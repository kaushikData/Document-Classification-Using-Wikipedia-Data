The '''constitutional crisis of 1993''' was a [[War of Laws#Issues in a new Russia|political stand-off]] between the [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Boris Yeltsin]] and the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Russian parliament]] that was resolved by using military force. The relations between the president and the parliament had been deteriorating for some time. The [[constitutional crisis]] reached a tipping point on September&amp;nbsp;21, 1993, when President Yeltsin aimed to dissolve the country's legislature (the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies]] and its [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]]), although the president did not have the power to dissolve the parliament according to the constitution. Yeltsin used the results of the [[Russian government referendum, 1993|referendum of April 1993]] to justify his actions. In response, the parliament declared that the president's decision was null and void, impeached Yeltsin and proclaimed vice president [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]] to be acting president.

The situation deteriorated at the beginning of October. On October&amp;nbsp;3, demonstrators removed police cordons around the parliament and, urged by their leaders, took over the Mayor's offices and tried to storm the [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] television centre. The army, which had initially declared its neutrality, stormed the Supreme Soviet building in the early morning hours of October&amp;nbsp;4 by Yeltsin's order, and arrested the leaders of the resistance.

The ten-day conflict became the deadliest single event of street fighting in [[Moscow]]'s [[History of Moscow|history]] since the [[Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Afgantsy: the Russians in Afghanistan 1979–89|first=Rodric|last=Braithwaite|publisher=Profile Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-84668-054-0|page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to government estimates, 187 people were killed and 437 wounded, while estimates from non-governmental sources put the death toll at as high as 1,500.

==Origins==
===Intensifying executive-legislative power struggle===
The [[Soviet Union]] broke up on 26 December 1991. Yeltsin's [[Economy of Russia#Economic Reform in the 1990s|economic reform program]] took effect on January&amp;nbsp;2, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/bg879.cfm |title=The Creeping Counterrevolution in Russia: Local Resistance to Privatization |accessdate=2007-09-04 |first=Alexandr |last=Urmanov |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]] |date=February 6, 1992 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231213/http://www.heritage.org/Research/RussiaandEurasia/bg879.cfm |archivedate=September 26, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward [[price]]s skyrocketed, government spending was slashed, and heavy new [[tax]]es went into effect. A deep [[Credit (finance)|credit]] crunch shut down many [[industry|industries]] and brought about a protracted depression. Certain politicians quickly began to distance themselves from the program; and increasingly the ensuing political confrontation between Yeltsin on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform on the other, became centered in the two branches of government.

Throughout 1992, opposition to Yeltsin's reform policies grew stronger and more intractable among bureaucrats concerned about the condition of Russian industry and among regional leaders who wanted more independence from [[Moscow]]. Russia's vice president, [[Aleksandr Rutskoy]], denounced the Yeltsin program as "economic genocide".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/world/yeltsin-deputy-calls-reforms-economic-genocide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title=Yeltsin Deputy Calls Reforms 'Economic Genocide |work=The New York Times |first=Celestine |last=Bohlen |date=February 9, 1992| accessdate=December 8, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, during the first half of 1992, the average income of the population declined 2–2.5 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ecsocman.edu.ru/data/501/178/1217/006.RIMASHEVSKAYA.pdf |script-title=ru:Социальные последствия экономических трансформаций в России |first=Наталья Михайловна |last=Римашевская |publisher=Социологические исследования. |year=1997 |number=6 |pages=55–65| accessdate=September 25, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=July 2013}} Leaders of [[oil]]-rich republics such as [[Tatarstan]] and [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkiria]] called for full independence from Russia.

Also throughout 1992, Yeltsin wrestled with the Supreme Soviet (the standing legislature) and the Russian Congress of People's Deputies (the country's highest legislative body, from which the Supreme Soviet members were drawn) for control over government and government policy. In 1992 the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals.

The president was concerned about the terms of the constitutional amendments passed in late 1991, which meant that his special powers of decree were set to expire by the end of 1992 (Yeltsin expanded the powers of the presidency beyond normal constitutional limits in carrying out the reform program). Yeltsin, awaiting implementation of his [[privatization]] program, demanded that parliament reinstate his decree powers (only parliament had the authority to replace or amend the constitution). But in the Russian Congress of People's Deputies and in the Supreme Soviet, the deputies refused to adopt a new constitution that would enshrine the scope of presidential powers demanded by Yeltsin into law.

====Seventh Congress of People's Deputies====
[[File:Russian Congressional Fractions 1992.png|thumb|right|Congressional Factions in December 1992]]

During its December session the parliament clashed with Yeltsin on a number of issues, and the conflict came to a head on December&amp;nbsp;9 when the parliament refused to confirm [[Yegor Gaidar]], the widely unpopular architect of Russia's "[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]" market liberalizations, as prime minister. The parliament refused to nominate Gaidar, demanding modifications of the economic program and directed the Central Bank, which was under the parliament's control, to continue issuing credits to enterprises to keep them from shutting down.&lt;ref&gt;The Central Bank's efforts got in the way of pro-Yeltsin, Western-oriented leaders were seeking to carry out a decisive neoliberal economic transformation of Russia. They undermined the regime of fiscal austerity that the Yeltsin government was attempting to pursue. See, e.g., Thomas F. Remington, ''Politics in Russia'' (New York: Addison-Wesley Educational Publishers Inc., 2002), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an angry speech the next day on December&amp;nbsp;10, Yeltsin accused the Congress of blocking the government's reforms and suggested the people decide on a [[referendum]], "which course do the citizens of Russia support? The course of the President, a course of transformations, or the course of the Congress, the Supreme Soviet and its Chairman, a course towards folding up reforms, and ultimately towards the deepening of the crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c9POldxUqhMC&amp;pg=PA784 |script-title=ru:Из истории создания Конституции Российской Федерации: Конституционная комиссия стенограммы, материалы, документы (1990–1993 гг.) в 6 томах |first=Олег Г |last=Румянцев |publisher=Wolters Kluwer Russia |year=2008 |isbn=978-5-466-00354-3 |page=784| accessdate=August 5, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parliament responded by voting to take control of the parliamentary army.

On December&amp;nbsp;12, Yeltsin and parliament speaker Khasbulatov agreed on a compromise that included the following provisions: (1) a national referendum on framing a new Russian constitution to be held in April 1993; (2) most of Yeltsin's emergency powers were extended until the referendum; (3) the parliament asserted its right to nominate and vote on its own choices for prime minister; and (4) the parliament asserted its right to reject the president's choices to head the Defense, Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Security ministries. Yeltsin nominated [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]] to be prime minister on December&amp;nbsp;14, and the parliament confirmed him.

Yeltsin's December 1992 compromise with the seventh Congress of the People's Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over the language of the referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president's extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late 1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], began to sense that it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the president called a referendum on a constitution for April&amp;nbsp;11.

====Eighth congress====
The eighth Congress of People's Deputies opened on March&amp;nbsp;10, 1993 with a strong attack on the president by Khasbulatov, who accused Yeltsin of acting unconstitutionally. In mid-March, an emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies voted to amend the constitution, strip Yeltsin of many of his powers, and cancel the scheduled April referendum, again opening the door to legislation that would shift the balance of power away from the president. The president stalked out of the congress. [[Vladimir Shumeyko]], first deputy prime minister, declared that the referendum would go ahead, but on April&amp;nbsp;25.

The parliament was gradually expanding its influence over the government. On March&amp;nbsp;16, the president signed a decree that conferred Cabinet rank on [[Viktor Gerashchenko]], chairman of the central bank, and three other officials; this was in accordance with the decision of the eighth congress that these officials should be members of the government. The congress' ruling, however, had made it clear that as ministers they would continue to be subordinate to parliament. In general, the parliament's lawmaking activity decreased in 1993, as its agenda increasingly became to be dominated by efforts to increase the parliamentarian powers and reduce those of the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVc8qmx6p9wC&amp;pg=PA61 |title=When majorities fail: the Russian Parliament, 1990–1993 |first=Josephine T |last=Andrews |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=61 |isbn=978-0-521-80112-6| accessdate=December 8, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===="Special regime"====
The president's response was dramatic. On March&amp;nbsp;20, Yeltsin addressed the nation directly on television, declaring that he had signed a decree on a "special regime" ("Об особом порядке управления до преодоления кризиса власти"), under which he would assume extraordinary executive power pending the results of a referendum on the timing of new legislative elections, on a new constitution, and on public confidence in the president and vice-president. Yeltsin also bitterly attacked the parliament, accusing the deputies of trying to restore the Soviet-era order.

Soon after Yeltsin's televised address, [[Valery Zorkin]] (Chairman of the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]]), [[Yuri Voronin]] (first vice-chairman of the Supreme Soviet), [[Alexander Rutskoy]] and [[Valentin Stepankov]] ([[Prosecutor General of Russia|Prosecutor General]]) made an address, publicly condemning Yeltsin's declaration as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecsocman.hse.ru/data/175/680/1219/042.PIKHOYA.pdf |script-title=ru:Президент и Советы: политико конституционный кризис 1993. г.|author=Р.Г.

====Ninth congress====
[[File:Russian Congressional Fractions 1993.png|thumb|right|Congressional Fractions in March 1993]]
The ninth congress, which opened on March&amp;nbsp;26, began with an extraordinary session of the Congress of People's Deputies taking up discussions of emergency measures to defend the constitution, including [[impeachment]] of President Yeltsin. Yeltsin conceded that he had made mistakes and reached out to swing voters in parliament. Yeltsin narrowly survived an impeachment vote on March&amp;nbsp;28, votes for impeachment falling 72 short of the 689 votes needed for a 2/3 majority. The similar proposal to dismiss Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Supreme Soviet was defeated by a wider margin (339 in favour of the motion), though 614 deputies had initially been in favour of including the re-election of the chairman in the agenda, a tell-tale sign of the weakness of Khasbulatov's own positions (517 votes for would have sufficed to dismiss the speaker).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=43501 |script-title=ru:Съезд завершен: противостояние продолжается |work=[[Kommersant]] |date=March 30, 1993|accessdate=2010-09-18|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the ninth Congress, the legislative branch was dominated by the joint communist-nationalist [[Russian Unity]] bloc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ъ - Блок "Российское единство" не хочет никого свергать |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=26903 |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iRrCumMW?url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=26903 |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-07-13 |language=ru |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which included representatives of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|CPRF]] and the Fatherland faction (communists, retired military personnel, and other deputies of a socialist orientation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/29621 |script-title=ru:Пресс-конференция фракции "Отчизна" |publisher=Ъ-Газета| accessdate=December 15, 2011&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Владимир Прибыловский: Блоки и фракции российского парламента |url=http://www.panorama.ru/gazeta/p32frac.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iRrEpR7B?url=http://www.panorama.ru/gazeta/p32frac.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-07-13 |language=ru |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Agrarian Party of Russia|Agrarian Union]], and the faction "[[Russian All-People's Union|Russia]]" led by [[Sergey Baburin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Николай Анисин __ ЗАПРОС НА БАБУРИНА |url=http://www.zavtra.ru/cgi//veil//data/zavtra/98/239/21.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iRrFPgam?url=http://www.zavtra.ru/cgi//veil//data/zavtra/98/239/21.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=2009-07-13 |language=ru |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Коммунистическая партия Российской Федерации ("Есть такие партии!") |url=http://www.scilla.ru/works/partii07/kprf.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5iRrG165F?url=http://www.scilla.ru/works/partii07/kprf.html |archivedate=July 22, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-07-13 |language=ru |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with more 'centrist' groups (e.g. 'Change' (''Смена'')), the Yeltsin supporters ('Democratic Russia', 'Radical democrats') were clearly left in the minority.

====National referendum====
{{main article|Russian government referendum, 1993}}
The referendum would go ahead, but since the impeachment vote failed, the Congress of People's Deputies sought to set new terms for a popular referendum. The legislature's version of the referendum asked whether citizens had confidence in Yeltsin, approved of his reforms, and supported early presidential and legislative elections. The parliament voted that in order to win, the president would need to obtain 50 percent of the whole electorate, rather than 50 percent of those actually voting, to avoid an early presidential election.

This time, the Constitutional Court supported Yeltsin and ruled that the president required only a simple majority on two issues: confidence in him, and economic and social policy; he would need the support of half the electorate in order to call new parliamentary and presidential elections.

On April&amp;nbsp;25, a majority of voters expressed confidence in the president and called for new legislative elections. Yeltsin termed the results a mandate for him to continue in power. Before the referendum, Yeltsin had promised to resign, if the electorate failed to express confidence in his policies.&lt;ref&gt;Российская газета. 1993. 1 апр. Cited in: Белкин А.А..

As before, the president had to appeal to the people over the heads of the legislature.

On [[Labor Day|1 May]], antigovernment protests organized by the hardline opposition turned violent. Numerous deputies of the Supreme Soviet took part in organizing the protest and in its course. One [[OMON]] police officer suffered fatal injuries during the riot. As a reaction, a number of the representatives of Saint Petersburg intelligentia (e.g., [[Oleg Basilashvili]], [[Aleksei Yuryevich German|Alexey German]], [[Boris Strugatsky]]) sent a petition to president Yeltsin, urging "putting an end to the street criminality under political slogans".&lt;ref&gt;Известия, 4 мая 1993. С. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional convention===
On April&amp;nbsp;29, 1993, [[Boris Yeltsin]] released the text of his proposed constitution to a meeting of government ministers and leaders of the republics and regions, according to [[ITAR-TASS]].{{sfn|Gönenç|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Jeffries|1996|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Yeltsin to Unveil Full Text of Draft Constitution | last= Tolz | first= Vera | publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]] |date=April 29, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Yeltsin Promotes New Constitution | last= Tolz | first= Vera | publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]] | date=April 30, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{date|12 May}} Yeltsin called for a special assembly of the Federation Council, which had been formed July&amp;nbsp;17, 1990 within the office of the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Russian Politics and Society: An Introduction | first= Catherine J | last= Danks | year= 2001 | isbn= 978-0-582-47300-3 | quote= In a move designed to appeal to Russia's regions and its non-Russian peoples Yeltsin in July 1990 had already established a Federation Council within the office of the chair of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other representatives, including political leaders from a wide range of government institutions, regions, public organizations, and political parties, to finalize a draft for a new constitution from June&amp;nbsp;5–10, and was followed by a similar decree {{date|21 May}}.{{sfn|Gönenç|2002|p=161}}{{sfn|Jeffries|1996|p=110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= President Takes Further Steps to Speed Up Constitution Adoption | last= Tolz | first= Vera | publisher= [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|RFE/RL]] | date= May 13, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After much hesitation, the Constitutional Committee of the Congress of People's Deputies decided to participate and present its own draft constitution. Of course, the two main drafts contained contrary views of legislative-executive relations.

Some 700 representatives at the conference ultimately adopted a draft constitution on July&amp;nbsp;12 that envisaged a bicameral legislature and the dissolution of the congress. But because the convention's draft of the constitution would dissolve the congress, there was little likelihood that the congress would vote itself out of existence. The Supreme Soviet immediately rejected the draft and declared that the Congress of People's Deputies was the supreme lawmaking body and hence would decide on the new constitution.

===July–September===
The parliament was active in July, while the president was on vacation, and passed a number of decrees that revised economic policy in order to "end the division of society." It also launched investigations of key advisers of the president, accusing them of corruption. The president returned in August and declared that he would deploy all means, including circumventing the constitution, to achieve new parliamentary elections.

In July, the [[Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation]] confirmed the election of [[Pyotr Sumin]] to head the administration of the [[Chelyabinsk oblast]], something that Yeltsin had refused to accept. As a result, a situation of [[dual power]] existed in that region from July to October in 1993, with two administrations claiming legitimacy simultaneously.&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Зорькин, Валерий |url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14164180/full.htm |publisher=Lenta.ru |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ghdcrZSY?url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14164180/full.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2009 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2009-04-12 |language=ru |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another conflict involved the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation regarding the regional presidency in [[Mordovia]]. The court delegated the question of legality of abolishing the post of the region's president to the Constitutional Court of Mordovia. As a result, popularly elected President {{Interlanguage link multi|Vasily Guslyannikov|ru|3=Гуслянников, Василий Дмитриевич}}, member of the pro-Yeltsin [[Democratic Russia]] movement, lost his position. Thereafter, the state news agency ([[ITAR-TASS]]) ceased to report on a number of Constitutional Court decisions.&lt;ref name="lenta.ru"/&gt;

The Supreme Soviet also tried to further foreign policies that differed from Yeltsin's line. Thus, on July&amp;nbsp;9, 1993, it passed a resolutions on [[Sevastopol]], "confirming the Russian [[Federal cities of Russia|federal status]]" of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sevkrimrus.narod.ru/ZAKON/sewastop.htm |script-title=ru:Постановление Верховного Совета Российской Федерации| accessdate=July 22, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine saw its territorial integrity at stake and filed a complaint to the Security Council of the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sevkrimrus.narod.ru/ZAKON/oonsev.htm |title=Решение Совбеза ООН по Севастополю № S/26118| accessdate=July 22, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeltsin condemned the resolution of the Supreme Soviet.

In August 1993, a commentator reflected on the situation as follows: "The President issues decrees as if there were no Supreme Soviet, and the Supreme Soviet suspends decrees as if there were no President." ([[Izvestiya]], August 13, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA76 |title=Executive decree authority |first1=John M |last1=Carey |first2=Matthew S |last2=Matthew |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59722-7 |page=76| accessdate=July 15, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The president launched his offensive on September&amp;nbsp;1 when he attempted to suspend Vice President Rutskoy, a key adversary. Rutskoy, elected on the same ticket as Yeltsin in 1991, was the president's automatic successor. A presidential spokesman said that he had been suspended because of "accusations of corruption." On September&amp;nbsp;3, the Supreme Soviet rejected Yeltsin's suspension of Rutskoy and referred the question to the Constitutional Court.

Two weeks later Yeltsin declared that he would agree to call early presidential elections provided that the parliament also called elections. The parliament ignored him. On September&amp;nbsp;18, Yeltsin then named Yegor Gaidar, who had been forced out of office by parliamentary opposition in 1992, a deputy prime minister and a deputy premier for economic affairs. This appointment was unacceptable to the Supreme Soviet, which emphatically rejected it.

==Siege and assault==
[[File:Supreme Soviet of Russia meeting (1993).png|right|thumb|Supreme Soviet session, September&amp;nbsp;21, 1993]]

On September&amp;nbsp;21, Yeltsin declared the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet]] dissolved; this act was in contradiction with a number of articles of the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|Constitution of 1978]] (as amended 1989–1993), such as, Article 121&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Congress enabled this formerly-suspended amendment after it had failed to impeach Yeltsin after his declaration of a 'Special Rule' in March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; which stated that:

{{quote|The powers of the President of Russian Federation cannot be used to change the national and state organization of the Russian Federation, to dissolve or to interfere with the functioning of any elected organs of state power. In this case, his powers cease immediately.}}

In his television appearance to the citizens of Russia, President Yeltsin argued for the decree nr 1400 as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Already more than a year attempts were made to reach a compromise with the corps of deputies, with the Supreme Soviet. Russians know well that how many steps were taken by my side during the last congresses and between them. […] The last days destroyed once and for all the hopes for a resurrection of at least some constructive cooperation. The majority of the Supreme Soviet goes directly against the will of the Russian people. A course is taken in favour of the weakening of the president and ultimately his removal from office, of the disorganization of the work of the government; during the last months, dozens of antipopular decisions have been prepared and passed. [...] Lots of these are deliberately planned to worsen the situation in Russia. The more flagrant ones are the so-called economic policies of the Supreme Soviet, its decisions on the budget, privatization, there are many others that deepen the crisis, cause colossal damage to the country. All attempts of the government undertaken to at least somewhat alleviate the economic situation meet incomrehension. There is hardly a day when the cabinet of ministers is not harassed, its hands are not being tied. And this happens in a situation of a deepest economic crisis. The Supreme Soviet has stopped taking into account the decrees of the president, his amendments of the legislative projects, even his constitutional veto rights. Constitutional reform has practically been pared down. The process of creating rule of law in Russia has essentially been disorganized. To the contrary, what is going on is a deliberate reduction of the legal basis of the young Russian state that is even without this weak. The legislative work became a weapon of political struggle. Laws, that Russia urgently needs, are not being passed for years.[...]
 
For a long time already, most of the sessions of the Supreme Soviet take place with the infringements of the elementary procedures and order... A cleansing of committees and commissions is taking place. Everyone who does not show up personal loyalty to its leader is being mercilessly expelled from the Supreme Soviet, from its presidium. [...] This is all a bitter evidence of the fact that the Supreme Soviet as a state institution is currently in a state of decay [...]. The power in the Supreme Soviet has been captured by a group of persons who have turned it into an HQ of the intransigent opposition. [...] The only way how to overcome the paralysis of the state authority in the Russian Federation is its fundamental renewal on the basis of the principles of popular power and constitutionality. The constitution currently in force does not allow to do this. The constitution in force also does not provide for a procedure of passing a new constitution, that would provide for a worthy exit from the crisis of state power. I as the guarantor of the security of our state have to propose an exit from this deadlock, have to break this vicious circle.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time, Yeltsin repeated his announcement of a constitutional referendum, and new legislative elections for December. He also repudiated the Constitution of 1978, declaring that it had been replaced with one that gave him extraordinary executive powers. (According to the new plan, the lower house would have 450 deputies and be called the [[State Duma]], the name of the Russian legislature before the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917. The [[Federation Council of Russia|Federation Council]], which would bring together representatives from the 89 subdivisions of the Russian Federation, would assume the role of an upper house.)

Yeltsin claimed that by dissolving the Russian parliament in September 1993 he was clearing the tracks for a rapid transition to a functioning market economy. With this pledge, he received strong backing from the leading powers of the West. Yeltsin enjoyed a strong relationship with the Western powers, particularly the [[United States]], but the relationship made him unpopular with some Russians. In Russia, the Yeltsin side had control over television, where hardly any pro-parliament views were expressed during the September–October crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aCNQ4oWKAPsC&amp;pg=PA126 |title=Changing channels: television and the struggle for power in Russia |first=Ellen P |last=Mickiewicz |publisher=Duke University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8223-2463-8 |page=126| accessdate=July 12, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliament purports to impeach Yeltsin as president===
Rutskoy called Yeltsin's move a step toward a ''[[coup d'etat]]''. The next day, the Constitutional Court held that Yeltsin had violated the constitution and could be impeached. During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president's decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed president and took the oath on the constitution. He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers [[Pavel Grachev]] (defense), [[Nikolay Golushko]] (security), and [[Viktor Yerin]] (interior). Russia now had two presidents and two ministers of defense, security, and interior. It was [[dual power]] in earnest. Although [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and other top leaders of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] did not participate in the events, individual members of communist organizations actively supported the parliament.

On September&amp;nbsp;23, the Congress of People's deputies convened. Though only 638 deputies were present (the quorum was 689), Congress purported to impeach Yeltsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Guide to the Economies in Transition |first=Ian |last=Jeffries |publisher=Routledge |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-415-13684-6 |page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September&amp;nbsp;24, an undaunted Yeltsin announced presidential elections for June 1994. The same day, the Congress of People's Deputies voted to hold simultaneous parliamentary and presidential elections by March 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/stories/dissolve092293.htm |title=Yeltsin Dissolves Parliament, Orders New Vote |publisher=Washington Post |first=Margaret |last=Shapiro |date=September 22, 1993|accessdate=July 12, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeltsin scoffed at the parliament-backed proposal for simultaneous elections, and responded the next day by cutting off electricity, phone service, and hot water in the parliament building.

===Mass protests and the barricading of the parliament===
Yeltsin also sparked popular unrest with his dissolution of a parliament increasingly opposed to his [[neoliberal]] economic reforms. Tens of thousands of Russians marched in the streets of Moscow seeking to bolster the parliamentary cause. The demonstrators were protesting against the deteriorating living conditions. Since 1989, the [[gross domestic product|GDP]] had been declining, [[Political corruption|corruption]] was rampant, [[violent crime]] was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing and [[life expectancy]] falling. Yeltsin was also increasingly getting the blame.&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is still hotly debated among Western economists, social scientists, and policy-makers as to whether or not the IMF-, World Bank-, and U.S. Treasury Department-backed reform policies adopted in Russia, often called "shock therapy," were responsible for Russia's poor record of economic performance in the 1990s. Under the Western-backed economic program adopted by Yeltsin, the Russian government took several radical measures at once that were supposed to stabilize the economy by bringing state spending and revenues into balance and by letting market demand determine the prices and supply of goods. Under the reforms, the government let most prices float, raised taxes, and cut back sharply on spending in industry and construction. These policies caused widespread hardship as many state enterprises found themselves without orders or financing. The rationale of the program was to squeeze the built-in inflationary pressure out of the economy so that producers would begin making sensible decisions about production, pricing and investment instead of chronically overusing resources, as in the Soviet era. By letting the market rather than central planners determine prices, product mixes, output levels, and the like, the reformers intended to create an incentive structure in the economy where efficiency and risk would be rewarded and waste and carelessness were punished. Removing the causes of [[chronic inflation]], the reform's architects argued, was a precondition for all other reforms: Hyperinflation would wreck both democracy and economic progress, they argued; only by stabilizing the state budget could the government proceed to restructure the economy. A similar reform program had been adopted in Poland in January 1990, with generally favorable results. However, Western critics of Yeltsin's reform, most notably [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Marshall Goldman]] (who would have favored a more "gradual" transition to market capitalism) consider policies adopted in Poland ill-suited for Russia, given that the impact of communism on the Polish economy and political culture was far less indelible. See [http://www.imf.org/external/np/vc/2002/082602.htm 'Has Russia Been on the Right Path?'] by Kenneth Rogoff, IMF, August&amp;nbsp;26, 2002.

Rostowski, Centre for Economic Performance, September 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside Moscow, the Russian masses overall were confused and disorganized. Nonetheless, some of them also tried to voice their protest, and sporadic strikes took place across Russia. The protesters included supporters of various communist ([[Labour Russia]]) and nationalist organizations, including those belonging to the [[National Salvation Front (Russia)|National Salvation Front]]. A number of armed militants of [[Russian National Unity]] took part in the defense of the [[White House (Moscow)|White House]], as reportedly did veterans of Tiraspol and [[Riga]] OMON.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rsB-5-e0RwgC&amp;pg=PA78 |title=Close protection: the politics of guarding Russia's rulers |first=David |last=Cox |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-275-96688-1 |page=78| accessdate= July 15, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of Transnistrian forces, including the [[KGB]] detachment 'Dnestr', stirred General [[Alexander Lebed]] to protest against Transnistrian interference in Russia's internal affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panorama.ru/gazeta/p41leb.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220091412/http://panorama.ru/gazeta/p41leb.html |archivedate=2010-12-20 |script-title=ru:ЛЕБЕДЬ Александр Иванович |publisher=ПАНОРАМА |date=July 1998|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specnaz.ru/archive/05_2002/2.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133751/http://www.specnaz.ru/archive/05_2002/2.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |script-title=ru:ПУТЬ ГЕНЕРАЛА ЛЕБЕДЯ |publisher=СПЕЦНАЗ РОССИИ N |date=May 2002|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, Moscow saw the first bloody clashes between the special police and anti-Yeltsin demonstrators. Also on the same day, the Interior Ministry moved to seal off the parliament building. Barricades and wire were put around the building. On October 1, the Interior Ministry estimated that 600 fighting men with a large cache of arms had joined Yeltsin's political opponents in the parliament building.

===Storming of the television premises===
Soviet leaders still did not discount the prospect of a compromise with Yeltsin. The Russian Orthodox Church acted as a host to desultory discussions between representatives of the parliament and the president. The negotiations with the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] Patriarch as [[mediation|mediator]] continued until October&amp;nbsp;2. On the afternoon of October&amp;nbsp;3, Moscow police failed to control a demonstration near the White House, and the political impasse developed into armed conflict.

On October&amp;nbsp;2, supporters of parliament constructed barricades and blocked traffic on Moscow's main streets. On the afternoon of October&amp;nbsp;3, armed opponents of Yeltsin successfully stormed the police cordon around the White House territory, where the Russian parliament was barricaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oanB4q0o2vsC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=1993+october+moscow+rutskoy+mayor%27s |title=Politics and the Russian army: civil-military relations, 1689–2000 |first=Brian D |last=Taylor |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-01694-0 |page=290| accessdate=July 12, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramilitaries from factions supporting the parliament, as well as a few units of the internal military (armed forces normally reporting to the Ministry of Interior), supported the Supreme Soviet.

Rutskoy greeted the crowds from the White House balcony, and urged them to form battalions and to go on to seize the mayor's office and the national television center at Ostankino. Khasbulatov also called for the storming of the Kremlin and imprisoning "the criminal and usurper Yeltsin" in [[Matrosskaya Tishina]]. At 16:00 Yeltsin signed a decree&lt;ref&gt;Decree of the President of Russian Federation of October&amp;nbsp;3, 1993 Number 1575: [http://document.kremlin.ru/doc.asp?ID=085389  УКАЗ Президента РФ от 03.10.1993 N 1575] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002080416/http://document.kremlin.ru/doc.asp?ID=085389 |date=October 2, 2009 }} {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring a state of emergency in Moscow.

On the evening of October&amp;nbsp;3, after taking the mayor's office located in the former [[Comecon]] HQ nearby, pro-parliament demonstrators and gunmen led by General [[Albert Makashov]] moved toward Ostankino, the television center. But the pro-parliament crowds were met by [[Militsiya (Russia)|Interior Ministry units]] and [[OMON|special forces]] who took positions in and around the TV complex. A pitched battle followed. Part of the TV center was significantly damaged. Television stations went off the air and 62 people were killed, including [[Terry Michael Duncan]], an American lawyer, who was in Moscow to establish a law firm and was killed while attempting to help the wounded.&lt;ref name="Isvestia"&gt;[http://www.izvestia.ru/russia/article2803780/ Quiet American] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005082147/http://www.izvestia.ru/russia/article2803780/ |date=October 5, 2006 }}, by A.

When broadcasting resumed late in the evening, vice-premier [[Yegor Gaidar]] called on television for a meeting in support of democracy and President Yeltsin "so that the country would not be turned yet again into a huge concentration camp"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqPLUz1Mlfg Video]&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of people with different political convictions and interpretations over the causes of the crisis (such as [[Grigory Yavlinsky]], [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], [[Yuri Luzhkov]], [[Ales Adamovich]], and [[Bulat Okudzhava]]) also appealed to support the President.&lt;ref name="yabloko.ru"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yabloko.ru/Publ/2003/2003_10/031007_ng_sheynis.html |script-title=ru:Октябрь 1993-го: конец переy the middle of October, ходной эпохи |publisher=Yabloko |date=October 7, 2003|accessdate=July 12, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Civic Union bloc of 'constructive opposition' issued a statement accusing the Supreme Soviet of having crossed the border separating political struggle from criminality.&lt;ref name="yabloko.ru"/&gt; Several hundred of Yeltsin's supporters spent the night in the square in front of the Moscow City Hall preparing for further clashes, only to learn in the morning of October&amp;nbsp;4 that the army was on their side.

===Storming of the White House===
Between October&amp;nbsp;2–4, the position of the army was the deciding factor. The military equivocated for several hours about how to respond to Yeltsin's call for action. By this time dozens of people had been killed and hundreds had been wounded.

Rutskoy, as a former general, appealed to some of his ex-colleagues. After all, many officers and especially rank-and-file soldiers had little sympathy for Yeltsin. But the supporters of the parliament did not send any emissaries to the barracks to recruit lower-ranking officer corps, making the fatal mistake of attempting to deliberate only among high-ranking military officials who already had close ties to parliamentary leaders. In the end, a prevailing bulk of the generals did not want to take their chances with a Rutskoy-Khasbulatov regime. Some generals had stated their intention to back the parliament, but at the last moment moved over to Yeltsin's side.

The plan of action was proposed by Captain Gennady Zakharov. Ten tanks were to fire at the upper floors of the [[White House (Moscow)|White House]], with the aim of minimizing casualties but creating confusion and panic amongst the defenders. Then, [[spetznaz|special troops]] of the [[Vympel]] and [[Alpha Group|Alpha]] units would storm the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1YEBhxioiRYC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=yeltsin+decree+1400+1993&amp;lr=&amp;ei=tZW3SfS1FJWyyQT_27XpBg#PPA79,M1 |title=Yeltsin's Russia and the West |first=Andrew |last=Felkay |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-275-96538-9 |page=79| accessdate=July 12, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yeltsin's bodyguard [[Alexander Korzhakov]], firing on the upper floors was also necessary to scare off snipers.

[[File:White House-3.JPG|thumb|Burned facade of the White House after the storming]]
By sunrise on October&amp;nbsp;4, the Russian army encircled the parliament building, and a few hours later army tanks began to shell the White House. At 8:00 am Moscow time, Yeltsin's declaration was announced by his press service. Yeltsin declared: &lt;blockquote&gt;Those, who went against the peaceful city and unleashed bloody slaughter, are criminals. But this is not only a crime of individual [[bandit]]s and [[pogrom]]makers. Everything that took place and is still taking place in Moscow is a pre-planned armed rebellion. It has been organized by Communist [[revanchist]]s, Fascist leaders, a part of former deputies, the representatives of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]s.&lt;br&gt;Under the cover of negotiations they gathered forces, recruited bandit troops of mercenaries, who were accustomed to murders and violence. A petty gang of politicians attempted by armed force to impose their will on the entire country. The means by which they wanted to govern Russia have been shown to the entire world. These are the cynical lie, bribery. These are [[cobblestone]]s, sharpened iron rods, automatic weapons and machine guns.&lt;br&gt;Those, who are waving [[red flag (politics)|red flags]], again stained Russia with blood. They hoped for the unexpectedness, for the fact that their impudence and unprecedented cruelty will sow fear and confusion.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
He also assured the listeners that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Fascist-communist armed rebellion in Moscow shall be suppressed within the shortest period. The Russian state has necessary forces for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.russ.ru/antolog/1993/chron141.htm |title=4 октября - Четырнадцатый день противостояния.

By noon, troops entered the White House and began to occupy it, floor by floor. Rutskoy's desperate appeal to Air Force pilots to bomb the Kremlin was broadcast by the [[Echo of Moscow]] radio station but went unanswered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/09/22/080922fa_fact_remnick&lt;/ref&gt; He also tried to have the Chairman of the Constitutional Court, [[Valery Zorkin]] call the Western embassies to guarantee Rutskoy's and his associates' safety - to no avail. Hostilities were stopped several times to allow some in the White House to leave. By mid-afternoon, popular resistance in the streets was completely suppressed, barring occasional sniper fire.

The "second October Revolution"{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}, as mentioned, saw the deadliest street fighting in Moscow since 1917. Police said, on October&amp;nbsp;8, that 187&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Treisman, Daniel (2011) ''The Return: Russia's Journey from Gorbachev to Medvedev.'' Simon and Schuster, p. 54. {{ISBN|1-4516-0574-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; had died in the conflict and 437 had been wounded.

Some claim Yeltsin was backed by the military only grudgingly, and only at the eleventh hour.{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} The instruments of coercion gained the most, and they would expect Yeltsin to reward them in the future. A paradigmatic example of this was General [[Pavel Grachev]], who had demonstrated his loyalty during this crisis. Grachev became a key political figure, despite many years of charges that he was linked to corruption within the Russian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rusnet.nl/encyclo/g/grachev.shtml |title=Pavel Grachev |publisher=Rusnet| accessdate=July 12, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion on crisis===
The Russian public opinion research institute [[VCIOM]] (''VTsIOM''), a state-controlled agency, conducted a poll in the aftermath of October 1993 events and found out that 51% of the people polled thought that the use of military force by Yeltsin was justified and 30% thought it was not justified. This support for Yeltsin's actions declined in later years. When VCIOM-A asked the same question in 2003, only 20% agreed with the use of the military, with 57% opposed.

When asked about the main cause of the events of October&amp;nbsp;3–4, 46% in the 1993 VCIOM poll blamed Rutskoy and Khasbulatov. However, ten years following the crisis, the most popular culprit was the legacy of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] with 31%, closely followed by Yeltsin's policies with 29%.

In 1993, a majority of Russians considered the events of September&amp;nbsp;21–October&amp;nbsp;4 as an attempt of Communist revanche or as a result of Rutskoy and Khasbulatov seeking personal power.

==Yeltsin's consolidation of power==

===Immediate aftermath===
On October&amp;nbsp;5, 1993, the newspaper ''[[Izvestia|Izvestiya]]'' published the [[open letter]] "Writers demand decisive actions of the government" to the government and President signed by 42 well-known Russian [[Intellectual|literati]] and hence called the [[Letter of Forty-Two]]. It was written in reaction to the events and contained the following seven demands:&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Писатели требуют от правительства решительных действий |url=http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |accessdate=2011-08-21 |newspaper=[[Izvestia]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716043414/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM |archivedate=July 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |date=October 1993 |language=ru |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|
# All kinds of сommunist and nationalist parties, fronts, and associations should be disbanded and banned by a decree of the President.
# All illegal paramilitary and a fortiori armed groups and associations should be identified and disbanded (with bringing them to criminal responsibility when it is bound by a law).

# Recognize not only the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]], the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Council]] but also all bodies (including the Constitutional Court) formed by them as nonlegitimate.}}

In the weeks following the storming of the Russian White House, Yeltsin issued a barrage of presidential decrees intended to consolidate his position. On October&amp;nbsp;5, Yeltsin banned political leftist and nationalist organizations and newspapers like ''Den''', ''Sovetskaya Rossiya'' and ''Pravda'' that had supported the parliament (they would later resume publishing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://russiancinema.ru/template.php?dept_id=3&amp;e_dept_id=5&amp;e_chrdept_id=4&amp;chr_year=1993&amp;e_chr_id=2154 |script-title=ru:Указом Бориса Ельцина при Минпечати России создано управление по предварительной цензуре |publisher=Энциклопедия отечественного кино |date=October 5, 1993| accessdate=September 19, 2010&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an address to the nation on October&amp;nbsp;6, Yeltsin also called on those regional [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]] that had opposed him—by far the majority—to disband. [[Valery Zorkin]], chairman of the Constitutional Court, was forced to resign. The chairman of the Federation of Independent Trade Unions was also sacked. The anti-Yeltsin TV broadcast [[600 Seconds]] of [[Alexander Nevzorov]] was ultimately closed down.

Yeltsin decreed, on October&amp;nbsp;12, that both houses of parliament would be elected in December. On October&amp;nbsp;15, he ordered that a popular referendum be held in December on a new constitution. Rutskoy and Khasbulatov were charged on October&amp;nbsp;15 with "organizing mass disorders" and imprisoned. On 23 February 1994 the State Duma amnestied all individuals involved in the events of September–October 1993.  They were later released in 1994 when Yeltsin's position was sufficiently secure. In early 1995, the criminal proceedings were discontinued and were eventually placed into the archives&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://1993.sovnarkom.ru/TEXT/STATYI/flb_ru_2003.htm Леонид Прошкин - "Правых в этой истории не было"]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Russia needs order," Yeltsin told the Russian people in a television broadcast in November in introducing his new draft of the constitution, which was to be put to a referendum on December&amp;nbsp;12. The new basic law would concentrate sweeping powers in the hands of the president. The bicameral legislature, to sit for only two years, was restricted in crucial areas. The president could choose the prime minister even if the parliament objected and could appoint the military leadership without parliamentary approval. He would head and appoint the members of a new, more powerful security council. If a vote of no confidence in the government was passed, the president would be enabled to keep it in office for three months and could dissolve the parliament if it repeated the vote. The president could veto any bill passed by a simple majority in the lower house, after which a two-thirds majority would be required for the legislation to be passed. The president could not be impeached for contravening the constitution. The central bank would become independent, but the president would need the approval of the State Duma to appoint the bank's governor, who would thereafter be independent of the parliament. At the time, most political observers regarded the draft constitution as shaped by and for Yeltsin and perhaps unlikely to survive him.

===End of the first constitutional period===
{{See also|Russian constitutional referendum, 1993}}

On December&amp;nbsp;12, Yeltsin managed to push through his new constitution, creating a strong presidency and giving the president sweeping powers to issue decrees.

However, the parliament elected on the same day (with a turnout of about 53%) delivered a stunning rebuke to his neoliberal economic program. Candidates identified with Yeltsin's economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge protest vote, the bulk of which was divided between the Communists (who mostly drew their support from industrial workers, out-of-work bureaucrats, some professionals, and pensioners) and the ultra-nationalists (who drew their support from disaffected elements of the lower [[middle classes]]). Unexpectedly, the most surprising insurgent group proved to be the ultranationalist [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia|Liberal Democratic Party]] led by [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]]. It gained 23% of the vote while the Gaidar led '[[democratic Choice of Russia|Russia's Choice]]' received 15.5% and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, 12.4%. LDPR leader, [[Vladimir Zhirinovsky]], alarmed many observers abroad with his neo-[[fascism|fascist]], [[chauvinism|chauvinist]] declarations.

Nevertheless, the referendum marked the end of the constitutional period defined by the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|constitution]] adopted by the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] in 1978, which was [[Russian Constitution of 1978#List of amendments|amended many times]] while Russia was a part of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s Soviet Union. Although Russia would emerge as a dual presidential-parliamentary system in theory, substantial power would rest in the president's hands. Russia now has a [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]] who heads a cabinet and directs the administration, but the system is an example of presidentialism with the cover of a presidential prime minister, not an effective semipresidential constitutional model. (The premier, for example, is appointed, and in effect freely dismissed, by the president.)

An '''advance pricing agreement''' ('''APA''') is an ahead-of-time agreement between a taxpayer and a tax authority on an appropriate [[transfer pricing]] methodology (TPM) for a set of transactions at issue over a fixed period of time&lt;ref&gt;OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines – 2009&lt;/ref&gt; (called "Covered Transactions"). 

Most APAs involve U.S. taxpayers and the US [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), but APAs are also made outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/page04.aspx?id=10598 Mutual Agreement Procedures (MAPs) and Advance Pricing Arrangements (APAs)], Retrieved November 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bilateral and multilateral APAs'''&lt;br /&gt;
APAs are generally bi- or multilateral—i.e. they also include agreements between the taxpayer and one or more foreign tax administrations under the authority of the mutual agreement procedure (MAP) specified in [[Tax treaty|income tax treaties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/intmanual/INTM422030.htm INTM422030 - Transfer pricing: methodologies: Advance Pricing Agreements: types of agreement], Retrieved November 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The taxpayer benefits from such agreements since they are assured that income associated with covered transactions is not subject to [[double taxation]] by the IRS and the relevant foreign tax authorities. It is IRS policy to "encourage" taxpayers to seek bilateral or multilateral APAs where competent-authority provisions exist. 

'''Unilateral APAs'''&lt;br /&gt;
It is possible, however, that a taxpayer may negotiate a unilateral APA involving only the taxpayer and the IRS. In this case, the two parties negotiate an appropriate TPM for U.S. tax purposes only. Should the taxpayer be involved in a dispute with a foreign tax administration regarding the covered transactions, they may seek relief by requesting that the U.S. competent authority initiate a mutual agreement proceeding. This assumes, of course, that there is an applicable income tax treaty in force with the foreign country.

'''The APA Program'''&lt;br /&gt;
Each APA is handled by an APA team. One of the APA Program's designated team leaders is responsible for assembling the team, and it will generally consist of an economist, an international examiner, a LMSB field counsel, and—in bi- or multilateral cases—a U.S. competent-authority analyst tasked with leading discussions with treaty partners. Other team members may include an LMSB International Technical Advisor, LMSB exam personnel, or an Appeals Officer.

{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}
'''Alexander Yakovlev''' was a long-serving tenured member of the [[United Nations]] [[procurement]] department (since 1985).  He was involved in the [[oil-for-food]] scandal and had other allegations of impropriety.

The Russian diplomat was accused by the investigators of taking nearly $1 million in bribes, which also includes alleged illicit dealings with [[Compass Group]] PLC's subsidiary [[Eurest Support Services]] (ESS) and its terminated CEO [[Peter R. Harris]] and senior executive [[Andy Seiwert]].

Yakovlev is alleged to have conducted himself improperly in 1996 when he indirectly tried to get bribes from Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A.. 

Yakovlev resigned June 23, 2005. On August 8, 2005, United Nations [[Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]] waived the [[diplomatic immunity]] of Alexander Yakovlev on a request from the [[U.S. Attorney's Office]], and Yakovlev apparently had been taken into custody, said [[Mark Malloch Brown]], Annan's [[Chef de Cabinet (UN)|chief of staff]]. Yakovlev's case (1:2005-cr-00819) was assigned to New York Southern District.

The same day he pleaded guilty to wire fraud under the oil-for-food program, making him the first U.N. official to face criminal charges in connection with the scandal-tainted operation. He was released under bond of $400,000.

Alexander Yakovlev also pleaded guilty in federal court to charges of [[wire fraud]] and [[money laundering]] for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from U.N. contractors in his work outside oil-for-food. He could face up to 20 years in prison for each of the three counts. His Brooklyn criminal lawyer Arkady Bukh said it could take several years until Yakovlev was sentenced. On December 22, 2010 he was sentenced to time served, 2 years of supervised release and was ordered to forfeit $900,000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3384">An '''archipelagic state''' is a designation used for certain [[island countries]] that consist of an [[archipelago]].  The designation is legally defined by the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]].

In various conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part4.htm |title= Preamble to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea: Article 46 – Use of Terms |date= May 13, 2013 |publisher= [[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fiji]], [[Indonesia]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[the Bahamas]], and the [[Philippines]] are the five original [[sovereign state]]s that obtained approval in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea signed in [[Montego Bay]], [[Jamaica]] on December 10, 1982 and qualified as archipelagic states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_overview_convention.htm |title= United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 |date= May 13, 2013 |publisher= [[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archipelagic states are states that are composed of groups of islands forming a state as a single unit, with the islands and the waters within the baselines as internal waters. Under this concept ("archipelagic doctrine"), an archipelago shall be regarded as a single unit, so that the waters around, between, and connecting the islands of the archipelago, irrespective of their breadth and dimensions, form part of the internal waters of the state, and are subject to its exclusive sovereignty.

The approval of the [[United Nations]] for the five sovereign states as archipelagic states respect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betterphils.blogspot.com/2011/10/2-laws-unlcos-200-and-archipelagic.html |title= 2 laws UNLCOS 200 and Archipelagic States to End Spratlys Disputes: THE ARCHIPELAGIC STATES |date= May 13, 2013 |publisher= Rebuilding for the Better Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; existing agreements with other countries and shall recognize traditional fishing rights and other legitimate activities of the immediately adjacent neighboring countries in certain areas falling within archipelagic waters. The terms and conditions for the exercise of such rights and activities, including the nature, the extent and the areas to which they apply, shall, at the request of any of the countries concerned, be regulated by bilateral agreements between them. Such rights shall not be transferred to or shared with third countries or their nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/part4.htm |title= PART IV ARCHIPELAGIC STATES: Article 51 – Existing agreements, traditional fishing rights and existing submarine cables |date= May 13, 2013 |publisher= [[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, {{nihongo|'''attorneys at law'''|弁護士|bengoshi|lit. "advocate"}} form the base of the country's legal community.

==History==

===Pre-Meiji restoration===
Historically, Japanese customs instituted an avoidance of legal involvement, based upon [[Confucianism]] doctrines, and Japanese principles of harmony;&lt;ref name="zagslaw"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uchtmann|first1=Donald|last2=Blessen|first2=Richard|last3=Maloney|first3=Vince|title=The Developing Japanese Legal System: Growth And Chance In The Modern Era|journal=Gonzaga Law Review|volume=23:349|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; anyone brought before a court for a criminal or civil matter suffered public and private humiliation, since they disrupted harmony.&lt;ref name="zagslaw"/&gt;

Nevertheless, by the 18th century, innkeepers in [[Edo]] began offering simple legal services for guests. They were known as ''Kujishi''.&lt;ref name="history1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Joe|title=A brief history of lawyers in Japan|url=http://www.mutantfrog.com/2007/03/18/a-brief-history-of-lawyers-in-japan/|website=Mutantfrog Travelogue|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century, references began to appear in Japanese literature on the role of "European-style" lawyers.&lt;ref name="history1"/&gt;

Officially recognized legal representatives in civil trials, known as ''daigennin'', began to appear by the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=history2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hood|first1=David|title=Exclusivity and the Japanese Bar: Ethics or Self-Interest?|journal=Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Journal|date=1997|volume=6|issue=1|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/dspace-law/bitstream/handle/1773.1/884/6PacRimLPolyJ199.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=7 August 2014|publisher=Pacific Rim Law &amp; Policy Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; No legal training was required to be a ''daigennin''.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt;

===Meiji restoration===
Regulation of legal professionals began during the [[Meiji Restoration]]. In 1890, the Criminal Code was amended, which recognized the right to legal representation during a criminal trial.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; The state's representative at the trial, known as a Procurator, was given the prestige of being a government official.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; By association, it unofficially granted a modicum of official status to the ''daigennin''.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt;

The government also required the establishment of [[bar association]]s at each district court,&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; and by 1893, the ''Lawyer's Law'' was promulgated, officially regulating the legal profession by setting standards for, as well as legitimatize, attorneys at law.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt;

===Post-World War II===
{{nihongo|''The Attorney Act''|弁護士法|bengoshihō}} was promulgated in 1949, which officially laid down the mission of an attorney at law, as well as establishing other requirements for those in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese Law Translation – [Law text] – Attorney Act|url=http://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/law/detail/?id=1878&amp;vm=04&amp;re=02|website=Japanese Law Translation Database System|publisher=Ministry of Justice, Japan|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legal industry==
The legal profession in Japan (''hoso'') comprises judges, prosecutors and attorneys. In Japan, judges are not selected from experienced lawyers, but instead are selected after the one-year of mandatory "Legal Training Research Institute".  

More than 100 universities have an undergraduate law faculty, which means that many people study law at the undergraduate level and go work for companies in a role that is unrelated to law. However, to become a lawyer, it is necessary to go to law school, pass the bar exam, and complete the LTRI. 

As of August 2014, there are 35,031 attorneys registered with bar associations in Japan,&lt;ref name="JFBA"/&gt; which is up from 22,049 in April 2005.&lt;ref name="JFBA-Eng-2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=JFBA: Outline of JFBA |date=1 April 2005 |url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/about/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051027103834/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/about/index.html |archivedate=27 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to cultural traditions, Japanese have rarely used lawsuits as a means to settle disputes.&lt;ref name="lawyershortage"&gt;{{cite news|title=Japan: Lawyers Wanted. No, Really |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_14/b3978064.htm|accessdate=29 July 2010|newspaper=Bloomberg BusinessWeek|date=3 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of patent-disputes and international mergers, however, Japan is facing a shortage of lawyers, and the government has allowed universities to offer graduate courses on law, in order to ease the shortage.&lt;ref name="lawyershortage"/&gt; The recent push to produce lawyers has also been reflected in the demographics of the legal community, where 25.3% of the lawyers surveyed have only been admitted to the bar for less than 5 years.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=日弁連 – 弁護士実勢調査 (Translation: JFBA – Lawyer Survey)|url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/ja/jfba_info/census/index.html|publisher=Japanese Federation of Bar Associations|accessdate=29 July 2010|language=Japanese|date=June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723143634/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/ja/jfba_info/census/index.html|archive-date=23 July 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting salaries for Japanese attorneys are typically around 10 million yen (US$100,000) in established law firms, and about half as much in Japanese companies. [[In-house counsel]] are still relatively rare in Japan, with only 770 of the 32,000 registered ''bengoshi'' working in corporate law departments as of January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanlawyer.com/PubArticleAL.jsp?id=1202580575361&amp;Japans_Lawyers_Heading_InHouse&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese bengoshi have a lapel pin of a balance surrounded by a sunflower, respectively symbolizing justice/liberty (sunflower) and fairness/equality (balance).

Foreign law firms have been permitted to hire Japanese attorneys since 2005, and some such firms such as [[Morrison &amp; Foerster]] and [[White &amp; Case]] have built large Japanese law practices that handle domestic matters for domestic clients. Some foreign firms that built ''bengoshi'' practices under this system, such as [[Linklaters]] and [[Allen &amp; Overy]], have since downsized or eliminated their ''bengoshi'' teams, while others such as [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] elected to rely on referral relationships with the [[Big Four law firms (Japan)|Big Four law firms]] rather than competing with them by employing ''bengoshi'' within the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brennan|first=Tom|title=Foreign Firms Stumble Going Local in Japan|url=http://www.americanlawyer.com/PubArticleAL.jsp?id=1202610878523&amp;thepage=1|accessdate=16 July 2013|newspaper=The Asian Lawyer|date=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualification==
With several minor exceptions, attorneys at law are required to pass a national {{nihongo|bar examination|司法試験|shihō shiken|lit. "legal examination"}} followed by one year of internship, supervised by the {{nihongo|Legal Research and Training Institute|司法研修所|Shihō Kenshūjo}} of the Supreme Court of Japan. 

There were 72 law schools as of July 2013 in Japan. Applications in law school in Japan has been declining sharply from approximately 70,000 applicants in 2004 to approximately 20,000 in 2015. This is due to the high tuition, difficulty of finding employment, and the pre-examination whose enrollment has increased. 

The types of quasi-lawyers are patent agents (''benrishi''), tax agents (''zerishi''), judicial scriveners (''shiho shoshi''),  and administrative scriveners (''gyosei shoshi'').

===Bar examination===
Before 2006, the bar examination consisted of three stages. The first stage, held in May, consisted of 60 multiple choice questions regarding constitutional law, civil law and criminal law. The second stage, held over two days in July, consisted of twelve essay questions regarding constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, commercial law, civil procedure law and criminal procedure law. The final stage, held in October, was an oral examination regarding constitutional law, civil law, criminal law, civil procedure law and criminal procedure law. Final results were published in mid-November. On average, 40,000–50,000 people took the first stage, 7,000–8,000 qualified for the second stage, and only 1,500 qualified for the oral examination each year.

In 2006, a new bar examination was instituted with only two stages. The first stage is a one-day short-answer examination concerning the six laws as well as administrative law. The second stage is a three-day essay examination concerning public law, civil law and criminal law, as well as subjects that can be selected by the examinee (including labor law, environmental law, public international law, and private international law). In addition, a law school requirement was introduced. All bar examination participants must complete a two or three-year graduate law program, and are limited to taking the examination within five years after graduation.

Those who have not graduated from law school may take the bar examination after passing a preliminary qualifying examination("Yobi-Shiken"). But passing a preliminary exam is still a minor path and most people are from law school. In 2015, the pass rate for the pre-examination was 3%. This path allows to skip law school and thus avoid paying high tuition.

Japanese Bar exam is known as one of the most difficult exams in the world. Although the bar pass rates are getting higher after the structural reform in 2006, only around 20% of the law school graduates pass the bar. Therefore, the top law schools in Japan are competing with each other by achieving higher bar pass rate. Students can only attempt to pass the bar 5 times, after which they are disqualified. Until 2013, they could only attempt the bar examination 3 times. Most students study at independent private schools in order to pass the bar examination, in addition to law school. The average age of those passing the bar examination is 28-29 years old.

===Legal Training and Research Institute of Supreme Court===
Those who have passed the bar examination participate in a one-year training process for studying practical skills (the skills for judges, prosecutors, and lawyers) in the LTRI. The training at the LTRI consist of (1) collective training (classes in the classroom); (2) field training (apprentices to judges, prosecutors and law offices). LTRI focuses on teaching the litigation skills. When the students pass the final examination (''nikai shiken'') at the LTRI, they become lawyers, prosecutors or judges. Prosecutors and judges are handpicked by the LTRI.

==Bar association membership==
In addition to passing bar examinations, an attorney must also be a member of the {{nihongo|bar association|弁護士会|bengoshikai}} for the [[prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] where the law office is located. According to a 2008 survey by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA), 39.4% of all lawyers belong to the three Tokyo bar associations (Tokyo Bar Association, First Tokyo Bar Association, and Second Tokyo Bar Association).&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

===Female attorneys===
As of August 2014, there were 6,326 female attorneys in Japan that were admitted to the bar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=弁護士会別会員数 (Number of Attorneys)|url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/library/ja/jfba_info/membership/data/140801.pdf|website=Japan Federation of Bar Associations|accessdate=4 August 2014|language=Japanese|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising about 18% of Japanese lawyers.

===Membership for foreign attorneys===
A total of 412 foreign-law attorneys were registered as of April 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shiraiwa |first1=Hiona |title=Japan aims to increase number of foreign-law attorneys |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/Japan-aims-to-increase-number-of-foreign-law-attorneys |website=Nikkei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[World War II]], attorneys qualified in foreign countries could join a Japanese bar with special permission from the Supreme Court. These individuals were referred to as {{nihongo|quasi-members|準会員|junkaiin}} of the bar. None remain in practice today.&lt;ref name="JFBA"&gt;{{cite web|title=日弁連の会員 (Translation: Members of the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations)|url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/jfba_info/membership/about.html|accessdate=3 August 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quasi-membership was abolished by judicial reforms in 1955,&lt;ref name="JFBA"/&gt; and was replaced by the {{nihongo|[[attorney at foreign law]]|外国法事務弁護士|gaikokuhō jimu bengoshi}} membership in 1986. 

Attorneys in [[Okinawa]] who had been admitted as U.S. attorneys before the repatriation in 1972 were admitted as Japanese attorneys. They are classified by the Japanese Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA) as "Special members in Okinawa", and nine of them are still in practice as of August 2014.&lt;ref name="JFBA"/&gt;

===Corporate membership===
Large law firms have been organized in Tokyo, [[Osaka]] and other major cities, and have grown dramatically in recent years. Since 2002, these law firms can also join as members in their own right.&lt;ref name="JFBA"/&gt; They are classified by the JFBA as {{nihongo|Legal Profession Corporation|弁護士法人|bengoshi hōjin}},&lt;ref name="JFBA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JFBA-Eng"&gt;{{cite web|title=JFBA: Outline of JFBA|url=http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/about/index.html|accessdate=14 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100402084217/http://www.nichibenren.or.jp/en/about/index.html| archivedate= 2 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are 775 law firms who joined the bar in this capacity as of August 2014.&lt;ref name="JFBA"/&gt;

The '''Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005''' ('''BAPCPA''') ({{USStatute|109|8|119|23|2005|04|20}}), is a legislative act that made several significant changes to the [[bankruptcy in the United States|United States Bankruptcy Code]].  Referred to colloquially as the "New Bankruptcy Law", the [[List of United States federal legislation|Act of Congress]] attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]]; some of these consumers may instead utilize [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]]. Voting record of S. 256.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00044#position]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was passed by the [[109th United States Congress]] on April 14, 2005 and signed into law by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] on April 20, 2005. Most provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005.

== Provisions ==
The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it "more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/news-releases/opening-statement-sen-chuck-grassley-bankruptcy-reform-hearing Opening Statement of Sen. Chuck Grassley at the Bankruptcy Reform Hearing], 2005-02-10, Press Release, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa&lt;/ref&gt; The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy—under which most debts are forgiven (or [[Bankruptcy discharge|discharged]])--and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy—under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts.

Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following:

===Presumption of abuse===
Prior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a "means test."&lt;ref name="Sahadi"&gt;Sahadi, Jeanne.  [http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/17/pf/debt/bankruptcy_law/index.htm "The new bankruptcy law and you"]. ''CNNMoney.com'', October 17, 2005. Retrieved on April 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b}}. Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of "abuse" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with "primarily consumer debt".  The pre-BAPCPA language of § 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of "substantial abuse".  Under the former § 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions.

Post-BAPCPA, § 707(b) provides two definitions of "abuse". "Abuse" may be found when there is an unrebutted "presumption of abuse" arising under a BAPCPA-created "means test", [''see'' {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|2}}], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [''see'' {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|3}}].

====Means test====

Only debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under § 707(b)(2). Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under § 707(b)(2), [''see'' {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|7}}]. This creates a means test "safe harbor" for debtors below the state's median income figure.

Current monthly income is defined in {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|101|10A}} as the monthly average of the income received by the debtor (and the debtor's spouse in a joint case) during a defined six-month time period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case. Some narrow classes of payments, for example, social security, are excluded from these figures. Notably, the average income may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's "current monthly income" as "presumed income". It should be noted that if the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable.

The applicable median income figure is adjusted by family size.  Generally, the larger the family, the greater the applicable median income figure and the more money the debtor must earn before a presumption of abuse arises. A chart of the most recent applicable median incomes by state can be found at the US Trustee's website.&lt;ref name="meanstesting"&gt;[http://www.usdoj.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/meanstesting.htm Census Bureau Median Family Income By Family Size], U.S. Trustee Program, Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;

This code section then requires a comparison between the debtor's "current monthly income" and the median income for the debtor's state.  If the debtor's income exceeds the median income, then the debtor must apply the means test.

For debtors subject to the means test, the test is calculated as follows. The debtor's "current monthly income" is reduced by a set of allowed deductions specified by the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. These deductions are not necessarily the actual expenses the debtor incurs on a monthly basis. Some commentators have referred to these deductions as "presumed expenses".

The deductions applicable in the "means test" are defined in {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|2|A}}, (ii)-(iv) and include:
*living expenses specified under the "collection standards of the Internal Revenue Service",
*actual expenses not provided by the Internal Revenue Standards including "reasonably necessary health insurance, disability insurance, and health savings account expenses",
*expenses for protection from family violence,
*continued contributions to care of nondependent family members,
*actual expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan,
*expenses for grade and high school, up to $1,500 annually per minor child provided that the expenses are reasonable and necessary,
*additional home energy costs in addition to those laid out in the IRS guidelines that are reasonable and necessary,
*1/60th of all secured debt that will become due in the five years after the filing of the bankruptcy case,
*1/60th of all priority debt, and
*continued contributions to tax-exempt charities.

An itemized list of the applicable IRS living standards can be found at the US Trustee's website.&lt;ref name="meanstesting" /&gt;

A "presumption of abuse" will arise if: (1) the debtor has at least $182.50 in current monthly income available after the allowed deductions (this equals $10,950 over five years) regardless of the amount of debt, or (2) the debtor has at least $109.59 of such income ($6,575 over five years) and this sum would be enough to pay general unsecured creditors more than 25% over five years.  For example, if a debtor had exactly $109.59 of "current monthly income" left after deductions and owed less than $26,300 in general unsecured debt, then the presumption of abuse would arise, [''see'' {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|2|A|i}}].

If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of "special circumstances", [''see'' {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|2|B}}].

==== Nonpresumed abuse ====

Even in cases where there is no presumption of abuse, it is still possible for a Chapter 7 case to be dismissed or converted. If the debtor's "current monthly income" is below the median income, as discussed above, only the court or the [[United States Trustee Program|United States trustee]] (or bankruptcy administrator) can seek dismissal or conversion of the debtor's case. If the debtor's "current monthly income" is above the median income, as discussed above, any party in interest may seek dismissal or conversion of the case. The grounds for dismissal under {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|707|b|3}} are the filing of a petition in "bad faith", or when "the totality of the circumstances (including whether the debtor seeks to reject a personal services contract and the financial need for such rejection as sought by the debtor) of the debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse."

=== Waiting period between filings ===

Another change that resulted from the BAPCPA was an extension of the time between multiple bankruptcy filings. {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|727|a|8}} was amended to provide that the debtor would be denied a discharge if a debtor had received a discharge in a prior Chapter 7 case filed within eight (8) years of the filing of the present case.  Prior to BAPCPA, the rule was six (6) years between chapter 7 filings.  BAPCPA did not change the rule for the waiting period if the debtor filed a chapter 13 previously.

=== Credit counseling and debtor education requirements ===
Another major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. Section 109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either chapter 7 or chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing the debtor received an "individual or group briefing" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator.

The new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either chapter 7 or chapter 13 complete an "instructional course concerning personal financial management."  If a chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, it constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|727|a|11}}. The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months. Theoretically, if the educational courses prove to be ineffective, the requirement may disappear.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

{{quote|... the value of the counseling requirement is not clear. The counseling was intended to help consumers make informed choices about bankruptcy and its alternatives. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that by the time most clients receive the counseling, their financial situations are dire, leaving them with no viable alternative to bankruptcy. As a result, the requirement may often serve more as an administrative obstacle than as a timely presentation of meaningful options. Because no mechanism currently exists to track the outcomes of the counseling, policymakers and program managers are unable to fully assess how well the requirement is serving its intended purpose.|Government Accounting Office|Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear}}

=== Applicability of Automatic Stay ===

The automatic stay in bankruptcy is the court order that requires all collection proceedings to stop.  There are exceptions, of course, but generally this is the term for the "relief" from collection proceedings a debtor receives by filing the bankruptcy with the bankruptcy clerk's office.  BAPCPA limited the protections the stay provides in some re-filed cases.  New § 362(c)(3) provides that if the debtor files a chapter 7, 11 or 13 case within one year of the dismissal of an earlier case, the automatic stay in the present case terminates 30 days after the filing, unless the debtor or some other party in interest files a motion and demonstrates that the present case was filed in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed.  If the present case is a third filing within one (1) year, the automatic stay does not go into effect at all, unless the debtor or any other party in interest files a motion to impose the stay that demonstrates that the third filing is in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed.

The provision presumes that the repeat filings are not in good faith and requires the party seeking to impose the stay (usually the debtor) to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence.

There are exceptions.  Notably, § 362(i) provides that the presumption that the repeat filing was not in good faith would not arise in a "subsequent" case if a debtor's prior case was dismissed "due to the creation of a debt repayment plan."

BAPCPA also limited the applicability of the automatic stay in eviction proceedings.  The stay does not stop an eviction proceeding if the landlord has already obtained a judgment of possession prior to the bankruptcy case being filed, § 362(b)(22).  The stay also would not apply in a situation where the eviction is based on "endangerment" of the rented property or "illegal use of controlled substances" on the property, § 362(b)(23).  In either situation the landlord must file with the court and serve on the debtor a certificate of non-applicability of the stay spelling out the facts giving rise to one of the exceptions.  There is a process for the debtor to contest the assertions in the landlord's certificate or if state law gives the debtor an additional right to cure the default even after an order for possession is entered, § 362(l) &amp; (m).

In addition, BAPCPA extends the exceptions to automatic stay to certain paternity, child custody, domestic violence and domestic and child support proceedings.&lt;ref name="PalmBar2006" /&gt;

=== Stricter notice requirements ===

BAPCPA enacts a provision that protects creditors from monetary penalties for violating the stay if the debtor did not give "effective" notice pursuant to § 342, [§ 342(g)].  The new notice provisions require the debtor to give notice of the bankruptcy to the creditor at an "address filed by the creditor with the court," or "at an address stated in two communications from the creditor to the debtor within 90 days of the filing of the bankruptcy case.  The notice must also include the account number used by the creditor in the two relevant communications [§ 342(c)(2)(e) &amp; (f)].  An ineffective notice can be cured if the notice is later "brought to the attention of the creditor."  This means that the notice must be received by a person designated by the creditor to receive bankruptcy notices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spilmanlaw.com/getattachment/d45e4f08-7c8c-4e37-814b-6330e537164a/Do-the-Trade-Winds-Blow-Fair-or-is-BAPCPA-Full-of.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054406/http://www.spilmanlaw.com/getattachment/d45e4f08-7c8c-4e37-814b-6330e537164a/Do-the-Trade-Winds-Blow-Fair-or-is-BAPCPA-Full-of.aspx |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dischargeability ===

BAPCPA also provided more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge.  The presumption of fraud in the use of credit cards was expanded.  The amount that the debtor must charge for "luxury goods" to invoke the presumption is reduced from $1,225 to $500.  The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750.  The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days.  Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 days of filing, the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises.  Prior to BAPCPA, the presumption would not have arisen unless the purchase was for more than $1,225 and was made within 60 days of filing (§ 523(a)(2)(C)).

BAPCPA amended § 523(a)(8) to broaden the types of educational ("student") loans that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy absent proof of "undue hardship."  The nature of the lender is no longer relevant.  Thus, even loans from "for-profit" or "non-governmental" entities are not dischargeable.

=== Lien avoidance ===

Some types of liens may be avoided through a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. The definition of "household goods" was changed—for example, by limiting "electronic equipment" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. The definition now excludes certain items such as works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500, with adjustment for inflation (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles&lt;ref&gt;See e.g., § 522(f)(1)(B) and § 522(f)(4)(B).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc.

=== Limits to the homestead exemption ===

Under the new law, the [[homestead exemption]], which allows bankruptcy filers in some states to exempt the value of their homes from creditors, is limited in various ways. If a filer acquired their home less than 1,215 days (40 months) before filing, or if they have been convicted of security law violations or been found guilty of certain crimes, they may only exempt up to $125,000 (adjusted periodically), regardless of a state's exemption allowance.(§ 522(p)(1)).  Filers must also wait 730 days before they are allowed to use their state's exemptions. (§ 522(b)(3)(A)). There is an exception if the property is "reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor."

These provisions were largely intended to prevent filers from forum shopping, i.e. moving assets and domiciles to a state with more favorable exemptions and filing.

=== Exemptions ===

BAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived "forum shopping" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions.  Exemptions define the amount of property debtors may protect from liquidation to pay creditors.  Typically, every state has exemption laws that define the amount of property that can be protected from creditor collection action within the state.  There is also a federal statute that defines exemptions in federal cases.  In bankruptcy, Congress allowed states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme.  Opt out states still controlled the amount of property that could be protected from creditors, or "exempted" from creditors, in bankruptcy cases.

Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor's domicile for the majority of the 180-day time period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing [§ 522(b)(3)].  If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions.

Also, there is a "cap" placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case added value to a homestead.  The provision provides that "any value in excess of $125,000" added to a homestead can not be exempted.  The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (§ 522(p)).  This "cap" would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his/her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition).

=== Additional requirements for filers ===

{{More footnotes|date=November 2008}}

The new law adds a number of new requirements for bankruptcy filers that attempt to make the filing process more difficult and costly. These additional requirements include:

*''Additional filing requirements and fees''.  The new law increases the amount of paperwork involved in filing and raises the filing fees. The law also allows filing fees to be waived for debtors earning below 150 percent of the federal [[poverty level]].
*''Increased attorney liability and costs.'' Attorneys representing bankruptcy filers are now required to conduct an investigation of their clients' filings and can be held personally liable for inaccuracies.  Most bankruptcy attorneys predicted that this will result in increased attorneys fees and will make attorneys less likely to take on some cases. In addition, bankruptcy filings are now subject to audit in a manner similar to tax returns.
*''Increased compliance requirements for small businesses''. The new law increases the bureaucratic compliance obligations and shortens the deadline for Chapter 11 reorganizations involving small businesses, a series of new requirements not applicable to larger businesses.
*''Increased amount of debt repayment under Chapter 13''. The new law made several changes that effectively increased the amount of debt that Chapter 13 filers will have to repay.

=== Other changes ===

*The new law allows creditors to pursue collection remedies without court permission in various circumstances such as offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation in all respects except the final turnover of assets from the estate, establishing wage assignments in domestic relations actions, repossessing vehicles and personal property subject to loans or leases 45 days after the first meeting of creditors in cases where no court action has been taken regarding that property, and allowing evictions that completed the court process prior to the filing of the petition or involve endangerment to property or drug use to proceed. The law also makes it easier for creditors who received preferential payments of less than $5,000 from the debtor before bankruptcy to avoid repaying such payments for the benefit of all creditors.
* The law improves the ability of the bankruptcy estate to reclaim assets placed in asset protection trusts within ten years of filing or paid as employment bonuses to insiders within two years prior to filing.
* The law makes [[Chapter 12]] bankruptcy (farm reorganization) permanent while adding family fishermen, overhauls the treatment of complex financial contracts including many derivative contracts used by hedge funds, and overhauls the treatment of ancillary foreign bankruptcy proceedings.
* The law extends protection to non-[[ERISA]] pension plans like private sector [[403(b)]]s and some [[Individual Retirement Account]] that ERISA plans had enjoyed thereby making these plans more similar to ERISA plans.
* The law raises the priority status for payment of domestic support obligations (such as [[alimony]] and [[child support]]) from seventh place to first, only behind the administrative expenses of the trustee. This means that domestic support claimants get paid before all other unsecured creditors.&lt;ref name="PalmBar2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.furrcohen.com/Articles-News/BAPCPA-Changes-That-Impact-the-Family-Law-Practioner.shtml |title=BAPCPA: Changes That Impact the Family Law Practitioner |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2006 |publisher=Palm Beach County Bar Association Bulletin |access-date=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George W. Bush signs Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act into law, April 20, 2005.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] signs into law the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act on April 20, 2005.]]
The 2005 bankruptcy bill was actually first drafted in 1997 and first introduced in 1998. The [[United States House of Representatives]] approved a version titled the "Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999" and the Senate approved a slightly different version in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:H.R.833.EH: H.R.833.EH - Text of Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; After the differences in the bills were reconciled, Congress passed the "Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000". President Clinton, however, employed what is known as a "[[pocket veto]]" by waiting for the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] congressional session to adjourn without signing the bill, a legislative maneuver tantamount to a veto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c106:H.R.833.EAS: H.R.833.EAS - Text of Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lubbockonline.com/stories/121900/upd_075-5725.shtml "Clinton vetoes bankruptcy bill."] ''Associated Press'', December 20, 2000. Retrieved on April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Elizabeth Warren#Advisory roles|Elizabeth Warren]], a member of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission at that time, briefed First Lady Clinton on negative effects of the bill; according to Warren, after the briefing:

{{quote|text=President Clinton had been showing that this is another way that he could be helpful to business. It wasn't a very high visibility bill. And when Mrs. Clinton came back with a little better understanding of how it all worked, they reversed course, and they reversed course fast. And indeed, the proof is in the pudding.

The last bill that came before President Clinton was that bankruptcy bill that was passed by the House and the Senate in 2000 and he vetoed it. And in her autobiography, Mrs. Clinton took credit for that veto and she rightly should. She turned around a whole administration on the subject of bankruptcy.

In the years since 2000, the bill was introduced in each Congress, but was repeatedly shelved due to threats of a filibuster from its opponents and because of disagreements over various amendments, including one backed by Senate Democrats that would have made it harder for [[Opposition to the legalization of abortion|anti-abortion groups]] to discharge court fines related to legal debts incurred from lawsuits filed by [[pro-abortion]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2002/06/03/story8.html|author=Kent Hoover|date=June 2, 2002|accessdate=February 27, 2018|publisher=[[Atlanta Business Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in Republican majorities in the Senate and House after the 2004 elections breathed new life into the bill, which was introduced in its current form by the chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Finance|Senate Finance Committee]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Chuck Grassley]] of [[Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.256.ENR: Full text of legislation S.256]&lt;/ref&gt; According to George Packer in his book ''[[The Unwinding]]'', [[Joe Biden]], [[Chris Dodd]], and [[Hillary Clinton]] helped pass this bill.&lt;ref name="The Unwinding page 345 to 350"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Unwinding, an inner history of the New America | publisher=Farrar, Straus, and Giroux | author=Packer, George | year=2013 | location=New York | pages=348 | quote=In 2005, with the help of Democrats like Joe Biden and Chris Dodd and Hillary Clinton, Congress passed a law restricting the right to file for bankruptcy. | isbn=978-0-374-10241-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Of the three, however, only Biden voted for the final bill.

== Support ==
Support for the act mostly came from banks, credit card companies, and other creditors.&lt;ref name="Harvey R. Miller 2007"&gt;Harvey R. Miller, ''Chapter 11 in Transition - From Boom to Bust and Into the Future'', 81 Am. Bankr. L.J. 375, 388 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
Since banks, credit companies and other creditors are the ones who must bear the losses for debts discharged through bankruptcy, their lobby power was a great supporting factor to eventually prevailing and getting Congress to pass the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005.

It was widely claimed by advocates of BAPCPA that its passage would reduce losses to creditors such as credit card companies, and that those creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers in the form of lower interest rates.  These claims turned out to be false.   After BAPCPA passed, although credit card company losses decreased, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.&lt;ref name = "Credit Card"&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1157158 "The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices"] Berkeley Business Law Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 bankruptcy bill was opposed by a wide variety of groups, including consumer advocates, legal scholars, retired bankruptcy judges, and the editorial pages of many national and regional newspapers. While criticisms of the bill were wide ranging, the central objections of its opponents focused on the bill's sponsors' contention that bankruptcy fraud was widespread, the strict means test that would force more debtors to file under [[Chapter 13, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 13]] (under which a percentage of debts must be paid over a period of 3–5 years) as opposed to Chapter 7 (under which debts are paid only out of existing assets), the additional penalties and responsibilities the bill placed on debtors, and the bill's many provisions favorable to credit card companies.  Opponents of the bill regularly pointed out that the credit card industry spent more than $100 million lobbying for the bill over the course of eight years.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;Egan, Timothy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/national/11credit.html " Newly Bankrupt Raking In Piles Of Credit Offers."] The New York Times, December 11, 2005. Retrieved on April 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been significant criticism of BAPCPA's changes to Chapter 11 business bankruptcies.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey R. Miller, ''Chapter 11 in Transition - From Boom to Bust and Into the Future'', 81 Am. Bankr. L.J. 375, 387-88 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Harvey Miller, one of the most-prominent bankruptcy attorneys in the country (particularly in terms of representing corporate debtors) has described BAPCPA as "ill-conceived."&lt;ref name="Harvey R. Miller 2007" /&gt;

One of the primary stated purposes of the bankruptcy bill was to cut down on abusive or fraudulent uses of the bankruptcy system.  As Congressman F. [[Jim Sensenbrenner|James Sensenbrenner Jr.]] (R-Wis), one of the bill's key supporters in the House, argued, "This bill will help restore responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system by cracking down on fraudulent, abusive, and opportunistic bankruptcy claims."&lt;ref&gt;Day, Kathleen.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53688-2005Apr14.html "Bankruptcy bill passes; Bush expected to sign.]" ''The Washington Post,'' April 15, 2005; Page E01. Retrieved on April 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the bill argued that claims of bankruptcy abuse and fraud were wildly overblown, and that the vast majority of bankruptcies were related to medical expenses and job losses. These arguments were bolstered by an in-depth study and survey of 1,771 bankruptcy cases by scholars at [[Harvard University]], of whom 931 submitted to interviews. The study found that "about half" of bankruptcy filers in the year 2001 cited out-of-pocket medical bills in excess of $10,000 as a major contributor to bankruptcy (the average bankruptcy filer in this study was a 41-year-old woman with a median income of $25,000, slightly below the personal income average for that year). However, the study did not address broader [[personal finance]] habits (budgeting, savings, debt to income ratios prior to medical bills, etc), and were noted as being limited to relying largely on [[anecdotal]] data which may be biased.&lt;ref&gt;Himmelstein, David U., Elizabeth Warren, Deborah Thorne, and Steffie Woolhandler. [http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.w5.63/DC1 "MarketWatch:Illness And Injury As Contributors To Bankruptcy."] ''Health Affairs'', February 2, 2005. Retrieved on April 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most controversial provisions of the bill was the strict means test it established to determine whether a debtor's filing under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code would be considered as an "abuse" and therefore subject to dismissal. This decision was previously made by a [[bankruptcy court]] judge, who would evaluate the particular circumstances that led to a bankruptcy. Critics of the means test, which is triggered if a debtor makes more than their state's [[median]] income, argued that it ignored the many causes of individual bankruptcies, including job loss, family illnesses, and [[predatory lending]], and would force debtors seeking to challenge the test into costly [[litigation]], driving them even further into debt.&lt;ref&gt;Sabatini, Patricia. [http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05116/494270.stm "New law's 'means' test just mean, bankruptcy experts say."] ''Pittsburgh Post Gazette'', April 26, 2005. Retrieved April 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the stricter means test, opponents of the bill also objected to the many other obstacles the bill creates for individuals seeking bankruptcy protection.  These changes included more detailed reporting requirements, higher fees, mandated [[credit counseling]], and the additional liability placed on bankruptcy attorneys, which critics argued would drive up attorneys' fees and decrease the number of lawyers willing to help consumers file.&lt;ref name="Sahadi" /&gt; These criticisms were partly borne out in the months following the new law, as lawyers have reported that the bankruptcy process has become significantly more arduous, forcing them to charge higher fees and take fewer clients.&lt;ref&gt;Gertner, Reni. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4185/is_20060506/ai_n16353787 "Lawyers reflect on first six months of bankruptcy reform"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060603124043/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4185/is_20060506/ai_n16353787 |date=2006-06-03 }}.

One criticism of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://www.ngos.net/credit/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232410/http://www.ngos.net/credit/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A major target of the bill's opponents were provisions they described as beneficial to credit card companies.  In particular, critics objected to the extension to eight years from six to the time before which debtors could liquidate their debts through bankruptcy, and requirements that those who file for multiple bankruptcies pay previous credit card debt that would have been forgiven under the old law.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of [[credit card debt]], forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid [[child support]]. More broadly the bill's critics argued that the legislation did nothing to curtail what they characterize as predatory practices of credit card companies, such as exorbitant [[interest rates]], rising and often hidden fees, and targeting minors and the recently bankrupt for new cards. The bill's critics argue that these practices are themselves significant contributors to the growth of consumer bankruptcies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1381&amp;wit_id=3996|title=Testimony of Professor Elizabeth Warren to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923215507/http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1381&amp;wit_id=3996|archivedate=2008-09-23|date=2005-02-10|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurricane Katrina bankruptcies==

Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican chairman of the [[House Judiciary Committee]] claimed: "If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2005/katrina_bankruptcy03.html "No Bankruptcy Relief for Katrina Victims"], ConsumerAffairs.Com, September 15, 2005. Accessed April 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Trustee|Justice Department's US Trustee]] program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/27/business/storm-victims-may-face-curbs-on-bankruptcy.html?_r=0 New York Times, September 27, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department Trustees oversee the administration of bankruptcy law and are able to file the motions necessary to enforce the means test. Despite these assurances, bankruptcy judges are still able to enforce these rules ''[[sua sponte]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' 11 U.S.C. 707.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Justice also indicated it would not oppose a debtor's eligibility to file bankruptcy because the debtor did not fulfill the credit counseling requirements before filing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} U.S. Trustees have the discretion to grant waivers of the credit counseling requirements to debtors. ''See'' {{UnitedStatesCodeSub|11|109|h|2}}.

==Global Financial Crisis of 2008==

As the Financial Times noted during the fall of 2008, "the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company's assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24cd66ea-a6eb-11dd-95be-000077b07658.html The Financial Times October 31, 2008 Wall Street 'made rod for own back' Francesco Guerrera, Nicole Bullock and Julie MacIntosh New York&lt;/ref&gt; This radically altered the historic process of paying off creditors and did so just a few years prior to trillions of dollars in assets going into liquidation as a consequence of bankruptcies following from the global financial crisis of 2008.

Some observers{{who|date=November 2012}} have argued that this contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by removing the incentive that creditors would normally have to keep a borrower out of bankruptcy.  Institutions who provided short-term funding to financial firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman through repo lending could abruptly withdraw that funding even if it risked pushing the firms into bankruptcy, because they did not have to worry about tying up their claims in bankruptcy court, due to the new safe harbor provisions of BAPCPA.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

On October 4, 2009, FDIC Chair [[Sheila Bair]] proposed imposing a haircut on secured lenders in the event of a bank default, in order to prevent this kind of short-term funding run on a troubled bank.  "This would ensure that market participants always have some skin in the game, and it would be very strong medicine indeed," Bair said.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.economonitor.com/blog/2009/10/why-sheila-bairs-remarks-about-repos-are-really-really-important/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''border blaster''' is a broadcast station that, though not licensed as an [[external service (broadcasting)|external service]], is, in practice, used to target another country.  The term "border blaster" is of North American origin, and usually associated with Mexican [[AM band|AM stations]] covering large parts of the [[United States]] and United States border AM stations covering large parts of [[Canada]].  Conceptually similar European broadcasting included some pre-World War II broadcasting towards the United Kingdom, "[[:fr:Radio périphérique|radio périphérique]]" around France and the U.S. government-funded propaganda station [[Radio Free Europe]], targeting eastern Europe.

With broadcasting signals far more powerful than U.S. stations, the Mexican border blasters could be heard over large areas of the U.S. from the 1940s to the 1970s, often to the great irritation of American radio stations, whose signals could be overpowered by their Mexican counterparts.  These are also sometimes referred to as '''X stations''' for their [[call letters]]: Mexico assigns callsigns beginning with XE or XH to broadcast stations.

On November 9, 1972 in Washington, D.C., the United States and Mexico signed an "Agreement Concerning Frequency Modulation Broadcasting in the 87.5 to 108 MHz Band". Since then, in the [[FM band]] power levels and frequency assignments have been set by mutual agreement between the two countries. [[AM broadcasting|AM radio]] border blasters still exist, though they are largely ignored due to the decline of AM radio in the U.S. and in Mexico. There are several such stations licensed by Mexico's [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] using transmitters with an [[effective radiated power]] similar to those of major licensed commercial stations located within the USA.

In 1973 the border blaster [[XEPRS#XERB: The Mighty 1090|XERB]] became famous when [[George Lucas]] featured the station as the source for the musical soundtrack of his motion picture ''[[American Graffiti]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

==Background==
In contrast to [[pirate radio]] stations which broadcast illegally, border blasters are generally licensed by the government upon whose soil they are located. Pirate radio stations are freebooters from offshore, outside the [[territorial waters]] of the nation they target, or ones that are illegally operating in defiance of national law within its sovereign territory.

A similar situation developed in Europe, beginning with [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] after World War II.  The [[United Kingdom|British]] government identified these stations as ''pirates'' because the Sunday broadcast was reserved for British listeners (deliberately coinciding with the BBC Sundays of religious programmes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=James|title=History of international broadcasting|date=1994|publisher=P. Peregrinus|location=London|isbn=0-86341-302-1|edition=Pbk.|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broadcasts were considered illegal on British soil as these stations were breaking the monopoly of the non-commercial [[BBC]]. (Coincidentally, a large percent of the Republic of Ireland could receive spillover from Northern Ireland, Wales and the west of England BBC TV and radio broadcasts for decades.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmr.ulster.ac.uk/the-digital-switchover-and-rte-in-northern-ireland/|title=The digital switchover and RTE in Northern Ireland|author=Centre for Media Research|date=|work=University of Ulster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/article/815513/ireland-television---irish-tv-its-digital|title=Ireland Television - Irish TV is well on its way to digital|author=Lucy Rouse|date=10 June 2008|work=mediaweek.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listening to the broadcasts was technically a violation of UK radio-license laws of the day.  The same [[:fr:Radio périphérique|radio périphérique]], or "peripheric radio", phenomenon existed in [[France]] from the 1930s until the legalization of private broadcasting in the early 1980s, which allowed [[Radio Luxembourg (French)|Radio Luxembourg]] from [[Luxembourg]], [[:fr:Radio Andorre|Radio Andorre]] and [[:fr:Sud Radio|Sud Radio]] from [[Andorra]], [[Radio Monte Carlo]] from [[Monaco]], and [[:fr:Europe 1|Europe 1]] from [[Saarland]], [[Germany]] to begin legally broadcasting signals across international borders.

In Mexico and the US, while the federal government of the US did not particularly like them, the stations were allowed to flourish. [[W. Lee O'Daniel]] used a border blaster in his successful campaign for governor of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Border Radio: Quacks, Yodelers, Pitchmen, Psychics, and Other Amazing Broadcasters of the American Airwaves| last= Fowler| first=Gene|author2=Crawford, Bill| year= 2002| publisher= University of Texas Press| isbn=978-0-292-72535-5| page=181}}&lt;!--| accessdate=July 30, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The US, unlike the UK, has never required a license to listen to broadcast radio or television. The only restriction placed upon border-blasters was a law which prohibited studios in the US from linking by telephone to border-blaster transmitters in Mexico.  This law, part of the [[Brinkley Act]], was introduced in the wake of [[John R. Brinkley]]'s fraudulent medical advice program on [[XERA-AM|XERA]]. The Brinkley Act remains on the books in the US, but licenses under that act are now routinely granted as long as the station follows applicable US and Mexican regulations.

The British government created a similar measure after World War II: the state-owned telephone monopoly prevented studios in Britain from linking by telephone to the transmitters of Radio Luxembourg. These restrictions were mostly lifted following the privatisation and demonopolisation of the UK telephone system.

Signals of many US and Canada radio stations (and to a lesser extent television outlets) encroach into neighboring territory. Such stations are usually not deemed "border blasters," as their programming is not primarily targeted at listeners and viewers across the border. US and Canadian stations adhere to comparable maximum power levels, and the encroachment is regarded as unintentional and largely unavoidable.

An exception to that general rule is [[KRPI]] located in [[Ferndale, Washington]]. It is owned by BBC Broadcasting Inc., a Washington state company with studios in [[Richmond, British Columbia]].  The station airs a mixture of music, news and talk focused on the [[South Asian Canadian|South Asian]] communities in [[Metro Vancouver]].  To improve reception of the station within its target market, KRPI applied and received a FCC construction permit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/leg_det.pl?Application_id=1576309&amp;File_number=BR-20130927AJA|title=Legal Action Information|author=FCC Internet Services Staff|date=|work=fcc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase its nighttime power from 10 to 50 kilowatts, change the community it served and move its transmitter from Ferndale to [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], a community adjacent to the Canada–US border. The move has attracted much criticism from the local citizens of Point Roberts and the adjacent densely populated community of [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia]] because it would cause harmful [[blanketing]] interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allpointbulletin.com/news/article.exm/2013-08-30_heavy_static_greets_radio__towers_proposal_|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105013911/http://www.allpointbulletin.com/news/article.exm/2013-08-30_heavy_static_greets_radio__towers_proposal_|title=Heavy static greets radio towers proposal|archivedate=November 5, 2013 |publisher=All Point Bulletin|date=Aug 30, 2013|author=Pat Grubb|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allpointbulletin.com/news/article.exm/2013-08-22_radio_towers_spark_high_wattage_opposition|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000433/http://allpointbulletin.com/news/article.exm/2013-08-22_radio_towers_spark_high_wattage_opposition|title=Radio towers spark high wattage opposition|date=Aug 22, 2013|author=Pat Grubb|archivedate=October 19, 2014 |publisher=All Point Bulletin|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allpointbulletin.com/static/files/Attachment%20B%20comments%20ferndale.pdf |title=Letters and Comments from Ferndale Residents to FCC |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018235521/http://allpointbulletin.com/static/files/Attachment%20B%20comments%20ferndale.pdf |archivedate=October 18, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible exception to that general rule on the Canadian side was [[CKLW]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]], across the river from [[Detroit]]. Originally licensed as a Class II-B (now Class B) station and always operating in full compliance with the technical specifications and operating rules of its [[Canadian Radio-Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] licence (i.e., protection of the entire Mexican border nights and protection of co-channel Canadian stations days and nights), CKLW's 50,000-watt directional signal blanketed much of [[Michigan]] and northern [[Ohio]] east to [[Cleveland]] days and nights, and south to Toledo, Lima and Dayton in the daytime.  American-owned until 1970 as part of the [[RKO General]] chain (along with such other top 40 powerhouses as [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] in [[Los Angeles]] and [[KFRC (defunct)|KFRC]] in [[San Francisco]]), it functioned essentially as a Detroit-market station during the 1960s and 1970s. Its Motown-flavored personality Top 40 format made it one of the most highly rated stations in the [[Midwestern US]]. The decline of AM radio as a music source in the 1970s, combined with new Canadian government rules imposing [[Canadian content|minimum domestic music content]], made it difficult for CKLW to continue to compete for listeners with Detroit-based, US-licensed FM music stations, which offered clean stereo sound and faced no program content or music playlist restrictions. CKLW abandoned the Top 40 format and its efforts to compete in the Detroit market in the 1980s. Today it is a news/talk station aimed specifically at an Ontario audience, though still containing a significant amount of American syndicated talk.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), the regulatory body for Canadian broadcasting, it is illegal to operate a station licensed in Canada from studios in the US; [[CKEY-FM]] in [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] learned this when it attempted to offshore its operations to American-based [[Citadel Broadcasting]]'s studios across the [[Niagara River]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], and almost had its license revoked because of it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} CKEY remains on the air, targeting solely the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara|Niagara Region]] and no longer targeting [[Western New York]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Attempts at border-blasting were somewhat more common on the other side of the border, where smaller markets in the United States could find lucrative larger markets in Canada within their broadcast range. [[WIVB-TV]], prior to the digital television transition, could be seen as a U.S. border blaster into Canada (as Western New York is a smaller market than [[Southern Ontario]], which boasts the major world city of [[Toronto]]); it operated with 100,000 watts of power on the VHF low band (channel 4), even after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] reduced the maximum allowed power for that band to 80,000 watts. (WIVB did not make significant attempts to reach the Canadian market, although rival station [[WKBW-TV]] did.) Another famous U.S.-based border blaster into Canada was [[KCND-TV]] in [[Pembina, North Dakota]]; Pembina was a small border town of less than 1,000 residents, which normally would be far too small of a market to support a television station, but spent its fifteen-year existence targeting [[Winnipeg]], a much larger city sixty miles north of Pembina. Likewise, the small market of [[Burlington, Vermont]] and [[Plattsburgh, New York]] found it could reach a larger audience in [[Montreal]]. Canadian regulators put in [[simultaneous substitution]] requirements to prevent losing revenue to these American border-blasters (this forced KCND's owners to sell the station to Canadian interests, who transformed the station into modern-day Winnipeg, Manitoba-based [[CKND-TV]]; Burlington station [[WFFF-TV]] entered into a famous cross-border scheduling feud over the simsub problems, while WKBW, after [[Capital Cities Communications Inc v Canadian Radio-Television Commission|unsuccessfully suing to bar the CRTC from enforcing it on systems that only operate in one province]] in 1977, competed mainly by focusing on its unique brand of local news, which could not be simsubbed). Also in Western New York, radio station [[WTOR]] is licensed to the northwesternmost municipality in the region ([[Youngstown, New York|Youngstown]]), operates with a [[directional antenna|directional signal]] covering Southern Ontario but very little American territory, and is brokered to a Canadian ethnic broadcaster based in [[Mississauga]]; it maintains its U.S. license and transmitter site as a [[legal fiction]], with ethnic broadcaster [[Birach Broadcasting Corporation|Sima Birach]] holding the station's license and claiming himself as "operations manager" even as he seldom appears at the station's nominal U.S. studio in person.

The mythology surrounding the history of the border blaster stations in Mexico is extensive with examples being the 1971 [[The Doors|Doors]] song, "[[The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat)]]", 1975 [[ZZ Top]] song "[[Fandango!|Heard It on the X]]", "The Wolfman Of Del Rio" by [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]] on his 1979 album ''[[Lubbock (On Everything)]]'', 1983's "[[Mexican Radio]]" by [[Wall of Voodoo]], and 1987's "[[Border Radio]]" movie theme by [[The Blasters]].&lt;ref name="reach"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rohter|first=Larry|title=Border Music's Long Reach|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/24/arts/border-music-s-long-reach.html|accessdate=January 10, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 24, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Most border blaster stations today program Spanish-language programming targeted at the Mexican side of the border. Some of the Spanish language border blasters target the growing Latino audience living in the southwestern US. Some target both.

As was the case between the 1930s and the 1970s, some border blaster stations in areas near larger American border cities such as San Diego are leased out by American broadcasting companies and air English-language programming targeting American audiences, although the AM stations have sometimes been supplanted by FM signals just over the border and able to reach major American cities like San Diego or El Paso with city-grade signals. During those decades border radio was used by preachers who solicited donations, and advertisers who sold products of dubious value.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Miller (travel writer)|Tom Miller]]. ''On the Border: Portraits of America’s Southwestern Frontier'', pp. 76–87.&lt;/ref&gt; The American side leases the station from the Mexican station owners/license holders and feeds programming from their American studios to the Mexican transmitters via satellite.

Due to Mexican government regulations, these stations, like all radio stations in Mexico, must air ''[[La Hora Nacional]]'' ("The Mexican National Hour") on Sunday evenings at 10pm and ''[[Himno Nacional Mexicano]]'' (the Mexican National Anthem) at midnight and 6 am. In addition, they must also air 48 minutes a day of ''tiempos oficiales'' (public service announcements from the Mexican government, which include campaign ads during elections) and give station identification in Spanish. This is usually done softly or during commercial breaks so the listeners on the American side won't usually notice it. The PSA requirement has produced controversy even amongst officials in Mexico, for reasons including reinforcing negative perceptions of the country, taking up space that could be used to promote cross-border tourism and interaction, and their poor quality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-public-service-spots-have-radio-listeners-2012mar11-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coahuila ===

==== Ciudad Acuña ====
:*'''[[XER-AM|XER]]''': "Sunshine Station between the Nations" broadcasting on [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] at 735kHz. This was the original station licensed to [[John R. Brinkley]] in [[Mexico]] as the Villa Acuña Broadcasting Company. It first signed on August 18, 1932 with a 50 kW transmitter and claimed 75&amp;nbsp;kW ERP via an omnidirectional antenna. The engineering was by Will Branch of [[Fort Worth]] who had engineered [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] for [[Amon Carter]], owner of the ''Fort Worth Star-Telegram''. It was shut down by the Mexican authorities on February 24, 1933 and the Villa Acuña Broadcasting Company was dissolved.
:*'''[[XERA-AM|XERA]]''': In September 1935 Brinkley gained a new license for Villa Acuña from the Government of Mexico with new call letters of XERA. His new operating company was Cía Mexicana Radiodifusora Fronteriza and the station came on the air from the same location as the old XER but with a directional antenna. His new transmitter power was 500 kW, but with his new antenna he claimed an output of 1MW.  XERA called itself "''the world's most powerful broadcasting station''" and ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine claimed that it could be heard in New York City. Following the signing of various treaties, the Government of Mexico revoked the license of XERA in the closing days of 1939.
:*'''[[XERF-AM]]''': from 1947. The station that made [[Wolfman Jack]] world famous for his [[disc jockey]] and sales presentations between 1962 and 1964. This station came on the air long after the era of both XERA and Brinkley, but it initially used his old facilities although the powerful transmitter of XERA had been dismantled and shipped elsewhere. The station later moved to a new building where a 250kW [[RCA]] main transmitter was installed. The [[Ampliphase|RCA "Ampliphase"]] transmitter has not been operational for many decades.

==== Piedras Negras ====
:*'''[[XEPN-AM]]''' was sister station to XER/XERA, and was also controlled by John Brinkley.
:*'''[[XEROK-AM|XELO-AM]]'''

===Nuevo León===

==== Monterrey ====
:*'''[[XEG-AM]]''': In 1950 the advertising time of this station came under the control of [[Harold Schwartz]] of [[Chicago]], who also came to represent XERB near Tijuana/Rosarito (the station made famous in the movie ''[[American Graffiti]]''.) From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, XEG was known for its nighttime Black/R&amp;B/Disco music programming block, transcribed from KGFJ, Los Angeles. XEG ran a huge 150kW signal at night, with 50kW daytime, on 1050 kHz.
:*'''[[XET-AM]]'''

=== Tamaulipas ===

==== Matamoros ====
:*'''[[XELD-TV]]''': This station, owned in a joint venture between [[Romulo O'Farrill]] and [[Emilio Azcárraga Jean|Emilio Azcárraga]], signed on in 1951 as Mexico's third television station on air, the first outside Mexico City and the first TV border blaster. It held affiliations with all major American networks, though its primary connection was with CBS. It was the only station in the area until 1953; weakened by economic conditions, new stations in the US and the deterioration and destruction of its physical plant, the station was gone by the middle of 1954.
:*'''[[XHRIO-TDT]]''': From 1979-81, the Matamoros-based station operated from studios in [[McAllen, Texas]], and was programmed as an English independent.

==== Nuevo Laredo ====
:*'''[[XENT-AM]]''': Operated by [[Norman G. Baker]] from 1933 until forced off the air in 1940; "The Calliaphone Station" (for an air-operated [[Calliope (music)|calliope]] invented by Baker) promoted a cancer-cure clinic of Baker's, essentially continuing his former station KTNT ("Know The Naked Truth") of [[Muscatine, Iowa|Muscatine]], [[Iowa]], as was itself forced off the air in 1931. Brochures for the clinic urged patients to "phone 666 upon arrival in Laredo," attracting many complaints to the American Medical Association as invoked reference to Revelation 13:18, citing 666 as the Mark of the Beast. When the original XENT was dismantled, the callsign was assigned to a new and unrelated station at [[La Paz, Baja California Sur]].

==== Reynosa ====
:*'''[[XED-AM]]''': The first radio station in Mexico to be considered a border-blaster. XED was originally located at Reynosa, Tamaulipas, and was under the advertising sales management of the International Broadcasting Company. Located across the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas, the station broadcast with a power of 10 kilowatts that was the most powerful transmitter in Mexico at that time.
:*'''[[XEAW-AM]]''': Another station that came under the management control of [[John R. Brinkley]]. (See XER and XERA.)

==== Tampico ====
:*'''[[XEFW-AM]]'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13478">A '''broadcast license''' is a type of spectrum [[license]] granting the licensee permission to use a portion of the [[radio frequency]] [[radio spectrum|spectrum]] in a given geographical area for [[broadcasting]] purposes. The licenses generally include restrictions, which vary from band to band.&lt;ref name="nuechterlein235"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Crossroads |last=Nuechterlein |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |author2=Weiser, Philip J. |year=2005 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= |page=235 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spectrum may be divided according to use. As indicated in a graph from the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] (NTIA), [[frequency allocation]]s may be represented by different types of services which vary in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/allochrt.pdf|title=National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) United States Frequency Allocations The Radio Spectrum|author=|date=|website=doc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many options exist when applying for a broadcast license; the FCC determines how much spectrum to allot to licensees in a given band,&lt;ref&gt;&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Crossroads |last=Nuechterlein |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |author2=Weiser, Philip J. |year=2005 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= |page=234 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to what is needed for the service in question.&lt;ref name="nuechterlein235"/&gt;

The determination of frequencies used by licensees is done through frequency allocation, which in the [[United States]] is specified by the FCC in a [[table of allotments]]. The FCC is authorized to regulate spectrum access private and government uses; however, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration]] of the [[United States Department of Commerce|Commerce Department]] allocates spectrum for use by the federal government (including the military).

In some cases (e.g. [[Citizens' band radio|CB]] radio), the public may use spectrum without a license. Commercial users (such as television, AM/FM radio, and some types of two-way communications) will receive an FCC assignment to a portion of spectrum, which may be a single frequency or a band of frequencies. In issuing broadcast licenses the FCC relies on "comparative hearings", whereby the most qualified user will be granted use of the spectrum to best serve the public interest; researchers have pointed out that this procedure favors incumbents.&lt;ref&gt;Krattenmaker, T. G. &amp; Pwwe, L. A. Jr. (1994). Regulating Broadcast programming.&lt;/ref&gt;

Violation of the terms of a license (due to technical fault or illegal content) may result in [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s or [[revocation]] of the license. Licenses have also been jeopardized by misrepresentation on the part of the holder or failure to keep a [[public file]] (in the U.S. and Canada). [[Unlicensed broadcasting]] refers to legal devices allowed to transmit at [[low-power broadcasting|low power]] without a license and [[Pirate radio|pirate stations]], which violate the law.

== Economics ==
In the U.S. broadcast licenses were issued for only a nominal payment, but economist [[Ronald Coase]] challenged the FCC's approach. [[Coase]] proposed that, as for other resources (land, metal, etc.), the market should regulate the use of radio spectrum. This proposition is based on the [[Coase theorem]]: with well-defined property rights, the free market will allocate resources to their most efficient use if transaction costs are low. Coase's theory indicated that broadcast licenses in a spectrum that was limited had high [[economic value]], which should be paid on the [[open market]]. Licenses are increasingly offered via [[spectrum auction]]s; however, this fails to consider [[non-commercial educational]] users (who are shut out of the process for economic reasons).

Licensing is conducted by a broadcasting authority (a government agency) to manage the radio-frequency spectrum and implement [[public policy]], such as that regarding the [[concentration of media ownership]]. In [[Broadcasting in the United States|the U.S.]] the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) does not assign licenses to exclusive users, instead permitting qualified users to apply for a license.&lt;ref name="nuechterlein235"/&gt; The [[Radio Act of 1927]] established the regulatory premise that the spectrum belongs to the public, and licensees have no property rights to use it.&lt;ref name="nuechterlein232"&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Crossroads |last=Nuechterlein |first=Jonathan |authorlink= |author2=Weiser, Philip J. |year=2005 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn= |page=232 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the spectrum is licensed to bidders, its purchase does not entail ownership or rights but the privilege of using that portion of the spectrum.

== Process ==
The process of obtaining a new broadcast license may be lengthy. A [[broadcast engineer]] first determines an available frequency, which may be unavailable in a crowded [[media market]] (such as a [[metropolitan area]]). If a frequency is available, an engineering study is submitted with an application to the broadcasting authority, to demonstrate that the licensee will not cause [[RF interference]] to existing stations. There is a limited term for the license, once acquired. According to the United States Government Printing Office in 1997, the term could exceed 8 years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-02-05/pdf/97-2755.pdf|title=United States Government Printing Office Broadcast License Terms|author=|date=|website=gpo.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this has been shortened to five years or less (depending on whether the FCC requires further evaluation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=license|title=The Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television|author=|date=|website=www.museum.tv|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[construction permit]] is first issued, with the license receiving approval when the station certifies that the permit has been executed (after testing to ensure that all parameters are within allowable [[tolerance (engineering)|tolerance]]s). Once a facility is built and operational, it may be allowed to operate under [[program test authority]] until the license is issued (or denied). Where a station is close to an [[international border]], a license may also need to be approved by the foreign country's broadcasting authority for [[frequency coordination]]. This is done even if the border is outside of a station's [[computer modeling|predicted]] [[broadcast range]], since [[radio propagation]] sometimes causes stations to be heard outside their service area.

Existing stations apply for permits and license amendments when making changes to their facilities (such as relocation to another site, changing the [[radio antenna]] [[HAAT|height]], making changes to a [[directional antenna]]'s [[radiation pattern]], or when adding—or converting to—[[digital broadcasting]]). Other situations (such as a change in the [[city of license]]) are covered in [[rulemaking]] [[proceeding]]s in the U.S., which may be a prerequisite to moving a station a significant distance (leaving its original community outside its new coverage area). Temporary situations are covered by [[special temporary authority]] (STA) to operate at a variance from the license or permit or a [[Restricted Service Licence]] (RSL) to operate for a fixed period at reduced power. While these are FCC and [[Ofcom]] terms, respectively, other countries have similar regulations.

In the U.S., court cases can prolong the process when [[mutually exclusive]] applications are received. The FCC opens application window periods of about a week. Some applications have been pending for years; others end up in [[administrative law]] courts or [[arbitration]], sometimes with one applicant seeking a [[buyout]] of another.

== Technical specifications ==
Management of technical [[specification]]s (such as those in [[broadcast television systems]]) is normally undertaken as a part of broadcast licensing in each country. [[Radio band]]s carry [[radio signal|signals]] (such as [[video]] and [[Audio signal|audio]], [[Digital data|digital]] and [[analog signal|analog]], [[narrowband]], [[broadband]] and [[content (media and publishing)|content]]), and are licensed differently.

The broadcast license typically specifies the following minimum information:
*[[Geographic coordinate]]s, with exact [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]
*[[Carrier frequency]] and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]
*[[Modulation]] type[s]
*[[Effective radiated power]] (ERP)
*[[Height above average terrain]] (HAAT)
*[[Directional antenna]] [[radiation pattern]], specified at several [[azimuth]]s

Additionally, it often specifies:
*Operating hours (for [[mediumwave]] and [[shortwave]])
*[[Transmitter power output]] (TPO) (before any [[attenuation]] or [[gain (electronics)|gain]])
*[[Broadcast auxiliary service]]s (BAS) linking studio and transmitter sites
*[[Radio antenna|Antenna]] brand and model
*Height [[above mean sea level]] (AMSL) and above ground level (AGL)
*Backup facilities (which may have separate licenses)
*Additional service authorizations ([[subcarrier]]s, [[digital radio]])

Some countries (such as the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] in [[Canada]]) specify [[radio format]] or the [[genre]] of [[television programming]], to ensure diversity. Community stations (such as [[class A television service]] and [[LPFM]] stations in the U.S.) may be required to broadcast local content each week. U.S. [[broadcast translator]] licenses ''prohibit'' local content on FM, while [[LPTV]] stations can choose, except those tied to a DTV station as a fill-in translator or booster to overcome the shortcomings of the [[ATSC]] system mandated by the FCC. 

==Sharing==
In some cases, two stations may share the same frequency in the same area, or even the same facility.  [[Time sharing]] has on occasion been used when two applicants have an equal number of points, mainly with LPFM stations.  In [[FCC auction 1000]] for the 600MHz band, TV stations were paid to leave the air in crowded markets (to facilitate repacking of stations on [[TV channel]]s 38 to 51 into those already using 2 to 36), but are allowed to move the license to another existing station, keeping their [[virtual channel]] numbers and [[must-carry]] rights.  Each licensee is responsible for the content on their own channels, while both are jointly responsible for the technical operation of the transmitter, antenna, and tower.

In the [[city of New York]], 89.1 MHz is reserved for the [[United Nations]]; however, it is used instead by [[WNYU-FM]] and [[WNYU-FM1]], unless the U.N. should ever apply to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?city=new+york&amp;freq=89.1&amp;fre2=89.1&amp;list=1&amp;size=10|title=FM Query Results -- Audio Division (FCC) USA|author=|date=|website=www.fcc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewal ==
Licensing requirements differ for [[public radio]] and [[public television|television]] and for [[community radio]] and [[community television|television]] compared to commercial applicants. Licensees must be aware of deadlines, from original application to renewal, which vary by state&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/localism/renewals.html Federal Communications Commission Broadcast License Renewal Filing &amp; Expiration Dates] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408094705/http://www.fcc.gov/localism/renewals.html |date=April 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/video/renewal.html|title=Federal Communications Commission License Renewal Applications for Television Broadcast Stations|author=|date=|website=fcc.gov|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and include license expiration and dates for renewals. The form for renewal of a broadcast license in the United States is FCC Form 303-S. While the Form 303-S License Application consists of yes-or-no questions and certifications, the process of renewing the license is complex; the FCC requires that licensees certify that they were in compliance with all rules and regulations during the prior license term. If a license has been acquired in the middle of a term, the licensee will be evaluated from that point to the end of the license term. Misrepresentation to the FCC may lead to the loss of a license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwt.com/LearningCenter/Advisories?find=406501|title=Preparing for Radio Station FCC License Renewals  - Advisories &amp; Blogs - Davis Wright Tremaine|author=|date=|website=www.dwt.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charitable incorporated organisation''' ('''CIO''') is a new form of [[Incorporation (business)|legal entity]] designed for [[non-profit organisation]]s in the [[United Kingdom]].

The main intended benefits of the new entity are that it has [[legal personality]], the ability to conduct business in its own name, and [[limited liability]] so that its members and [[trustee]]s will not have to contribute in the event of financial loss. These are already available to [[limited companies]]; charities can be formed as companies, but then they must be registered with both [[Companies House]] and the [[Charity Commission]]. In contrast, the CIO only needs to register with the Charity Commission. This is expected to reduce [[red tape|bureaucracy]] for the charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shrifin |first=Tash |title=Q&amp;A: what's in the draft charities bill |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jun/02/charityreform.charities |accessdate=14 October 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIO status became available to charities in England and Wales on 4 March 2013. In Scotland, the [[Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]] began registering '''Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations''' ('''SCIO'''s) in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Scottish Charitable Incorporated Organisations (SCIOs) |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/People/15300/charities/SCIOs |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea originated with the Chief Executive of the [[National Council for Voluntary Organisations]] (NCVO), Judy Weleminsky, in 1992 and was taken forward by Lindsay Driscoll who was the Head of Legal and Governance at NCVO. A Charity Commission advisory group was set up in 2000 to look at incorporation of charities, and recommended a new form of legal entity. In 2001 the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]]'s company law review steering group likewise recommended a ''charitable incorporated organisation'' with a separate legal regime, as [[company law]] is aimed at the commercial sector, with [[corporate governance]] structured around the assumption that members of a company have a financial interest in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCurry|first=Patrick|title=New guidelines to benefit the voluntary sector|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/sep/19/charityfinance1|accessdate=14 October 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary legislation to introduce the CIO as a new legal form of incorporation was included in the Charities Bill in 2004, and this aspect of the Bill was particularly welcomed by charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=FitzHerbert|first=Luke|title=All to play for|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/dec/21/politics.charityreform|accessdate=14 October 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was finally enacted in the [[Charities Act 2006]]. 

The Charity Commission opened a consultation on draft documentation and regulations in 2008, raising a large number of difficulties and suggested improvements.&lt;ref name=cs1/&gt; 

The Scottish regulator began registering SCIOs in April 2011,&lt;ref name=cs1&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Tania|title=Charitable Incorporated Organisation delayed until next year|url=http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/governance/news/content/10681/charitable_incorporated_organisation_delayed_until_next_year|accessdate=14 October 2011|newspaper=Civil Society|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a fifth of new Scottish charities registered by December of that year were SCIOs. 
To spread the workload for the regulator, existing charitable companies and [[industrial and provident society|industrial and provident societies]] were unable to convert to SCIOs until 2012; other forms of charity in Scotland were able to apply from April 2011. Implementation in England and Wales is likewise being phased, starting in January 2013 with brand new charities, followed by conversions of existing unincorporated charities according to income, to be followed by charitable companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oscr.org.uk/about-scottish-charities/scio/ Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator]. Retrieved 14 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cs2&gt;{{cite news|title=Hurd takes CIO legislation to Parliament|url=http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/news/content/13680/hurd_takes_cio_legislation_to_parliament|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=Civil Society|date=31 October 2012|first=Niki May|last=Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Charity Commission in England and Wales began publishing guidance in May 2011.  On 4 March 2013, for the first time, the Commission enabled an existing charity, Challenge to Change, to convert from a charitable trust to a CIO.&lt;ref name="Challenge"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/challenge-change-first-existing-charity-use-cio-legal-form/governance/article/1173316 | title=Challenge to Change is the first existing charity to use CIO legal form | work=Third Sector | date=5 March 2013 | accessdate=17 November 2014 | author=Ricketts, Andy}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later reported some difficulties in transferring assets and long-term grant agreements to the new legal entity and subsequently closed due to reduced levels of funding.&lt;ref name="Challenge to Change"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.challengetochange.org/ | title=Closure of Challenge to Change | publisher=Challenge to Change | date=5 December 2014 | accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another charity converted but then reverted to its old status because of the cost and inconvenience of changing its registration number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Mason|first=Tania| url=https://www.civilsociety.co.uk/news/new-cio-applies-to-revert-to-charity-structure.html |title=New CIO applies to revert to charity status |newspaper=Civil Society |date=31 May 2013 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

A '''charity regulator'''  is a [[Regulatory agency]] that regulate the charitable sectors in their respective jurisdictions. They can also be referred to as commissions, although that term can also refer specifically to the non-tax policy regulation of charities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icnl.org/research/journal/vol12iss3/art_3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

They take various forms, from small teams within taxation departments to standalone bodies.

The '''Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations 1980''', or the "Rome Convention", is a measure in [[private international law]] or [[conflict of laws]] which creates a common choice of law system in contracts within the [[European Union]]. The convention determines which law should be used, but does not harmonise the substance (the actual law). It was signed in [[Rome]], [[Italy]] on 19 June 1980 and entered into force in 1991.

It has now been replaced by the [[Rome I Regulation]] (593/2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008R0593:EN:NOT 593/2008]&lt;/ref&gt; except for in [[Denmark]], which has an [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]] from implementing regulations under the [[area of freedom, security and justice]], and the [[Special member state territories and the European Union#Overseas countries and territories|Overseas countries and territories]] of European Union member states. In that respect, the convention is applicable in Aruba, the Caribbean Netherlands, Curaçao, Sint Maarten (Kingdom of the Netherlands), Faroer (Denmark), Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Saint Barthélemy, French Polynesia, Wallis and Futuna and New Caledonia (France).&lt;ref name=depositary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/agreements-conventions/agreement/?aid=1988024|title=Agreement details|accessdate=31 March 2013|work=Council of the European Union}}&lt;br&gt;for France, see Article 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the convention==
{{Conflict of laws}}
Under Article 1, the Convention's rules are to apply to all [[choice of law]] issues involving contractual obligations and, under Article 10, once selected, the ''[[lex causae]]'' will govern:
:(a) interpretation;
:(b) performance but, in relation to the manner of performance and the steps to be taken in the event of defective performance, regard shall be had to the ''[[lex loci solutionis]]'', i.e. law of the place in which performance takes place;
:(c) within the limits of the powers conferred on the forum [[court]] by its [[procedure (conflict)|procedural]] law, the consequences of breach, including the assessment of [[damages]] in so far as it is governed by rules of law;
:(d) the various ways of extinguishing obligations, and the [[statute of limitations|limitation]] of actions; and
:(e) the consequences of nullity of the contract.
Article 15 excludes the operation of [[renvoi]]. In addition, a number of issues with a separate [[characterisation (conflict)|characterisation]] are excluded, namely:
*the [[status (law)|status]] or [[capacity (law)|capacity]] of [[natural person]]s. Article 11 covers the situation where two persons physically present in the same [[Sovereign state|state]] make a contract, and both parties have capacity under the ''[[lex loci contractus]]''. One party cannot invoke incapacity under another law unless the other party was aware of this incapacity at the time the contract was made or was not aware of the incapacity as a result of [[negligence]].
*contractual obligations relating to [[succession (conflict)|succession]] and all rights claimed in property in a [[marriage (conflict)|marriage]] or family relationship, particularly where the question of the entitlement of any [[child]] who is [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] is raised.
*obligations arising under [[negotiable instrument]]s including bills of exchange, [[cheque]]s, and [[promissory note]]s and connected to their negotiable character;
*[[arbitration]] agreements and agreements on the choice of court (see [[arbitration clause]]s and [[forum selection clause]]s);
*questions governed by the law of [[company (law)|companies]] and other bodies [[corporation|corporate]] or [[business entity|unincorporate]] such as the creation, by registration or otherwise, legal capacity, internal organisation or winding up of companies and other bodies corporate or unincorporate, and the personal liability of officers and members for the obligations of the company or body;
*the question whether an [[agent (law)|agent]] is able to bind a [[principal (commercial law)|principal]], or an organ to bind a company or body corporate or unincorporate, to a third party;
*the constitution of trusts and the relationship between settlors, [[trustee]]s and [[beneficiary|beneficiaries]] (see [[trusts (conflict)]]);
*[[evidence (law)|evidence]] and procedure save that, under Article 14, the Applicable Law applies to the extent that it contains, in the law of contract, rules which raise presumptions of law or determine the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]]. Thus, under Article 14 (2) a contract or an act intended to have legal effect may be proved by any mode of proof recognised by the ''[[lex fori]]'' or by any of the laws referred to in Article 9 under which that contract or act is formally valid, provided that such mode of proof can be administered by the forum court.
*the question of whether a contracts of [[insurance]] covers a [[risk]] situated in the territories of one of the [[Member States]] is determined under the municipal law of the relevant states. This exclusion does not apply to contracts of [[reinsurance]].

==The uniform rules==

===Express selection===
Article 3 states the general rule that the parties to a contract have freedom of choice over the applicable law. To exercise this choice either express words may be used or the intention should be demonstrated with reasonable certainty by the terms of the contract or the circumstances of the case.

The law chosen may apply to the whole or only a part of the contract, and the choice is not irrevocable. The parties can at any time agree to change the applicable law and any such variation will not prejudice the formal validity of the agreement nor adversely affect the rights of third parties.

Where all the elements of a contract, at the time of its conclusion, are connected with only one country, Article 3 may not be used to [[evasion (law)|evade]] the mandatory provisions of that state (Article 3(4)).

To establish a choice demonstrated with reasonable certainty, there must have been a "real choice". That the parties ''would'' have chosen a particular law is not sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;"This Article does not permit the court to infer a choice of law that the parties might have made where they had no clear intention of making such a choice" ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980Y1031(01):EN:HTML Giuliano-Lagarde Report]).&lt;/ref&gt; The court will take into account '''both''' the terms of the contract and the circumstances of the case.&lt;ref&gt;See the examples in the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31980Y1031(01):EN:HTML Guiliano-Lagarde Report].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guiliano-Lagarde Report gives three examples of situations where a real choice may be demonstrated with reasonable certainty:
* '''Standard form contracts''' The report gives as an example a Lloyd's policy of marine insurance.
* '''Jurisdiction and arbitration agreements'''
* '''Course of dealing'''&lt;ref&gt;See further {{cite court

  |vol=1
  |reporter=Lloyd's Rep
  |opinion=380
  |pinpoint=
  |court=
  |date=1996
  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Implied selection===
If there is no express choice, Article 4 provides that the contract shall be governed by the law of the country with which it is most closely connected. If the agreement is severable, two applicable laws may be selected. For these purposes, it is presumed that the contract is most closely connected with the ''lex loci solutionis'', i.e. the law of the place where the contract is to be performed, or the law of the [[habitual residence]] of the person who is to perform, or, in the case of a body corporate or unincorporate, where its central administration is located. However, if it is a commercial or professional contract, the applicable law will be the law of the place in which the principal place of business is situated or, where under the terms of the contract the performance is to be effected through a place of business other than the principal place of business, the country in which that other place of business is situated except that there is a [[rebuttable presumption]]:
:where the subject matter of the agreement is immovable property, the ''[[lex situs]]'' will apply; and
:contracts for the carriage of goods and charter-parties are governed by the law of the place in which, at the time the contract is concluded, the carrier has his principal place of business if that is also the place in which loading or discharge is to occur or the place where the consignor has his or her principal place of business.

===Consumer contracts===
Article 5 applies to contracts for the supply of goods or services to a [[consumer]] for a non-commercial purpose, or to a contract for the provision of credit for that object. Although Article 3 gives the parties a free choice of law, this choice cannot deprive the consumer of any protections available under the mandatory law of the country in which he has his habitual residence if the consumer was responding to advertising material or a specific invitation and makes the agreement in that country, or if the other party or his agent received the consumer's order in that country, or if the contract is for the sale of goods and the consumer travelled from that country to another country and there gave his order, provided that the consumer's journey was arranged by the seller for the purpose of inducing the consumer to buy. For these purposes, Article 7 defines "mandatory rules" as rules that must be applied whatever the Applicable Law. In deciding whether rules are mandatory in the ''lex fori'' or a law with which the contract has a close connection, regard shall be had to their nature and purpose and to the consequences of their application or non-application.

If the contract is silent on the choice of law, it will be governed by the law of habitual residence if it is entered into in the circumstances described above. But this Article does not apply to:

:(a) a contract of carriage;
:(b) a contract for the supply of services where the services are to be supplied to the consumer exclusively in a country other than that in which he has his habitual residence.

The Article does, however, apply to a contract which, for an inclusive price, provides for a combination of travel and accommodation.

===Contracts of employment===
{{see also|Posted Workers Directive}}
Under Article 6, no choice of law selection contained in a contract of [[employment]] can deprive the [[employee]] of the protection afforded to him by the mandatory laws which would be applicable in the absence of that choice. If there is no express selection, an employment contract is governed,

{{quote|(a) by the law of the country in which the employee habitually carries out his work in performance of the contract, even if he is temporarily employed in another country; or

(b) if the employee does not habitually carry out his work in any one country, by the law of the country in which the place of business through which he was engaged is situated;

unless it appears from the circumstances as a whole that the contract is more closely connected with another country, in which case the contract shall be governed by the law of that country.}}

The provisions may only apply for the benefit of the employee.

===Material validity===
Under Article 8, the material validity of a contract, or of any term in a contract, shall be determined by the law which would govern it under the Convention if the contract or term were valid (i.e. the putative Applicable Law). But, if this would produce an obviously unfair result, a party may rely upon the law of the place of habitual residence to establish that he did not give a free consent.

===Formal validity===
Under Article 9, a contract concluded between persons who are in the same country is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of either the Applicable Law or the law of the country where it is concluded. A contract concluded between persons who are in different countries is formally valid if it satisfies the formal requirements of either the Applicable Law or the law of one of those countries. Where a contract is concluded by an agent, the country in which the agent acts is the relevant country for the purposes of the earlier tests. But a contract relating to immovable property is always subject to the mandatory provisions of the ''lex situs''.

===Transfers of obligation===
Article 12 deals with a voluntary [[assignment (law)|assignment]] or [[novation]]. Whether the rights and/or obligations can be transferred, the nature of the relationship between the assignee and the debtor that results from a transfer, the conditions under which the assignment can be invoked against the debtor, and any question whether the debtor's obligations have been discharged, are determined by the Applicable Law of the original agreement. The Applicable Law of the transfer will determine the mutual obligations of assignor and assignee as against the third party, i.e. "the debtor". Article 13 deals with [[subrogation]] so that whether a third person may enforce an existing liability owed to a "creditor" by a "debtor" is determined by reference to the law which governs the debtor's duty to satisfy the creditor.

===Ordre public===
Under Article 16, the forum court may invoke its own [[public policy (law)|public policy]] as a justification for refusing to apply the ''lex causae''.

===Composite or federated states===
Under Article 19, where the choice of law rules point to a country with more than one legal system, the Convention selects the most appropriate municipal law (not the choice of law rules of that law given that renvoi is excluded).

==Signature, ratification and amendment==
The convention was signed by Belgium, Germany, France, Ireland and Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 19 June 1980, followed by Denmark and the United Kingdom in 1981, thus covering all members of the [[European Communities]]. It entered into force in 1991 for 8 of those countries and one year later for Ireland. During the enlargement of the Communities with Greece (1984), Spain and Portugal (1992) and Sweden, Finland and Austria (1996), and the 10 countries in 2004, treaties were concluded on the extension of the convention to those countries. Those Extension conventions were however not all ratified by the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland and thus which hampered entry into force of the convention between those three countries and the acceding countries. With the accession of Romania and Bulgaria, the council of the European Union was empowered to effect the accession to the treaty, which took place in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2007:347:0001:0002:EN:PDF|title=concerning the accession of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the Convention on the Law applicable to Contractual Obligations, opened for signature in Rome on 19 June 1980|accessdate=30 March 2013|work=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fixed fire monitor.jpg|thumb|Fixed fire monitor at a plastic manufacturing factory]]

A '''deluge gun''', '''fire monitor''', '''master stream''' or '''deck gun''' is an aimable controllable high-capacity water jet used for manual [[firefighting]] or automatic [[fire protection]] systems. Deluge guns are often designed to accommodate foam which has been injected in the upstream piping. 

== Background ==
[[File:grfd392monitor.jpg|thumb|A Great River Fire Department Engine demonstrating its deluge gun.]]
[[File:A Boston fireboat -a.jpg|thumb|The Boston fireboat ''Firefighter'' shows off its fire monitors.]]
The term ''monitor'' may be derived from the class of warships [[Monitor (warship)|known by the same name]], that were armed with disproportionately large guns.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Installation==
Deluge guns are often fitted to [[fire boat]]s, [[tug boat]]s, and on top of large [[fire truck]]s for use in manual firefighting efforts, where they can be aimed and operated by one firefighter and are used to deliver water or foam from outside the immediate area of the fire. Deluge guns are sometimes installed in fixed fire protection systems to protect high hazards, such as aviation hangars and helicopter landing pads. Similarly, facilities with highly flammable material such as [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] may have permanently installed deluge guns. Most apparatus-mounted deluge guns can be directed by a single firefighter, compared to a standard fire hose which normally requires several. Deluge guns can be automatically positioned for fixed systems, or may have portable designs. The latter option enables a firefighter to set up the gun to apply water to a blaze, before leaving it in place to attend to other tasks.

==Capacity ==
{{technical|date=August 2016}}
A deluge gun can discharge 2,000 US gallons (7,600 liters) per minute, or more. A '''master stream''' is a [[fire service]] term for a water stream of 350 US gallons (1,300 liters) per minute or greater. It is delivered by a '''master stream device''', such as a deck gun, deluge gun, or fire monitor. Master streams are often found at the end of [[Turntable ladder|aerial ladders]], tele-squirt nozzles, or monitor nozzles.  The high pressure that they require renders them unsuitable for handline use.

==Risks==
A master stream brings with it many risks when used in an urban setting. A master stream should never be fired into a building with people inside, as the force could knock down a supporting wall in a structure and crush victims. Also, the steam resulting from the high volume of water delivered could cause a [[Explosion|blowout]] or displace oxygen from an enclosed area, creating a risk of [[asphyxiation]].

'''Energy monitoring and targeting''' (M&amp;T) is an energy efficiency technique based on the standard [[management]] axiom stating that “you cannot manage what you cannot measure”. M&amp;T techniques provide [[Energy engineering|energy manager]]s with feedback on operating practices, results of energy management projects, and guidance on the level of energy use that is expected in a certain period. Importantly, they also give early warning of unexpected excess consumption caused by equipment malfunctions, operator error, unwanted user behaviours, lack of effective maintenance and the like.

The foundation of M&amp;T lies in determining the normal relationships of energy consumptions to relevant driving factors (HVAC equipment, production though puts, weather, occupancy available daylight, etc.) and the goal is to help business managers:

* Identify and explain excessive energy use
* Detect instances when consumption is unexpectedly higher or lower than would usually have been the case
* Visualize energy consumption trends (daily, weekly, seasonal, operational…)
* Determine future energy use and costs when planning changes in the business
* Diagnose specific areas of wasted energy
* Observe how changes to relevant driving factors impact energy efficiency
* Develop performance targets for energy management programs
* Manage energy consumption, rather than accept it as a fixed cost

The ultimate goal is to reduce energy costs through improved [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and energy management control. Other benefits generally include increased resource efficiency, improved [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] budgeting and reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.

==History==
M&amp;T is an established technique that was first launched as a national program in the [[UK]] in 1980, and has since then spread throughout Europe. These techniques are now{{When|date=July 2014}} also rapidly growing in America.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Goals and benefits==
Throughout the numerous M&amp;T projects implemented since the 1980s, a certain number of benefits have proved to be recurrent:
* Energy cost savings: generally 5% of the original energy expenses, according to [[The Carbon Trust]]. Carbon Trust has conducted a study over 1000 [[Small Business|small businesses]] and has concluded that on average an organization could save 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced metering for SMEs |url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209000820/https://www.carbontrust.com/media/77244/ctc713_advanced_metering_for_smes.pdf |archivedate=December 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduction in [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions: lower energy consumption helps reduce emissions
* Financing: measured energy reductions help obtain [[grant (money)|grants]] for energy efficiency projects
* Improved product and service costing: [[Utility submeter|sub-metering]] allows the division of the energy bill between the different processes of an [[industry]], and can be calculated as a [[production cost]]
* Improved [[budgeting]]: M&amp;T techniques can help forecast energy expenses in the case of changes in the business, for example
* Waste avoidance: helps diagnose energy waste in any process.

==Technique==

=== Key principles ===
Monitoring and Targeting techniques rely on three main principles, which form a constant [[feedback]] cycle, therefore improving control of energy use.

====Monitoring====
Monitoring [[information]] of energy use, in order to establish a basis for energy management and explain [[deviation (statistics)|deviations]] from an established pattern. Its primary goal is to maintain said pattern, by providing all the necessary data on energy consumption, as well as certain [[driving factors]], as identified during preliminary investigation ([[production, costs, and pricing|production]], weather, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodengineeringmag.com/articles/90655-energy-management-crunching-the-numbers|title=Energy management: crunching the numbers|last=Labs|first=Wayne|date=13 May 2013|publisher=Food Engineering Magazine|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reporting====
The final principle is the one which enables ongoing control of energy use, achievement of targets and verification of savings: reports must be issued to the appropriate managers. This in turn allows [[decision-making]] and actions to be taken in order to achieve the targets, as well as confirmation or denial that the targets have been reached.

===Procedures===
Before the M&amp;T measures themselves are implemented, a few preparatory steps are necessary. First of all, key energy consumers on the site must be identified. Generally, most of the energy consumption is concentrated in a small number of processes, like heating, or certain [[machinery]]. This normally requires a certain survey of the [[building]] and the equipment to estimate their energy consumption level.

It is also necessary to assess what other [[measurements]] will be required to [[analysis|analyze]] the consumption appropriately. This data will be used to [[chart]] against the energy consumption: these are underlying factors which influence the consumption, often [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] (for industry processes) or exterior [[temperature]] (for heating processes), but may include many other variables.

Once all variables to be measured have been established, and the necessary meters installed, it is possible to initiate the M&amp;T procedures.

====Measure====
The first step is to compile the data from the different meters.  Low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. The frequency at which the data is compiled varies according to the desired reporting interval, but can go once every 30 seconds to once every 15 minutes. Some measurements can be taken directly from the meters, others must be calculated. These different measurements are often called streams or channels.

Driving factors such as production or [[degree day]]s also constitute streams and must be collected at intervals to match.

====Define the base-line====
The data compiled must then be plotted on a [[chart|graph]] in order to define the general consumption base-line. Consumption rates are plotted in a [[scatter plot]] against [[production, costs, and pricing|production]] or any other variable previously identified, and the [[best fit line]] is identified. This graph is the image of the business’ average energy performance, and conveys a lot of information:

* The [[y-intercept]] gives the minimal consumption in the absence of the variable (no [[production, costs, and pricing|production]], zero [[degree-day]]...). This is the base load of the system, the minimal consumption when it is not operating.
* The [[slope]] represents the relationship between the consumption and the previously identified [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]. This represents the efficiency of the process.
* The scatter is the degree of variability of the consumption with operational factors.
The [[slope]] is not used quite as often for M&amp;T purposes. However, a high [[y-intercept]] can mean that there is a fault in the process, causing it to use too much energy with no performance, unless there are specific distinctive features which lead to high base loads. Very scattered points, on the other hand, may reflect other significant factors playing in the variation of the energy consumption, other than the one plotted in the first place, but it can also be the illustration of a lack of control over the process.

====Monitor variations====
The next step is to monitor the difference between the expected consumption and the actual measured consumption. One of the tools most commonly used for this is the [[control chart|CUSUM]], which is the CUmulative SUM of differences. This consists in first calculating the difference between the expected and actual performances (the [[best fit line]] previously identified and the points themselves).

The [[CUSUM]] can then be plotted against time on a new [[chart|graph]], which then yields more information for the energy efficiency specialist. [[Variance]]s scattered around zero usually mean that the process is operating normally. Marked variations, increasing or decreasing steadily usually reflect a modification in the conditions of the process.

[[Image:CUSUM graph.jpg|right|Example of a CUSUM graph]]In the case of the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph, the [[slope]] becomes very important, as it is the main indicator of the [[savings]] achieved. A [[slope]] going steadily down indicates steady [[savings]]. Any variation in the [[slope]] indicates a change in the process. For example, in the graph on the right, the first section indicated no [[savings]]. However, in September (beginning of the yellow line), an energy efficiency measure must have been implemented, as [[savings]] start to occur. The green line indicates an increase in the [[savings]] (as the [[slope]] is becoming steeper), whereas the red line must reflect a modification in the process having occurred in November, as [[savings]] have decreased slightly.

====Identify causes====
Energy efficiency specialists, in collaboration with building [[managers]], will decipher the [[control chart|CUSUM]] graph and identify the causes leading to variations in the consumption. This can be a change in [[behaviour]], a modification to the process, different exterior conditions, etc. These changes must be monitored and the causes identified in order to promote and enhance good behaviour, and discourage bad ones.

====Set targets====
Once the base line has been established, and causes for variations in energy consumption have been identified, it is time to set targets for the future. Now with all this information in hand, the targets are more realistic, as they are based on the building’s actual consumption.
Targeting consists in two main parts: the measure to which the consumption can be reduced, and the [[timeframe]] during which the compression will be achieved.

A good initial target is the [[best fit line]] identified during step 2. This line represents the [[average]] historical performance. Therefore, keeping all consumption below or equal to the historical average is an achievable target, yet remains a challenge as it involves eliminating high consumption peaks.

Some companies, as they improve their energy consumption, might even decide to bring their [[average]] performance down to their historical best. This is considered a much more challenging target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logicenergy.com/live-energy-monitoring/building-energy-use/case-studies/|title=Building Energy Generation &amp; Usage|work=Case Studies|publisher=Logic Energy|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monitor results====
This brings us back to step 1: measure consumption. One of the specificities of M&amp;T is that it is an ongoing process, requiring constant [[feedback]] in order to consistently improve performance. Once the targets are set and the desired measures are implemented, repeating the procedure from the start ensures that the managers are aware of the success or failure of the measures, and can then decide on further action.

===Examples===
An example with some features of an M&amp;T application is the [[ASU Campus Metabolism]], which provides real-time and historic energy use and generation data for facilities of [[Arizona State University]] on a public web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/|title=DGLux5 by DGLogik|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many utilities also offer customers electric interval data monitoring services. [[Xcel Energy]] is an example of an investor owned utility that offers its customer electric and natural gas monitoring services under the product name InfoWise from Xcel Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is administered by Power TakeOff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.PowerTakeOff.com|title=PowerTakeOff – EMIS Behavioral Programming|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a third party partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xcelenergy.com/infowise/|title=InfoWise from Xcel Energy - Xcel Energy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

'''Evasion''' in [[law]], is a fundamental [[public policy (law)|public policy]] doctrine, which exists also in the [[conflict of laws]].

==Definition==
Although one may legitimately plan affairs to avoid the incidence of obligations or liabilities imposed by the law, but no one may evade the operation of otherwise-mandatory provisions if duties and liabilities have been properly imposed or incurred.

It is a standard doctrine in most [[jurisdiction]]s: in [[France]], it is termed, ''fraude à la loi'', in [[Spain]], ''fraude de ley'', in [[Italy]], ''violazione di norme di legge'', in [[Germany]], ''Rechtswidrige Umgehung eines Gesetzes''. It reflects the need for [[government]]s to prevent their [[citizen]]s from intentionally and improperly manipulating their behaviour to prevent mandatory provisions in the law from applying to them. As the translated names necessarily imply, the key is an intention to displace the normal operation of the legal system.

Sometimes, that intention is express. On other occasions, it is for the courts to decide whether a sufficient intention can be imputed. Once the intention is established, the evasive manoeuvre is void, and the normal legal provisions will apply to the parties.

==Taxation==
Almost all [[state (polity)|states]] operate a collection system for [[taxation]] revenues within a framework of law that is enforced by independent [[court]]s. Enabling [[statute]]s must be strictly applied, and it is generally against public policy to allow the tax administration to agree to reduce the amount of tax payable by any individual. Like [[criminal law]] in which agreements by the policing authorities to exempt a criminal are prohibited, tax law has a special status as being essential to an organised society in maintaining public trust through the policy of equal treatment in the legal system.

Nevertheless, a taxpayer who organises affairs to exploit a loophole in the law to avoid the incidence of tax liability will usually be permitted to do so. It is not for the courts to legislate and plug the gaps left by the legislature.

The test of avoidance is whether there is a legitimate purpose for the given behaviour. Many states adopt a "business purpose" test, by decomposing the transaction into its component steps to determine the true purpose of the transaction(s) (see [[tax avoidance]]).

==Family law==
In [[Family law]], the citizens of any state may not be allowed to evade rules like those on [[marriage]] by blood relatives or by persons of the same biological sex only by travelling to and going through a ceremony in a state that allows them. The policies underpinning such laws are so fundamental to the [[culture]] of a state that they acquire mandatory status (see [[nullity (conflict)|nullity]]). The same applies to [[divorce (conflict)|divorce]].

An early case in [[France]] (under the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law system]]), known as the ''Princess Bauffremont Affair'' decided by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] in 1878 [Civ. 18 mars 1878, S.78.1.193 (note Labbé)] saw the princess obtain [[citizenship]] in [[Germany]] to obtain a divorce there and then remarry. She returned to France where she attempted to re-establish herself. Because the divorce was not recognised in France, her remarriage was declared null as a ''fraude à la loi''.

==Contract law==
In [[Contract law]], as an exception to the principle of autonomy implicit in the policy of [[freedom of contract]], the parties cannot agree to a voluntary agreement to evade obligations imposed by law or to prevent the courts from taking jurisdiction if a dispute arises.

Also, the courts will examine the entire context for any series of transactions that seeks to avoid the operation of law. Hence, if it is illegal to export particular goods from X to A, such a law cannot be evaded by entering into back-to-back agreements to export the goods first to Y and then to A.

Some laws are so fundamental that they can never be evaded. Thus, even though the contracts might be perfectly legal, they would be denied enforcement if the effect would be against public policy, such as the following: 
*protection from unreasonable [[restraint of trade|restraints of trade]], such as [[non-compete clause|agreements not to compete]] after terminating [[employment]] or selling a business must allow individuals a reasonable opportunity to earn a living.
*protection of family relationships: an agreement relating to the custody of a child and maintenance cannot exclude the power of a court to examine its terms and to judge whether it is in the best interests of the child.
*Prevention of the enforcement of contracts:
::involving commission of a [[tort]] or crime;
::inducing breach of fiduciary duties;
::inducing a breach in a contract with a third party;
::disclaiming liability for harm caused intentionally, recklessly or negligently (including liability for any misrepresentation). Liability for personal injuries arising from the use of products can be disclaimed only in rare circumstances (for example, if two merchants fairly bargain for it, and the product is experimental).
::involving the waiver or release of entrenched rights: in the [[United States]], the release of rights granted by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, 29 U.S.C. § 621 will not be effective even if supported by [[consideration]], except under the Older Workers Benefit Protection Acta.

==Conflict of laws==
At either the [[characterisation (conflict)|characterisation]] or the [[choice of law]] stage, the most usual manipulation involves the way in which the connecting factors are pleaded as between the ''[[lex fori]]'' and the ''[[lex loci]]'' so that inconvenient local laws are evaded in favour of a "foreign" law.

==Detection==
Under US [[Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act]], it is illegal to operate or embark in a submersible vessel or semi-submersible vessel without nationality on an international voyage&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|110|407}}, §101&lt;/ref&gt; with the intent to evade detection.&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2285}}(a)&lt;/ref&gt; That is curious because one of the required proofs of nationality is the documents issued under the 1958 [[Convention on the High Seas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|18|2285}}(d)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; a convention, which Congress has never acknowledged by ratifying&lt;ref name=rufe&gt;Roger Rufe, President of the Ocean Conservancy. [http://foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2003/RufeTestimony031021.pdf Statement before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, October 21, 2003].&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''HTTPS Everywhere''' is a [[Free and open-source software|free and open-source]] [[browser extension]] for [[Google Chrome]], [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Brave (web browser)|Brave]], and [[Firefox for Android]], which is developed collaboratively by [[The Tor Project, Inc|The Tor Project]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere|title=HTTPS Everywhere|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It automatically makes [[Website|websites]] use a more secure [[HTTPS]] connection instead of [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], if they support it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/news/item/HTTPS-Everywhere-reaches-2-0-comes-to-Chrome-as-beta-1445615.html|title=HTTPS Everywhere reaches 2.0, comes to Chrome as beta|last=|first=|date=29 February 2012|website=[[H-online.com]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The option "Block all HTTP requests" makes it possible to block and unblock all non-HTTPS browser connections with one click.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eff.org/files/Changelog.txt ''HTTPS Everywhere'' Changelog] (englisch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
HTTPS Everywhere was inspired by [[Google]]'s increased use of HTTPS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Automatic-web-encryption-almost-everywhere-1025472.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623004449/http://www.h-online.com/open/news/item/Automatic-web-encryption-almost-everywhere-1025472.html|title=Automatic web encryption (almost) everywhere - The H Open Source: News and Features|publisher=[[H-online.com]]|date=2010-06-18|archivedate=2010-06-23|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is designed to force the usage of HTTPS automatically whenever possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/technology/personaltech/17basics.html?src=me&amp;ref=general|title=New Hacking Tools Pose Bigger Threats to Wi-Fi Users|last=Murphy|first=Kate|date=16 February 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The code, in part, is based on [[NoScript]]'s [[HTTP Strict Transport Security]] implementation, but HTTPS Everywhere is intended to be simpler to use than NoScript's force HTTPS functionality which requires the user to manually add websites to a list.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The EFF provides information for users on how to add HTTPS rulesets to HTTPS Everywhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/rulesets|title=HTTPS Everywhere Rulesets|last=|first=|date=24 January 2014|website=|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and information on which websites support HTTPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/atlas/|title=HTTPS Everywhere Atlas|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Platform support===
A [[Software release life cycle#Open and closed beta|public beta]] of HTTPS Everywhere for Firefox was released in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/firefox-add-on-encrypts-sessions-with-facebook-twitter/|title=Firefox add-on encrypts sessions with Facebook, Twitter|last=Mills|first=Elinor|date=18 June 2010|website=[[CNET]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and version 1.0 was released in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/08/firefox-security-tool-https-everywhere-hits-1-0/|title=Firefox Security Tool HTTPS Everywhere Hits 1.0|author=Gilbertson|first=Scott|date=5 August 2011|website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A beta for Chrome was released in February 2012.&lt;ref name="SSLObservatory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/02/https-everywhere-decentralized-ssl-observatory|title=HTTPS Everywhere &amp; the Decentralized SSL Observatory|last=Eckersley|first=Peter|date=29 February 2012|website=|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a version was released for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/05/firefox-for-android-https-everywhere/|title=Browsing on your Android phone just got safer, thanks to the EFF|last=Brian|first=Matt|date=27 January 2014|website=[[Engadget]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSL Observatory ==
The SSL Observatory is a feature in HTTPS Everywhere introduced in version 2.0.1&lt;ref name="SSLObservatory"/&gt; which analyzes [[public key certificate]]s to determine if [[Certificate authority|certificate authorities]] have been compromised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2620473/encryption/eff-builds-system-to-warn-of-certificate-breaches.html|title=EFF builds system to warn of certificate breaches|last=Lemos|first=Robert|date=21 September 2011|website=[[InfoWorld]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if the user is vulnerable to [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-https-everywhere-web-browser-extension-released/|title=New 'HTTPS Everywhere' Web browser extension released|last=Vaughan|first=Steven J.|date=28 February 2012|website=[[ZDNet]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[ICANN]] [[Security and Stability Advisory Committee]] (SSAC) noted that the [[data set]] used by the SSL Observatory often treated intermediate authorities as different entities, thus inflating the number of certificate authorities. The SSAC criticized SSL Observatory for potentially significantly undercounting internal name certificates, and noted that it used a data set from 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/sac-057-en.pdf|title=1 SSAC Advisory on Internal Name Certificates|last=|first=|date=15 March 2013|website=|publisher=[[ICANN]] Security and Stability Advisory Committee (SSAC)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continual Ruleset Updates ==
The update to Version 2018.4.3, shipped 3 April 2018, introduces the "Continual Ruleset Updates" function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/https-everywhere-now-delivers-new-rulesets-without-upgrading-extension/|title=HTTPS Everywhere Now Delivers New Rulesets Without Upgrading Extension|last=Abrams|first=Lawrence|date=5 April 2018|website=BleepingComputer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To apply up-to-date https-rules, this update function executes one rule-matching within 24 hours. A website called https://www.https-rulesets.org/ was built by the [[Electronic_Frontier_Foundation|EFF]] for this purpose. This automated update function can be disabled in the add-on settings. Prior the update- mechanism there have been ruleset-updates only through app-updates. Even after this feature was implemented there are still bundled rulesets shipped within app-updates.

== Reception ==
Two studies have recommended building in HTTPS Everywhere functionality into Android browsers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|last=Fahl|first=Sascha|display-authors=etal|url=https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/docs/articles/p50.pdf|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20130108040246/http://cs.ucsb.edu/~koc/ns/docs/articles/p50.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-08|title=Why Eve and Mallory love Android: An analysis of Android SSL (in)security|work=Proceedings of the 2012 ACM conference on Computer and communications security|publisher=ACM, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proceedings of the 11th annual international conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services - Mobi ''Sys'' '13|last1=Davis|first1=Benjamin|last2=Chen|first2=Hao|publisher=|isbn=9781450316729|location=|publication-date=June 2013|pages=181–192|chapter=Retro ''Skeleton''|doi=10.1145/2462456.2464462}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Eric Phetteplace described it as "perhaps the best response to [[Firesheep]]-style attacks available for any platform".&lt;ref&gt;Kern, M. Kathleen, and Eric Phetteplace. "Hardening the browser." [[Reference &amp; User Services Quarterly]] 51.3 (2012): 210-214. http://eprints.rclis.org/16837/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Vincent Toubiana and Vincent Verdot pointed out some drawbacks of the HTTPS Everywhere add-on, including that the list of services which support HTTPS needs maintaining, and that some services are redirected to HTTPS even though they are not yet available in HTTPS, not allowing the user of the extension to get to the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|eprint=1108.5864|title=Show Me Your Cookie And I Will Tell You Who You Are|date=2011|last1=Toubiana|first1=Vincent|last2=Verdot|first2=Vincent|class=cs.CR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2554">The '''Hart–Fuller debate''' is an exchange between [[Lon Fuller]] and [[H. L. A. Hart]] published in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' in 1958 on morality and law, which demonstrated the divide between the [[Legal positivism|positivist]] and [[natural law]] philosophy. Hart took the positivist view in arguing that morality and law were separate. Fuller's reply argued for morality as the source of law's binding power.

==Philosophy==
Positivists believe in a separation between the law as it is and the law as it should be.  Legal rights and moral rights are not related, beyond mere coincidence. Hart believes the method of deciding cases through logic or deduction is not necessarily wrong, just as it is not necessarily right to decide cases according to social or moral aims.  Hart uses the problem of "the core and the penumbra" to illustrate the idea that laws must be related to the meaning of the words, not any natural or moral belief.  A "core" case would be one that the statute is intended to cover.  In the classic example, a statute that bans vehicles from a park is obviously intended to cover cars. A "penumbra" case would be one not considered by the creators of the law, such as a skateboard in the example above.  A judge interpreting such a law from a positivist viewpoint would look to a definition of the words in the statute. The natural law view believes that the creation of law should be based on natural laws or common morals

In '''''Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc.''''', 32 N.J. 358, 161 A.2d 69 (N.J. 1960), the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] held that an automobile manufacturer's attempt to use an express warranty that disclaimed an [[implied warranty of merchantability]] was invalid.

== Facts ==
On May 7, 1955, Mr. Claus H. Henningsen purchased a [[Plymouth automobile|Plymouth]] automobile, manufactured by [[Chrysler Corporation]], from Bloomfield Motors, Inc. The automobile was intended as a [[Mother's Day]] gift to his wife, Helen, and the purchase was executed solely by Mr. Henningsen.

The contract for sale was a one-page form and contained paragraphs in various type sizes on the front and back of the form. Mr. Henningsen testified he did not read all paragraphs of the contract. The back of the contract contained the following clause:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The manufacturer warrants each new motor vehicle (including original equipment placed thereon by the manufacturer except tires), chassis or parts manufactured by it to be free from defects in material or workmanship under normal use and service. Its obligation under this warranty being limited to making good at its factory any part or parts thereof which shall, within ninety (90) days after delivery of such vehicle To the original purchaser or before such vehicle has been driven 4,000 miles, whichever event shall first occur, be returned to it with transportation charges prepaid and which its examination shall disclose to its satisfaction to have been thus defective; This warranty being expressly in lieu of all other warranties expressed or implied, and all other obligations or liabilities on its part, and it neither assumes nor authorizes any other person to assume for it any other liability in connection with the sale of its vehicles.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The car was delivered on May 9, 1955. There were no problems with the car until May 19, 1955. On that day, Mrs. Henningsen was driving the car at 20-22&amp;nbsp;mph on a smooth two lane highway. Mrs. Henningsen then heard a loud noise, the steering wheel spun in her hands, and the car suddenly veered and collided with a wall. The car was damaged severely, and declared totaled by the Henningsens' insurance carrier.

The defendants refused to repair the car under warranty since they claimed the express warranty was limited only to repairing the defective parts and that it was not liable for damages caused by defective parts.

== Procedure ==
Mr. and Mrs. Henningsen sued under a theory of negligence and a theory of warranty. The court felt the proof was not sufficient to make out a ''[[prima facie]]'' case of negligence and gave the case to the jury solely on the warranty theory. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs, Mr. and Mrs. Henningsen, against both defendants. The appellate case was argued on December 7, 1959 and was decided on May 9, 1960.

== Holding ==
Automobile purchasers may recover for damages caused by defective parts under an implied warranty of merchantability since automobile manufacturers and dealers may not limit this warranty to replacement of only defective parts as this violates fair dealing and public policy.

== Reasoning ==
Automobiles were sold by the automobile manufacturer to the automobile dealer, who in turn sells them to consumers. Therefore, there is no privity between the automobile manufacturer and the consumer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} While a majority of courts, at this time, hold privity is required for the manufacturer to be liable to the consumer, there is a trend towards eliminating privity as a requirement. It is unjust for the manufacturer to benefit from advertising their product as suitable as a car and profit from this representation, while providing a basic implied warranty that what they are providing matches what they represent they are providing. Therefore, an implied warranty accompanies every car the manufacturer puts into the stream of trade.

The express warranty signed by Mr. Henningsen will apply under contract law even if he did not read all of it. The warranty agreement, which is a standard used by all major automobile manufacturers, seems to disguise the limitations of the warranty coverage. The jury verdict at trial established this disclaimer was not fairly obtained, and, therefore, the disclaimer will not apply to the situation at hand. Therefore, damages under implied warranty will stand.

Further, the contract is one of adhesion and Mr. Henningsen had no chance to bargain on its terms. The defendants took advantage of their relative bargaining power to force unfair disclaimers upon the customer, and since this disclaimer of any warranty except one for replacement of defective parts violates public policy.

== Commentary ==
Some law and economics scholars have criticized this result as it will ultimately raise prices as automobile manufacturers and dealers have to pay for implied warranty costs. This results in an economically inefficient transaction since not all consumers wanted this warranty, but now all consumers are forced to pay for it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

New Jersey courts, attorneys and scholars frequently cite ''Henningsen'' as the landmark case that established strict liability for defective products in the United States. However, the majority of US courts, attorneys, and law professors usually cite ''[[Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.]]'' and the [[Supreme Court of California]] as the source of the doctrine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10027">The [[Norwegian Police Service]] is the civilian [[police]] agency for [[Norway]]. The police service dates to the 13th century when [[lensmann|sheriffs]] were first appointed. The first [[chief of police]] was appointed for [[Trondheim]] in 1686, and [[Oslo]] received a uniformed police corps in 1859. Police districts were introduced in 1894, with the current structure dating from 2003.

==History==
The police force in Norway was established during the 13th century. Originally the 60 to 80 sheriffs (''[[lensmann]]'')  were predominantly used for [[writ of execution]] and to a less degree [[police]] [[Law enforcement agency powers|power]]. In the cities there were originally ''gjaldker'' who had police power. The sheriffs were originally subordinate to the ''sysselmann'', but from the 14th century they instead became subordinate to the ''fogd'' and the number of sheriffs increased. In the cities the police authority was transferred directly to the ''fogd'', known as ''byfogd''. By the mid 17th century there were between 300 and 350 sheriffs. With the introduction of the [[absolute monarchy]] in 1660 and subsequent strengthening of the civil service, the importance of the police increased. The ''fogd'' as such became part of the police structure, with their subordinates, the [[county governor (Norway)|county governors]], received a similar role as that of chief of police. The first chief of police was hired in [[Trondheim]] in 1686, thus creating the first police district, although his jurisdiction only covered the city. Additional chiefs of police were hired in [[Bergen]] in 1692, [[Oslo|Christiania]] (Oslo) in 1744 and [[Christianssand]] in 1776.&lt;ref name=history1&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20002001/stmeld-nr-22-2000-2001-/3/8.html?id=431929 |title=Politireform 2000 Et tryggere samfunn |chapter=3.8 Historikk |date=12 January 2001 |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |language=Norwegian |access-date=17 August 2012 |archive-date=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69ziJdvGz?url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20002001/stmeld-nr-22-2000-2001-/3/8.html?id=431929 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Police constables Norway 1908.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian police constables in 1908]]
From the 19th century deputies were hired in larger areas to assist the sheriffs. Neither the [[Norway in 1814|democratization in 1814]] nor the introduction of municipal councils in 1837 effected the police structure. However, the Ministry of Justice and the Police was created in 1818 and has since had the primary responsibility for organizing the police force. The 19th century saw a large increase in the number of chiefs of police, increasing to sixteen by the middle of the century. Christiana established the country's first uniformed corps of constables from 1859, which gave the force a more unified appearance. Similar structures were soon introduced in many other cities. From 1859 the municipalities would finance the wages of the deputies and constables, which made it difficult for the police to use those forces outside the municipal borders.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt; The first organized education of police officers started in Christiana in 1889.&lt;ref name=phshist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phs.no/no/Om-PHS/Fakta-og-tal/PHS-sin-historie/ |title=Historie |publisher=[[Norwegian Police University College]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=9 November 2010 |archivedate=9 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109012337/http://www.phs.no/no/Om-PHS/Fakta-og-tal/PHS-sin-historie/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''fogd'' position was decided abolished in 1894 and it was decided that some of its tasks would be transferred to the sheriffs.This resulted in 26 new chief of police positions, largely corresponding to the old ''fogderi'' areas. Some received both cities and rural areas, other just rural areas. At the same time the existing police districts were expanded to include the surrounding rural areas. However, the individual ''fogd'' were not removed from office until their natural retirement, leaving some in place until 1919. This removed the difference between the rural and city police forces; however the sheriffs were only subordinate to the chief of police in police matters—in civil matters and administration they remained under the county governors.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt;

The police school was established in 1920&lt;ref name=phshist /&gt; and the Governor of Svalbard was created in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arlov |first=Thor B. |title=A short history of Svalbard |year=1994 |url=http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007032002001 |publisher=[[Norwegian Polar Institute]] |location=Oslo |isbn=82-90307-55-1 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase the police force's flexibility, the municipal funding was cut and replaced with state funding in 1937.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt; Also in 1937 the first two specialty agencies were created, the Police Surveillance Agency (later the Police Security Service) and the [[National Mobile Police Service (Norway)|Mobile Police Service]],&lt;ref name=history2&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20002001/stmeld-nr-22-2000-2001-/3/9.html?id=431932 |title=Politireform 2000 Et tryggere samfunn |chapter=3.9 Organisasjonsutvikling fra 70 årene til i dag |date=12 January 2001 |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |language=Norwegian |access-date=18 August 2012 |archive-date=18 August 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6A0iZysqv?url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20002001/stmeld-nr-22-2000-2001-/3/9.html?id=431932 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the former [[Statspolitiet (1931–1936)|State Police]] was discontinued.

After a border agreement was reached between Norway and the Soviet Union in 1949, the Norwegian Border Commission was established the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grensekom.no/grensekom_boken.pdf |title=Overenkomsten |last=Johanson |first=Bodil B. |publisher=[[Norwegian Border Commission]] |language=Norwegian |page=41 |accessdate=14 August 2007 |archivedate=14 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814011638/http://www.grensekom.no/grensekom_boken.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Investigation Service was established in 1959.&lt;ref name=history2 /&gt; The search and rescue system with two joint coordination centers and sub-centers for each police district was created in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/kilde/jd/bro/2003/0005/ddd/pdfv/183865-infohefte_engelsk.pdf |title=The Norwegian Search and Rescue Service |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |accessdate=18 August 2012 |archivedate=18 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A0MEOr7A?url=http://www.regjeringen.no/upload/kilde/jd/bro/2003/0005/ddd/pdfv/183865-infohefte_engelsk.pdf |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of police districts was nearly constant from 1894 to 2002, although a few have been creased and closed.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt; However, the organization in the various police districts varied considerably, especially in the cities. In particular some cities had the civilian responsibilities undertaken by the municipality. Especially for the public this was confusing, and the police services received a homogenous organization during the 1980s, with the civil tasks being organized as part of the police stations.&lt;ref name=history2 /&gt; Økokrim was established in 1988&lt;ref name=oppgaver&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20042005/stmeld-nr-42-2004-2005-/4.html?id=199272 |title=Politiets rolle og oppgaver |chapter=4 Politiets organisering, oppgaver og oppgaveløsning |date=24 June 2005 |publisher=[[Ministry of Justice and the Police (Norway)|Ministry of Justice and the Police]] |language=Norwegian |access-date=17 August 2012 |archive-date=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69zZZ9HJh?url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/stmeld/20042005/stmeld-nr-42-2004-2005-/4.html?id=199272 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1994 the administrative responsibilities for the sheriff's offices was transferred to police districts.&lt;ref name=history1 /&gt; The police school became a [[university college]] in 1993 and introduced a three-year education; in 1998 a second campus opened in [[Bodø]].&lt;ref name=phshist /&gt; Police Reform 2000 was a major restructuring of the police force.

The '''Indian Evidence Act''',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://devgan.in/iea/|title=Indian Evidence Act, 1872}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally passed in [[India]] by the [[Imperial Legislative Council]] in 1872, during the [[British Raj]], contains a set of rules and allied issues governing admissibility of evidence in the [[India]]n courts of law.

==Importance==

{{Original research|section|date=October 2013}}The enactment and adoption of the Indian Evidence Act was a path-breaking judicial measure introduced in India, which changed the entire system of concepts pertaining to admissibility of evidences in the Indian courts of law. Until then, the rules of evidences were based on the traditional legal systems of different social groups and communities of India and were different for different people depending on caste, community, faith and social position. The Indian Evidence Act introduced a standard set of law applicable to all Indians.

The law is mainly based upon the firm work by Sir [[James Fitzjames Stephen]], who could be called the founding father of this comprehensive piece of legislation.

==The Act==

The Indian Evidence Act, identified as Act no. 1 of 1872,&lt;ref name="test1"&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/keralamedicolegalsociety/the-indian-evidence-act-1872 Kerala Medico-Legal Society] Indian Evidence Act. The Amendment by Act 10 of 2009 is also included&lt;/ref&gt; and called the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has eleven chapters and 167 sections, and came into force 1 September 1872. At that time, India was a part of the [[British Empire]]. Over a period of more than 125 years since its enactment, the Indian Evidence Act has basically retained its original form except certain amendments from time to time.

Amendments:

The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2005

==Applicability==

When India gained [[Partition of India|independence]] on 15 August 1947, the Act continued to be in force throughout the [[Republic of India]] and [[Pakistan]], except the [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/keralamedicolegalsociety/home-1/important-laws-and-rules/short-title-extent-and-commencement&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the Act continues in force in India, but it was repealed in Pakistan in 1984 by the Evidence Order 1984 (also known as the "Qanun-e-Shahadat"). It also applies to all judicial proceedings in the court, including the court martial. However, it does not apply on affidavits and arbitration.

==Contents==
This Act is divided   into three parts and there are 11 chapters in total under this Act.&lt;ref name="test1"/&gt;
;Part 1
Part 1 deals with relevancy of the facts. There are two chapters under this part: the first chapter is a preliminary chapter which introduces to the Evidence Act and the second chapter specifically deals with the relevancy of the facts.

;Part 2
Part 2 consists of chapters from 3 to 6. Chapter 3 deals with facts which need not be proved, chapter 4 deals with oral evidence, chapter 5 deals with documentary evidence and chapter 6 deals with circumstances when documentary evidence has been given preference over the oral evidence.

;Part 3
The last part, that is part 3, consists of chapter 7 to chapter 11. Chapter 7 talks about the burden of proof. Chapter 8 talks about estoppel, chapter 9 talks about witnesses, chapter 10 talks about examination of witnesses, and last chapter which is chapter 11 talks about improper admission and rejection of evidence.

==Indian Evidence Act Classic Classification==
{{Unsourced section|date=July 2016}}
In the Evidence Act All the Provisions can be divided into two Categories
(1) Taking the Evidence (By Court)
(2) Evaluation

In Taking the Evidence Court take the Evidence for the Facts (Either "Issue of Facts" or "Relevant Facts"); The Facts means the things which is said before the court in connection with the matter, The main thing, which is Crime in Criminal and Right etc. in Civil matters are main Issues, So main Issues are known as "Issue of Facts", and the other facts which are Relevant to it are "Relevant Facts".

For those Facts Evidence is Given to the Court by two ways, One is Orally and Second is Documentary (includes Electronic Documents), Oral Evidence mostly suggest the Verbal deposition before the Court (and not other wise), and Which includes oral statement regarding materials too, Documentary Evidence suggest the Documents. So The Evidence Regarding Matter which have number of Facts, for which Evidence by way of oral or Documentary produced before the court for its Evaluation for either one fact or facts. Court by going through those Documentary Evidence and Oral Evidence decide that particular fact and all facts are proved or not, or whether the fact or facts can be presumed to be proved?

In Evaluation as above said by looking into the Oral and Documentary Evidence Court decide whether particular fact is proved or not, or facts are proved or not, In Evaluation there are two concepts to prove facts; One is Prove (Prove, Disprove or Not prove) and Other is Presumption (that fact is proved) (may Presume, Shall presume and Conclusive proof) After going to Oral and Documentary Evidence Court see that whether any fact or facts are proved by looking to such evidence or not? If at all no evidence is given or enough evidence is given for the fact its said fact is 'Not proved'; The second Concept for evaluation is "Presumption" In Evidence many Section suggest these presumptions, Where there is said Facts 'may presume', Court is extremely free to believe it or not and may ask to prove the fact, In 'shall presume' there is more weight given to believe facts but in that too court may ask to give more evidence to prove the facts, Where in any provision it is said that particular fact, or particular fact in particular circumstances must be concluded as "conclusive proof' Court has no liberty then to believe it to be proved.

== Classification of Evidence Act in Four Questions==
Evidence Act may be divided in four questions.
'''Question 1'''      What is the Evidence given of?
'''Answer 1'''        of Facts ("Issue of Facts" or "Relevant Facts")
'''Question 2'''      How the Evidence of such Facts are Given
'''Answer 2'''        The Evidence of Such Facts is Given Either by way of "Oral Evidence" or "Documentary Evidence'
'''Question 3'''      On whom does the Burden of proof lie?
'''Answer 3'''        "Burden of Proof"(of particular fact) or "Onus of proof" (to prove whole case) lies on the [[Prosecution]] incharge
'''Question 4'''      What are the Evaluation of the Facts.
'''Answer 4'''        The Evaluation is "Prove" or "Presumption"(of prove); The fact is either 'proved','disproved', or 'Not proved'; or there may be presumption that proof of facts "may presume', 'shall presume', or 'conclusive proof'.

'''''International Labor Rights Forum v Firestone Tire and Rubber Co''' (2005) was a class-action lawsuit filed by The [[International Labor Rights Forum]] on November 17, 2005, against the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]], on behalf of a group of former child laborers, in [[Liberia]].

The plaintiffs accused the company of knowingly allowing the use of child laborers filing a suit as a result of policies which began when Firestone opened its first plant in Liberia in 1926.

Firestone contends the 1926 agreement as a milestone advancement in the global production of rubber.

The '''Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries''', or '''Jewish exodus from Arab countries''', was the departure, flight, expulsion, evacuation and migration of 850,000 Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/VideoLibrary/Pages/Jewish-refugees-from-Arab-lands.aspx|title=VI- November 30: Commemorating the expulsion of Jews from Arab lands|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group seeks justice for 'forgotten' Jews |first=Warren |last=Hoge |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/world/americas/04iht-nations.4.8182206.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=5 November 2007 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] background, from [[Arab countries|Arab]] and [[Muslim countries]], mainly from 1948 to the early 1970s. The last major [[Exodus of Iran's Jews|migration wave]] took place from Iran in 1979–80, as a consequence of the Islamic Revolution.

A number of small-scale Jewish exoduses began in many Middle Eastern countries early in the 20th century with the only substantial [[aliyah]] coming from Yemen and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Reeva S. Simon, Michael M. Laskier, Sara Reguer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bW7aNxCGDKQC&amp;pg=PA327&amp;lpg=PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times], 2003, p. 327="Before the 1940s only two communities, Yemen and Syria, made substantial aliyah."&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation of Israel]] in 1948, approximately 800,000 Jews were living in lands that now make up the [[Arab world]]. Of these, just under two-thirds lived in the French and Italian-controlled [[North Africa]], 15–20% in the [[Kingdom of Iraq]], approximately 10% in the [[Kingdom of Egypt]] and approximately 7% in the [[Kingdom of Yemen]]. A further 200,000 lived in [[Pahlavi Iran]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]].

The first large-scale exoduses took place in the late 1940s and early 1950s, primarily from Iraq, Yemen and Libya. In these cases over 90% of the Jewish population left, despite the necessity of leaving their property behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aharoni |first=Ada |url=http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/content/w91udxrhc7cf5a86 |title=The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries |journal=Peace Review: A Journal of Social Justice |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |volume=15 |pages=53–60 |ref=harv |issue=1 |doi=10.1080/1040265032000059742 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hundred and sixty thousand Jews from Arab countries immigrated to [[Israel]] between 1948 and 1951, accounting for 56% of the total immigration to the newly founded state.&lt;ref name=colin63/&gt; Following the establishment of the State of Israel, a plan to accommodate 600,000 immigrants over four years, doubling the existing Jewish population, was submitted by the Israeli government to the Knesset.&lt;ref name=hokohen&gt;{{cite book |last=Hakohen |first=Devorah |title=Immigrants in Turmoil: Mass Immigration to Israel and Its Repercussions in the 1950s and After |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=2003 |page=46 |isbn=9780815629696|quote=After independence, the government presented the Knesset with a plan to double the Jewish population within four years.

Opponents in the Jewish Agency and the government of mass immigration argued that there was no justification for organizing large-scale emigration among Jews whose lives were not in danger, particularly when the desire and motivation were not their own.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan, however, encountered mixed reactions; there were those within the Jewish Agency and government who opposed promoting a large-scale emigration movement among Jews whose lives were not in danger.&lt;ref name=hokohen/&gt;

Later waves peaked at different times in different regions over the subsequent decades. The peak of the exodus from Egypt occurred in 1956 following the [[Suez Crisis]]. The exodus from the other North African Arab countries peaked in the 1960s. Lebanon was the only Arab country to see a temporary increase in its Jewish population during this period, due to an influx of Jews from other Arab countries, although by the mid-1970s the Jewish community of Lebanon had also dwindled. Six hundred thousand Jews from Arab and Muslim countries had reached Israel by 1972.&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adi-schwartz.com/israeli-arab-conflict/all-i-wanted-was-justice/|title=All I Wanted was Justice|last=Schwartz|first=Adi|date=4 January 2008|work=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulewitz&gt;Malka Hillel Shulewitz, ''The Forgotten Millions: The Modern Jewish Exodus from Arab Lands'', Continuum 2001, pp. 139 and 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aharoni&gt;Ada Aharoni [http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm "The Forced Migration of Jews from Arab Countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213230126/http://www.hsje.org/forcedmigration.htm |date=13 February 2012 }}, Historical Society of Jews from Egypt website.

Some lived comfortably and securely in Arab lands; others suffered from fear and oppression.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When presenting the history, those who view the Jewish exodus as analogous to the [[1948 Palestinian exodus]] generally emphasize the push factors and consider those who left as refugees, while those who do not, emphasize the pull factors and consider them willing immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palestineremembered.com/Articles/General/Story2127.html|title=THE FORGOTTEN REFUGEES: the causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries By Philip Mendes - Palestine Remembered|website=www.palestineremembered.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|History of the Jews under Muslim rule}}
At the time of the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, ancient Jewish communities had existed in many parts of the Middle East and North Africa since Antiquity. [[History of the Jews under Muslim rule|Jews under Islamic rule]] were given the status of [[dhimmi]], along with certain other pre-Islamic religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Bat Ye'or (1985), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; As such, these groups were accorded certain rights as "[[People of the Book]]".

During [[Christian persecution of Jews|waves of persecution in Medieval Europe]], many Jews found refuge in Muslim lands,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; though in other times and places, Jews fled persecution in Muslim lands and found refuge in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1984 p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhambra Decree|Jews expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] were [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire#Influx of Sephardi Jews from Iberia|invited to settle]] in various parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they would often form a prosperous [[model minority]] of [[History of the Jews in the Ottoman Empire#Banking and finance|merchants acting as intermediaries]] for their Muslim rulers.

==North Africa region==

===French colonization===
In the 19th century, [[Francization]] of Jews in the French colonial [[North Africa]], due to the work of organizations such as the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]]{{sfn|Laskier|1994}} and French policies such as the [[Crémieux Decree|Algerian citizenship decree of 1870]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Israeli-Palestinian Conflict in the Francophone World|first=Nathalie|last=Debrauwere-Miller|publisher=Routledge|year=2011|isbn=9781135843878|page=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_giRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in a separation of the community from the local Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Laskier|first=Michael|title=North African Jewry in the Twentieth Century: The Jews of Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria|publisher=NYU Press|year=1994|isbn=9780814750728}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaked, Edith Haddad. "On the State of being (Jewish) between 'Orient' and 'Occident'" in Bat-Ami Bar On and Tessman, Lisa, eds. Jewish Locations: Traversing Racialized Landscapes. (City: Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2002), "Quite many observers have noted that it is remarkable how quickly Tunisian Jews shifted their identification and leapt from a way of life quite similar to that of the Muslim Arab population into a new European cultural world, following the establishment of the French Protectorate in Tunisia in 1882. Under the French Protectorate, the Jews had a different position, "one small notch above the Muslims on the pyramid which is the basis of all colonial societies." ... For the generation born under the protectorate, the French language replaced Judeo-Arabic as the Tunisian Jews' mother tongue.... Under French colonial rule, the Jews of Tunisia deconstructed many aspects of their "Oriental" selves, and experienced an image shift, from resembling the "Oriental" colonized Arabs to resembling the "Occidental" French colonizers, through their rapid adaptation to the French language, customs, and culture. Since the French administrators strongly encouraged the French acculturation of Tunisian Jews through many educational and economic opportunities, their "Oriental" past started just to fade away. As a result, a new society of French-assimilated Jews emerged. When Tunisia gained its independence from France and emerged as a Muslim Arab country, Tunisian Jews were not let to forget that after all, they were French-acculturated Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

The French began [[Invasion of Algiers in 1830|the conquest of Algeria in 1830]]. The following century had a profound influence on the status of the Algerian Jews; following the 1870 "Décret Crémieux", they were elevated from the protected minority dhimmi status to French citizens of the colonial power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Chouraqui|first=Andre|authorlink=André Chouraqui|year=2002|title=Between East and West: A History of the Jews of North Africa|isbn=1-59045-118-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Studies in Contemporary Jewry: Volume XIX: Jews and the State: Dangerous Alliances and the Perils of Privilege|last=Mendelsohn|first=Ezra|year=2004|isbn=9780195346879|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i-TttDROff0C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decree began a wave of [[Pied-Noir]]-led anti-Jewish protests (such as the 1897 anti-Jewish riots in [[Oran]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Algeria, 1830–2000: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_-5XTVKW08C&amp;pg=PA10|year=2004|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8916-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which the Muslim community did not participate in, to the disappointment of the European agitators.
{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002|p=152|ps=: "A number of factors finally led to the defeat of the anti-Semitic party in Algeria and to its disappearance in 1902.... Most important perhaps was the refusal of the Moslems of Algeria to allow themselves to be drawn into the anti-Jewish manifestations, thus confounding the hopes and plans of the agitators. This phenomenon is a telling proof that the assertions regarding the so-called axiomatic hatred of the Moslems for the Jews were utterly unfounded."}} Though there were also cases of Muslim-led anti-Jewish riots, such as in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]] in 1934 when 34 Jews were killed.&lt;ref name="Vance2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sharon Vance|title=The Martyrdom of a Moroccan Jewish Saint|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5eE0QbtrTAgC|date=10 May 2011|publisher=BRILL|isbn=90-04-20700-7|page=182|quote=Muslim anti Jewish riots in Constantine in 1934 when 34 jews were killed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neighbouring [[Husainid Dynasty|Husainid Tunisia]] began to come under European influence in the late 1860s and became [[French protectorate of Tunisia|a French protectorate]] in 1881. Since the 1837 accession of [[Ahmad I ibn Mustafa|Ahmed Bey]],{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002a|ps=: "Although the French Protectorate was established only in 1881, the occupation of Algeria in 1830 exerted a profound influence on Tunisia's rulers and on the life of the Jews there. The accession of Ahmed Bey to the throne in 1837 marked a turning point in the evolution of Tunisia, and during his eighteen-year reign the Jews had a foretaste of the security and freedom that they were to enjoy under the Protectorate."}} and continued by his successor [[Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn|Muhammed Bey]],{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002b|ps=: "Immediately after [Mohammed Bey's 1855] accession, he abolished the corvee duty to which Jews were still subjected under the old laws for the dhimmis, and he made the Jews subject to the same fiscal laws as Moslems."}} Tunisia's Jews were elevated within Tunisia society with improved freedom and security, which was confirmed and safeguarded during the French protectorate.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002c|ps=: "But for the Jews of Tunisia [the 1881 French Protectorate] did not signify the revolutionary change ... [but] rather, to confirm and safeguard through the French presence the existing liberal tendencies which had characterized the Regency since the reign of Ahmed Bey."}} Around a third of Tunisian Jews took French citizenship during the protectorate.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002d|ps=: "Altogether, 7,311 Jews were granted French nationality in Tunisia between 1911 and the end of the Protectorate. These, with their descendants, eventually made up one-third of the Jewish population of Tunisia."}}

Morocco, which had remained independent during the 19th century, became [[French protectorate in Morocco|a French protectorate]] in 1912. However, during less than half a century of colonization, the equilibrium between Jews and Muslims in Morocco was upset, and the Jewish community was again positioned between the colonisers and the Muslim majority.{{sfn|Chouraqui|2002e|ps=: "[Moroccan] Jews became a monolithic block poised between Europeans and Moslems, not fully accepted by either group.... The equilibrium in which the Jews and Moslems had lived, for better or worse, for twelve centuries was upset by the introduction into Morocco of the third and henceforth most powerful force—the French.... Morocco's Jews found themselves, at the end of fifty years, alienated from both societies on whose perimeters they lived."}} French penetration into Morocco between 1906 and 1912 created significant Morocco Muslim resentment, resulting in nationwide protests and military unrest. During the period a number of anti-European or anti-French protests extended to include anti-Jewish manifestations, such as in [[Casablanca]], [[Oujda]] and [[Fes]] in 1907-08 and later in the [[1912 Fes riots]].{{sfn|Laskier|2012|p=42|ps=: "But the worst was yet to come, for the systematic French penetration after Algeciras brought Moroccan Muslim resentment to the boiling point. The resentment was manifested in the form of popular protests and tribal and military unrest throughout the country. The French proceeded by occupying Oujda; and following anti-European manifestations in Marrakesh and riots in Casablanca (1907), resulting in the killing of Europeans, the French government sent to Casablanca's coast the cruiser Galilee and a French expeditionary force. French troops were now in Casablanca whereas major portions of the adjacent Chaouia plain were occupied under the command of Generals Drude and d'Amade. ln 1907–1908 anti-European feelings extended to include anti-Jewish manifestations in Oujda, Casablanca, and Fez."}}

The situation in colonial Libya was similar; as for the French in the other North African countries, the [[History of Italian Libya|Italian influence in Libya]] was welcomed by the Jewish community, increasing their separation from the non-Jewish Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eUM2phcxIFIC&amp;pg=PA111|title=The Making of Modern Libya, Ali Abdullatif Ahmida, p 111 |publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014|isbn=9780791417614 |author1=Ahmida |first1=Ali Abdullatif |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=160|ps=: "Moreover, the Libyan Jewish community benefited economically from Ottoman rule. As a result, there was little Jewish emigration during this period. At the same time, however, as European powers increased their economic influence in Libya, Jews increasingly became middlemen between them and the local population. More and more they were seen by Muslim Libyans as aligned with foreign powers. Italian rule soon made this partnership more overt. The colonial rule then further increased Muslim-Jewish conflict, eventually leading to both collective violence and migration. By the end of the Italian period, the Jewish community of Libya was no longer willing to accept a traditional subordinate place in a Muslim society, and in fact was unprepared to live in an independent Arab Muslim state."}}

As in Tunisia and Algeria, [[Moroccan Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349&gt;{{harvnb|Laskier|1994|p=349}}: "... the policies adopted by Nasser's Egypt or Syria such as internment in prison camps, sequestration, or even outright confiscation of assets, and large-scale expulsions (as was the case with Egyptian Jews in 1956-57), were never implemented by Muhammad V, Hasan II, Bourguiba, or the FLN. The freedom of action granted in Algeria, Morocco (since 1961), and Tunisia to Jewish emigration societies... was unparalleled elsewhere in the Arab world. These organizations enjoyed greater legality than government opponents who were Muslims  ... albeit managed by foreigners and financed from abroad."&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morocco the Vichy regime during World War II passed discriminatory laws against Jews; for example, Jews were no longer able to get any form of credit, Jews who had homes or businesses in European neighborhoods were expelled, and quotas were imposed limiting the percentage of Jews allowed to practice professions such as law and medicine to no more than two percent.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|reason=Contradicts Xavier Cornut JPost article - need quote from Stillman to clarify.|date=January 2016}} [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Mohammed V]] expressed his personal distaste for these laws, assuring Moroccan Jewish leaders that he would never lay a hand "upon either their persons or property".

In the late Fifties, before his coronation, he had shocked people during a visit in Lebanon by arguing that the only solution for the enduring conflict was to make peace and incorporate Israel in the Arab League. The king was fascinated by the idea of the "reconciliation of the Semitic brotherhood," although he never expressed it in the early years of his reign, aligning his country with the anti-Israeli alliance."&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1948, soon after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|Israel was established]] and in the midst of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|first Arab–Israeli war]], [[1948 Oujda and Jerada pogrom|violent anti-Jewish riots]] broke out in Oujda and [[Djerada]], leading to deaths of 44 Jews. In 1948–49, after the massacres, 18,000 Moroccan Jews left the country for Israel. Later, however, the Jewish exodus from Morocco slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early 1950s, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:

In 1954, Mossad had established an undercover base in Morocco, sending agents and emissaries within a year to appraise the situation and organize continuous emigration.&lt;ref name=Cornut1/&gt;  The operations were composed of five branches: self-defence, information and intelligence, illegal immigration, establishing contact, and public relations.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=236-37|ps=:"The clandestine North African operation was composed of five branches.

The third branch was illegal immigration. In the fourth branch, young Moroccan Zionists worked in the underground with the Mossad. Their main function, Havillio explained, was to establish the first contact with jewish families to ask them if they [were] ready and willing to go. The fifth branch was public relations aimed at obtalnlng secret support from key members of the jewish Community. This branch, which included an underground medical organization and maintained contacts with foreign diplomats and the press, would approach community members and say, for example, "You have industries, you can help us organize a secret stock of arms."}} Mossad chief [[Isser Harel]] visited the country in 1959 and 1960, reorganized the operations, and created a clandestine militia named the "Misgeret" ("framework").&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Cornut, Jerusalem Post, 2009, [http://www.jpost.com/Features/The-Moroccan-connection The Moroccan connection: Exploring the decades of secret ties between Jerusalem and Rabat.], "When Isser Harel visited Morocco in 1959 and 1960, he was convinced the Jews were ready to leave en masse to return to Zion.

A clandestine militia was created, the "Misgeret" ("framework"), with central command in Casablanca and operatives recruited across the kingdom. Its goal was to defend the Jewish communities and organize departures clandestinely."&lt;/ref&gt;

Emigration to Israel jumped from 8,171 persons in 1954 to 24,994 in 1955, increasing further in 1956. Between 1955 and independence in 1956, 60,000 Jews emigrated.&lt;ref name=Cornut1&gt;Xavier Cornut, Jerusalem Post, 2009, [http://www.jpost.com/Features/The-Moroccan-connection The Moroccan connection: Exploring the decades of secret ties between Jerusalem and Rabat.], "In 1954, Mossad head Isser Harel decided to establish a clandestine base in Morocco. An undercover agent named Shlomo Havilio was sent to monitor the conditions of Jews in the country. His report was alarming: The Jews feared the departure of the French colonial forces and the growing hostility of pan-Arabism; Jewish communities could not be defended and their situation was likely to worsen once Morocco became independent. Havilio had only one solution: a massive emigration to Israel. Harel agreed. Less than a year after his report, the Mossad sent its first agents and emissaries to Morocco to appraise the situation and to organize a nonstop aliya. About 90,000 Jews had emigrated between 1948 and 1955, and 60,000 more would leave in the months preceding the country's independence. Then, on September 27, 1956, the Moroccan authorities stopped all emigration, declaring it illegal. From then until 1960 only a few thousand left clandestinely each year."&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1956, Morocco [[French protectorate in Morocco#Independence 1956|attained independence]].

On 10 January 1961 the ''[[Egoz (ship)|Egoz]]'', a Mossad-leased ship carrying Jews attempting to emigrate undercover, sank off the northern coast of Morocco.

It was also intended to convince the king that he should not keep people against their volition in order to foster the belief that Morocco was a tolerant country. The pamphlet, supposedly printed by an underground Zionist organization, was circulated throughout Morocco, and the government hit the roof. The Moroccan ambassador to the United States, Mehdi Ben Aboud, said in a speech before an American Jewish audience in Washington that the wreck of the Egoz had "brought to light [the] clandestine immigration operation... which has been exploited in a premeditated press campaign of distortion intended to serve Zionist purposes... We have had no Jewish problem in Morocco in the past, and we do not have a Jewish problem in Morocco today. Al-Istiqlal magazine, speaking for the nationalist opposition party, wrote that the pamphlets "were distributed by adventurers, hired by the Zionist state.""}} These events prompted King Mohammed V to allow Jewish emigration, and over the three following years, more than 70,000 Moroccan Jews left the country,&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; primarily as a result of [[Operation Yachin]].

[[Operation Yachin]] was fronted by the New York-based [[Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society]] (HIAS),{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=209a|ps=:"History seemed to repeat itself on a steamy day in August 1961 when an emissary from Jerusalem and the head of the principal private American Jewish immigration agency shook hands in New York on a secret agreement to cooperate in negotiating and organizing departures of Jews from Morocco to Israel, both legally and illegally, in the largest postwar enterprise of its kind. The handshake was between Jewish Agency representative Baruch Duvdvani, a sixty-five-year-old veteran of Palestinian illegal immigration operations, and [[Murray Gurfein|Murray I.

[[Mohamed Oufkir|Colonel Oufkir]], the new Interior Minister in Morocco, and [[Meir Amit]], the new chief of the Mossad, concluded a secret pact that year providing for the training of Moroccan security services by the Israelis and limited covert military assistance in exchange for a flow of intelligence on Arab affairs and continued free departures of jews. In 1965, the Mossad rendered Oufkir the shocking and sinister service of tracking down [[Mehdi Ben Barka|Mehdi Ben-Barka]], the leader of the leftist opposition in Morocco, whom both the king and his Interior Minister wished dead. Amit agreed to locate Ben-Barka, and Mossad agents persuaded him to come to Paris from Geneva under false pretenses. Near a restaurant, French plainclothesmen arrested Ben-Barka and handed him over to Oufkir's agents. They then took him to the countryside, killed him and buried him in a garden. Investigations by the French government uncovered the truth, and the Ben-Barka affair became a political scandal in France, Morocco and Israel."}}

By 1967, only 50,000 Jews remained.&lt;ref name=Stillman175&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1967 [[Six-Day War]] led to increased Arab–Jewish tensions worldwide, including in Morocco, and significant Jewish emigration out of the country continued. By the early 1970s, the Jewish population of Morocco fell to 25,000; however, most of the emigrants went to France, Belgium, Spain, and Canada, rather than Israel.&lt;ref name=Stillman175/&gt;

Despite their dwindling numbers, Jews continue to play a notable role in Morocco; the King retains a Jewish senior adviser, [[André Azoulay]], and Jewish schools and synagogues receive government subsidies. Despite this, Jewish targets have sometimes been attacked (notably the [[2003 Casablanca bombings|2003 bombing attacks]] on a Jewish community center in Casablanca), and there is sporadic anti-Semitic rhetoric from radical Islamist groups. Invitations from the late King [[Hassan II]] for Jews to return to Morocco have not been taken up by the people who had emigrated.

According to [[Esther Benbassa]], the migration of Jews from the North African countries was prompted by uncertainty about the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UaiipUj3SJ8C&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=Tunisia+Jews+france+emigrate|author=Esther Benbassa|title=The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present |isbn=978-0-691-09014-6 |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, over 250,000&lt;ref name="Stearns"/&gt;–265,000&lt;ref name="Avneri"/&gt; Jews lived in Morocco.

As in Tunisia and Morocco, [[Algerian Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349/&gt;

Jewish emigration from Algeria was part of a wider ending of French colonial control and the related social, economic and cultural changes.{{sfn|Mandel|2014|p=38a|ps=: "Indeed, although the French premier, Pierre Mendes-France, proposed granting greater autonomy for Tunisia and gradual internal reforms for Morocco in 1954, the early 1950s were characterized by widespread nationalist resistance and concomitant economic, political, and social breakdown. Likewise, in Algeria, the outbreak of anti-French agitation in November 1954, ultimately pitting Front de liberation nationals terrorism against the French military's ruthless tactics, undermined the lives of many residents. In response, thousands of Muslims, Christians, and Jews left the region, often for France but also for Canada, South America, Israel, and elsewhere in Europe. Jewish migration was very much a part of this wider collapse of colonial control and the social, economic, and cultural change that followed.}}

The Israeli government had been successful in encouraging Morocco and Tunisian Jews to emigrate to Israel, but were less so in Algeria. Despite offers of visa and economic subsidies, only 580 Jews moved from Algeria to Israel in 1954-55.{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=84|ps=: "While obtaining a fair level of success in gaining émigrés from Morocco and Tunisia, the government of David Ben-Gurion detected only minimal enthusiasm in Algeria. With the offer of visas and economic subsidies, 580 Jews ended up relocating in Israel between 1954 and 1955."}}

Emigration peaked during the [[Algerian War]] of 1954–1962, during which thousands of Muslims, Christians and Jews left the country,{{sfn|Mandel|2014|p=38b}} particularly the Pied-Noir community. In 1956, Mossad agents worked underground to organize and arm the Jews of Constantine, who comprised approximately half the Jewish population of the country.{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=85|ps=: "Taking serious interest in the possible stakes raised by Arab nationalism in Algeria, the Israeli government did not limit its intervention to consular affairs. In 2005, the Israeli daily newspaper, the Maariv, carried a story about the historical activities of the Mossad in Algeria during the war of independence. The article cited interviews with former Mossad agents who recounted working underground and arming the young Jews of Constantine during the Algerian War to rout the ALN. Two former Mossad members, Shlomo Havilio and "agent" Avraham Barzilai, now 78, spoke openly about having been sent by Israeli special services to Algeria in 1956 to organize underground Jewish cells. They had in fact crossed into Algeria from Egypt where they had taken part in organizing armed resistance against Egyptian president Gamal Nasser."}} In Oran, a Jewish counter-insurgency movement was thought to have been trained by former members of [[Irgun]].{{sfn|Choi|2015|p=86|ps=: "Constantine was not the only region in which there was active militant intervention on the part of Israeli organizations. French sources concerning the surveillance of Israeli military activity in Algeria are not open to public viewing, but documents issued by the Information services in La Rocher allude strongly (laissé entendre) to the active presence in Oran of former Irgun (the Israeli national military Organization) members and to their training of Algerian Jewish commandos. In fact, French intelligence reports refer repeatedly to persistent rumors about a Jewish counter-insurgency movement consisting solely of Oranais Jewish youth who had come back from Israel where they received military training. No other evidence was given in the French surveillance reports save for mention that the tactics used by the Constantine Jewish militants resembled those once used by the Irgun."}}

As of the last census in Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians in Algeria (10 percent of the total population including 130,000."

Jewish migration from North Africa to France led to the rejuvenation of the [[History of the Jews in France#Today|French Jewish]] community, which is now the third largest in the world.

As in Morocco and Algeria, [[Tunisian Jews]] did not face large scale expulsion or outright asset confiscation or any similar government persecution during the period of exile, and Zionist agents were relatively allowed freedom of action to encourage emigration.&lt;ref name=Lask349/&gt;

In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel's advent altered outlook for Middle East Jews|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/05/05/uk-israel-palestinians-1948-jews-idUKL0272854620080505|accessdate=30 November 2013|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|date=5 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 1,500 remain today, mostly in [[Djerba]], [[Tunis]], and [[Zarzis]].

===Libya===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Libya}}
According to Maurice Roumani, a Libyan emigrant who was previously the Executive Director of [[WOJAC]],&lt;ref&gt;Yehouda Shenhav. [http://people.socsci.tau.ac.il/mu/yshenhav/files/2013/07/Ethnicity-and-National-Memory.pdf Ethnicity and National Memory: The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) in the Context of the Palestinian National Struggle]. British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies. Volume 29, Issue 1, 2002, Pages 27 - 56.&lt;/ref&gt; the most important factors that influenced the Libyan Jewish community to emigrate were "the scars left from the last years of the Italian occupation and the entry of the British Military in 1943 accompanied by the Jewish Palestinian soldiers".{{sfn|Roumani|2009|p=133 #1|ps= "As stated above, many factors influenced and strengthened the determination of the Jewish community in Libya to emigrate. Most important were the scars left from the last years of the Italian occupation and the entry of the British Military in 1943 accompanied by the Jewish Palestinian soldiers. These soldiers played an instrumental role in reviving Zionism in the community and turning it into a pragmatic program to fulfill the dream of immigrating to Israel. Moreover, the rise of nationalism and preparations for independence made many members of the community suspicious and apprehensive about their future in Libya. The difficulties raised by the British in allowing Libyan Jews to immigrate dampened the enthusiasm of many, however."}}

Zionist emissaries, "shlichim", has begun arriving in the early 1940s, with the intention to "transform the community and transfer it to Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Simon, [http://jcpa.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/schlichim-in-palestine.pdf Shlichim from Palestine in Libya], page 50&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]] began to send emissaries to prepare the infrastructure for the emigration of the Libyan Jewish community.{{sfn|Roumani|2009|p=133 #2|ps= "The Jewish Agency and the Mossad Le Aliyah Bet (the illegal immigration agency) realized the potential of this immigration and decided as early as the summer of 1943 to send three clandestine emissaries—Yair Doar, Zeev (Vilo) Katz and Naftali Bar-Ghiora—to prepare the infrastructure for aliyah of the Libyan Jewish community. These emissaries played a crucial role in establishing the immigration infrastructure that would later, in a more advanced form, facilitate the mass of immigration of Libyan Jews."}}

In 1942, [[Afrika Korps|German troops]] fighting the [[North African Campaign|Allies in North Africa]] occupied the Jewish quarter of [[Benghazi]], plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of that group of Jews perished. At the time, most of the Jews were living in cities of [[Tripoli]] and Benghazi and there were smaller numbers in [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] and [[Misrata]].&lt;ref name=berkeley /&gt; Following the allied victory at the [[Battle of El Agheila]] in December 1942, German and Italian troops were driven out of Libya. The British installed the [[Palestine Regiment]] in [[Cyrenaica]], which later became the core of the [[Jewish Brigade]], which was later also stationed in [[Tripolitania]]. The pro-Zionist soldiers encouraged the spread of Zionism throughout the local Jewish population{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=150}}&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=0RY7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT42 Jewish Brigade: An Army with Two Masters 1944–45]'', Morris Beckman, The History Press, 2010, pp. 42–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yoav Gelber]], ''Jewish Palestinian Volunteering in the British Army during the Second World War'', Vol. III. ''The Standard Bearers - The Mission of the Volunteers to the Jewish People'', (Hebrew, Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi, Jerusalem 1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the liberation of North Africa by allied forces, antisemitic incitements were still widespread. The most severe racial violence between the start of World War II and the establishment of Israel erupted in [[1945 Tripoli pogrom|Tripoli in November 1945]]. Over a period of several days more than 130 Jews (including 36 children) were killed, hundreds were injured, 4,000 were displaced and 2,400 were reduced to poverty. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.&lt;ref name="Stillman, 2003, p. 145"&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gil Shefler]] writes that "As awful as the pogrom in Libya was, it was still a relatively isolated occurrence compared to the mass murders of Jews by locals in Eastern Europe."&lt;ref name="SaadonandShefler"/&gt; The same year, violent anti-Jewish violence also occurred in [[1945 Cairo pogrom|Cairo]], which resulted in 10 Jewish victims.

In 1948, about 38,000 Jews lived in Libya.&lt;ref name="Avneri"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; The pogroms continued in June 1948, when 15 Jews were killed and 280 Jewish homes destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1948, a few months after the events in Tripoli, the American consul in Tripoli, Orray Taft Jr., reported that: "There is reason to believe that the Jewish Community has become more aggressive as the result of the Jewish victories in Palestine. There is also reason to believe that the community here is receiving instructions and guidance from the State of Israel. Whether or not the change in attitude is the result of instructions or a progressive aggressiveness is hard to determine. Even with the aggressiveness or perhaps because of it, both Jewish and Arab leaders inform me that the inter-racial relations are better now than they have been for several years and that understanding, tolerance and cooperation are present at any top level meeting between the leaders of the two communities."{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=68}}&lt;ref&gt;NARA RG 84, Libya— Tripoli, General Records 1948–49; file 800–833, Taft to Secretary of State (23 November 1948)&lt;/ref&gt;

Immigration to Israel began in 1949, following the establishment of a [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] office in Tripoli. According to Harvey E. Goldberg, "a number of Libyan Jews" believe that the Jewish Agency was behind the riots, given that the riots helped them achieve their goal.{{sfn|Goldberg|p=156|ps=: "Immigration began when the British authorities granted permission to the Jewish Agency to set up an office in Tripoli and organize the operation. As an indication of how the causes of events can be reinterpreted in terms of their results, a number of Libyan Jews have told me that their guess is that the Jewish Agency was behind the riots, for they clearly had the effect of bringing the Jews to Israel"}} Between the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and Libyan independence in December 1951 over 30,000 Libyan Jews emigrated to Israel.

On 31 December 1958 a decree was issued by the President of the Executive Council of Tripolitania, which ordered the dissolution of the Jewish Community Council and the appointment of a Muslim commissioner nominated by the Government. A law issued in 1961 required Libyan citizenship for the possession and transfer of property in Libya, a requirement that was rejected to all but 6 Libyan Jewish individuals. Jews were banned from voting, attaining public offices and from serving in the army or in police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/the-final-exodus-of-the-libyan-jews-in-1967/|title=The Final Exodus of the Libyan Jews in 1967 - Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimenaexperience.org/libya/about-jimena/past-and-present/|title=Jewish History|website=jimenaexperience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, during the [[Six-Day War]], the Jewish population of 4,000 was again subjected to riots in which 18 were killed,{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and many more injured. According to [[David Harris (advocate)|David Harris]], the Executive Director of the Jewish advocacy organization [[American Jewish Committee|AJC]], the pro-Western Libyan government of [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]] "faced with a complete breakdown of law and order ... urged the Jews to leave the country temporarily", permitting them each to take one suitcase and the equivalent of $50. In June and July over 4,000 traveled to Italy, where they were assisted by the Jewish Agency for Israel. 1,300 went on to Israel, 2,200 remained in Italy, and most of the rest went to the United States. A few scores remained in Libya and others managed to return between 1967 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 155–156, "Finally, faced with a complete breakdown of law and order, the Libyan government urged the Jews to leave the country temporarily. Whereas, in the past, Jews had had considerable difficulty obtaining travel documents, Libyan officials were now visiting Jewish homes and issuing such documents on the spot. Escorts were provided to the airports. But departing Jews were permitted only one suitcase and the equivalent of $50. ... Predictably, the so-called temporary exodus in 1967 became permanent. A few score of Jews remained in Libya, while others managed, in the two years prior to Qaddhafi's coup d'état in September 1969, to return briefly in an attempt to regain their possessions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon, 1999, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the Libyan government issued new laws that confiscated all the assets of Libya's Jews, issuing in their stead 15-year bonds. However, when the bonds matured no compensation was paid. Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] justified this on the grounds that "the alignment of the Jews with Israel, the Arab nations' enemy, has forfeited their right to compensation."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 2001, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the main synagogue in Tripoli was renovated in 1999, it has not reopened for services. The last Jew in Libya, Esmeralda Meghnagi, died in February 2002. Israel is home to about 40,000 Jews of Libyan descent, who maintain unique traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews in Islamic Countries: Libya|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/libyajews.html|work=JVL|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===

====1930s and early 1940s====
{{see also|History of the Jews in Iraq|Baghdadi Jews|Kurdish Jews}}
The [[Mandatory Iraq|British mandate over Iraq]] came to an end in June 1930, and in October 1932 the country became independent. The Iraqi government response to the demand of [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] autonomy (the Assyrians being the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Eastern Aramaic-speaking Semitic descendants of the ancient Assyrians and [[Mesopotamians]], and largely affiliated to the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and [[Syriac Orthodox Church]]), turned into a [[Simele massacre|bloody massacre]] of [[Assyrians in Iraq#Independent Kingdom of Iraq|Assyrian villagers]] by the Iraqi army in August 1933. This event was the first sign to the Jewish community that minority rights were meaningless under Iraqi monarchy. [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], known for his liberal policies, died in September 1933, and was succeeded by [[Ghazi of Iraq|Ghazi]], his nationalistic anti-British son. Ghazi began promoting [[Arab nationalist]] organizations, headed by Syrian and Palestinian exiles. With [[1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine]], they were joined by rebels, such as the [[Amin al-Husayni|Grand Mufti of Jerusalem]]. The exiles preached pan-Arab ideology and fostered anti-Zionist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, M. ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Iraqi nationalists, Nazi propaganda began to infiltrate the country, as Nazi Germany was anxious to expand its influence in the Arab world. Dr. [[Fritz Grobba]], who resided in Iraq since 1932, began to vigorously and systematically disseminate hateful propaganda against Jews. Among other things, Arabic translation of ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' was published and Radio Berlin had begun broadcasting in Arabic language. Anti-Jewish policies had been implemented since 1934, and the confidence of Jews was further shaken by the growing crisis in Palestine in 1936. Between 1936 and 1939 ten Jews were murdered and on eight occasions bombs were thrown on Jewish locations.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, M. ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Farhud mass grave.jpg|thumb|Mass grave of victims of the [[Farhud]], 1941.]]
In 1941, immediately following the British victory in the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], riots known as the [[Farhud]] broke out in [[Baghdad]] in the [[power vacuum]] following the collapse of the pro-[[Axis Powers|Axis]] government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] while the city was in a state of instability. 180 Jews were killed and another 240 wounded; 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Itamar (2001). ''Locked Doors: The Seizure of Jewish Property in Arab Countries''. (Praeger/Greenwood) {{ISBN|0-275-97134-1}}, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some accounts the Farhud marked the turning point for Iraq's Jews.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World'' ("Either way, the farhūd was a significant turning-point for the Jewish community. In addition to its effect on relations between Iraqi Muslims and Jews, it exacerbated the tensions between the pro-British Jewish notables and the younger elements of the community, who now looked to the Communist Party and Zionism and began to consider emigration.")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=VxEJrEY22egC&amp;pg=PA350&amp;dq=FARHUD+TURNING+POINT&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeb3UreLB8jjswaB8IHABA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=FARHUD%20TURNING%20POINT&amp;f=false The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times, p. 350]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Esther Meir-Glitzenstein's [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU2QAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=FARHUD+BEGINNING+OF+THE+END&amp;hl=iw&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YBr4UuXRE8S04AS5s4DICw&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=FARHUD%20DYNAMICS&amp;f=false book on zionism in Iraq, p. 213]&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, however, see the pivotal moment for the Iraqi Jewish community much later, between 1948–51, since Jewish communities prospered along with the rest of the country throughout most of the 1940s,{{sfn|Bashkin|2012}}&lt;ref name=Gat&gt;Moshe Gat, [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Jewish_Exodus_from_Iraq_1948_1951.html?id=o-mbui7U_awC&amp;redir_esc=y ''The Jewish Exodus from Iraq, 1948–1951''], quote(1): "[as a result] of the economic boom and the security granted by the government. ... Jews who left Iraq immediately after the riots, later returned." Quote(2): "Their dream of integration into Iraqi society had been dealt a severe blow by the farhud but as the years passed self-confidence was restored, since the state continued to protect the Jewish community and they continued to prosper." Quote(3): Quoting [[Enzo Sereni]]: "The Jews have adapted to the new situation with the British occupation, which has again given them the possibility of free movement after months of detention and fear."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB/&gt;&lt;ref name=LRB&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n21/adam-shatz/leaving-paradise London Review of Books, Vol. 30 No. 21 • 6 November 2008, pages 23–25, Adam Shatz], "Yet Sasson Somekh insists that the farhud was not 'the beginning of the end'. Indeed, he claims it was soon 'almost erased from the collective Jewish memory', washed away by 'the prosperity experienced by the entire city from 1941 to 1948'. Somekh, who was born in 1933, remembers the 1940s as a 'golden age' of 'security', 'recovery' and 'consolidation', in which the 'Jewish community had regained its full creative drive'. Jews built new homes, schools and hospitals, showing every sign of wanting to stay. They took part in politics as never before; at Bretton Woods, Iraq was represented by Ibrahim al-Kabir, the Jewish finance minister. Some joined the Zionist underground, but many more waved the red flag. Liberal nationalists and Communists rallied people behind a conception of national identity far more inclusive than the Golden Square's Pan-Arabism, allowing Jews to join ranks with other Iraqis – even in opposition to the British and Nuri al-Said, who did not take their ingratitude lightly."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishvoiceny.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2165:world-organization-of-jews-from-arab-countries-wojac-history-and-purpose&amp;catid=113:oped&amp;Itemid=296 World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC): History and Purpose, 17 October 2012, Heskel M. Haddad], "The turning point for the Jews in Iraq was not the Farhood, as it is wrongly assumed."&lt;/ref&gt; and many Jews who left Iraq following the Farhud returned to the country shortly thereafter and permanent emigration did not accelerate significantly until 1950–51.&lt;ref name=Gat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt;

Either way, the Farhud is broadly understood to mark the start of a process of politicization of the Iraqi Jews in the 1940s, primarily among the younger population, especially as a result of the impact it had on hopes of long term integration into Iraqi society. In the direct aftermath of the Farhud, many joined the [[Iraqi Communist Party]] in order to protect the Jews of Baghdad, yet they did not want to leave the country and rather sought to fight for better conditions in Iraq itself.{{sfn|Bashkin|2012|p=141–182}} At the same time the Iraqi government that had taken over after the Farhud reassured the Iraqi Jewish community, and normal life soon returned to Baghdad, which saw a marked betterment of its economic situation during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gat|first=Moshe|title=The Jewish exodus from Iraq: 1948–1951|year=1997|publisher=Cass|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=071464689X|pages=23–24|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman|first=Shlomo Hillel ; translated by Ina|title=Operation Babylon |year=1988 |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=978-0002179843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Farhud in 1941, Mossad LeAliyah Bet sent emissaries to Iraq to begin to organize emigration to Israel, initially by recruiting people to teach Hebrew and hold lectures on Zionism. In 1942, [[Shaul Avigur]], head of [[Mossad LeAliyah Bet]], entered Iraq undercover in order to survey the situation of the Iraqi Jews with respect to immigration to Israel.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=206|ps=:"Even as Schwartz spoke, the Joint was secretly underwriting and helping organize Jewish emigration from Yemen, Aden and Iraq. In late 1946, the Mossad launched Operations Ezra and Nehemiah (known together as Operation Babylon) to save Jews from successive regimes in Iraq. This was really the second phase of an operation that dated back to March 1942, when Avigur smuggled himself into Iraq. Ephraim Krasner Dekel, the head of the Shai, had introduced Avigur to a Jewish sergeant in a British Army transport company which ran regular routes between Tel Aviv and Baghdad. Avigur disguised himself as the assistant driver of a military truck - it was the only time in his life he ever wore any military uniform - and went to survey the situation of the Iraqi jewish community of some 150,000, one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world. After crossing the Syrian desert in unbearable heat, Avigur wasted no time in Baghdad contacting Jewish community leaders."}} During the 1942–43, Avigur made four further trips to Baghdad to arrange the required Mossad machinery, including a radio transmitter for sending information to Tel Aviv, which remained in use for 8 years.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=208a|ps=:"During 1942 and 1943, Avigur made four more secret trips to Baghdad to set up the Mossad machlnery, including the installation of a clandestine radio transmitter that broadcast dally to Tel Aviv headquarters for eight years."}} In late 1942, one of the emissaries explained the size of their task of converting the Iraqi community to Zionism, writing that "we have to admit that there is not much point in [organizing and encouraging emigration]. ... We are today eating the fruit of many years of neglect, and what we didn't do can't be corrected now through propaganda and creating one-day-old enthusiasm."{{sfn|Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=64–65|ps=: Sereni's letter stated "If we thought before we came here and when we started our work that our main task would be to organize and encourage—today we have to admit that there is not much point in either of these activities. ... We are today eating the fruit of many years of neglect, and what we didn't do can't be corrected now through propaganda and creating one-day-old enthusiasm. ... We have to prepare for the future, to educate a generation of young people, to prepare a young guard that can do our work here. Forming a Zionist organization, a youth movement, a vanguard are the main tasks of the hour."}} It was not until 1947 that legal and illegal departures from Iraq to Israel began.{{sfn|Szulc|1991|p=208b|ps=:"But Jewish departures, legal and illegal, did not start from Iraq until 1947, when enough pressures and bribery finally moved the royal government to let the Jews go, albeit gradually."}} Around 8,000 Jews left Iraq between 1919–48, with another 2,000 leaving between mid-1948 to mid-1950.&lt;ref name=Marqusee&gt;[[Mike Marqusee]], "Diasporic Dimensions" in If I am Not for Myself, Journey of an Anti-Zionist Jew, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

====1948 Arab–Israeli War====
In 1948, there were approximately 150,000 Jews in Iraq. The community was concentrated in Baghdad and [[Basra]].

Before [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] vote, the Iraq's prime minister [[Nuri al-Said]] told British diplomats that if the United Nations solution was not "satisfactory", "severe measures should [would?] be taken against all Jews in Arab countries".&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the General Assembly Hall at Flushing Meadow, New York, on Friday, 28 November 1947, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Fadel Jamall, included the following statement: "Partition imposed against the will of the majority of the people will jeopardize peace and harmony in the Middle East. Not only the uprising of the Arabs of Palestine is to be expected, but the masses in the Arab world cannot be restrained. The Arab–Jewish relationship in the Arab world will greatly deteriorate. There are more Jews in the Arab world outside of Palestine than there are in Palestine. In Iraq alone, we have about one hundred and fifty thousand Jews who share with Moslems and Christians all the advantages of political and economic rights. Harmony prevails among Moslems, Christians and Jews. But any injustice imposed upon the Arabs of Palestine will disturb the harmony among Jews and non-Jews in Iraq; it will breed inter-religious prejudice and hatred."&lt;ref name="unispal.un.org"&gt;{{Citation|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/93DCDF1CBC3F2C6685256CF3005723F2 |accessdate=15 October 2013 |title=U.N General Assembly, A/PV.126,28 November 1947, discussion on the Palestinian question |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016084808/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/93DCDF1CBC3F2C6685256CF3005723F2 |archivedate=16 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 February 1949, al-Said acknowledged the bad treatment that the Jews had been victims of in Iraq during the recent months. He warned that unless Israel would behave itself, events might take place concerning the Iraqi Jews.&lt;ref name="UN1949NuriSaid1949"/&gt; Al-Said's threats had no impact at the political level on the fate of the Jews but were widely published in the media.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=206 #1|ps=: "Although Nuri's threats had no impact on the fate of the Jews on the political level, they were prominently publicized in the media."}}

In 1948, the country was placed under martial law, and the penalties for Zionism were increased. Courts martial were used to intimidate wealthy Jews, Jews were again dismissed from civil service, quotas were placed on university positions, Jewish businesses were boycotted (E. Black, p.&amp;nbsp;347) and [[Shafiq Ades]] (one of the most important anti-Zionist Jewish businessmen in the country) was arrested and publicly hanged for allegedly selling goods to Israel, shocking the community (Tripp, 123). The Jewish community general sentiment was that if a man as well connected and powerful as [[Shafiq Ades]] could he eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer.&lt;ref name="Bashkin2012p90"&gt;{{harvnb|Bashkin|2012|p=90}}: "the general sentiment was chat if a man as well connected and powerful as Adas could he eliminated by the state, other Jews would not be protected any longer."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq forbade any legal emigration of its Jews on the grounds that they might go to Israel and could strengthen that state. At the same time, increasing government oppression of the Jews fueled by anti-Israeli sentiment together with public expressions of antisemitism created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty.

Like most [[Arab League]] states, Iraq initially forbade the emigration of its Jews after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state. However, by 1949 Jews were escaping Iraq at about a rate of 1,000 a month.&lt;ref name="Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p.365"&gt;Simon, Reguer, and Laskier, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the British believed that the Zionist underground was agitating in Iraq in order to assist US fund-raising and to "offset the bad impression caused by the Jewish attitudes to Arab refugees".{{sfn|Shiblak|1986|ps=: "In a confidential telegram sent on 2 November 1949, the British ambassador to Washington explained ... the general view of officials in the State Department is that the [Zionist] agitation has been deliberately worked up for two reasons:&lt;br&gt;
(a) To assist fund-raising in the United States&lt;br&gt;
(b) To create favourable sentiments in the United Nations Assembly to offset the bad impression caused by the Jewish attitudes to Arab refugees. They suggest that the Israeli Government is fully aware of the Iraqi Jews, but is prepared to be callous towards the community, the bulk of which, as [[Eliahu Eilat|Dr Elath]] admitted, has no wish to transfer its allegiance to Israel."}}

The Iraqi government took in only 5,000 of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|c.700,000 Palestinians who became refugees]] in 1948–49 and refused to submit to American and British pressure to admit more.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=296|ps=: "Throughout that time (1948–1949), Iraq took in only about 5,000 refugees and consistently refused to admit any more, despite British and American efforts to persuade Iraq and Syria to do more to solve the problem."}} In January 1949, the pro-British Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Said discussed the idea of deporting Iraqi Jews to Israel with British officials, who explained that such a proposal would benefit Israel and adversely affect Arab countries.{{sfn|Shenhav|1999|p=610|ps=: "Shortly after his government assumed power in January 1949, Nuri al-Said toyed with the idea of deporting the Iraqi Jews to Israel. However, the British ambassador in Palestine warned him that such an act could have serious unanticipated repercussions. Israel, the ambassador explained, would welcome the arrival of cheap Jewish labor and would demand that in return the Arab states assimilate Palestinian refugees. In February 1949, the Foreign Office instructed the British ambassador in Baghdad, Sir Henry Mack, to caution Nuri al-Said against expelling the Jews, as this would adversely affect the position of the Arab states."}}&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 119,124, 125,127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008, p. 413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tripp 2002 p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meir-Glitzenstein, such suggestions were "not intended to solve either the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees or the problem of the Jewish minority in Iraq, but to torpedo plans to resettle Palestinian Arab refugees in Iraq".{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=297a|ps=: "Nuri's proposals for a forced population exchange were not intended to solve either the problem of the Palestinian Arab refugees or the problem of the Jewish minority in Iraq, but to torpedo plans to resettle Palestinian Arab refugees in Iraq. He knew that Britain and the United States would not condone the deportation of Iraqi Jews to Israel."}} In July 1949 the British government proposed to Nuri al-Said a [[population exchange]] in which Iraq would agree to settle 100,000 [[Palestinian refugees]] in Iraq; Nuri stated that if a fair arrangement could be agreed, "the Iraqi government would permit a voluntary move by Iraqi Jews to Palestine."{{sfn|Shenhav|1999|p=613|ps=: "In July 1949, the British, fearing the decline of their influence in the Middle East, put forward a proposal for a population transfer and tried to persuade Nuri al-Said to settle 100,000 Palestinian refugees in Iraq. A letter sent by the British Foreign Office to its legations in the Middle East spoke of an "arrangement whereby Iraqi Jews moved into Israel, received compensation for their property from the Israeli government, while the Arab refugees were installed with the property in Iraq". The British Foreign Office believed that "the Israeli government would find it hard to resist an opportunity of bringing a substantial number of Jews to Israel." In return, Nuri al-Said demanded that half the Palestinian refugees be settled in the territory of Palestine and the rest in the Arab states. If the refugee arrangement were indeed fair, he said, the Iraqi government would permit a voluntary move by Iraqi Jews to Palestine. Under the terms of the plan, an international committee was to assess the value of the property left behind by the Palestinian refugees who would be settled in Iraq, and they would receive restitution drawn from the property of the Iraqi Jews who would be sent to Palestine.... In October 1949, the world and Israeli press reported the Iraqi-British plan for a population exchange (e.g., Davar, 16 October 1949). The publicity embarrassed the other Arab leaders and caused a stir in the refugee camps of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In a message to the Foreign Office, [[Henry Mack (diplomat)|Henry Mack]], the British ambassador to Iraq, said that the Palestinian refugees would not agree to settle in Iraq."}} The Iraqi-British proposal was reported in the press in October 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anglo U.S split on policy aggravated by Iraq offer|publisher=The Palestine Post, Jerusalem|date=19 October 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 1949 Nuri Al Said raised the exchange of population concept with the economic mission survey.&lt;ref name="Tovy2014p163"/&gt; At the Jewish Studies Conference in Melbourne in 2002, Philip Mendes summarised the effect of al-Saids vacillations on Jewish expulsion as: "In addition, the Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri as-Said tentatively canvassed and then shelved the possibility of expelling the Iraqi Jews, and exchanging them for an equal number of Palestinian Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985|title=The Forgotten Refugees: the causes of the post-1948 Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries - The Case of Iraq|author=Philip Mendes|work=14th Jewish Studies Conference, Melbourne|year=2002|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130113093432/http://mefacts.org/cached.asp?x_id=10985|archivedate=13 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "

====A reversal: Allowing a Jewish immigration to Israel====
{{main|Operation Ezra and Nehemiah}}

[[File:Iraqi jews displaced 1951.jpg|thumb|[[Iraqi jews]] displaced 1951.]]
In March 1950 Iraq reversed their earlier ban on Jewish emigration to Israel and passed a law of one-year duration allowing Jews to emigrate on the condition of relinquishing their Iraqi citizenship. According to [[Abbas Shiblak]], many scholars state that this was a result of British, American and Israeli political pressure on [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi]]'s government, with some studies suggesting there were secret negotiations.{{sfn|Shiblak|1986|p=79|ps=: "Many studies, however, while not rejecting all the official Iraqi justifications out of hand, see the law as the result of continuous pressure on Iraq from the British, American, and Israeli governments. Some studies go further, regarding Law 1/1950 as the culmination of secret negotiations involving these parties together with the [[Tawfiq al-Suwaidi|al-Suwaidi]] government."}} According to [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]],&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; the Iraqi government was motivated by "economic considerations, chief of which was that almost all the property of departing Jews reverted to the state treasury"&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; and also that "Jews were seen as a restive and potentially troublesome minority that the country was best rid of."&lt;ref name="Black1991p89"/&gt; Israel mounted an operation called "[[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]]" to bring as many of the Iraqi Jews as possible to Israel.

The Zionist movement at first tried to regulate the amount of registrants until issues relating to their legal status were clarified. Later, it allowed everyone to register. Two weeks after the law went into force, the Iraqi interior minister demanded a CID investigation over why Jews were not registering.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} A few hours after the movement allowed registration, four Jews were injured in a bomb attack at a café in Baghdad.

Immediately following the March 1950 Denaturalisation Act, the emigration movement faced significant challenges. Initially, local Zionist activists forbade the Iraqi Jews from registering for emigration with the Iraqi authorities, because the Israeli government was still discussing absorption planning.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=202a}} However, on 8 April, a bomb exploded in a Jewish cafe in Baghdad, and a meeting of the Zionist leadership later that day agreed to allow registration without waiting for the Israeli government; a proclamation encouraging registration was made throughout Iraq in the name of the State of Israel.&lt;ref name=MG202/&gt; However, at the same time immigrants were also entering Israel from Poland and Romania, countries in which Prime Minister [[David Ben-Gurion]] assessed there was a risk that the communist authorities would soon "close their gates", and Israel therefore delayed the transportation of Iraqi Jews.&lt;ref name=MG204/&gt; As a result, by September 1950, while 70,000 Jews had registered to leave, many selling their property and losing their jobs, only 10,000 had left the country.&lt;ref name=MG203/&gt; According to Esther Meir-Glitzenstein, "The thousands of poor Jews who had left or been expelled from the peripheral cities, and who had gone to Baghdad to wait for their opportunity to emigrate, were in an especially bad state. They were housed in public buildings and were being supported by the Jewish community. The situation was intolerable." The delay became a significant problem for the Iraqi government of Nuri al-Said (who replaced Tawfiq al-Suwaidi in mid-September 1950), as the large number of Jews "in limbo" created problems politically, economically and for domestic security.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=205a}} "Particularly infuriating" to the Iraqi government was the fact that the source of the problem was the Israeli government.

As a result of these developments, al-Said was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible.&lt;ref name=MG205/&gt;&lt;ref name="Glitzenstein2004p205"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bashkin277/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirkbride/&gt; On 21 August 1950 al-Said threatened to revoke the license of the company transporting the Jewish exodus if it did not fulfill its daily quota of 500 Jews,{{failed verification|date=May 2014|reason=Not in source, and doesn't make sense as he was not prime minister in August}} and in September 1950, he summoned a representative of the Jewish community and warned the Jewish community of Baghdad to make haste; otherwise, he would take the Jews to the borders himself.&lt;ref name="Hakohen2003p124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gat2013p119"/&gt; On 12 October 1950, Nuri al-Said summoned a senior official of the transport company and made similar threats, justifying the expulsion of Jews by the number of Palestinian Arabs fleeing from Israel.{{citation needed|date=May 2014|reason=Is this the same as the August reference above?possible sourced- Gat 2013 p. 115}}

Two months before the law expired, after about 85,000 Jews had registered, a [[1950–1951 Baghdad bombings|bombing campaign]] began against the Jewish community of Baghdad. The Iraqi government convicted and hanged a number of suspected Zionist agents for perpetrating the bombings, but the issue of who was responsible remains a subject of scholarly dispute. All but a few thousand of the remaining Jews then registered for emigration. In all, about 120,000 Jews left Iraq.

According to Gat, it is highly likely that one of Nuri as-Said's motives in trying to expel large numbers of Jews was the desire to aggravate Israel's economic problems (he had declared as such to the Arab world), although Nuri was well aware that the absorption of these immigrants was the policy on which Israel based its future.&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi Minister of Defence told the U.S ambassador that he had reliable evidence that the emigrating Jews were involved in activities injurious to the state and were in contact with communist agents.&lt;ref&gt;Gat 2013 p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Between April 1950 and June 1951, Jewish targets in Baghdad were struck five times. Iraqi authorities then arrested 3 Jews, claiming they were Zionist activists, and sentenced two — Shalom Salah Shalom and Yosef Ibrahim Basri—to death. The third man, Yehuda Tajar, was sentenced to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref name="Hirst"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hirst |first=David |authorlink=David Hirst (journalist) |title=The gun and the olive branch: the roots of violence in the Middle East |publisher=Nation Books |date=25 August 2003 |page=400 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ALVtAAAAMAAJ |isbn=1-56025-483-1 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May and June 1951, arms caches were discovered that allegedly belonged to the Zionist underground, allegedly supplied by the [[Yishuv]] after the Farhud of 1941.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} There has been much debate as to whether the bombs were planted by the [[Mossad]] to encourage Iraqi Jews to emigrate to Israel or if they were planted by Muslim extremists to help drive out the Jews.

The emigration law was to expire in March 1951, one year after the law was enacted. On 10 March 1951, 64,000 Iraqi Jews were still waiting to emigrate, the government enacted a new law blocking the assets of Jews who had given up their citizenship, and extending the emigration period.{{sfn| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=206 #2|ps=: "On 10 March 1951, precisely one year after the Denaturalization Law had come into effect, when 64,000 people were still waiting to emigrate, the Iraqi legislature enacted a law blocking the assets of Jews who had given up their citizenship."}}

The bulk of the Jews leaving Iraq did so via Israeli airlifts named [[Operation Ezra and Nehemiah]] with special permission from the Iraqi government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moia.gov.il/English/FeelingIsrael/AboutIsrael/Pages/ezraVenechmia.aspx|title=Operation Ezra and Nehemiah – the Aliyah of Iraqi Jewry (1950-1951)|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Aliyah and Immigrant Absorption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====After 1951====
In 1969, about 50 of the Jews who remained were executed; 11 were publicly executed after [[show trial]]s and hundred thousand Iraqis marched past the bodies in a carnival-like atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic of fear: the politics of modern Iraq'' By Kanan Makiya, chapter 2 "A World of Fear", University of California 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, there were only about 100 left of this previously thriving community.

====Background====
Although there was a small indigenous community, most Jews in Egypt in the early twentieth century were recent immigrants to the country,{{Failed verification|reason=Article does not support that the Egyptian Jews were recent immigrants.|date=December 2014}} who did not share the Arabic language and culture.&lt;ref name="Kramer-p233" &gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n6qjaDq1sRwC&amp;pg=PA233 The Jews in Modern Egypt, 1914–1952, Gudrun Krämer], page 233, Quote: "Not only were they not Muslim, and mainly not of Egyptian origin; most of them did not share the Arabic language and culture, either. Added to these factors was their political diversity."&lt;/ref&gt; Many were members of the highly diverse [[Mutamassirun]] community, which included other groups such as Greeks, Armenians, Syrian Christians and Italians, in addition to the British and French colonial powers.{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=174-5}} Until the late 1930s, the Jews, both indigenous and new immigrants, like other minorities tended to apply for foreign citizenship in order to benefit from a foreign protection.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian government made it very difficult for non-Muslim foreigners to become naturalized. The poorer Jews, most of them indigenous and Oriental Jews, were left stateless, although they were legally eligible for Egyptian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The drive to Egyptianize public life and the economy harmed the minorities, but the Jews had more strikes against them than the others. In the agitation against the Jews of the late thirties and the forties, the Jew has been seen as an enemy&lt;ref name="Kramer-p233"/&gt; The Jews were attacked because of their real or alleged links to Zionism. Jews were not discriminated because of their religion or race, like in Europe, but for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer 1989 p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

The Egyptian Prime Minister [[Mahmoud an-Nukrashi Pasha]] told the British ambassador:
"All Jews were potential Zionists [and] ... anyhow all Zionists were Communists."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2008 p. 412&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 November 1947, the head of the Egyptian delegation to the [[United Nations]] General Assembly, Muhammad Hussein Heykal Pasha, said, "the lives of 1,000,000 Jews in Moslem countries would be jeopardized by the establishment of a Jewish state."&lt;ref name="morris2008p67"&gt;{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=1948: a history of the first Arab-Israeli war|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5jtAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2013|year=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1947, Dr Heykal Pasha said: "if the U.N decide to amputate a part of Palestine in order to establish a Jewish state, ... Jewish blood will necessarily be shed elsewhere in the Arab world ... to place in certain and serious danger a million Jews. Mahmud Bey Fawzi (Egypt) said: "Imposed partition was sure to result in bloodshed in Palestine and in the rest of the Arab world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/49e8cf7b046bf55b85256a7200671a8e/$FILE/gapal83.pdf 29th Meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee on Palestine: 24 November 1947: Retrieved 31 December 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231000442/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/49e8cf7b046bf55b85256a7200671a8e/%24FILE/gapal83.pdf |date=31 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exodus of the foreign mutamassirun ("Egyptianized") community, which included a significant number of Jews, began following the First World War, and by the end of the 1960s the entire mutamassirun was effectively eliminated. According to Andrew Gorman, this was primarily a result of the "decolonization process and the rise of [[Egyptian nationalism]]".{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=176 #1|ps=: "In the course of the 40 years from the end of the First World War until the early sixties, this considerable mutamassir presence was effectively eliminated, a casualty of the decolonization process and the rise of Egyptian nationalism. The relation between these two phenomena was exacerbated by British policy."}}{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=176 #2|ps=: "During the Second World War, at the insistence of British authorities, adult male Italian citizens were incarcerated as enemy aliens. In 1948, the foundation of Israel made the position of all Jews in Egypt increasingly tenuous, no matter what their nationality, and the position of Greeks was affected by the vicissitudes of the Greek Civil War in the 1940s. Another critical setback came during the Suez crisis in 1956 when all those who held British and French citizenship were deemed enemy aliens and expelled from the country."}}

The exodus of Egyptian Jews was impacted by the [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Egypt]], though such emigration was not significant as the government stamped the violence out and the Egyptian Jewish community leaders were supportive of [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. In 1948, approximately 75,000 Jews lived in Egypt. Around 20,000 Jews left Egypt during 1948–49 following the events of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War (including the [[1948 Cairo bombings]]).&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt; A further 5,000 left between 1952–56, in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] and later the [[false flag]] [[Lavon Affair]].&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt; The Israeli invasion as part of the [[Suez Crisis]] caused a significant upsurge in emigration, with [[1956–57 exodus and expulsions from Egypt|14,000 Jews leaving]] in less than six months between November 1956 and March 1957, and 19,000 further emigrating over the next decade.&lt;ref name=Marqusee/&gt;

====Suez Crisis====
In October 1956, when the Suez Crisis erupted, the position of the mutamassirun, including the Jewish community, was significantly impacted.{{sfn|Gorman|2003|p=177|ps=: "Hand in hand with the British retreat from empire came the rise of a strident even chauvinist Arab nationalism, particularly after 1956. Since at least the 1930s the dominance of foreign interests in many parts of the Egyptian economy, had prompted increasing calls for Egyptianization. The initial measures, while slow to take effect, made it progressively difficult for foreign nationals, resident or not, to own and operate business interests or maintain employment. The situation became more difficult following Suez, when a large number of businesses owned by British and French nationals were confiscated. The final blow came in 1961 when, though not aimed specifically at the mutamassirun, the nationalization laws effectively deprived many of their livelihoods. The emigration, already well underway, now seemed unstoppable."}}

1,000 Jews were arrested and 500 Jewish businesses were seized by the government. A statement branding the Jews as "Zionists and enemies of the state" was read out in the mosques of Cairo and Alexandria.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Jewish bank accounts were confiscated and many Jews lost their jobs. Lawyers, engineers, doctors and teachers were not allowed to work in their professions. Thousands of Jews were ordered to leave the country. They were allowed to take only one suitcase and a small sum of cash, and forced to sign declarations "donating" their property to the Egyptian government. Foreign observers reported that members of Jewish families were taken hostage, apparently to insure that those forced to leave did not speak out against the Egyptian government. Jews were expelled or left, forced out by the anti-Jewish feeling in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Hopwood2002p56"/&gt; Some 25,000 Jews, almost half of the Jewish community left, mainly for Europe, the United States, South America and Israel, after being forced to sign declarations that they were leaving voluntarily, and agreed with the confiscation of their assets. Similar measures were enacted against British and French nationals in retaliation for the invasion. By 1957 the Jewish population of Egypt had fallen to 15,000.&lt;ref name=JVL-Jewish-Refugees-from-Arab-Countries&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/talking/jew_refugees.html|work=JVL|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later====
In 1960, the American embassy in Cairo wrote of Egyptian Jews that: "There is definitely a strong desire among most Jews to emigrate, but this is prompted by the feeling that they have limited opportunity, or from fear for the future, rather than by any direct or present tangible mistreatment at the hands of the government."&lt;ref&gt;NARA 886B. 41 1/2-2060, Cairo to Department of State (20 February 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=47}}

In 1967, Jews were detained and tortured, and Jewish homes were confiscated.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2012}} Following the Six Day War, the community practically ceased to exist, with the exception of several dozens of elderly Jews.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Yemen===
{{main|Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)}}
{{see also|Yemenite Jews|History of the Jews in Aden}}

The Yemeni exodus began in 1881, seven months prior to the more well-known [[First Aliyah]] from Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Parfitt|1996|p=51}} The exodus came about as a result of European Jewish investment in the [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem]], which created jobs for labouring Jews alongside local Muslim labour thereby providing an economic incentive for emigration.{{sfn|Parfitt|1996|p=52}} This was aided by the reestablishment of Ottoman control over the [[Yemen Vilayet]] allowing freedom of movement within the empire, and the opening of the [[Suez canal]], which reduced the cost of travelling considerably. Between 1881 and 1948, 15,430 Jews had immigrated to Palestine legally.{{sfn|Ariel|2013|p=71}}

In 1942, prior to the formulation of the [[One Million Plan]], David Ben-Gurion described his intentions with respect to such potential policy to a meeting of experts and Jewish leaders, stating that "It is a mark of great failure by Zionism that we have not yet eliminated the Yemen exile [diaspora]."{{sfn|Shenhav|2006|p=31}}

If one includes [[Aden]], there were about 63,000 Jews in Yemen in 1948. Today, there are about 200 left. In 1947, [[1947 Aden pogrom|rioters killed at least 80 Jews in Aden]], a British colony in southern Yemen. In 1948 the new [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] Imam [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] unexpectedly allowed his Jewish subjects to leave Yemen, and tens of thousands poured into Aden. The Israeli government's [[Operation Magic Carpet (Yemen)|Operation Magic Carpet]] evacuated around 44,000 Jews from Yemen to Israel in 1949 and 1950.&lt;ref name=Stillman156-157&gt;Stillman, 2003, pp. 156–57.&lt;/ref&gt; Emigration continued until 1962, when the [[North Yemen Civil War|civil war in Yemen]] broke out. A small community remained until 1976, though it has mostly immigrated from Yemen since. In March 2016, the Jewish population in Yemen was estimated to be about 50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mission-to-airlift-jews-out-of-yemen-heralds-the-end-of-one-of-oldest-jewish-communities/ar-BBqLwuU |title=Mission to airlift Jews out of Yemen heralds the end of one of oldest Jewish communities |first=Kim |last=Sengupta |date=22 March 2016 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=23 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322083906/http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/mission-to-airlift-jews-out-of-yemen-heralds-the-end-of-one-of-oldest-jewish-communities/ar-BBqLwuU |archivedate=22 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lebanon and Syria===

====Background====
{{see also|History of the Jews in Lebanon|History of the Jews in Syria}}
The area now known as Lebanon and Syria was the home of one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to at least 300 BCE.

====Lebanon====

In November 1945, fourteen Jews were killed in anti-Jewish riots in [[Tripoli (Lebanon)|Tripoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirsten Schulze. "Lebanon". ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor [[Norman A. Stillman]]. Brill Online, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other Arab countries, the Lebanese Jewish community did not face grave peril during the 1948 Arab–Israel War and was reasonably protected by governmental authorities. Lebanon was also the only Arab country that saw a post-1948 increase in its Jewish population, principally due to the influx of Jews coming from Syria and Iraq.&lt;ref name=Parfitt&gt;Parfitt, Tudor. (2000) p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 24,000 Jews in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Hendler, Sefi (19 August 2006). "Beirut's last Jews". Ynet. Retrieved on 22 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest communities of Jews in Lebanon were in [[Beirut]], and the villages near [[Mount Lebanon]], [[Deir al Qamar]], [[Barouk]], [[Bechamoun]], and [[Hasbaya]]. While the French mandate saw a general improvement in conditions for Jews, the Vichy regime placed restrictions on them. The Jewish community actively supported [[Lebanese Independence Day|Lebanese independence]] after World War II and had mixed attitudes toward Zionism.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

However, negative attitudes toward Jews increased after 1948, and, by 1967, most Lebanese Jews had emigrated—to Israel, the United States, Canada, and France. In 1971, Albert Elia, the 69-year-old Secretary-General of the Lebanese Jewish community, was kidnapped in Beirut by Syrian agents and imprisoned under torture in [[Damascus]], along with Syrian Jews who had attempted to flee the country. A personal appeal by the [[U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan]], to the late President [[Hafez al-Assad]] failed to secure Elia's release.

The remaining Jewish community was particularly hard hit by the [[Lebanese civil war|civil war in Lebanon]], and by the mid-1970s, the community collapsed. In the 1980s, [[Hezbollah]] kidnapped several Lebanese Jewish businessmen, and in the 2004 elections, only one Jew voted in the municipal elections. There are now only between 20 and 40 Jews living in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="jewcy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewcy.com/religion-and-beliefs/jews_lebanon_another_perspective|title=The Jews of Lebanon: Another Perspective - Jewcy|date=20 November 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ynetnews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3292543,00.html|title=Beirut's last Jews|date=19 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, there were approximately 30,000 Jews in Syria. In 1949, following defeat in the Arab–Israeli War, the CIA-backed [[March 1949 Syrian coup d'état]] installed [[Husni al-Za'im]] as the President of Syria. Za'im permitted the emigration of large numbers of Syrian Jews, and 5,000 left to Israel.{{sfn|Zenner|2000|p=55}}

The subsequent Syrian governments placed severe restrictions on the Jewish community, including barring emigration.{{sfn|Zenner|2000|p=55}} Over the next few years, many Jews managed to escape, and the work of supporters, particularly [[Judy Feld Carr]],&lt;ref name="levin"&gt;Levin, 2001, pp. 200–201.&lt;/ref&gt; in smuggling Jews out of Syria, and bringing their plight to the attention of the world, raised awareness of their situation. Although the Syrian government attempted to stop Syrian Jews from exporting their assets, the American consulate in Damascus noted in 1950 that "the majority of Syrian Jews have managed to dispose of their property and to emigrate to Lebanon, Italy, and Israel".{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=31}}&lt;ref&gt;NARA RG 59, 883.411/7-2550, Damascus to Department of State (25 July 1950)&lt;/ref&gt;  In November 1954, the Syrian government lifted its ban on Jewish emigration.{{sfn|Fischbach|2013|p=34}}

In March 1964, the Syrian government issued a decree prohibiting Jews from traveling more than three miles from the limits of their hometowns.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times'', edited by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer P:329&lt;/ref&gt; During 1967, riots broke out in Damascus and Aleppo. Jews were allowed to leave their homes only for few hours daily. Many Jews found impossible to pursue their business venture because the larger community was boycotting their products. In 1972 demonstrations were held by 1000 Syrian Jews in Damascus, after four woman were killed as they attempted to flee Syria. The protest surprised Syrian authorities, who closely monitored Jewish community, eavesdropped on their telephone conversations, and tampered with their mail.&lt;ref&gt;''The Jews of the Middle East and North Africa in Modern Times'', edited by Reeva Spector Simon, Michael Menachem Laskier, Sara Reguer P:329–330&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]], the United States put pressure on the Syrian government to ease its restrictions on Jews, and during Passover in 1992, the government of Syria began granting exit visas to Jews on condition that they did not emigrate to Israel. At that time, the country had several thousand Jews. The majority left for the United States—most to join the large Syrian Jewish community in [[South Brooklyn]], New York—although some went to France and Turkey, and those who wanted to go to Israel were brought there in a two-year covert operation.&lt;ref name="Landis" /&gt;

{{disputed section|date=December 2016}}

The [[Tel Or]] village was established in 1930 (or 1932) in [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] in the vicinity of [[Naharayim]] hydroelectric power plant. The village of Tel Or was the only Jewish village in Transjordan at the time. The village was built as housing compound for operation crews of the power plant and their families,&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel'', ed. Raphael Patai, Herzl Press/McGraw Hill, New York, Vol. 2, p.818&lt;/ref&gt; being predominantly Jewish. Tel Or had existed until its depopulation in 1948 during the Arab–Israeli War, when it was overran by the Transjordanian forces. The families of the employees were evacuated in April 1948, leaving behind only workers with Jordanian ID cards. Following a prolonged battle between Yishuv forces and the Transjordanian Arab Legion in the area, the residents of Tel Or were given an ultimatum to surrender or leave the village. The village of Tel Or was shortly abandoned by the residents, who fled to Yishuv-controlled areas to the West of Jordan.

In 1948 during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|Arab–Israeli War]], Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter population of about 2,000 Jews was besieged, and forced to leave en masse. The defenders surrendered on 28 May 1948. Colonel [[Abdullah el Tell]], local commander of the Jordanian [[Arab Legion]], with whom [[Mordechai Weingarten]] negotiated the surrender terms, described the destruction of the Jewish Quarter, in his Memoirs (Cairo, 1959):
[[File:Weingarten and Yehudit.jpg|thumb|right|Weingarten negotiating the surrender with Arab Legion soldiers]]

{{quote|... The operations of calculated destruction were set in motion. ... I knew that the Jewish Quarter was densely populated with Jews who caused their fighters a good deal of interference and difficulty. ... I embarked, therefore, on the shelling of the Quarter with mortars, creating harassment and destruction. ... Only four days after our entry into Jerusalem the Jewish Quarter had become their graveyard. Death and destruction reigned over it. ... As the dawn of Friday, May 28, 1948, was about to break, the Jewish Quarter emerged convulsed in a black cloud—a cloud of death and agony.|Yosef Tekoah (Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations) quoting Abdullah el-Tal.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;}}

Greenwood Publishing Group. 2006: P60. {{ISBN|0-313-32053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the emigration of [[Persian Jews]] from Pahlavy Iran in 1950s and later migration wave from [[Iran]] during and after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, during which the community of 80,000 dropped to less than 20,000.&lt;ref name=Mahdi/&gt; The migration of Persian Jews after Iranian Revolution is mostly attributed to fear of religious persecution,&lt;ref name=Mahdi/&gt; economic hardships and insecurity after the deposition of the Shah regime and consequent [[consolidation of the Iranian Revolution|domestic violence]] and the [[Iran–Iraq War]].

While Iranian constitution generally respects minority rights of non-Muslims (though there are some forms of discrimination), the strong anti-Zionist policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran created a tense and uncomfortable situation for Iranian Jews, who became vulnerable for accusation on alleged collaboration with Israel.

===Turkey===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Turkey|2003 Istanbul bombings}}

When the Republic of Turkey was established in 1923, [[Aliyah]] was not particularly popular among Turkish Jewry; migration from Turkey to Palestine was minimal in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;İlker Aytürk. "Aliya to Mandatory Palestine and Israel". ''Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World''. Executive Editor Norman A. Stillman. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. New York University (NYU). 5 December 2012 [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/aliya-to-mandatory-palestine-and-israel-COM_0001450]&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1923-1948, approximately 7,300 Jews emigrated from Turkey to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=507a|ps=:"From 1923 to the founding of the State of Israel in 1948, it is estimated that 7,308 Jews emigrated from Turkey to Palestine.}} After the [[1934 Thrace pogroms]] following the [[1934 Turkish Resettlement Law]], immigration to Palestine increased; it is estimated that 521 Jews left for Palestine from Turkey in 1934 and 1,445 left in 1935.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=507b}} Immigration to Palestine was organized by the Jewish Agency and the Palestine Aliya Anoar Organization. The [[Varlık Vergisi]], a capital tax established in 1942, was also significant in encouraging emigration from Turkey to Palestine; between 1943 and 1944, 4,000 Jews emigrated."{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508}}

The Jews of Turkey reacted very favorably to the creation of the State of Israel. Between 1948 and 1951, 34,547 Jews immigrated to Israel, nearly 40% of the Jewish population at the time.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508a}} Immigration was stunted for several months in November 1948, when Turkey suspended migration permits as a result of pressure from Arab countries.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=508b|ps=: "Turkey, having not recognized Israel immediately after its proclamation of statehood, suspended permits to emigrate there in November 1948, in response to objections from Arab countries. However, this restriction did not stop the emigration of Jews by illegal means."}}

In March 1949, the suspension was removed when Turkey officially recognized Israel, and emigration continued, with 26,000 emigrating within the same year. The migration was entirely voluntary, and was primary driven by economic factors given the majority of emigrants were from the lower classes.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=505–9|ps=:"However, the emigration of the Jews was not part of a government-mandated population exchange. On the contrary, the Jews immigrated to Israel of their own free will.... In the great wave of 1948–51, a large majority of the emigrants came from the lower classes.... These lower classes were less influenced by the Alliance Israelite Universelle schools and the republic's modernizing trends.... Even so, economic factors were the dominant theme among lower-class emigrants in their motivation to move."}} In fact, the migration of Jews to Israel is the second largest mass emigration wave out of Turkey, the first being the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=505|ps=:"The migration of Jews from Turkey to Israel is the second largest mass emigration movement out of Turkey, the first being labour migration to Europe. The largest mass emigration of minorities from Turkey was that of the Greeks during the Turkish–Greek population exchanges of the early 1920s."}}

After 1951, emigration of Jews from Turkey to Israel slowed materially.{{sfn|Toktas|2006|p=511|ps=:"After the emigration of 34,547 Turkish Jews to Israel in 1948–51, in the period up to 2001 another 27,473 made their way to the Jewish state.... A total of 6,871 emigrants arrived in Israel in 1952–60, 4,793 in 1961–64, 9,280 in 1965–71, 3,118 in 19702–79, 2,088 in 1980–89, 1,215 in 1990–2000, and 108 in 2001.36 The migration figures then decrease greatly. Only 68 immigrants arrived in Israel in 2002, 53 in 2003 and just 52 in 2004."}}

In the mid 1950s, 10% of those who had moved to Israel returned to Turkey. A new synagogue, the [[Neve Shalom Synagogue|Neve Şalom]], was constructed in [[Istanbul]] in 1951. Generally, Turkish Jews in Israel have integrated well into society and are not distinguishable from other Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;Toktas, Sule.

On the night of 6–7 September 1955, the [[Istanbul pogrom]] was unleashed. Although primarily aimed at the city's [[Greeks in Turkey|Greek population]], the Jewish and [[Armenians|Armenian]] communities of Istanbul were also targeted to a degree. The caused damage was mainly material - more than 4,000 shops and 1,000 houses belonging to Greeks, Armenians and Jews were destroyed - but it deeply shocked minorities throughout the country&lt;ref&gt;Dilek Güven, Nationalismus, Sozialer Wandel und Minderheiten: Die Ausschreitungen gegen die Nichtmuslime der Tuerkei (6–7 September 1955), Universitaet Bochum, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with Afghanistan was difficult at this time and with many Jews facing persecution around the world, reports reached the outside world after a delay and were rarely researched thoroughly. 
Jews were allowed to emigrate in 1951 and most moved to Israel and the United States.&lt;ref name="RFL"&gt;New York, 19 June 2007 ([[Radio Free Europe|RFE/RL]]), [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/6/c837c590-c06b-4c30-9017-36f29fc98437.html U.S.: Afghan Jews Keep Traditions Alive Far From Home]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, some 300 remained, and most of these left after the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of 1979]], leaving 10 Afghan Jews in 1996, most of them in [[Kabul]]. More than 10,000 Jews of Afghan descent presently live in Israel. Over 200 families of Afghan Jews live in New York City.&lt;ref name="RFL"/&gt;

At one point it was reported that two Jews were left in Afghanistan and that they did not talk to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Warren |first=Marcus |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1364310/The-last-two-Jews-in-Kabul-fight-like-cat-and-dog.html |title=The last two Jews in Kabul fight like cat and dog |work=The Daily Tlegraph |date=4 December 2001 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
{{see also|History of the Jews in Pakistan}}
At the time of [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Pakistani independence in 1947]], some 1,300 Jews remained in [[Karachi]], many of them [[Bene Israel]] Jews, observing [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Jewish rites. A small [[Ashkenazi]] population was also present in the city. Some Karachi streets still bear names that hark back to a time when the Jewish community was more prominent; such as Ashkenazi Street, Abraham Reuben Street (named after the former member of the Karachi Municipal Corporation), Ibn Gabirol Street, and Moses Ibn Ezra Street—although some streets have been renamed, they are still locally referred to by their original names. A small Jewish graveyard still exists in the vast [[Mewa Shah Graveyard]] near the shrine of a Sufi saint. The neighbourhood of Baghdadi in [[Lyari Town]] is named for the Baghdadi Jews who once lived there. A community of [[Bukharan Jews]] was also found in the city of [[Peshawar]], where many buildings in the old city feature a [[Star of David]] as exterior decor as a sign of the Hebrew origins of its owners. Members of the community settled in the city as merchants as early as the 17th century, although the bulk arrived as refugees fleeing the [[Russian Conquest of Bukhara|advance of the Russian Empire into Bukhara]], and later the Russian Revolution in 1917. Today, there are virtually no Jewish communities remaining in Karachi or Peshawar.

The exodus of Jews from Pakistan to [[Bombay]] and other cities in India came just prior to the creation of Israel in 1948, when anti-Israeli sentiments rose. By 1953, fewer than 500 Jews were reported to reside in all of Pakistan. Anti-Israeli sentiment and violence often flared during ensuing conflicts in the Middle East, resulting in a further movement of Jews out of Pakistan. Presently, a large number of Jews from Karachi live in the city of [[Ramla]] in Israel.

===Sudan===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Sudan}}

The Jewish community in Sudan was concentrated in the capital [[Khartoum]], and had been established in the late 19th century. By the middle of the 20th century the community included some 350 Jews, mainly of Sephardic background, who had constructed a synagogue and a Jewish school. Between 1948 and 1956, some members of the community left the country, and it finally ceased to exist by the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;M. Cohen, ''Know your people, Survey of the world Jewish population''. 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nakham&gt;I. Nakham, ''The notebook of the Jewish community of Sudan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
{{see also|History of the Jews in Bangladesh}}
The Jewish population in [[East Bengal]] was 200 at the time of the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947. They included a [[Baghdadi Jew]]ish merchant community that settled in [[Dhaka]] during the 17th-century. A prominent Jew in [[East Pakistan]] was Mordecai Cohen, who was a Bengali and English newsreader on East Pakistan Television. By the late 1960s, much of the Jewish community had left for [[Calcutta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianjewishlife.org/pages/articles/AJL_Issue_10_Sept2012/AJL_Feature_Unknown-Jews-Bangladesh.html|title=Asian Jewish Life - Feature Issue 10 - The Unknown Jews of Bangladesh|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bechollashon.org/resources/newsletters/05-11/bangladesh-jewish-community.php|title=Be'chol Lashon: Educational Resources: Newsletters: May 2011: Bangladesh – with Jewish connections|publisher=|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table of Jewish population since 1948==
In 1948, there were between 758,000 and 881,000 Jews (see table below) living in communities throughout the Arab world. Today, there are fewer than 8,600. In some Arab states, such as Libya, which was about 3% Jewish, the Jewish community no longer exists; in other Arab countries, only a few hundred Jews remain.

The majority of Jews in Arab countries eventually immigrated to the modern State of Israel.&lt;ref name=Stillmanxxi&gt;Stillman, 2003, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Jews were temporarily settled in the numerous [[immigrant camps (Israel)|immigrant camps]] throughout the country. Those were later transformed into [[ma'abarot]] (transit camps), where tin dwellings were provided to house up to 220,000 residents. The ma'abarot existed until 1963. The population of transition camps was gradually absorbed and integrated into Israeli society. Many of the North African and Middle-Eastern Jews had a hard time adjusting to the new dominant culture, change of lifestyle and there were claims of discrimination.{{Citation needed|reason=at least one specific example of such discrimination is needed|date=February 2014}}

===France===
France was also a major destination and about 50% (300,000 people) of modern French Jews have roots from North Africa. In total, it is estimated that between 1956 and 1967, about 235,000 North African Jews from Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco immigrated to France due to the decline of the French Empire and following the Six-Day War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Esther Benbassa]], ''The Jews of France: A History from Antiquity to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the exodus==

===United States Congress===
In 2003, {{USBill|108|hconres|311}} was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] by pro-Israel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Features/In-Thespotlight/Ileana-Ros-Lehtinen-Ready-to-play-hardball Ileana Ros-Lehtinen: Ready to play hardball], ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', 23 December 2010, "I think she'll be terrific on Israel relations issues. I don't think there's anybody better," assessed [[Morris J. Amitay|Morrie Amitay]], former executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and currently the head of the staunchly pro-Israel Washington Political Action Committee. "She's 100 percent behind making Israel secure. I can't think of any issue affecting Israel in which she hasn't been on the right side," enthused Amitay, whose PAC has funded her campaigns generously over the years"&lt;/ref&gt; congresswoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]]. In 2004 [[simple resolution]]s {{USBill|108|hres|838}} and {{USBill|108|sres|325}} were issued into the House of Representatives and [[United States Senate|Senate]] by [[Jerrold Nadler]] and [[Rick Santorum]], respectively. In 2007 simple resolutions {{USBill|110|hres|185}} and {{USBill|110|sres|85}} were issued into the House of Representatives and Senate. The resolutions had been written together with lobbyist group [[Justice for Jews from Arab Countries|JJAC]],{{sfn|Fischbach|2008}} whose founder Stanley Urman described the resolution in 2009 as "perhaps our most significant accomplishment"&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Urman, [http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/bff9ff349ebb4792d7948cd641952cca058c1d34.pdf "Seeking Justice for Displaced Jews"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610042110/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/bff9ff349ebb4792d7948cd641952cca058c1d34.pdf |date=10 June 2012 }}, Justice for Jews from Arab Countries, American Sephardi Federation, [[World Jewish Congress]], transcript from Strategic Review Phase II, October 2009. Quote: "Perhaps our most significant accomplishment was the adoption in April 2008 by the United States Congress of Resolution 185, which granted the first-ever recognition of Jewish refugees from the Arab countries. This now requires US diplomats in all Middle East negotiations to refer to a quote of what the resolution calls 'multiple population of refugees' with a specific injunction that hands forth any specific reference and 'any specific reference to the Palestinian refugees must be matched by an explicit reference to Jewish refugees' ... our mandate is to follow that lead. Any explicit reference to Palestinians should be followed by explicit reference to Jewish refugees."&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives resolution was sponsored by Jerrold Nadler, who followed the resolutions in 2012 with House Bill {{USBill|112|hr|6242}}. The 2007–08 resolutions proposed that any "comprehensive Middle East peace agreement to be credible and enduring, the agreement must address and resolve all outstanding issues relating to the legitimate rights of all refugees, including Jews, Christians and other populations displaced from countries in the Middle East", and encourages President [[Barack Obama]] and his administration to mention Jewish and other refugees when mentioning Palestinian refugees at international forums. The 2012 bill, which was moved to committee, proposed to recognize the plight of "850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab countries", as well as other refugees, such as Christians from the Middle East, North Africa, and the Persian Gulf.

Jerrold Nadler explained his view in 2012 that "the suffering and terrible injustices visited upon Jewish refugees in the Middle East needs to be acknowledged. It is simply wrong to recognize the rights of Palestinian refugees without recognizing the rights of nearly 1 million Jewish refugees who suffered terrible outrages at the hands of their former compatriots."&lt;ref name="HR 185 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Congress-considers-recognizing-Jewish-refugees |title=Congress considers recognizing Jewish refugees |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |agency=JTA |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HR 185"&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/jewish-refugees-bill-being-considered-by-u-s-house-of-representatives-1.455503 |title=Jewish refugees bill being considered by U.S. House of Representatives |work=Haaretz |agency=JTA |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Recognition House"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4262885,00.html |title=House members seek recognition for Jewish refugees from Arab countries |publisher=Yedioth Ahronot |date=31 July 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have suggested the campaign is simply an anti-Palestinian "tactic",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Refugee Repatriation: Justice, Responsibility and Redress|first=Megan|last=Bradley|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9781107026315|page=91|quote="Although this is arguably not so much an attempt to secure meaningful redress for the Mizrahi as a tactic to stymie any productive discussion of the Palestinians claims, the campaign has been well-received in the United States, with resolutions on the issue introduced in the Senate and House of Representatives in February 2007."}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Michael Fischbach explains as "a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli–Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischbach|2008|ps=:"On 1 April 2008, the New York–based coalition Justice for Jews from Arab Countries (JJAC) announced that the U.S. House of Representatives had passed Resolution 185 (H.Res. 185), a nonbinding "sense of the House" resolution concerning the fate of 800,000 Jews who left Arab countries in the wake of the first Arab–Israeli war of 1948, some without their property. Describing these Jews as "refugees", the resolution called on the U.S. president to ensure that American representatives participating in international fora refer to the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries whenever mention is made of the 1948 Palestinian refugees. H.Res. 185—which JJAC helped to write—was not an effort to demand compensation for Jewish property losses in the Arab world, but rather a tactic to help the Israeli government deflect Palestinian refugee claims in any final Israeli–Palestinian peace deal, claims that include Palestinian refugees' demand for the 'right of return' to their pre-1948 homes in Israel."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli government position===
The issue of comparison of the Jewish exodus with the Palestinian exodus was raised by the Israeli Foreign Ministry as early as 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Ministry for Foreign Affairs, Information Division. ''The Jewish Exodus from the Arab Countries, and the Arab Refugees''. 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a special campaign on behalf of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries was established and gained momentum. The campaign urges the creation of an international fund that would compensate both Jewish and [[Palestinian Arabs|Palestinian Arab]] refugees, and would document and research the plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries.&lt;ref name="2012 campaign"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-urges-ban-ki-moon-to-place-plight-of-post-1948-jewish-refugees-on-un-agenda/ |title=Israel urges Ban Ki-moon to place plight of post-1948 Jewish refugees on UN agenda |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=21 September 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |author=Gur, Haviv Retting}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the campaign plans to create a national day of recognition in Israel to remember the 850,000 Jewish refugees from Arab countries, as well as to build a museum that would document their history, cultural heritage, and collect their testimony.&lt;ref name="Step up"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=282835 |title=Gov't steps up campaign for Jewish Arab refugees |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=28 August 2012 |accessdate=22 September 2012 |author=Sharon, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2012, a special event was held at the United Nations to highlight the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries. Israeli ambassador [[Ron Prosor]] asked the United Nations to "establish a center of documentation and research" that would document the "850,000 untold stories" and "collect the evidence to preserve their history", which he said was ignored for too long. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister [[Danny Ayalon]] said that "We are 64 years late, but we are not too late." Diplomats from approximately two dozen countries and organizations, including the United States, the European Union, Germany, Canada, Spain, and Hungary attended the event. In addition, Jews from Arab countries attended and spoke at the event.&lt;ref name="2012 campaign"/&gt;

===Jewish "Nakba" narrative===

====Comparison with Palestinian Naqba====
In response to the Palestinian Nakba narrative, the term "Jewish Nakba" is sometimes used to refer to the persecution and expulsion of Jews from Arab countries in the years and decades following the creation of the State of Israel. Israeli columnist [[Ben Dror Yemini]], himself a Mizrahi Jew, wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Dror Yemini |title=The Jewish Nakba: Expulsions, Massacres and Forced Conversions |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/891/209.html |work=Maariv |date=16 May 2009 |accessdate=23 June 2009 |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|However, there is another Nakba: the Jewish Nakba. During those same years [the 1940s], there was a long line of slaughters, of pogroms, of property confiscation and of deportations against Jews in Islamic countries. This chapter of history has been left in the shadows. The Jewish Nakba was worse than the Palestinian Nakba. The only difference is that the Jews did not turn that Nakba into their founding ethos. To the contrary.}}

Professor [[Ada Aharoni]], chairman of The World Congress of the Jews from Egypt, argues in an article entitled "What about the Jewish Nakba?" that exposing the truth about the expulsion of the Jews from Arab states could facilitate a genuine peace process, since it would enable Palestinians to realize they were not the only ones who suffered, and thus their sense of "victimization and rejectionism" will decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ada|last=Aharoni |title=What about Jewish Nakba? |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3743829,00.html |work=YnetNews |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Canadian MP and international human rights lawyer [[Irwin Cotler]] has referred to the "double Nakba". He criticizes the Arab states' rejectionism of the Jewish state, their subsequent invasion to destroy the newly formed nation, and the punishment meted out against their local Jewish populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Irwin |last=Cotler |title=The double Nakba |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=30 June 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2011 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=106021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The result was, therefore, a double Nakba: not only of Palestinian-Arab suffering and the creation of a Palestinian refugee problem, but also, with the assault on Israel and on Jews in Arab countries, the creation of a second, much less known, group of refugees—Jewish refugees from Arab countries.}}

====Criticism of Jewish Naqba narrative in Israel====
Iraqi-born [[Ran Cohen]], a former member of the [[Knesset]], said: "I have this to say: I am not a refugee. I came at the behest of Zionism, due to the pull that this land exerts, and due to the idea of redemption. Nobody is going to define me as a refugee." Yemeni-born [[Yisrael Yeshayahu]], former Knesset speaker, Labor Party, stated: "We are not refugees. [Some of us] came to this country before the state was born. We had messianic aspirations." And Iraqi-born [[Shlomo Hillel]], also a former speaker of the Knesset, Labor Party, claimed: "I do not regard the departure of Jews from Arab lands as that of refugees. They came here because they wanted to, as Zionists."&lt;ref name=Shenhav2/&gt;

Historian [[Tom Segev]] stated: "Deciding to emigrate to Israel was often a very personal decision. It was based on the particular circumstances of the individual's life. They were not all poor, or 'dwellers in dark caves and smoking pits'. Nor were they always subject to persecution, repression or discrimination in their native lands. They emigrated for a variety of reasons, depending on the country, the time, the community, and the person."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palestinechronicle.com/view_article_details.php?id=15627 "Arab Jews and Myths of Expulsion and Exchange"] The Palestine Chronicles.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=November 2010}}

Iraqi-born Israeli historian [[Avi Shlaim]], speaking of the wave of Iraqi Jewish migration to Israel, concludes that, even though Iraqi Jews were "victims of the Israeli-Arab conflict", Iraqi Jews aren't refugees, saying "nobody expelled us from Iraq, nobody told us that we were unwanted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Meron Rapoport |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/611505.html |title=No peaceful solution |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=11 August 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050814015754/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/611505.html |archivedate=14 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He restated that case in a review of [[Martin Gilbert]]'s book, ''In Ishmael's House''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/8ae6559c-b169-11df-b899-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1u5I93QVU "In Ishmael's house"] ''[[Financial Times]]''. 30 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yehuda Shenhav]] has criticized the analogy between Jewish emigration from Arab countries and the Palestinian exodus. He also says "The unfounded, immoral analogy between Palestinian refugees and Mizrahi immigrants needlessly embroils members of these two groups in a dispute, degrades the dignity of many Mizrahi Jews, and harms prospects for genuine Jewish-Arab reconciliation." He has stated that "the campaign's proponents hope their efforts will prevent conferral of what is called a 'right of return' on Palestinians, and reduce the size of the compensation Israel is liable to be asked to pay in exchange for Palestinian property appropriated by the state guardian of 'lost' assets."&lt;ref name=Shenhav2/&gt;

Israeli historian [[Yehoshua Porath]] has rejected the comparison, arguing that while there is a superficial similarity, the ideological and historical significance of the two population movements are entirely different. Porath points out that the immigration of Jews from Arab countries to Israel, expelled or not, was the "fulfilment of a national dream". He also argues that the achievement of this Zionist goal was only made possible through the endeavors of the Jewish Agency's agents, teachers, and instructors working in various Arab countries since the 1930s. Porath contrasts this with the Palestinian Arabs' flight of 1948 as completely different. He describes the outcome of the Palestinian's flight as an "unwanted national calamity" that was accompanied by "unending personal tragedies". The result was "the collapse of the Palestinian community, the fragmentation of a people, and the loss of a country that had in the past been mostly Arabic-speaking and Islamic. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yehoshua|last=Porath |title=Mrs. Peters's Palestine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1986/jan/16/mrs-peterss-palestine/?pagination=false |work= ''The New York Review of Books |date=16 January 1986 |accessdate=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alon Liel, a former director-general of the Foreign Ministry says that many Jews escaped from Arab countries, but he does not call them "Refugees" since his definition for the term "Refugee" is different from [[UNWRA]]'s [[Palestinian refugee#UNRWA|definition]].&lt;ref name=TOI/&gt;

====Criticism of Jewish Naqba narrative by Palestinians====
On 21 September 2012, at a [[United Nations]] conference, the issue of Jewish refugees from Arab countries was criticized by [[Hamas]] spokesman, Sami Abu Zuhri, who stated that the Jewish refugees from Arab countries were in fact responsible for the Palestinian displacement and that "those Jews are criminals rather than refugees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=285923 | title=Hamas: Arab Jews are not refugees, but criminals | publisher=Jerusalem Post | accessdate=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regard to the same conference, Palestinian politician [[Hanan Ashrawi]] has argued that Jews from Arab lands are not refugees at all and that Israel is using their claims in order to counterbalance to those of Palestinian refugees against it.&lt;ref name=jpost2012&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Hamas-Arab-Jews-are-not-refugees-but-criminals |title=Hamas: 'Arab Jews' are not refugees, but criminals |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=23 September 2012 |accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashrawi said that "If Israel is their homeland, then they are not 'refugees'; they are emigrants who returned either voluntarily or due to a political decision."&lt;ref name=jpost2012/&gt;

==Property losses and compensation==
In Libya, Iraq and Egypt many Jews lost vast portions of their wealth and property as part of the exodus because of severe restrictions on moving their wealth out of the country.

In the North Africa, the situation was more complex. For example, in Morocco emigrants were not allowed to take more than $60 worth of Moroccan currency with them, although generally they were able to sell their property prior to leaving,{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=94}} and some were able to work around the currency restrictions by exchanging cash into jewelry or other portable valuables.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=94}} This led some scholars to speculate the North African Jewish population, comprising two thirds of the exodus, on the whole did not suffer large property losses.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=88|ps=: "[In] the Maghrib countries of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria, Jews largely did not suffer large-scale property losses upon emigration.... Because proper dispossession largely was not a problem for Jewish emigrants from the Maghrib, it is difficult to find much information about Jewish property there."}} However, opinions on this differ.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Yemeni Jews were usually able to sell what property they possessed prior to departure, although not always at market rates.{{sfn|Fischbach|2008|p=49|quote=: "In fact, by and large, property dispossession did not feature into the saga of the Jewish exodus from Yemen. Yemeni Jewish emigrants usually sold what property they possessed prior to departure, although not always at market rates. others were so poor as to own practically nothing to begin with."}}

===Estimated value===
Various estimates of the value of property abandoned by the Jewish exodus have been published, with wide variety in the quoted figures from a few billion dollars to hundreds of billions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hirschberg, Private Property Keep Out!, Jerusalem Report 10th Anniversary, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', September 1999, "In 1945 there were 870,000 Jews living in the Middle East and North Africa. By 1952, hundreds of thousands had arrived in Israel, and tens of thousands had reached Western Europe and North and South America. Estimates on the collective value of the property they left behind vary wildly - from a few billion dollars to more than $100 billion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Organization of Jews from Arab Countries (WOJAC) estimated in 2006, that Jewish property abandoned in Arab countries would be valued at more than $100 billion, later revising their estimate in 2007 to $300 billion. They also estimated Jewish-owned real-estate left behind in Arab lands at 100,000 square kilometers (four times the size of the state of Israel).&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;LNGID=1&amp;FID=388&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2196|title=The Palestinian Refugee Issue: Rhetoric vs. Reality by Sidney Zabludoff|work=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=38842 |title=Jews forced out of Arab countries seek reparations |publisher=www.jpost.com |accessdate=16 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ejhdoal&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=82191 |title=Expelled Jews hold deeds on abandoned property in Arab lands |publisher=www.jpost.com |accessdate=16 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The type and extent of linkage between the Jewish exodus from Arab countries and the 1948 Palestinian exodus has also been the source of controversy. Advocacy groups have suggested that there are strong ties between the two processes and some of them even claim that decoupling the two issues is unjust.&lt;ref name=Mendes&gt;Mendes, Philip.

[[Holocaust restitution]] expert Sidney Zabludoff, writing for the Israeli-advocacy group [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], suggests that the losses sustained by the Jews who fled Arab countries since 1947 amounts to $700m at period prices based on an estimated per capita wealth of $700 multiplied by one million refugees, equating to $6 billion today, assuming that the entire exodus left all of their wealth behind.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;LNGID=1&amp;FID=388&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=2196 The Palestinian Refugee Issue: Rhetoric vs. Reality]", Sidney Zabludoff, ''Jewish Political Studies Review'' 20:1–2 (Spring 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israeli position===
The official position of the Israeli government is that Jews from Arab countries are considered refugees, and it considers their rights to property left in countries of origin as valid and existent.&lt;ref name=MOJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.il/MOJEng/Rights+of+Jews+from+Arab+Lands/|title=Rights of Jews from Arab Lands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Sephardi party, [[Shas]], announced its intention to seek compensation for Jewish refugees from Arab states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/shas-to-seek-payout-for-jews-deported-from-arab-countries-1.258142|title=Shas to seek payout for Jews deported from Arab countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Israeli lawmakers introduced a bill into the Knesset to make compensation for Jews from Arab and Muslim countries an integral part of any future peace negotiations by requiring compensation on behalf of current Jewish Israeli citizens, who were expelled from Arab countries after Israel was established in 1948 and leaving behind a significant amount of valuable property. In February 2010, the bill passed its first reading. The bill was sponsored by MK [[Nissim Ze'ev]] (Shas) and follows a resolution passed in the United States House of Representatives in 2008, calling for refugee recognition to be extended to Jews and Christians similar to that extended to Palestinians in the course of Middle East peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;Kliger, Rachelle [http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=169043 Israel vies to bring Mideast Jewish refugees into talks] (18 February 2010) in ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG202&gt;{{harvnb| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=202}}: "For the first few weeks after the enactment of the law, the Zionist activists forbade registration; they were waiting for a clarification of the aliyah routes and a decision by the Israeli government as to its willingness to take in the Jews of Iraq. This ban heightened the tension in the Jewish community. On 8 April 1950, the Zionist leadership (that is, the leaders of Hehalutz and the Haganah, along with the emissaries) convened and discussed the registration issue in view of the pressure from huge numbers of people who wanted to sign up. At the end of the meeting the leadership decided to instruct the people to register and not to wait for instructions from Tel Aviv. A bomb had blown up that day in a Jewish cafe, wounding four people, and the two events were presumably related.... The activists' faith in the Zionist ideal and their zeal to implement it, combined with their confidence that Israel would not ignore the aliyah needs of Iraqi Jewry, paved the way to this decision. To inform the Jews of the decision, the leadership issued a proclamation.... The fact that the proclamation was written in the name of the State of Israel lent it added force and gave the Jews the impression that the State of Israel and the Israeli government were calling on them to leave Iraq and move to Israel."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG204&gt;{{harvnb | Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=204}}: "As stated above, this situation was a consequence of the Israeli immigration and absorption policy. Throughout this period, Israel refused to instruct its emissaries in Baghdad to limit registration for emigration and instead expressed willingness to take in all Iraqi Jews who wished to leave. But immigrants were also flooding into Israel at the time from Poland and especially from Romania, where the exit gates had unexpectedly been re-opened, and Israel was unwilling to limit aliyah from there either. Israel could not afford the initial absorption of such large numbers of immigrants and therefore set quotas based on priorities. And Poland and Romania were given priority over Iraq.... The reason given for according priority to immigration from eastern Europe was concern that the communist regimes there would close their gates and put an end to the exodus.... Ben-Gurion maintained that the Iraqi leaders were determined to get rid of the Jews who had signed up to emigrate and assumed that delaying their departure would not put an end to the process. In contrast, he was afraid that aliyah from Romania would be terminated suddenly by an order from high up, and aliyah from Poland was expected to stop at the beginning of 1951."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG203&gt;{{harvnb | Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=203}}: "The change began as a result of the immigration policy of the Israeli government: the pace of aliyah lagged far behind registration and revocation of the registrants' citizenship.&lt;br&gt;By September 1950, only 10,000 Jews had left; 60,000 of the 70,000 registrants were still in Iraq. The problem grew worse. By mid-November only 18,000 of 83,000 registrants had left. Matters had not improved by early January 1951: the number of registrants was up to 86,000, only about 23,000 of whom had left. More than 60,000 Jews were still waiting to leave! According to the law, Jews who had lost their citizenship had to leave Iraq within 15 days. Although in theory, only 12,000 Jews still in Iraq had completed the registration process and had their citizenship revoked, the position of the others was not very different: the Iraqi government was in no hurry to revoke their citizenship only because the rate of departure was already lagging behind the revocation of citizenship, and it did not want to exacerbate the problem.&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, thousands of Jews had been fired from their jobs, had sold their property, and were waiting for Israeli aircraft, using up their meagre funds in the meantime. The thousands of poor Jews who had left or been expelled from the peripheral cities, and who had gone to Baghdad to wait for their opportunity to emigrate, were in an especially bad state. They were housed in public buildings and were being supported by the Jewish community. The situation was intolerable."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=MG205&gt;{{harvnb| Meir-Glitzenstein|2004|p=205}}: "But soon the delay in evacuating the Jews became the problem of the Iraqi state and not just that of the would-be emigrants and the emissaries. The condition of the Jews had ramifications for the overall political situation, domestic security and the Iraqi economy. The Iraqi government found that the problems of instability and turmoil not only remained unsolved but had become worse. Particularly infuriating was the awareness that the source of the problem was the Israeli government, which held the key to the volume and rate of departure of Iraqi Jewry.&lt;br&gt;These developments changed Iraq's attitude towards the Jews. From now on Iraq sought to get rid of everyone who had registered immediately and at almost any price. This policy was exacerbated when, in mid-September 1950, Nuri al-Said replaced Tawfiq aI-Suwaydi, who had initiated the Denaturalization Law, as prime minister. Nuri was determined to drive the Jews out of his country as quickly as possible, and when he discovered that Israel was unwilling to increase immigration quotas he suggested various ideas for expelling the Jews."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Bashkin277&gt;{{harvnb|Bashkin|2012|p=277}}: "By 1951 Sa'id realized that the Jews were about to leave Iraq, and wanted to see them depart immediately regardless of the Palestinian question.The British report that he asked the Jordanians to stop deceiving refugees on the possibility of their being admitted to Israel and for all Arab countries to take steps to resettle them. FO 371/91635, 15 January 1951, from Sir A. Kirkbride (Amman) to Foreign Office (London) (a report on Nuri Sa'id's visit to Jordan)."&lt;/ref&gt;

It arose from a decision of the Iraqi government to retaliate for the expulsion of Arab refugees from Palestine by forcing the majority of the Jewish community of Iraq to go to Israel. Nuri Said, the Prime Minister of Iraq, who was on a visit to Amman, came out with the astounding proposition that a convoy of Iraqi Jews should be brought over in army lorries escorted by armed cars, taken to the Jordanian-Israeli frontier and forced to cross the line. Quite apart from the certainty that the Israelis would not consent to receive the deportees in that manner, the passage of the Jews through Jordan would almost certainly have touched off serious trouble among the very disgruntled Arab refugees who were crowded into the country. Either the Iraqi Jews would have been massacred or their Iraqi guards would have had to shoot other Arabs to protect the lives of their charges. The devious method employed by Nuri Said to make the suggestion was, in itself, enough to upset the King and the cabinet, who still resented the way in which they had been left In the lurch by the Iraqi Government in the Armistice negotiations. Nuri first telephoned me asking to be received at my house with [[Samir al-Rifai|Samir Rifa'i]] to discuss an important question about Palestine. I agreed to the meeting on the natural assumption that Samlr already knew all about it. Nuri then spoke to Samlr and told him that I wanted to see both of them at my house. The latter assumed that the initiative came from myself. When we got together and Nuri made his proposal, and added the equally surprising statement that he would be responsible for the consequences, Samir and I were flabbergasted and our faces must have shown our feelings. Both of us were vexed at having been tricked into a false position. I replied at once that the matter at issue was no concern of His Majesty's Government. Samlr refused his assent as politely as possible, but Nuri lost his temper at being rebuffed and he said: 'So. you do not want to do It, do you?' Samlr snapped back, 'Of course I do not want to be party to such a crime', Nuri thereupon exploded with rage and I began to wonder what the head of the diplomatic mlsslon would do if two Prime Ministers came to blows in his study. We then broke up in disorder, but I got them out of the house while preserving a minimum of propriety.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews abandoned Lar and Jabrom, which were never resettled, and emigrated to Shiraz and thence to Palestine, where they joined the numerous Shirazis who had previously escaped. Just after the holiday of Sukkot in 1910, a pogrom organized by the apostate Qavam family resulted in thirteen deaths, injury, theft. vandalism and near starvation for the 6000 Jews of Shiraz (Alliance, 1910:229—245). }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

The '''Mining Code''', '''Mining Law''' or '''Miners' Law''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Закон о рудницима}}) or '''Novo Brdo Code''' ({{lang|sr|Новобрдски законик}}),  is a compilation of laws on mining in the [[Serbian Despotate]], enacted by Despot [[Stefan Lazarević]] on 29 January 1412, formulated earlier in 1390. Apart from mining laws, there are legal provisions concerning the organization and life in [[Novo Brdo Fortress|Novo Brdo]] ({{lang|sr|Статут Новог Брда}}, the ''Statute of Novo Brdo''), a city which at that time was the largest mine in the Balkans. The compilation is survived in several later transcripts, of which a 16th-century illustrated manuscript is regarded the most important.

'''Peter Marx''' is an American lawyer and business executive. He is known for coining the term "Information law". Marx is currently the President of the [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] Public Media Corporation Board of Directors. He is also the former host of the public television show ''Business Insight''.

==Education==
Peter Marx received a BA, MBA, and JD from [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref name=Marx&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EAa6jwEACAAJ|title=Information Law: A Compilation of Articles|first=Peter|last=Marx|date=14 May 2016|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|via=Google Books|isbn=9781533049032}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Career==
Between 1968 and 1971 Peter Marx was a staff attorney with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]. In the early 1980s, Marx served as the vice president and general counsel of Chase Econometrics/[[Interactive Data Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;Jon Zonderman. “The Lawyer turns Pitchman”. Boston Business Journal. November 15, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Marx chaired several legal technology forums that focused on the future of law in technology and intellectual property,&lt;ref&gt;Dan Hall. “Computer Law Forum a Response to More High-Tech Lawsuits”. New England Business Journal. January 3, 1983. Pages 33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; including the New England Computer Law Forum.&lt;ref name=Dooley&gt;Bill Dooley. “High-Tech Law a Specialty for Part-Time Legal Firm”. MIS Week. August 10, 1987. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  

He was then a partner at the Goulston &amp; Storrs law firm in Boston where he became an expert in the developing application of the law to computer technology companies. During the 1980s, Marx advocated for companies and clients to better understand their rights in order to pursue potential market opportunities as the laws evolved around the industry; and for government to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Berney. “Lawyers for a High Technology Age”. Nation’s Business. February 1986. Page 67-68.&lt;/ref&gt; He then became general counsel to the five-hundred member firm group the Information Industry Association, and served as chairman of the New England Corporate Counsel Association (an industry group for northeastern [[in-house counsel]] that he cofounded).&lt;ref name=Dooley /&gt; Beginning in 1987, Marx was the chairman of The Marx Group, a law and consulting firm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=cxcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|title=Network World|first=IDG Network World|last=Inc|date=11 July 1994|publisher=IDG Network World Inc|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided part-time counsel and legal help for technology companies unable to retain full-time in-house legal help.&lt;ref name=Dooley /&gt;

==Media==
In the mid-2000s, Marx produced podcasts and videos for major law firms targeted at law students and associates.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2006/10/law-firms-use-podcasts-2006-10-02.html&lt;/ref&gt; Marx also hosted the television series ''Business Insight'' on public access television, in which he interviewed entrepreneurs and other business individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMVnrzLYikU|title=Business Insight - "What To Do When You're New"|last=Wellesley Public Media|date=5 May 2016|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/Business_Insight_with_Peter_Marx|title=Business Insight with Peter Marx|last=Wellesley Public Media|date=16 November 2011|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the President of the [[Wellesley, Massachusetts|Wellesley]] Public Media Corporation Board of Directors,&lt;ref name=Wes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesleymedia.org/staff--board.html|title=Staff &amp; Board|website=Wellesley Public Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patch.com/massachusetts/wellesley/wellesley-free-library-foundation-receives-a-50k-grant-from-wellesley-media-corporation|title=Wellesley Free Library Foundation Receives a 50K Grant from Wellesley Media Corporation|date=11 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the current director of the Cornell Law School’s Alumni Helping Alumni careers program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawschool.cornell.edu/alumni/Alumni-Helping-Alumni.cfm|title=Alumni Helping Alumni|first=Instructional and Web Services, Cornell Information|last=Technologies|website=www.lawschool.cornell.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
Marx is the author of ''Information Law: A Compilation of Articles'', in which he first coined the term “Information Law” in 1985.&lt;ref name=Marx /&gt; He later wrote the ''Contracts in the Information Industry'' series of books, published by the [[Information Industry Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0267-3649(89)90043-5 |title=Contracts in the information industry |journal=Computer Law &amp; Security Review |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=28 |year=1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political organization''' is any [[organization]] that involves itself in the [[politics|political]] process, including [[political parties]], [[non-governmental organizations]], [[advocacy groups]] and [[special interest groups]]. Political organizations are those engaged in political activities (e.g., [[lobbying]], [[community organizing]], [[campaign advertising]], etc.) aimed at achieving clearly-defined political goals, which typically benefit the interests of their members.

While parties are one type of political organisation that may engage in some or all of those activities, they are distinct in that they typically focus on supporting [[candidates]] for public office, winning [[elections]] and controlling [[government]].

==Political parties==
{{Party politics}}

The most well-known type of political organization is the [[political party]]. Political parties are directly involved in the political processes of countries with party systems, of which there are several types.

Some of the most common types are [[democracy|democratic multi-party systems]], [[totalitarianism|single party dictatorships]], and  [[two party system]]s.

===Democratic systems===

In democratic multi-party systems such as India, Pakistan, etc., there is no restriction on the number of parties allowed to be in operation at any given time. Under these types of systems, people are free to participate in the political process both through elections and by forming their own political parties as they please.

Examples of multi-party systems are:
* {{flag|Bangladesh}}
* {{flag|Canada}}
* {{flag|France}}
* {{flag|Germany}}
* {{flag|India}}
* {{flag|Italy}}
* {{flag|Pakistan}}
* {{flag|South Africa}}
* {{flag|Taiwan}}

===Single party systems===
In single-party systems, one political party exercises control over the government. Unlike under other systems, single-party systems do not necessarily extend democratic privileges to the citizens. This means that citizens have little say regarding political subjects.

Examples of single-party systems are:
* {{flag|China}}
* {{flag|Cuba}}
* {{flag|Laos}}
* {{flag|North Korea}}
* {{flag|Vietnam}}

===Two-party systems===

Two-party systems are similar to multiparty systems in that power is not concentrated in one party and that parties have to consider the opinion of the general public in order to retain power by winning elections. However, two-party systems restrict the people's democratic rights by not authorizing the citizen's to found their own political parties.

Most two-party systems are technically multiparty systems but all power is effectively concentrated amongst two parties or coalitions.

Examples of two-party systems are:
* {{flag|United States}}
* {{flag|Nepal}}

==Party coalitions==

Another type of political organization is the party coalition. A party coalition is a group of political parties operating together in [[parliament]]. Oftentimes, party coalitions are formed after elections have taken place and no party has clearly won a majority seat in parliament (e.g. the [[Government of Delhi|AAP-Congress Government]] in [[Delhi]]). Other coalitions are formed prior to elections and are effectively agreements between two or more parties to run jointly in elections and to pursue similar agendas (e.g. the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] in India, and the [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal/National Coalition]] in Australia).

==Labour unions==
{{labour}}

A labor union (or trade union) is a political organization formed to promote the interests of workers.

Labour unions have various roles in modern politics, including:
* Organising [[strike action]]s and [[general strike]]s
* Negotiating with employers on behalf of workers
* Ensuring that workers aren't fired without severance pay
* Assuring that workers receive reasonable salaries

Unlike other political organizations, labor unions do not directly participate in elections, although they may campaign for parties and politicians supporting their positions. Labour unionization is a way for workers to maintain unity and preserve their rights. Often, major corporations antagonize the principle of labor unionization since it results in heavier employment regulations which restrict the powers of big business to fire workers at will, effectively causing economic difficulties for such companies.

{{Politics |Related}}

'''Political psychology''' is an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] academic field dedicated to understanding [[politics]], [[politician]]s and [[political behavior]] from a [[psychology|psychological]] perspective. The relationship between politics and psychology is considered bi-directional, with psychology being used as a lens for understanding politics and politics being used as a lens for understanding psychology. As an interdisciplinary field, political psychology borrows from a wide range of other disciplines, including: [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], [[Media (communication)|media]], [[journalism]] and [[history]].

Political psychology aims to understand interdependent relationships between individuals and contexts that are influenced by beliefs, motivation, perception, cognition, information processing, learning strategies, socialization and attitude formation. Political psychological theory and approaches have been applied in many contexts such as: leadership role; domestic and foreign policy making; behavior in ethnic violence, war and genocide; group dynamics and conflict; racist behavior; voting attitudes and motivation; voting and the role of the media; nationalism; and political extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition = 2nd |publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essence political psychologists study the foundations, dynamics, and outcomes of political behavior using cognitive and social explanations.

==History and early influences==

===France===
Political psychology originated from Western Europe, France, where it was closely tied to the emergence of new disciplines and paradigms as well as to the precise social and political context in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., 'Outline of a cultural history of political psychology'. Chapter 1, pp. 3-22 in: Stone, W. &amp; Schaffner, P. (1988), The psychology of politics. New York: Springer (2nd ed.). More elaborate backgrounds in: Van Ginneken. J. (1992). Crowds, psychology and politics. New York: Cambridge University Press. And its sequel: Van Ginneken, J. (2007). Mass movements. Apeldoorn (Neth.): Spinhuis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The discipline political psychology was formally introduced during the Franco-Prussian war and the socialist revolution, stirred by the rise of the [[Paris Commune]] (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "political psychology" was first introduced by the [[ethnologist]] Adolph Bastian in his book ''[[Man in History]]'' (1860). The philosopher [[Hippolyte Taine]] (1828–1893), a founder of the Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, applied Bastian's theories in his works ''[[The Origins of Contemporary France]]'' (1875–1893), to ideas on the founding and development of the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]. The head of Ecole Libre de Sciences Politiques, [[Emile Boutmy]] (1835–1906), was a famous explorer of social, political and geographical concepts of national interactions. He contributed various works on political psychology such as ''English People; A study of their Political Psychology'' (1901) and ''The American People; Elements of Their Political Psychology'' (1902).&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rudmin |first=F. W. |title= G.B.Grundy's 1917 Proposal for Political Psychology: "A science shich has yet to be Created" |journal= ISPP News |year=2005 |volume=16 |pages=6–7 |url= http://www.humiliationstudies.org/documents/RudminGrundyBio6.pdf|accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributor of [[Crowd psychology|crowd theory]] [[Gustave Le Bon]] (1841–1931) suggested that crowd activity subdued will and polluted rational thought which resulted in uncontrollable impulses and emotions. He suggested in his works ''Psychology of Socialism'' (1896) and ''Political Psychology and Social Defense'' (1910)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Monroe, K.R.|year=2002 |title= Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers| page= 71}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in the uncontrollable state of a crowd people were more vulnerable to submission and leadership, and suggested that embracing [[nationalism]] would remedy this.

===Italy===
Meanwhile in Italy, the [[Risorgimento]] (1870) instigated various social reforms and voting rights. The large division in social class during this period led lawyer [[Gaetano Mosca]] (1858–1914) to publish his work, ''The Ruling Class: Elements of Political Science'' (1896), which theorized the presence of the ruling and the ruled classes of all societies.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The psychology of Politics|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing| page= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vilfredo Pareto]] (1828–1923), inspired by Mosca's concepts, contributed ''The Rise and Fall of the Elites'' (1901) and ''The Socialist System'' (1902–1903) to the discipline of political psychology, theorizing on the role of class and social systems. His work ''[[The Mind and Society]]'' (1916) offers a sociology [[treatise]].&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1"&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.9)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosca and Pareto's texts on the Italian elite contributed to the theories of Robert Michels (1875–1936). Michels was a German socialist fascinated by the distinction between the largely lower class run parliament in Germany and upper class run parliament in Italy. He wrote ''Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchic Tendencies of Modern Democracy'' (1911).&lt;ref name="VanGinneken-c1" /&gt;

===Austria===
A large psychoanalytical influence was contributed to the discipline of political psychology by [[Sigmund Freud]] (1856–1939). His texts ''[[Totem and Taboo]]'' (1913) and ''[[Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego]]'' (1921) linked psychoanalysis with politics. Freud and [[William Christian Bullitt, Jr.|Bullitt]] (1967) developed the first psychobiographical explanation to how the personality characteristics of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] affected his decision making during World War I. [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957), inspired by the effects of World War II, was interested in whether personality types varied according to epoch, culture and class. He described the bidirectional effect of group, society and the environment with personality. He combined Freudian and [[Marxist]] theories in his book ''[[The Mass Psychology of Fascism]]'' (1933). He also edited ''The Journal for Political Psychology and Sexual Economy'' (1934–1938) which was the first journal to present political psychology in the principal of western language.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.11)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany, novice political alterations and [[fascist]] control during World War II spurred research into authoritarianism from [[Frankfurt school]]. Philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] (1898–1979) opened up issues concerning freedom and authority in his book, ''[[Reason and Revolution: Hegel and the Rise of Social Theory]]'' (1941), where he suggested groups compromise on individual rights. [[Theodor Adorno]] (1903–1969) also investigated authoritarian individuals and anti-Semitism. His report ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) attempts to determine the personality type susceptible to following fascism and anti-democratic propaganda. Nazi movements during World War II also spurred controversial psychologists such as [[Walther Poppelreuter]] (1932) to lecture and write about political psychology that identified with Hitler. The psychologist [[Eric Jaensch]] (1883–1940) contributed the racist book ''The Anti-type'' (1933).

===United Kingdom===
At the turn of the century, [[Oxford University]] and [[Cambridge University]] introduced disciplinary political psychology courses such as "The Sciences of the Man", along with the foundation of the Psychological society (1901) and the Sociological society (1904).&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford historian [[G. B. Grundy]] (1861–1948) noted political psychology (1917) as a sub-discipline of history. Motivated by social and political behavior during World War I, he deemed a new branch of historical science, "The Psychology of Men Acting in Masses".&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; He referred to science to instrument the clarification of mistaken beliefs about intention.&lt;ref name="Rudmin-p6-7" /&gt; The intellectual [[Graham Wallas]] (1859–1932) implicated the significance of studying psychology in politics in  ''Human Nature in Politics'' (1908). Wallace emphasized the importance of enlightening politicians and the public about the psychological processes in order to raise awareness on exploitation while developing control over one's own psychological intellect. He suggested in ''[[Great Society (book)|Great Society]]'' (1917) that recognition of such processes could help to build a more functional humanity.

===United States===
Across the Atlantic the first American to be considered a political psychologist was [[Harold Lasswell]] (1902–1978) whose research was also spurred by a sociological fascination of World War I. His work ''Propaganda Technique in the World War'' (1927) discussed the use of applying psychological theories in order to enhance propaganda technique.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.19)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasswell moved to Europe shortly after where he started to tie Freudian and Adler personality theories to politics and published ''Psychopathology and Politics'' (1930). His major theories involved the motives of the politically active and the relation between propaganda and personality.

Another contributing factor to the development of Political Psychology was the introduction of psychometrics and "The Measurement of Attitude" by [[Thurstone]] and [[Chave]] (1929). The methodological revolution in social science gave quantitative grounds and therefore more credibility to Political Psychology. Research into political preference during campaigns was spurred by [[George Gallup]] (1901–1984), who founded the "American Institute of Public Opinion". The 1940s election in America drew a lot of attention in connection with the start of World War II. Gallup, Roper and Crossley instigated research into the chances of Roosevelt being re-elected. Lazarsfeld, Berelson and Gaudet (1944) also conducted a famous panel study "The People's Choice" on the 1940s election campaign. These studies drew attention to the possibility of measuring political techniques using psychological theories.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of the US into World War II spiraled vast research into fields such as war technique, propaganda, group moral, psycho-biography and culture conflict to name a few, with the U.S. army and Navy recruiting young psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Van Ginneken, J., Ch. 1 in: {{Cite journal |author=Stone, W.F., Schaffner, W.|year=1988 |title= The Psychology of Politics (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Springer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the discipline quickly developed and gained international accreditation.

McGuire identifies three broad phases in the development of political psychology, these three phases are:
1.The era of [[personality studies]] in the 1940s and 1950s dominated by psychoanalysis 
2.The era of [[political attitudes]] and voting behavior studies in the 1960s and 1970s characterized by the popularity of "rational man" assumptions
3.An era since the 1980s and 1990s, which has focused on [[political beliefs]], information processing and decision making, and has dealt in particular with international politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2013 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality and politics==

The study of [[Personality psychology|personality]] in political psychology focuses on the effects of leadership personality on decision-making, and the consequences of mass personality on leadership boundaries. Key personality approaches utilized in political psychology are psychoanalytic theories, trait-based theories and motive-based theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.15)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A psychoanalytical approach===
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) made significant contributions to the study of personality in political psychology through his theories on the unconscious motives of behavior. Freud suggested that a leader's behavior and decision making skill were largely determined by the interaction in their personality of the [[Id, ego and super-ego#id|id]], [[Id, ego and super-ego#ego|ego]] and [[superego]], and their control of the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] and [[reality principle]]. The psychoanalytic approach has also been used extensively in psychobiographies of political leaders. Psychobiographies draw inferences from personal, social and political development, starting from childhood, to understand behavior patterns that can be implemented to predict decision-making motives and strategies.

===A trait-based approach===
Traits are personality characteristics that show to be stable over time and in different situations, creating predispositions to perceive and respond in particular ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press| page= 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] (1897-1967) realized the study of traits introducing central, secondary, cardinal and common traits. These four distinctions suggest that people demonstrate traits to varying degrees, and further that there is a difference between individual and common traits to be recognized within a society. [[Hans Eysenck]] (1916-1997) contributed three major traits, currently however [[Paul Costa Jr|Costa]] and [[Robert R. McCrae|McCrae]]'s (1992)  "Big Five" personality dimensions are the most recognized. These include; neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience and conscientiousness. Theories in political psychology induce that one's combination of these traits has implications for leadership style and capacity. For example, individuals who score highly on extroversion are demonstrated as having superior leadership skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.20)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Myers-Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) is a personality assessment scale commonly used in the study of political personality and for job profiling.

===A motive-based approach===
In terms of political psychology [[motivation]] is viewed as goal-oriented behavior driven by a need for three things; [[Power (social and political)|power]], affiliation intimacy, and [[Goal#Achieving personal goals|achievement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.21)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were grouped by Winter (1996) from Murray's (1938) twenty suggested common human goals. Need for power affects the style in which a leader performs. Winter and Stewart (1977) suggested that leaders high in power motivation and low in need of affiliation intimacy motivation make better presidents. Affiliation-motivated leaders alternatively tend to collaborate joint efforts in the absence of threat. Lastly, achievement motivation has demonstrated to not correspond with political success, especially if it is higher than power motivation (Winter, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.122)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation between a leader and those whom they are ruling needs to be consistent with success. Motives have been shown to be correlated more highly with situation and time since last goal-fulfillment, rather than consistent traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Sears, D.O., Huddy, L., Jervis, R.|year=2003 |title= Oxford Handbook of Political Psychology (p.132)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thematic Apperception Test]] (TAT) is commonly used for assessing motives. However, in the case of leadership assessment this test is more difficult to implement therefore more applicable tests are often used such as content analysis of speeches and interviews.

==Frameworks for assessing personality==

===The authoritarian personality===
The [[authoritarian personality]] is a syndrome theory that was developed by the researchers [[Adorno]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik|Frenkel-Brunswick]], [[Daniel Levinson|Levinson]] and [[Nevitt Sanford|Sanford]] (1950) at The University of California. The American Jewish Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Jost, J.T., Sidanius, J.|year=2004 |title= Political Psychology: Key Readings (p.47)|edition=1st|publisher= London: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsidized research and publishing on the theory since it revolved around ideas developed from World War II events. [[Adorno]] (1950) explained the authoritarian personality type from a psychoanalytic point of view suggesting it to be a result of highly controlled and conventional parenting. Adorno (1950) explained that individuals with an authoritarian personality type had been stunted in terms of developing an ability to control the sexual and aggressive id impulses. This resulted in a fear of them and thus a development of defense mechanisms to avoid confronting them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.40)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authoritarian personality types are persons described as swinging between depending on yet resenting authority. The syndrome was theorized to encompass nine characteristics; conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intraception (an opposition to subjective or imaginative tendencies), superstition and stereotypy, power and toughness, destructiveness and cynicism, sex obsession, and projectivity. The authoritarian personality type is suggested to be; ethnocentric, ego-defensive, mentally rigid, conforming and conventional, adverse to the out of the ordinary, and as having conservative political views. The book ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) introduces several scales based on different authoritarian personality types. These are; the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] which measures from where and to what degree fascist attitudes develop, the anti-Semitism scale, the ethnocentrism scale and the politico economic conservatism scale. The F-scale however, is the only scale that is expected to measure implicit authoritarian personality tendencies.

[[Bob Altemeyer]] (1996) deconstructed the authoritarian personality using trait analysis. He developed a [[Right-wing Authoritarianism]] (RWA) scale based on the traits; authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, and conventionalism. Altmeyer (1996) suggested that those who score high on the F-scale have a low ability for critical thinking and therefore are less able to contradict authority. Altmeyer's theories also incorporate the psychodynamic point of view, suggesting that authoritarian personality types were taught by their parents to believe that the world was a dangerous place and thus their impulses lead them to make impulsive, emotional and irrational decisions. The beliefs and behavior of an authoritarian are suggested to be easily manipulated by authority instead of being based on internal values.  Altmeyer also theorized that leaders with authoritarian personality types were more susceptible to the [[fundamental attribution error]]. There are many weaknesses associated with this syndrome and the F-scale. It may have been more relevant during the period in which it was produced, being shortly after World War II. The authoritarian personality is generally related to a fascist image however it is suggested to explain behavior of individuals in all political fields.

===Trait-based frameworks===
Trait-based frameworks, excluding the Freudian approach, were suggested by [[James David Barber|James Barber]] (1930–2004) in ''The Presidential Character'' (1972) who highlighted the importance of [[psychobiography]] in political personality analysis. Barber suggested that leadership personality comprised three dimensions; "character", "world view", and "style".&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.28)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barber also proposed that leadership typology followed a pattern leading from an individuals first political success and that it is includes two variables; the effort that a leader puts in and the personal satisfaction that the leader gains. This typology is fairly limited in its dimensions.

[[Etheredge]] (1978) proposed the importance of the traits; "dominance", "interpersonal trust", "self-esteem" and "introversion-extroversion", in leadership views and policy shaping. Etheredge found from studies on leaders during the Soviet Union, that those who scored highly on dominance were more likely to support the use of force during debate settlement. He found that the trait introversion can lead to a lack of co-operation, and that extroversion usually leads to cooperation and negotiation. Further he suggested that interpersonal trust and self-esteem were closely related to not advocating force.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p28" /&gt;

[[Margaret Hermann]] (1976) introduced the [[Leader Trait Assessment]] (LTA) and advocated the development of the [[Profiler-Plus]]. The Profiler-Plus is a computer system used to code spontaneous interview answers for seven major characteristics; need for power, cognitive complexity, task-interpersonal emphasis, self-confidence, locus of control, distrust of others, and ethnocentrism. This method can profile large bodies of leadership related text whilst removing any subjective bias from content analysis. It is efficient and has high reliability.
Hermann and Preston (1994) suggested 5 distinct variables of leadership style; their involvement in policy making, their willingness to tolerate conflict, their level and reasons for motivation, their information managing strategies, and their conflict resolving strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.30)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach is the [[Operational-Code]] method introduced by [[Nathan Leites]] (1951) and restructured by [[Alexander George (philosopher)|Alexander George]] (1979). The code is based on five philosophical beliefs and five instrumental beliefs. A [[Verbs in Context]] (VIC) coding system employed through the Profiler-Plus computer program once again allows substantial bodies of written and spoken speech, interviews and writings to be analyzed subjectively.  The method attempts to be able to predict behavior thorough applying knowledge of various beliefs.

Although political behavior is governed and represented by a leader the consequential influence of the leader largely depends upon the context in which they are placed and in which type of political climate they are running. For this reason group behavior is also instrumental for understanding sociopolitical environments

==The political psychology of groups==

[[Group behavior]] is key in understanding the structure, stability, popularity and ability to make successful decisions of political parties. Individual behavior deviates substantially in a group setting therefore it is difficult to determine group behavior by looking solely at the individuals that comprise the group. Group form and stability is based upon several variables; size, structure, the purpose that the group serves, group development and influences upon a group.

===Group size===
Group size has various consequences. In smaller groups individuals are more committed (Patterson and Schaeffer, 1997) and there is a lower turnover rate (Widmeyer, Brawley and Carron, 1990).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.67)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large groups display greater levels of divergence (O'Dell, 1968) and less conformity (Olson and Caddell, 1994). Group performance also diminishes with size increase, due to decreased co-ordination and free-riding.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; The size of a [[political party]] or nation can therefore have consequential effects on their ability to co-ordinate and progress.

===Group structure===
The structure of a group is altered by member diversity, which largely affects its efficiency. Individual diversity with in a group has proven to demonstrate less communication and therefore to increase conflict (Maznevski, 1994).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt; This has implications for political parties based in strongly colonial or multiracial nations.
Member diversity has consequences for; status, role allocation and role strain within a group, all of which can cause disagreement. Thus maintenance of group cohesion is key. Cohesion is affected by several factors; the amount of time members spend in the group, the amount that members like one another, the amount of reward that the group offers, the amount of external threat to the group and the level of warmth offered by leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.69)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors should be considered when attempting to form an efficient political group. President decision efficiency for example is affected by the degree to which members of the advisory group have a hierarchical status and by the roles that each member is assigned.

===Group function===
Studying the purpose for formation of a group, whether it is serving a "functional" purpose or an "interpersonal attraction" purpose (Mackie and Goethals, 1987), has implications for political popularity. Often people join groups in order to fulfill certain survival, interpersonal, informational and collective needs.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p67" /&gt;  A political party that provides; stability, clear information, offers power to individuals and satisfies a sense of affiliation, will gain popularity. [[William Schutz|Shutz's]] (1958) "[[Fundamental interpersonal relations orientation]]" theory suggests that groups satisfy the need for control, intimacy and inclusion. Groups also form due to natural attraction. Newcomb (1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.70)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that we are drawn to others close in socioeconomic status, beliefs, attitudes and physical appearance. Similarity in certain respects can thus be related to how much a person is attracted to joining one group over another.

===Group development===
[[Group development]] tends to happen in several stages; forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning (Tuckman, 1965). Group awareness of these stages is important in order for members to acknowledge that a process is taking place and that certain stages such as storming are part of progression and that they should not be discouraged or cause fear of instability. Awareness of group development also allows for models to be implemented in order to manipulate different stages. External influences upon a group will have different effects depending upon which stage the group is at in its course. This has implications for how open a group should be depending upon the stage of development it is at, and on its strength.
Consistency is also a key aspect in a group for success (Wood, 1994).

===The influence of conformity in groups===
The application of conformity is key for understanding group influence in political behaviour. Decision making within a group is largely influenced by conformity. It is theorized to occur based on two motives; [[normative social influence]] and [[informational social influence]] (Asch, 1955).&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.74)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of conformity is influenced by several factors; an increase in group size but only to a certain degree at which it plateaus, and degree of unanimity and commitment to the group. Therefore, the degree of popularity of a political group can be influenced by its existing size and the believed unanimity and commitment by the public of the already existing members. The degree by which the group conforms as a whole can also be influenced by the degree of individuation of its members.&lt;ref name="Cottam-p74" /&gt;
Also, the conformity within political groups can be related to the term, 'political coalition.' Humans represent groups as if there was a special category of an individual. For example, for cognitive simplicity, ancestral groups anthropomorphize each other because they have similar thoughts, values, and a historical background.  Even though the member of a group may have an irrational or wrong argument about a political issue, there is a high possibility for the other members to conform to it because of the mere fact that they are in the same coalition. &lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen, “States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics,” International Security, Vol. 36, No. 2, Fall 2011, pp. 48-83&lt;/ref&gt;

===The influence of power in groups===
Power is another influential factor within a group or between separate groups. The "critical bases of power" developed by French and Raven (1959) allocates the following types of power as the most successful; reward power, coercive power, legitimate power, [[referent power]] and expert power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.76)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The way in which power is exerted upon a group can have repercussive outcomes for popularity. Referent power results in greater popularity of a political group or leader than coercive power (Shaw and Condelli, 1986).&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.77)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has implications for leaders to manipulate others to identify with them, rather than to enforce consequential punishment. However, if coercive power is enforced, success and a trusted leader (Friedland, 1976) are necessary in order for group conflict not to escalate.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt; Extrinsic punishment and reward are also suggested to detract from intrinsic motivation. A sense of freedom must be advocated to the group.&lt;ref name="Cottan-p77" /&gt;

===Decision-making in groups===
[[Decision-making]] is an important political process which influences the course of a country's policy. Group decision-making is largely influenced by three rules; "[[majority]]-wins rule", "[[truth]]-wins rule", and "first-shift rule". Decision-making is also coerced by [[conformity]]. [[Irrational]] decisions are generally made during emotional periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.83)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an unpopular political party may receive more votes during a period of actual or perceived economic or [[political instability]]. Controversial studies by George Marcus (2003) however imply that high levels of [[anxiety]] can actually cause an individual to analyze information more rationally and carefully, resulting in more well-informed and successful decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schildkraut |first=D. J. |title= All Politics is psychological: A Review of Political Psychology Syllabi |journal= Perspectives on Politics |date=December 2004 |volume=2 |pages=807–819 |url= http://ase.tufts.edu/polsci/faculty/schildkraut/Perspectives2004.pdf |accessdate=5 Dec 2011 |doi= 10.1017/s1537592704040575|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychology of decision-making however must be analyzed in accordance with whether it is within a leadership context or a between group context. The implementation of successful decision-making is often enhanced by group decision-making (Hill, 1982) especially if the decision is important to the group and when the group has been working together for an extended period of time (Watson, Michaelson and Sharp, 1991). However groups can also hinder decision-making if a correct answer is not clear. Janis (1972) introduced the notion of [[Groupthink]] that advocates an increased chance of groups making faulty decisions under several conditions; strong group cohesion, isolation of group decision from public review, the presence of a directive leader in the group, and high stress levels.
[[Group polarization]] (Janis, 1972) suggests that group decision-making is often more extreme whether is it more risky or cautious.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.84)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Groupthink" refers to "a mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive in-group, when the members' striving for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=David Patrick Houghton|year=2015 |title= Political Psychology|edition=2nd|publisher= Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques to establish more effective decision making skills in political dimensions have been suggested. Hirt and Markman (1995) claim that implementing an individual in a group to find faults and to critique will enable the members to establish alternative view points. George (1980) suggested "multiple advocacy" which implements that a neutral person analyses the pros and cons of various advocate suggestions and thus makes an informed decision.

Applied psychology theories to improve productivity of political groups include implementing "[[team development]]" techniques, "quality circles" and autonomous work groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.81)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using psychology in the understanding of certain political behaviors==

===Evolution===

[[Evolutionary Psychology]] plays a significant role in understanding the state and people of how the current political regime came to be. It is an approach that focuses on the structure of human behavior claiming it’s dependence on the social and ecological environment. Developed through natural selection, the human brain functions to react appropriately to environmental challenges of coalitional conflict using psychological mechanisms and modifications. An example of political conflict would involve state aggression such as war. Psychological mechanisms work to digest what is taken in from internal and external information regarding the current habitat and project it in the most suited form of action such as acts of aggression, retrieval, dominance, and so forth. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Anthony C. Lopez |author2=Rose McDermott |author3=Michael Bang Petersen |authorlink1=States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |title= States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics |volume=36 |issue=2 fall 2011 |pages=48-83 |publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting behavior===

In order to make inferences and predictions about behavior concerning voting decision, certain key public influences must be considered. These influences include the role of emotions, political socialization, [[political sophistication]], tolerance of diversity of political views and the media. The effect of these influences on [[voting behavior]] is best understood through theories on the formation of attitudes, beliefs, schema, knowledge structures and the practice of information processing. The degree to which voting decision is affected by internal processing systems of political information and external influences, alters the quality of making truly democratic decisions.

===Conflict===

The application of psychology for understanding conflict and extreme acts of violence can be understood in both individual and group terms. Political conflict is often a consequence of ethnic disparity and "ethnocentrism" Sumner (1906).

On an individual level participators in situations of conflict can either be perpetrators, bystanders or altruists. The behavior of perpetrators is often explained through the authoritarian personality type. Individual differences in levels of empathy have been used to explain whether an individual chooses to stand up to authority or ignore a conflict. Rotter's (1954) [[locus of control]] theory in personality psychology has also been used to determine individual differences in reaction to situations of conflict.

Group behavior during conflict often affects the actions of an individual. The [[bystander effect]] introduced by Darley and Latane (1968) demonstrates that group behavior causes individuals to monitor whether others think it is necessary to react in a situation and thus base their behavior on this judgment. They also found that individuals are more likely to diffuse responsibility in group situations. These theories can be applied to situations of conflict and genocide in which individuals remove personal responsibility and therefore justify their behavior. [[Social identity theory]] explains that during the Holocaust of World War II political leaders used the Jews as an out-group in order to increase in-group cohesion. This allowed for the perpetrators to depersonalize from the situation and to diffuse their responsibility. The out-groups were held in separate confines and dehumanized in order to aid the in-group to disengage themselves from relating.

Research by Dr. Dan Kahan has demonstrated that individuals are resistant to accepting new political views even if they are presented with evidence that challenges their views.  The research also demonstrated that if the individual was required to write a few sentences about experiences they enjoyed or spend a few moments affirming their self-worth, the individual was more likely to accept the new political position.&lt;ref&gt;Motivated Numeracy and Enlightened Self-Government. retrieved on August 25, 2014. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2319992&lt;/ref&gt;

Although somewhat unusual, [[evolutionary psychology]] can also explain conflicts in politics and the international society. A journal by Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott and Michael Bang Petersen uses this idea to give out hypothesis to explain political events. According to the authors, instincts and psychological characteristics developed through evolution is still existent with modern people. They suggest human being as "adaptation executers"; people designed through natural selection, and not "utility maximizers"; people who strive for utility in every moment. Though a group of people, perhaps those who are in the same political coalition, may seem as if they pursue a common utility maximization, it is difficult to generalize the theory of "utility maximizers" into a nation-view because people evolved in small groups. This approach helps scholars to explain seemingly irrational behaviors like aggressiveness in politics and international society because "irrational behavior" would be the result of a mismatch between the modern world and evolutionary psychology.

For example, according to evolutionary psychology, coalitional aggression is more commonly found with males. This is because of their [[psychological mechanism]] designed since ancestral times. During those times men had more to earn when winning wars compared to women (they had more chance of finding a mate, or even many mates). Also, the victorious men had more chance of reproduction which eventually led to the succession of aggressive, eager-to-war DNAs. As a result, the authors hypothesize that countries with more men will tend to show more aggressive politics thereby having more possibility of triggering conflicts within and especially among states.

Indeed some exceptions do exists in this theory as this is just a hypothesis. However it is viable enough to be a hypothesis to be tested to explain certain political events like war and crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony C. Lopez, Rose McDermott, Michael Bang Petersen. "States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics"." International Security 36.2 (2011): 48-83. 20 Sept 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===

On an individual level terrorism has been explained as a display of psychopathological personality disorders. Terrorists have demonstrated to show narcissistic personality traits (Lasch, 1979, Pearlstein, 1991). Post (2004) argues that narcissistic and borderline personality disorders are found in terrorists and that mechanisms such as [[Splitting (psychology)|splitting]] and [[externalization]] are used by terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.271)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Silke (2004) and Mastors and Deffenbaugh (2007) refute this view. Crenshaw (2004) showed that certain terrorist groups are actually careful in not enlisting those demonstrating pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.272)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[authoritarian personality]] theory has also been used as an explanation for terrorist behavior in individuals.

In terms of explaining reasons for which individuals join terrorist groups, motivational theories such as need for power and need for affiliation intimacy are suggested. Festinger (1954) explained that people often join groups in order to compare their own beliefs and attitudes. Joining a terrorist group could be a method to remedy individual uncertainty. Taylor and Louis (2004) explained that individuals strive for meaningful behavior. This can also be used to explain why terrorists look for such radical beliefs and demonstrations. Studies on children in northern Ireland by Field (1979) have shown that exposure to violence can lead to terrorist behavior later on. Implicating the effect of developing acceptable norms in groups. However this view has also been criticized (Taylor, 1998). Other theories suggest that goal frustration can result in aggression (Dollard, Doob. Miller, mower, and Sears, 1939)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Cottam, M.L., Dietz-Uhler, B., Mastors, E., Preston, T.|year=2010 |title= Introduction To Political Psychology (p.273)|edition=2nd|publisher= New York, NY: Psychology Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that aggression can lead to frustration (Borum, 2004).
Group settings can cause a social identity and terrorist behavior to manifest. Methods such as dehumanization allow individuals to detach more easily from moral responsibility, and group influence increase the chance that individuals will concede to conformity and compliance. Manipulations of social control and propaganda can also instrument terrorist involvement.

In fact, a strategic model has been proposed to examine the political motivations of terrorists. The strategic model, the dominant paradigm in terrorism studies, considers terrorists are rational actors who attack civilians for political ends. According to this view, terrorists are political utility maximizers. The strategic model rests on three core assumptions which are: (1)terrorists are motivated by relatively stable and consistent political preferences; (2)terrorists evaluate the expected political payoffs of their available options; and (3)terrorism is adopted when the expected political return is superior to those of alternative options. However, it turns out that terrorists' decision-making process does not fully conform to the strategic model. According to Abrahms, Max who is the author of "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and [[Counterterrorism]] Strategy." &lt;ref&gt;Abrahms, Max. "What Terrorists Really Want: Terrorist Motives and Counterterrorism Strategy." International Security, vol. 32 no. 4, 2008, pp. 78-105. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/237009&lt;/ref&gt;there are seven common tendencies that represent important empirical puzzles for the strategic model, going against the conventional thought that terrorists are rational actors.

The '''Protection of Diplomats Convention''' (formally, the '''Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents''') is a [[United Nations]] [[anti-terrorism]] [[Multilateral treaty|treaty]] that codifies some of the traditional principles on the necessity of protecting [[diplomat]]s.

==Adoption==
The convention was adopted as a resolution of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 14 December 1973 in response to a series of kidnappings and murders of diplomatic agents, beginning in the 1960s. It was drafted by the [[International Law Commission]] (ILC), which began work on it in 1971. It was adopted within two years, which was exceptionally fast by ILC standards.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenau, Bernhard. ''The United Nations and Terrorism. Germany, Multilateralism, and Antiterrorism Efforts in the 1970s'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2014, pp. 104–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Parties to the convention agree to criminalise the commission of murders or kidnappings of internationally protected persons as well as violent attacks against the [[Diplomatic mission|official premises]], private accommodation, or means of transport of such persons. Parties to the convention also agree to criminalise the attempted commission or threatened commission of such acts. "Internationally protected persons" is a term created by the convention, and refers explicitly to [[head of state|heads of state]], [[head of government|heads of government]], [[foreign minister]]s, [[ambassador]]s, other official diplomats, and members of their families.

A central provision of the convention is the principle of ''[[aut dedere aut judicare]]''—that a party to the treaty must either (1) prosecute a person who commits an offence against an internationally protected person or (2) send the person to another state that requests his or her [[extradition]] for prosecution of the same crime.

==Ratifications and parties==
By the end of 1974, the convention had been signed by 25 states and it came into force on 20 February 1977 after it had been ratified by 22 states. As of October 2016, it has been ratified by 180 state parties, which includes 177 [[United Nations member states]] plus the [[Holy See]], [[Niue]] and the [[State of Palestine]]. The UN member states that have not ratified the convention are:

'''Rawlinson v Rice''' [1997] 2 NZLR 651, [1998] 1 NZLR 454 is a cited case in [[New Zealand]] regarding  claims in tort for misfeasance in [[Public administration|public office]].&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[District Court]] Judge Rice issued a non molestation order against Rawlinson, against his protestations that the law required for him to be living with the complainant, which he wasn't. Rawlinson was later proven right on court, and had the order quashed.

Rawlinson then sued the [[judge]] for misfeasance. At the time, whilst [[High Court]] judges had immunity for such conduct, District Court judges did not.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal sitting as a bench of five, said he was not legally barred from pursuing his claim.

Footnote: Section 119 of the District Court Act now extends immunity to District Court judges as well.

A '''reading''' of a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] is a [[debate]] on the bill held by a general body of a [[legislature]]. 

In the [[Westminster system|Westminster legislative system]], developed in the [[United Kingdom]], there are often several readings of a bill as it passes through the stages becoming, or failing to become, [[legislation]]. Some of these readings may be [[formality|formalities]] rather than actual debate.

==First reading==
A '''first reading''' is when a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] is introduced to a [[legislature]]. Typically, in the [[United States]], the title of the bill is read and immediately assigned to a committee. The bill is then considered by committee between the first and second readings. In the [[United States Senate]] and most [[Westminster system|British-influenced]] legislatures, the committee consideration occurs between second and third readings. In [[Israel]], the committee consideration occurs between first and second readings and (for [[private member bill]]s) between preliminary and first readings.

In the [[Oireachtas]] of Ireland, the "First Stage" of a bill is by either of two methods:&lt;ref&gt;Oireachtas, ''A Brief Guide to the Legislative Process''; Dáil Standing Orders 147; Seanad Standing Orders 144–148&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''introduction'' by a private member moving a motion "that leave be given to introduce" the bill—the bill goes to second stage if the motion is carried
* ''presentation'' on behalf of either the [[government of Ireland|government]] (unlimited numbers) or a parliamentary group (one at a time per group in the [[Dáil]], three in the [[Seanad]])—the bill automatically goes to second stage 

In [[New Zealand]], once a bill passes first reading it is normally referred to a [[Select Committee]].  However, a Government can have a bill skip the select committee stage by a simple majority vote in Parliament.

A bill can be defeated on first reading if a member introduces it and no one seconds it.

== Second reading ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Judicial officers of the Republic of Singapore]] --&gt;
{{redirect|Second reading|second reading at a mass|Mass (liturgy)#Liturgy of the Word}}
A '''second reading''' is the stage of the legislative process where a draft of a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] is read a second time. In most [[Westminster system]]s, a vote is   taken on the general outlines of the bill before being sent to committee.

In the Oireachtas of Ireland, it is referred to as "Second Stage", though the subheading "second reading" is used Dáil standing orders, and the motion at second stage is still "that the Bill is to be read a second time". A bill introduced in one house enters the other house at Second Stage, except that the Seanad second stage is waived for Dáil [[consolidation bill]]s. Once the bill passes second stage it is referred to a Select Committee of that house or taken in Committee Stage by the whole house.&lt;ref&gt;Oireachtas, ''A Brief Guide to the Legislative Process''; Dáil Standing Orders 148; Seanad Standing Orders 149, 180&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States Senate, a bill is either referred to committee or placed on the Calendar of Business after second reading. No vote is held on whether to read the bill a second time. In U.S. legislatures where consideration in committee precedes second reading, the procedure varies as to how a bill reaches second reading. In Illinois, for example, legislation is automatically read a second time, after which amendments are in order.

In New Zealand, once a bill passes a Second Reading it is then considered clause by clause by the whole Parliament. If a majority of Parliament agree, the bill can be considered part by part, saving considerable time.  Because most bills must have majority support to pass a second reading, it is now very rare for a bill to be considered clause by clause.

==Third reading&lt;!-- [[Fifth stage]] redirects here--&gt;==

A '''third reading''' is the stage of a [[legislative process]] in which a bill is read with all [[Bill (proposed law)|amendment]]s and given final approval by a legislative body. In legislatures whose procedures are based on those of the Westminster system, the third reading occurs after the bill has been amended by committee and considered for amendment at report stage.

In bicameral legislatures, if the bill passes the third reading, it is then sent to the other chamber of parliament to start the process again at first reading in that chamber. Once the bill has passed third reading in both chambers, it is sent on for [[promulgation]], such as [[Royal Assent]] in the Westminster system or signing by the president or governor in the U.S. model. In a unicameral legislature, after passing third reading in the sole chamber, the bill goes on directly for promulgation.

In the [[United States Senate]], after the third reading has been ordered, a bill may be amended with a two-thirds majority vote for adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.state.tx.us/about-us/bill/|title=Texas House of Representatives|first=Texas House of|last=Representatives|date=|website=www.house.state.tx.us|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still a vote on final passage.

In the Oireachtas of Ireland, the equivalent of the third reading is referred to as the "Fifth Stage" or "Final Stage". The motion is "That the Bill do now pass", except that the Seanad motion for a [[money bill]] is "That the Bill be returned to the Dáil". When a bill passes one house, it is sent to the other house and enters at Second Stage. After both houses have passed the bill, it is sent to the [[President of Ireland]] to be signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;Oireachtas, ''A Brief Guide to the Legislative Process''; Dáil Standing Orders 161; Seanad Standing Orders 163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Religious law''' refers to [[ethical code|ethical]] and [[Morality#Moral codes|moral codes]] taught by [[religious tradition]]s. Examples include [[Christian]] [[canon law]], [[Islamic]] [[sharia]], [[Jewish]] [[halakha]], and [[Hindu law]].&lt;ref&gt;Gad Barzilai, ''Law and Religion'', Ashgate, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Established religions and religious institutions==
A [[state religion]] (or [[established church]]) is a religious body officially endorsed by the [[State (polity)|state]]. A [[theocracy]] is a [[form of government]] in which a [[God]] or a [[deity]] is recognized as the supreme civil ruler.

In both theocracies and some religious jurisdictions, [[conscientious objector]]s may cause [[religious offense]]. The contrary legal systems are  [[secular state]]s or [[multicultural]] societies in which the government does not formally adopt a particular religion, but may either repress all religious activity or enforce tolerance of religious diversity.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{main|Bahá'í laws}}
[[Bahá'í laws]] are laws and ordinances used in the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and are a fundamental part of Bahá'í practice.&lt;ref name="PSmith158"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=158}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws are based on authenticated texts from [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, subsequent interpretations from [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] and [[Shoghi Effendi]] and legislation by the [[Universal House of Justice]].&lt;ref name="PSmith159"&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|pp=159}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'í law is presented as a set of general principles and guidelines and individuals must apply them as they best seem fit.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; While some of the social laws are enforced by Bahá'í institutions, the emphasis is placed on individuals following the laws based on their conscience, understanding and reasoning, and Bahá'ís are expected to follow the laws for the love of Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref name="PSmith159"/&gt; The laws are seen as the method of the maintenance of order and security in the world.&lt;ref name="PSmith158"/&gt;

A few examples of laws and basic religious observances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which are considered obligatory for Bahá'ís include:
* Recite an [[Obligatory Bahá'í prayers|obligatory prayer]] each day. There are three such prayers among which one can be chosen each day.
* Observe a [[Nineteen Day Fast]] from sunrise to sunset from March 2 through March 20. During this time Bahá'ís in good health between the ages of 15 and 70 abstain from eating and drinking.
* [[Gossip]] and [[backbiting]] are prohibited and viewed as particularly damaging to the individual and their relationships.

==Buddhism==
{{main|Patimokkha}}
Patimokkha comprises a collection of precepts for [[bhikkhu]]s and bhikkhunis (Buddhist munks and nuns).
{{main|dhammasattha}}

==Christianity==
{{see also|Christian ethics|Render unto Caesar...|Letter and spirit of the law|Legalism (theology)|antinomianism}}
Within the framework of [[Christianity]], there are several possible definitions for religious law. One is the [[Mosaic Law]] (from what Christians consider to be the [[Old Testament]]) also called [[Divine Law]] or [[biblical law]], the most famous example being the [[Ten commandments#Christianity|Ten Commandments]]. Another is the instructions of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] to his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] in the [[Gospel]] (often referred to as [[the Law of Christ]] or the [[New Commandment]] or the [[New Covenant]], in contrast to the [[Old Covenant]]). Another is the [[Apostolic Decree]] of Acts 15, which is still observed by the [[Greek Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Josef von Hefele]]'s [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html commentary on canon II of Gangra] notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the Greeks, indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show. [[Balsamon]] also, the well-known commentator on the canons of the Middle Ages, in his commentary on the sixty-third [[Canons of the Apostles|Apostolic Canon]], expressly blames the Latins because they had ceased to observe this command. What the Latin Church, however, thought on this subject about the year 400, is shown by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] in his work [[Contra Faustum]], where he states that the Apostles had given this command in order to unite the heathens and Jews in the one ark of Noah; but that then, when the barrier between Jewish and heathen converts had fallen, this command concerning things strangled and blood had lost its meaning, and was only observed by few. But still, as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]] (731) forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days. No one will pretend that the disciplinary enactments of any council, even though it be one of the undisputed [[Ecumenical council|Ecumenical Synods]], can be of greater and more unchanging force than the decree of that first council, held by the Holy Apostles at Jerusalem, and the fact that its decree has been obsolete for centuries in the West is proof that even Ecumenical canons may be of only temporary utility and may be repealed by disuse, like other laws."&lt;/ref&gt;  Another is [[canon law]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], and [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox]] churches.

In some [[Christian denominations]], law is often contrasted with [[divine grace|grace]] (see also [[Law and Gospel]] and [[Antithesis of the Law]]): the contrast here speaks to attempts to gain [[salvation]] by [[Legalism (theology)|obedience to a code of laws]] as opposed to seeking salvation through faith in the [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] made by [[Jesus]] on the cross.

===Biblical/Mosaic law===
{{main|Biblical law in Christianity}}
Christian views of the [[Old Covenant]] are central to [[Christian theology]], [[Christian ethics|ethics]], and [[Orthopraxy#Christianity|practice]]. The term "Old Covenant", also referred to as the [[Mosaic covenant]], the [[Law of Moses]], [[divine law]], Biblical law or God's law, refers to the statements or principles of religious law and [[religious ethics]] codified in the first five books or ''[[Pentateuch]]'' of the [[Old Testament]]. Views of the Old Covenant are expressed in the [[New Testament]], such as [[Jesus]]' [[Matthew 5#Antitheses|antitheses of the law]], the [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity#Circumcision controversy|circumcision controversy in Early Christianity]], and the [[Incident at Antioch]] and position of [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism]]. Many traditional Christians have the view that [[Supersessionism|only parts are applicable]], many [[Protestants]] have the view that [[Abrogation of Old Covenant laws|none is applicable]], [[Dual-covenant theology|dual-covenant theologians]] have the view that only [[Noahide Laws]] apply to [[Gentiles]], and a minority have the view that [[Jewish Christianity|all are still applicable]] to believers in [[Jesus]] and the [[New Covenant]].

===Canon law===
{{main|Canon law}}
Canon law is the body of laws and regulations made by or adopted by ecclesiastical authority, for the government of the Christian organization and its members. It is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglican Communion]] of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09056a.htm|title=Canon law|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[church council]] (From [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kanon'' / κανών, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / קנה, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.

====Canons of the Apostles====
{{main|Canons of the Apostles}}
The [[Canons of the Apostles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03279a.htm|title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Apostolic Canons|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/ecf/007/0070471.htm|title=The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles|publisher=Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol VII|accessdate=2008-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a collection of ancient ecclesiastical decrees (eighty-five in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]], fifty in the [[Roman Catholicism|Western]] Church) concerning the government and discipline of the [[Early Christian]] Church, incorporated with the [[Apostolic Constitutions]] which are part of the [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]]

====Catholic Church====

The [[canon law]] of the [[Catholic Church]] ({{Lang-la|jus canonicum}})&lt;ref&gt;Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Edition, pg. 771: "Jus canonicum"&lt;/ref&gt; is the system of [[law]]s and legal principles made and enforced by the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|hierarchical authorities]] of the Church to regulate its external organization and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics toward the mission of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first modern Western [[legal system]]&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Harold J.

Peters]], [http://canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info Home Page], accessed June-11-2013&lt;/ref&gt; predating the common and European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions.  What began with rules ("canons") adopted by the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] at the [[Council of Jerusalem]] in the 1st century has blossomed into a highly complex and original legal system encapsulating not just norms of the [[New Testament]], but some elements of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] ([[Old Testament]]), [[Roman law|Roman]], [[Visigoths|Visigothic]], [[Saxon people|Saxon]], and [[Celt]]ic legal traditions spanning thousands of years of human experience. while the unique traditions of [[Oriental canon law]] govern the 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]] [[particular church]]es ''[[sui iuris]].''

Positive ecclesiastical laws, based directly or indirectly upon immutable divine law or [[natural law]], derive formal authority in the case of universal laws from [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgation]] by the supreme legislator—the [[Supreme Pontiff]]—who possesses the totality of legislative, executive, and judicial power in his person,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P16.HTM Canon 331], [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while particular laws derive formal authority from promulgation by a legislator inferior to the supreme legislator, whether an ordinary or a [[delegated]] legislator. The actual subject material of the canons is not just doctrinal or moral in nature, but all-encompassing of the human condition.

The [[jurisprudence of canon law]] is the complex of legal principles and traditions within which canon law operates, while the [[philosophy, theology, and fundamental theory of canon law]] are the areas of philosophical, theological, and legal scholarship dedicated to providing a theoretical basis for canon law as legal system and as true law.

In the [[Early Christianity|early Church]], the first canons were decreed by [[bishop]]s united in "[[Ecumenical councils|Ecumenical]]" councils (the Emperor summoning all of the known world's bishops to attend with at least the acknowledgement of the [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]]) or "local" councils (bishops of a region or territory).  Over time, these canons were supplemented with [[decretal]]s of the Bishops of Rome, which were responses to doubts or problems according to the maxim, ''Roma locuta est, causa finita est'' ("Rome has spoken, case is closed").

Later, they were gathered together into [[collections of ancient canons|collections]], both unofficial and official. The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the [[Camaldolese]] monk [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the 11th century, commonly known as the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' ("Gratian's Decree"). [[Pope]] [[Gregory IX]] is credited with promulgating the first official collection of canons called the ''Decretalia Gregorii Noni'' or ''Liber Extra'' (1234).  This was followed by the ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]], the ''Clementines'' (1317) of [[Clement V]], the ''[[Extravagantes Joannis XXII]]'' and the ''[[Extravagantes Communes]]'', all of which followed the same structure as the Liber Extra. All these collections, with the [[Decretum Gratiani]], are together referred to as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. After the completion of the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'', subsequent [[papal]] legislation was published in periodic volumes called ''[[Bullarium|Bullaria]]''.

By the 19th century, this body of legislation included some 10,000 norms, many difficult to reconcile with one another due to changes in circumstances and practice. This situation impelled [[Pope St. Pius X]] to order the creation of the first [[Code of Canon Law]], a single volume of clearly stated laws. Under the aegis of the Cardinal [[Pietro Gasparri]], the Commission for the Codification of Canon Law was completed under [[Benedict XV]], who promulgated the Code, effective in 1918. The work having been begun by [[Pius X]], it was sometimes called the "Pio-Benedictine Code" but more often the 1917 Code.  In its preparation, centuries of material was examined, scrutinized for authenticity by leading experts, and harmonized as much as possible with opposing canons and even other Codes, from the [[Corpus Juris Civilis|Codex of Justinian]] to the [[Napoleonic Code]].

[[Pope John XXIII]] initially called for a [[Synod]] of the Diocese of Rome, an [[Ecumenical Council]], and an updating to the 1917 Code.  After the [[Second Vatican Council|Second Ecumenical Council]] of the Vatican (Vatican II) closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II.  After multiple drafts and many years of discussion, [[Pope John Paul II]] promulgated the revised [[Code of Canon Law]] (CIC) in 1983. Containing 1752 canons, it is the law currently binding on the Latin (western) Roman Church.

The canon law of the Eastern Catholic Churches, which had developed some different disciplines and practices, underwent its own process of codification, resulting in the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]] promulgated in 1990 by [[Pope John Paul II]].

The institutions and practices of canon law paralleled the legal development of much of Europe, and consequently both modern [[Civil law (legal system)|Civil law]] and [[Common law]] bear the influences of canon law.  Edson Luiz Sampel, a Brazilian expert in canon law, says that canon law is contained in the genesis of various institutes of civil law, such as the law in continental Europe and Latin American countries. Sampel explains that canon law has significant influence in contemporary society.

Currently, all Latin-Rite Catholic seminary students are expected to take courses in canon law (c. 252.3). Some ecclesiastical officials are required to have the doctorate ([[Doctor of Canon Law|JCD]]) or at least the licentiate ([[Licentiate of Canon Law|JCL]]) in canon law in order to fulfill their functions: Judicial Vicars (c. 1419.1), Judges (c. 1421.3), Promoters of Justice (c. 1435), Defenders of the Bond (c. 1435).  In addition, [[Vicars General]] and Episcopal Vicars are to be doctors or at least licensed in canon law or theology (c. 478.1), and canonical advocates must either have the doctorate or be truly expert in canon law (c. 1483).  Ordinarily, Bishops are to have advanced degrees in sacred scripture, theology, or canon law (c. 378.1.5). St. [[Raymond of Penyafort]] (1175–1275), a Spanish Dominican priest, is the patron saint of canonists, due to his important contributions to the science of Canon Law.

====Orthodox Churches====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[New Testament]] --&gt;
The Greek-speaking Orthodox have collected canons and commentaries upon them in a work known as the ''Pēdálion'' (Greek: Πηδάλιον, "Rudder"), so named because it is meant to "steer" the Church. The Orthodox Christian tradition in general treats its canons more as guidelines than as laws, the [[economy (Eastern Orthodox Church)|bishops adjusting them]] to cultural and other local circumstances. Some Orthodox canon scholars point out that, had the [[Ecumenical Councils]] (which deliberated in Greek) meant for the canons to be used as laws, they would have called them ''nómoi/νόμοι'' (laws) rather than ''kanónes/κανόνες'' (rules), but almost all Orthodox conform to them. The dogmatic decisions of the Councils, though, are to be obeyed rather than to be treated as guidelines, since they are essential for the Church's unity.

====Anglican Communion====
{{main|Canon law (Anglican Communion)}}
In the [[Church of England]], the [[ecclesiastical court]]s that formerly decided many matters such as disputes relating to marriage, divorce, wills, and defamation, still have jurisdiction of certain church-related matters (e.g., discipline of clergy, alteration of church property, and issues related to churchyards).  Their separate status dates back to the 11th century when the [[Normans]] split them off from the mixed secular/religious county and local courts used by the Saxons. In contrast to the other [[court]]s of England the law used in ecclesiastical matters is at least partially a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system, not [[common law]], although heavily governed by parliamentary statutes.  Since the [[English Reformation|Reformation]], ecclesiastical courts in England have been royal courts.  The teaching of canon law at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge was abrogated by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]; thereafter practitioners in the [[ecclesiastical courts]] were trained in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], receiving a [[Doctor of Civil Law]] (D.C.L.) degree from Oxford, or an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D.]] from Cambridge.  Such lawyers (called "doctors" and "civilians") were centred at "[[Doctors' Commons|Doctors Commons]]", a few streets south of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]], where they monopolized [[probate]], matrimonial, and [[Admiralty law|admiralty]] cases until their jurisdiction was removed to the [[common law]] courts in the mid-19th century.  (Admiralty law was also based on civil law instead of common law, thus was handled by the civilians too.)

[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] repealed Canon Law in [[Scotland]] in 1638 after uprisings of [[Covenanter]]s confronting the Bishops of Aberdeen following the convention at [[Muchalls Castle]] and other revolts across Scotland earlier that year.

Other churches in the [[Anglican Communion]] around the world (e.g., the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]]) still function under their own private systems of canon law.

====Presbyterian and Reformed Churches====
{{main|Presbyterian polity}}
In Presbyterian and Reformed Churches, canon law is known as "practice and procedure" or  "church order," and includes the church's laws respecting its government, discipline, legal practice and worship.

====Lutheranism====
The [[Book of Concord]] is the historic [[doctrinal statement]] of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran Church]], consisting of ten [[creed|credal]] documents recognized as authoritative in [[Lutheranism]] since the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;F. Bente, ed. and trans., ''Concordia Triglotta'', (St. Louis: [[Concordia Publishing House]], 1921), p. i&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Book of Concord is a confessional document (stating orthodox belief) rather than a book of ecclesiastical rules or discipline, like canon law.  Each Lutheran national church establishes its own system of church order and discipline, though these are referred to as "canons."

====The United Methodist Church====
The [[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)|Book of Discipline]] contains the laws, rules, policies and guidelines for The United Methodist Church.  It is revised every four years by the General Conference, the law making body of The United Methodist Church; the last edition was published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Discipline (United Methodist)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hinduism==
{{main|Hindu law}}{{See also|Dharmaśāstra}}
[[Hindu law]] is largely based on the [[Manu Smriti]] ([[smriti]] of Manu). It was recognized by the [[United Kingdom|British]] during their [[British Raj|rule of India]] but its influence waned after the establishment of the [[India|Republic of India]], which has a [[Secularism in India|secular]] legal system.

==Islam==
{{Further|Sharia|Application of sharia by country|Islamic ethics}}
''[[Sharia]]'', also known as Islamic law ({{lang|ar|قانون إسلامي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qānūn ʾIslāmī}})'', is the [[moral code]] and religious law of [[Islam]]. Sharia is derived from two primary [[sources of Islamic law|sources]], the [[precept|precepts]] set forth in the [[Quran]] and the example set by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] in the ''[[sunnah]]''. Islamic jurisprudence (''[[fiqh]]'') interprets and extends the application of sharia to questions not directly addressed in the [[primary sources]] by including [[secondary sources]]. These secondary sources usually include the consensus of the ''[[ulama]]'' (religious scholars) embodied in ''[[ijma]]'' and [[analogy]] from the Quran and ''sunnah'' through ''[[qiyas]]''. [[Shia]] jurists prefer to apply reasoning (''[['aql]]'') rather than analogy in order to address difficult questions.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Muslims believe ''sharia'' is [[God's law]], but they differ as to what exactly it entails.&lt;ref&gt;Otto, Jan Michiel (2008). p. 7. "When people refer to ''the'' sharia, they are in fact referring to ''their'' sharia, in the name of ''the'' eternal will of the Almighty God."&lt;/ref&gt; Modernists, traditionalists and fundamentalists all hold different views of sharia, as do adherents to different schools of Islamic thought and scholarship. Different countries, societies and cultures have varying interpretations of sharia as well.

Sharia deals with many topics addressed by secular law, including [[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|crime]], [[Political aspects of Islam|politics]] and [[Islamic economic jurisprudence|economics]], as well as personal matters such as [[Islamic sexual jurisprudence|sexual intercourse]], [[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence|hygiene]], [[Islamic dietary laws|diet]], [[salat|prayer]], and [[Sawm|fasting]]. Where it has official status, sharia is applied by Islamic judges, or [[qadis]]. The [[imam]] has varying responsibilities depending on the interpretation of sharia; while the term is commonly used to refer to the leader of communal prayers, the imam may also be a scholar, religious leader, or political leader.

The reintroduction of sharia is a longstanding goal for [[Islamist]] movements in Muslim countries. Some Muslim minorities in Asia (''e.g.'', in [[Islam in Israel|Israel]] or in [[Islam in India|India]]) have maintained institutional recognition of sharia to adjudicate their personal and community affairs. In western countries, where Muslim immigration is more recent, Muslim minorities have introduced sharia family law, for use in their own disputes, with varying degrees of success e.g., Britain's [[Muslim Arbitration Tribunal]]. Attempts by Muslims to impose sharia on non-Muslims in countries with large Muslim populations have been accompanied by controversy,&lt;ref&gt;Hamann, Katie (December 29, 2009).

==Jainism==
{{main|Jain law}}{{See also|Jain ethical code}}
[[Jain law]] or Jaina law refers to the modern interpretation of ancient Jain Law that consists of rules for adoption, marriage, succession and death for the followers of [[Jainism]].

==Judaism==
{{main|Halakha}}
{{See also|Sanhedrin}}
''[[Halakha]]'' ({{lang-he|הלכה}}; literally "walking") is the collective body of [[rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic Jewish]] religious laws derived from the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]], including the [[Mishnah]], the halakhic [[Midrash]], the [[Talmud]], and its commentaries. After the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)#Destruction of Jerusalem|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the year 70 during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]], the Oral Law was developed through intensive and expansive interpretations of the written Torah.

The ''halakhah'' has developed gradually through a variety of legal and quasi-legal mechanisms, including [[Judiciary|judicial]] decisions, [[legislation|legislative]] enactments, and [[customary law]]. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, are referred to as ''[[Responsa#In Judaism|responsa]]''. Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law were written based on Talmudic literature and responsa. The most influential code, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], guides the religious practice of most [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and some [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jews]].

According to rabbinic tradition there are [[613 mitzvot]] in the written Torah. The ''mitzvot'' in the Torah (also called the [[Law of Moses]]) pertain to nearly every aspect of human life. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups (the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite|Leviyim]]), members of the tribe of [[Levi]], some only to farmers within the [[Land of Israel]]. Some laws are only applicable when there is a [[Temple in Jerusalem]] (see [[Third Temple]]).

{{Italic title|force=true}}
'''''Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd.''''' was the first case to be decided by the [[Supreme Court of India]] on the issue of [[domain name]] protection, and dealt with two businesses employing variations on the same mark ("Sify" ) in their respective domain names.

In the case, the Supreme Court pronounced that the Indian [[Trade Marks Act, 1999]] is applicable to the regulation of domain names. The decision in favour of Satyam Infoway was premised on the court's observation that domain names may have all the features of trademarks. The court considered the confusion that may result in the market due to the use of identical or similar domain names. In such a situation, instead of being directed to the website of the legitimate owner of the name, a user could be diverted to the website of an unauthorized user of a similar or identical name. Upon arrival at the unauthorized site, customers might not find the goods or services customarily associated with the mark, and might be led to believe that the legitimate owner was misrepresenting its wares. This could result in the domain name's owner suffering a loss of market share and goodwill.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"&gt;{{cite court

==Facts==
The [[appellant]] in the Supreme Court action, Satyam Infoway Ltd., alleged that the [[respondent]], Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd., had intentionally registered and operated a domain name that was confusingly similar to one owned by Satyam Infoway. Satyam Infoway claimed that it had in 1999, registered several domain names pertaining to its business: sifynet.com, sifymall.com, sifyrealestate.com, with the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) and the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO). It submitted that the word "[[Sify]]"&amp;nbsp;– which was an amalgam of elements of its corporate name "Satyam Infoway"&amp;nbsp;– was a "fanciful" term, and that it had further garnered substantial [[Goodwill (accounting)|goodwill]] in the market. Meanwhile, Sifynet Solutions had started using the word "Siffy" as part of the domain names under which it carried on internet marketing (namely siffynet.com and siffynet.net), claiming to have registered them with ICANN in 2001.&lt;ref name="CedricManara2"&gt;{{Citation

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Satyam Infoway alleged that Sifynet Solutions was attempting to pass off its services as those belonging to Satyam Infoway by using a deceptively similar word as part of its domain name. Satyam Infoway claimed that this would cause confusion in the minds of the relevant consumers, who would mistake the services of Sifynet Solutions as belonging to Satyam Infoway.&lt;ref name="CedricManara2"/&gt;

Sifynet Solutions contended that unlike a trade mark, the registration of a domain name did not confer an intellectual property right in the name. It averred that a domain name is merely an address on the computer, which allows communications from the consumers to reach the owner of the business, and confers no comparable property rights in the same.&lt;ref name="CedricManara2"/&gt;

Because of a [[Non liquet|lacuna]] in the intellectual property laws of India, there was no law which specifically addressed disputes relating to domain names. Therefore, members of the Internet community asked the courts to apply trade mark law as an effective avenue of redress for their disputes. The High Court responded and held that domain names could be adequately protected under the doctrine of [[passing off]] referred to in the Indian law of trade marks. This doctrine was applied to resolve domain name disputes in ''Rediff Communication Ltd. v. Cyberbooth &amp; Anr.'' (AIR 2000 Bombay 27), ''Yahoo Inc. v. Akash OP Aurora'' [1999 PTC (19) 201], ''Acqua Minerals Ltd. v. Pramod Borse &amp; Anr.'' [2001 PTC 619 (Del)], ''Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. v. Manu Kosuri'' [2001 PTC 859 (Del)]. The Supreme Court in ''Satyam Infoway Ltd. v. Sifynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd.,'' affirmed the law laid down by these various High Courts, and established a modicum of certainty with regard to the law in this contentious sphere.&lt;ref name="RaghvendraSinghRaghuvanshi3"&gt;{{Citation

==City Civil Court==
Satyam Infoway filed suit in the City Civil Court, Bangalore, and requested a [[temporary injunction]] against Sifynet Solutions. The court ruled in favour of Satyam Infoway and granted the temporary injunction. It stated that Satyam Infoway was the prior user of the word "Sify", and that it had garnered immense popularity in respect of the sale of internet and computer services sold under the same. It further found that Sifynet Solutions' domain name was confusingly similar to that of Satyam Infoway, and would consequently create confusion in the minds of the public with respect to the source of the services.&lt;ref name="CedricManara2"/&gt;

==High Court==
Sifynet Solutions appealed to the [[Karnataka High Court]], which heard the case. The High Court based its decision on a consideration of where the [[balance of convenience]] lay. The High Court stated that Sifynet Solutions had already invested heavily in securing a customer base for the business (about 50,000 members), and would consequently suffer immense hardship and irreparable injury if the court found in Satyam Infoway's favour. It noted that the business that the two parties were involved in were disparate, and therefore there was no possibility of the customers being misled by similar domain names.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"/&gt; Further, since Satyam Infoway also had that name to use in trade, the High Court believed that it would not cause them considerable hardship to deny the temporary injunction.&lt;ref name="CedricManara2"/&gt;

==Supreme Court==
The Supreme Court, through a bench comprising Justices [[Ruma Pal]] and [[P. Venkatarama Reddi]], set aside the decision of the High Court, and ruled in favour of Satyam Infoway. It declared that domain names are subject to the regulatory framework that is applied to trade marks (i.e. the Trade Marks Act, 1999). The court stated that though there is no law in India which explicitly governs the regime of domain names, this state of affairs does not foreclose protection for domain names under the aegis of the Trade Marks Act. Thus, the court determined that domain names are protected under the law relating to passing off as delineated in the Trade Marks Act.&lt;ref name="ChanderMLall5"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to arrive at the Holding, the Supreme Court analogized domain names to trade marks. After an elaboration of sections 2(zb), 2(m), and 2(z), the court stated that a domain name in the contemporary era has evolved from a mere business address to a business identifier. Therefore, a domain name is not merely a portal for internet navigation, but also an instrument which distinguishes and identifies the goods or services of the business, while simultaneously providing the specific internet location. This feature of domain names in the modern era allows them to be likened to trade marks, and concomitantly to be included within the purview of the Trade Marks Act.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"/&gt;

===Passing off===
The court delineated the elements of an action for passing off that Satyam Infoway would have to prove in order to succeed. Firstly, Satyam Infoway had to prove accumulated goodwill in the name "Sify", such that it would be apparent that the consumers associated the name "Sify" with the services offered by Satyam Infoway.&lt;ref name="MarylouBillawalla5"&gt;{{Citation

|first1=Marylou
|title=Domain Names- An Overview of the Law
|journal=BCA Journal
|year=2004
|url=http://www.bcasonline.org/articles/artin.asp?403
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Satyam Infoway discharged this burden by demonstrating that the name "Sify" had acquired immense repute in the market in association with their services. Satyam Infoway argued that it had 840 cyber cafés, five [[lakh]] (five hundred thousand) subscribers, and 54 units of presence all over India. Moreover, it adduced evidence to indicate that it was the first Indian internet company to be listed on the [[NASDAQ]] stock exchange in 1999, and that it had expended an enormous amount of money towards the same. It further presented several newspaper articles which had specifically referred to Satyam Infoway company as "Sify", and further various advertisements developed to promote their services which had also prominently referred to Satyam Infoway as "Sify".&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"/&gt;

Secondly, Satyam Infoway had to establish that Sifynet Solutions had misrepresented its services to the consumers, such that a likelihood of confusion was created in the minds of the consuming public that the services offered by Sifynet Solutions belonged to Satyam Infoway.&lt;ref name="MarylouBillawalla5"/&gt;

Thirdly, Satyam Infoway was required to prove that a likelihood of confusion in the minds of consumers would inevitably be a result due to the use of a similar domain name by Sifynet Solutions, and further, that such confusion would cause injury to the public and definite loss to Satyam Infoway. The standard applied by the court to assess likelihood of confusion was that of an unwary consumer of "average intelligence and imperfect recollection".&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"/&gt; The court expressed the opinion that in the field of internet services, the difference in the nature of services offered by businesses may not be of much consequence due to the method of operation on the internet. The court discussed this facet at length and explained that the accessibility of domain names to a wide spectrum of users underscores the point that similarity in domain names would lead to confusion and also receipt of unsought for services.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"/&gt;

===Distinction between trade mark and domain name===
The court proceeded to distinguish between the nature of a trade mark and a domain name. It stated that the distinction is important to determine the scope of protection available to the rights of an owner of either of the two. The court indicated that they can be distinguished primarily on the basis of the method of operation. While, a trade mark upon registration in a particular country acquires rights which are purely national in character, the operation of a domain name cannot be contained within a specific country. Thus, due to this facet of domain names, the court expressed the opinion that it would be difficult to protect them effectively under national laws. In this regard, the court expressed that the International Registrars, i.e., WIPO, and ICANN, had provided a modicum of effective protection to domain names.&lt;ref name="SupremeCourtofIndia1"/&gt;

===Balance of convenience===
The Supreme Court disagreed with the High Court on the issue of where the balance of convenience lay. The court stated that no irreparable injury would be caused to Sifynet Solutions by proscribing him from using the domain name. It instead believed that Satyam Infoway had garnered immense goodwill associated with its business, and therefore denying it the use of its domain name would render injustice to it.

The court also ruled that the right to use similar domain names could not be conferred upon both the parties in equal measure, since upon evidence adduced during the proceedings it was reasonable to conclude that Sifynet Solutions had adopted Satyam Infoway's mark with a dishonest intention to pass off its services as those of Satyam Infoway's.

==Subsequent developments==
While the decision was appreciated for the finality it introduced in respect of the law regulating domain name disputes, it was also criticized by some in the legal circles for failing to notice the significant distinctions between trade marks and domain names. The decision has also been criticized because it is believed that the Trade Marks legislation is not equipped to deal with the myriad disputes that arise in the domain name realm. Further, it is also believed that even the [[Information Technology Act, 2000]], has failed to fill in the lacunae in the Trade Marks Act with respect to domain names.&lt;ref name="SlahudeenAhmed7"&gt;{{Citation

In 2004, The National Internet Exchange of India (NIXI), a not-for-profit company under Section 25 of Indian Companies Act 1956 promoted by the Department of Information Technology (DIT) in association with the Internet Service providers Association of India (ISPAI), was entrusted with the responsibility of setting up the Registry for .IN country code top level domain name (ccTLD). For this the  NIXI will create the .IN Network Information Centre (INNIC) to operate as a Registry for .IN domain in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://registry.in/system/files/inpolicy_0.pdf|title=IN INTERNET DOMAIN NAME - POLICY FRAMEWORK &amp; IMPLEMENTATION|last=Govt. Of India|first=MEITY|date=Government of India|website=|access-date=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, NIXI/.IN Registry came up with .IN Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (INDRP), pertaining to resolution of domain name disputes between the Trademark Holders and the .IN Domain Registrants based upon the similar principles as [[Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy|Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy]]. INDRP very clearly reads under clause 4 as:'' "The Registrant is required to submit to a mandatory Arbitration proceeding in the event that a Complainant files a complaint to IN Registry, in compliance with this Policy and Rules thereunder".'' That is, as soon as you register .IN Domain Name you become liable under INDRP for any complaint filed against the Domain Name. INDRP proceedings are conducted in accordance with IN Domain Name Dispute Policy, INDRP Rules of Procedure and Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Wherein the panelist (in UDRP) is referred to as an Arbitrator under INDRP policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.indrp.com/indrp-faqs/|title=INDRP, .In Domain Dispute Resolution Policy, FAQs|work=INDRP - IN Domain Disputes|access-date=2017-05-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fr. Sauter AG''' is a Swiss based [[Corporate group]], internationally active in [[building automation]] and [[system integration]], with headquarters in [[Basel]]. It operates from its head office under the name of ''Fr. Sauter AG''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707142822/http://bs.powernet.ch/webservices/inet/HRG/HRG.asmx/getHRGHTML?chnr=CH-270.3.003.244-9&amp;amt=270&amp;toBeModified=0&amp;validOnly=0&amp;lang=1&amp;sort=0] Online access to the commercial register entry of company no. CH-270.3.003.244-9&lt;/ref&gt; The group employs around 2300 people and generated sales of [[Swiss franc|CHF]] 406.6 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.badische-zeitung.de/basel/sauter-macht-mehr-umsatz--105364831.html] "Sauter macht mehr Umsatz" ("Badische Zeitung")&lt;/ref&gt; in 2014.

== History ==
In 1910, the company was founded by Fritz Sauter in [[Grindelwald]] (CH) as a manufacturer of electrical [[time switch]]es. The growing number of incoming orders led to an expansion and relocation of the operation to [[Basel]]. In 1920, the company was converted into a [[private limited company]].

In 1912, Sauter brought its first product to the market in the form of a time-switch – an [[astronomical clock]] for switching city [[street light]]ing on and off. The lights were switched on and off in the evening and morning, at the seasonal hour for twilight.

In 1917, Sauter developed a [[Water heating|boiler]] for the Basel power station, which was well received on the market. The company had already moved its workshop to Basel in 1916 because of its good relationship with the power station.

In 1935, Sauter took the step from time- or [[temperature]]-controlled activation of equipment to control technology, thus laying the foundation for its current main business.

In the early 1950s, Sauter started integrating [[electronics]] into the products. The product range comprised devices for controlling temperature, humidity and pressure.

In 1974, Sauter brought its first software-controlled [[building management system]] onto the market; in 1981, the first devices with [[microprocessor]]s.

In 1984, Sauter Holding AG was founded to defend against a hostile takeover bid. The operational activities are consolidated under Fr. Sauter AG.

In 1997, the first Internet-based automation product, that enables the system to be controlled using a [[web browser]], came onto the market.

Starting in 2000, Sauter expanded its activities into the service sector. [[Facility management]] became an integral part of its key business.

In 2002, Sauter began integrating the standardised [[BACnet]] communication protocol into the products.

In 2009, Sauter brought its Energy Management Solution (EMS) onto the market.

In 2012, the Sauter Vision Center software, a building management suite with a modular, scalable visualisation and management level, came onto the market.

== Group structure ==
The Sauter Group includes 16 subsidiaries in Europe, [[joint venture]]s in China and the Middle East, and local agencies in other countries. Countries with Sauter subsidiaries: Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, Austria, Slovakia, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Serbia. The portfolio includes the four specialist fields of Systems, Components, Services and Facility Management. The Facility Management business in Germany is managed by Sauter FM GmbH with headquarters in [[Augsburg]], a 100-percent owned subsidiary of the German Sauter branch.

== Products and services ==
Sauter produces hardware and software for regulation, control and building management systems for applications in the fields of heating, ventilation and air conditioning. The product range includes room [[sensors]], transducers, [[thermostat]]s, [[pressure switch]]es, electrical actuators, pneumatic actuators, valves, mixing valves, and dampers. On the management level, Sauter develops various software solutions for building management, as well as systems and room automation stations for individual room control and room management. Development and production takes place at the factory in Basel.

The area of building services includes services such as contracting, maintenance and monitoring. An increasingly important mainstay are services in the field of energy-conscious, technical, infrastructural and commercial facility management.

== Previous areas of activity ==

=== Boilers, electric cooking stoves ===
To operate on the French market, Sauter saw the need to set up a French production site. In 1923 Fritz Sauter and Godefroy Schlumberger&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gen-gen.ch/SCHLUMBERGER/Godefroy/1123040 See entry on www.gen-gen.ch]&lt;/ref&gt; founded the ''Société pour l'exploitation des Procédés Sauter Sàrl'' in the [[Alsace|Alsation]] town of [[Saint-Louis, Haut-Rhin|Saint-Louis]]. Sauter initially used the French production plant to assemble only [[Water heating|boiler]] of the ''Cumulus''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ultimheat.com/Museum/section2/1929%20Sauter.pdf Procédés Sauter – Société Anonyme: ''Chauffe-eau „Cumulus“'', 1929, PDF 4,19 MB, French; accessed on 10 October 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; brand and storage heaters of the ''Primulus'' brand. Due to the [[World War II|Second World War]] the French government moved any industry close to the border further into the country, and the Procédés Sauter relocated to [[Claye-Souilly]], thus also distancing itself from its Swiss partner. In 1948 Sauter sold its share of the Procédés Sauter to ''Continental et Garnier'' and, on 1 June 1948, it formed a new subsidiary, ''Sauter Appareils Automatiques SA'', in Saint-Louis. While Continental et Garnier retained the Sauter brand for the household appliance sector, the new company busied itself with [[Control engineering|control technology]].&lt;ref&gt;See Brückner p. 116-121&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 Garnier was taken over by [[Schlumberger]]. [[Brandt (brand)|Brandt SA]] gave the Sauter kitchen appliance brand&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confort-sauter.com/a-propos-de-sauter Entry on www.confort-sauter.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sauter-electromenager.com/web/sauter/la-marque|title=A propos de Sauter|work=Sauter électroménager|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; access to the Spanish [[Fagor]] Group, which filed for bankruptcy in November 2013. In April 2014 Fagor was partially taken over by the Algerian Groupe [[Cevital]].

=== Electricity meters ===
In 1991 the control technology-related activities in France were divested into a new company, ''Sauter Regulation SA''.&lt;ref&gt;Société Anonyme (France), later changed to an SAS ([[Société par actions simplifiée]])&lt;/ref&gt; The activities that remained with ''Sauter Appareils Automatiques SA'' (development, production and sale of electricity meters for the French market) were sold to the [[Uster Technologies|Zellweger Luwa]] Group in 1992. These activities were transferred from Zellweger to the Deutsche Zählergesellschaft,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dzg.de/en/company/company-history/|title=Company History|author=Deutsche Zählergesellschaft Oranienburg mbH|date=31 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which closed the plant in 2007 after it had relocated to [[Mulhouse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societe.com/societe/stepper-energie-france-388774143.html|title=STEPPER ENERGIE FRANCE|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ozonation and control of water supply installations ===
In 1948 the company got involved with the control of water supply installations with a [[Reservoir|water reservoir]] in [[Les Brenets]].&lt;ref&gt;Seee Brückner p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, in collaboration with the ''Compagnie des eaux et de l'ozone''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societe.com/societe/compagnie-des-eaux-et-de-l-ozone-procedes-m-p-otto-775667363.html|title=CIE DES EAUX OZONE PROCEDES M POTTO|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the drinking water supply of the canton psychiatric hospital in [[Boudry]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clin24-kliniken.de/hopital-psychiatrique-cantonal-perreux-Boudry See entry on www.clin24-kliniken.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020163419/http://www.clin24-kliniken.de/hopital-psychiatrique-cantonal-perreux-Boudry |date=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Neuchâtel was upgraded. As a result, the [[ozonation]] of drinking water became a separate line of business. From 1972 onwards, Sauter ozone installations were also used to neutralise odours in the return air of [[Sewage treatment|purification plants]]. The ozonation business was sold to Christ Water Technology AG around 1980.

The remaining business for controlling water supply installations was sold to Rittmeyer AG in 1996.

'''Sidney (or Sydney) Stanley''' (''né'' '''Solomon Wulkan''', alias '''Solomon Koszyski''',&lt;ref name="wb161"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''161&lt;/ref&gt; alias '''Stanley Rechtand''',&lt;ref name="WB136"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''136&lt;/ref&gt; later '''Schlomo ben Chaim'''&lt;ref name="WB246"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''246&lt;/ref&gt;) (1899/1905&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) at ''p.''63 claims that Stanley was 43 at the time of the tribunal but at ''pp''136–137 he suggests that he was 14 in 1913&lt;/ref&gt; – 1969) was a Polish ''émigré'' to the UK who became a dubious businessman of precarious ethics before claiming to be a ''contact man'', able to influence politicians and civil servants in return for cash bribes, claims that led to a great scandal and investigation by the [[Lynskey tribunal]] of 1948. There is also evidence that Stanley [[espionage|spied]] against the UK for the armed nationalist activist [[Irgun]] organisation. Stanley was ordered deported, but had lost his Polish nationality, and as a result was a [[statelessness|stateless person]]. Stanley was then placed under heavy restrictions and police surveillance. In 1949, he evaded police and fled to [[France]] and thence to [[Israel]], where he was granted citizenship through right-of-return. There he lived out the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.

==Early life==
Stanley was the eldest son of twelve children born in Poland. He had emigrated to Britain with his father&lt;ref name="dispatch"&gt;Account of his wife, published in the ''Sunday Dispatch'' 30 January 1949, quoted in Wade Baron (1966), ''p.''237&lt;/ref&gt; in 1913,&lt;ref name="WB136"/&gt; the rest of the family following when the two had settled in [[Aldgate]].&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt; He later said he was born in [[Oświęcim]]. He was granted a [[Polish passport]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron 1966) ''p.''242&lt;/ref&gt; He gave a fairly ambiguous account of his early career but seems to have been employed from the age of 14 in garment sales and trading, especially in government contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''136–137&lt;/ref&gt; He took his mother's name Koszyski.&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt;

He married his first wife Kate Zeitlin after World War I and the couple lived in [[Stoke Newington]] with Zeitlin's mother.&lt;ref name="dispatch"/&gt;

Stanley was made bankrupt in 1927, under the name Wulkan, and again in 1936, under the name Blotz.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''143&lt;/ref&gt; A [[deportation]] order was made against him in 1933 for [[conspiracy to defraud]]&lt;ref name="wb161"/&gt; though he proved untraceable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''243&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1946, he had established himself in a luxurious seven-room apartment in [[Park Lane (road)|Park Lane]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting with Gibson==
According to Stanley, in 1946, he was returning by train from a business trip to [[Manchester]] when the guard enquired whether he would make up a foursome for a game of [[solo whist]] with some other men. He consequently met [[George Gibson (trade unionist)|George Gibson]], a director of the [[Bank of England]].&lt;ref name="WB139"&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''139&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's account is that his party had asked Stanley for small change for their game and that Stanley had recognised Gibson through a common acquaintance, Cyril Ross.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''170&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson met Stanley several more times on the Manchester train before, in April 1947, running into him in the company of Marcus Wulkan, an American who had been involved in economic assistance to Britain during World War II and who was slightly known to Gibson. Stanley represented Wulkan as being his brother. Gibson invited the two to dinner, where they now met junior government minister [[John Belcher (politician)|John Belcher]], and after that Gibson visited Stanley's Park Lane home frequently.&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; At a subsequent dinner party attended by [[Morgan Phillips]] and four other [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MPs, Stanley became involved in raising finance for the [[anti-communist]] "Freedom and Democracy" organisation,&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; though he appears to have done little more than donate a cheque for £50 which was dishonoured.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''180&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1946, Stanley approached fur-dealer Cyril Ross, the common acquaintance from the Manchester train, with a business proposition. Ross said that he would be interested in a multiple store such as J.&amp;nbsp;Jones of Manchester. Stanley agreed to pursue the matter and also to get permission for flotation as a public company from the [[Capital Issues Committee]]. Stanley, somewhat prematurely, offered a directorship in J.&amp;nbsp;Jones to Gibson who, owing to his position, turned it down. Ross had originally intended that Stanley would be remunerated by equity in the new company but he ultimately lost trust, largely because of the extortionate expenses that Stanley regularly claimed, and agreed only to a fee for the work.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''126–127&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1948, Gibson introduced [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] [[Glenvil Hall]] to Stanley, believing that Marcus Wulkan might be in a position to arrange an American loan of £250 million to the UK government. At a dinner for Gibson on 23 March, Stanley ensured that he sat next to [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''361&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertaining Mr Belcher==
Belcher was keen to network with industrialists and was flattered by Stanley's apparent solicitude. The two rapidly became friends and Stanley offered Belcher use of a house that he had rented at [[Margate]] for the duration of the 1947 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] conference. Belcher took the opportunity to invite his wife, children and mother for a two-week vacation, and it soon became apparent to Stanley that the party was too large for his rented house. Stanley booked the party into a hotel in [[Cliftonville]] and, though Belcher at this point became nervous, Stanley insisted and prevailed. In the end, Belcher indulged himself thoroughly and the friendship between the pair became increasingly intimate.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''16–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley pressed more and more gifts of food and wine, a gold cigarette-case and ultimately a suit of a quality beyond the means, and clothing coupons, of a junior minister in post-war Britain. Stanley was full of rather vague industrial and commercial propositions that never came to any resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''23&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley also paid for suits for Gibson and [[Ministry of Works (United Kingdom)|Minister of Works]] [[Charles Key]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''121&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people warned of Stanley's unreliability including [[Hugh Dalton]], [[Leonard Joseph Matchan]] and Morgan Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spying==
In November 1947 an [[MI5]] report recorded that a man named "Stanley" had been passing information to Irgun from cabinet minister [[Manny Shinwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''360&lt;/ref&gt; Shinwell certainly knew Stanley whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the [[Transjordan Frontier Force]] from some government source.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt;

==Football pools==
Harry Sherman was a director of [[Shermans Pools Ltd]] of [[Cardiff]], a [[football pools]] promoter. The post-war paper-shortage had led the government to make an allocation of paper to the [[Football Pool Promoters' Association]] and to leave the association to share it among its members.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard,18 November 1947 adjournment debate 18 November 1947 (football pools reorganization)&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman believed his share to be unjust and took every opportunity to canvass anyone who could influence his case or find him an alternative source. However, Sherman's record of complaints of his misconduct in a closely regulated industry led the [[Board of Trade]] to start a [[prosecution]] against the company in January 1948. The [[magistrate]] who heard the case died before giving judgment and Sherman and his legal team galvanised into action to prevent a new hearing. Belcher was the minister responsible and was inundated with protests.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley contacted Sherman sometime in May, claiming to have already discussed the paper problems with Sherman's brother.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, D. "[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Generous+Sherman+brothers+should+not+be+forgotten%3B+Time+to+remember.-a080221051|Generous Sherman brothers should not be forgotten; Time to remember]", ''South Wales Echo'', 19 November 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Stanley introduced Sherman to Gibson and to Glenvil Hall. Sherman sought a public flotation of Shermans Ltd but needed the permission of the Capital Issues Committee though neither politician was optimistic. Stanley also canvassed Key over some premises that he was attempting to sell to Sherman.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''91&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 April, Stanley invited Belcher to stop by his Park Lane apartment. When he arrived he found Sherman. Belcher left angrily and later rebuked Stanley. Belcher decided to drop the prosecution against Sherman but the allocation of paper was now under his direct control and Sherman became still more insistent in seeking to increase his ration. Stanley continued to intercede on Sherman's behalf and Belcher agreed to meet with Sherman and the civil servant in charge of paper rationing on 24 June. At this meeting, Sherman revealed that he had been routinely exceeding his allocation. The government team were appalled and stopped the meeting indicating that they considered the matter a serious one and that an investigation would be inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the investigation could get under way, Sherman alleged that he had paid Stanley so that Stanley, in turn, could pay [[GBP]]2,500 each to Belcher and Sir [[Frank Soskice]], the [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]]. Sherman also claimed that he had loaned GBP12,000 to Stanley, secured by a GBP27,000 [[cheque]] made out to Lass &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''29&lt;/ref&gt; The cheque turned out to be a forgery, made out on a stolen blank cheque.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''32&lt;/ref&gt; Appalled, and becoming increasingly aware that rumours were beginning to circulate, Belcher tried to warn Gibson but could not contact him. Senior civil servants had now become aware of the allegations and the police were involved. Belcher agreed that the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[William Jowitt, 1st Earl Jowitt]] should be alerted and asked to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''33–34&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September, Belcher received a request from Jowitt that he provide a statement about his dealings with Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''36&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 October, the first rumours, though no names, appeared in the press.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stanley's arrest==
Jacob Harris was a supplier of amusement machines whose solicitor also acted for Stanley. The solicitor had originally met Stanley through [[service (law)|serving]] a bankruptcy notice on him and had ended up as his attorney. The original debtor never got paid. Stanley boasted of his surplus import licenses and the solicitor advised Harris whom he knew wanted to import [[pinball]] machines.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''72&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1948, Harris approached fellow supplier Francis Price with a proposal that they meet with Stanley. Stanley claimed that he could bribe Belcher and [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]] Glenvil Hall to obtain licenses. After canvassing some commercial and political confidantes, Price contacted the police. Press speculation intensified.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''37–39&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August, Stanley asked Gibson to write letters of introduction for his wife, who was about to leave for the US, to some of Gibson's trade union colleagues there. Gibson complied and Stanley used the letters to attempt to obtain from [[HM Treasury]] foreign currency above the usual allowance. Stanley's approach alerted officials to the possibility that he was about to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''178&lt;/ref&gt; 27 August was also the day when Gibson sent a cheque for GBP500 to Stanley as deposit on a share offer in Gray's Carpets Ltd. Gibson heard nothing more from Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''172&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was arrested on 18 October and held in [[Brixton Prison]]. Spartan though his surroundings were, he was able to order meals from a restaurant and pay another detainee for domestic duties.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp''39–40&lt;/ref&gt; He was bailed on 21 October and returned to his Park Lane flat where his movements were restricted under the [[Aliens Order 1946]].&lt;ref&gt;SR&amp;O No.395. of 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tribunal==
{{main|Lynskey tribunal}}
A tribunal was convened. Stanley, dapper in appearance, proved a self-important, self-aggrandising witness who amused the tribunal with his idiosyncratic, colourful, yet ambiguous and contradictory, responses to the questioning.&lt;ref name="Andrew 2009 p.361"/&gt; The tribunal found that Belcher and Gibson had acted improperly and they were fortunate to escape prosecution, gladly accepting the proffered alternative of resignation. [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney-General]] Sir [[Hartley Shawcross]] expressed the opinion that Stanley could not be prosecuted as the notoriety he gained from the tribunal would inhibit a [[fair trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.''232&lt;/ref&gt; The spying allegations were not raised in the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.''362&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the tribunal==
On 23 December, Stanley applied for cancellation of his deportation order but was refused.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 225&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Gibson and Belcher were resigning in disgrace, Stanley and his wife were enjoying their notoriety and celebrity, attending the [[Chelsea Arts Ball]] at New Year.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''p.'' 226&lt;/ref&gt;

In a debate in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 3 February 1949, Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] expressed the government view that Stanley should be deported as the deportation would be "conducive to the public good". Attlee was probably principally motivated by the spying allegations and Stanley's Zionist connections.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew (2009) ''p.'' 362&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the deportation order, the British government found that it could not deport Stanley, because no country was willing to receive him. He had lost citizenship in his home country of Poland, which was unwilling to take him in. Due to the changes in Poland's borders since [[World War II]], the Polish government required all Polish citizens to re-register home and abroad. Stanley had not done so, and in addition, the Polish Foreign Ministry announced that he would not be allowed to return. As a result, Stanley was rendered a [[statelessness|stateless person]], and could not be deported unless his country of origin or some other country was willing to receive him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19490217&amp;id=BwIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-SMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3967,3950397 Britain Has Its Hands Full in Ousting of Stateless Man], February 17, 1949&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1949, Stanley applied for [[Israel]]i nationality. On 13 February, his application was rejected on the grounds that he was an undesirable. The Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' attacked Stanley as a Jew who "suddenly discovered his love for [[Zion]]" when in difficulties and there was speculation that Stanley had done his case no good when he criticised the conduct of the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] during his tribunal testimony. Stanley continued to entertain and enjoy his celebrity, despite continued calls for his deportation, while he was again pursued by the bankruptcy courts.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 242–244&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley threatened to sue Israel for denying him entry, and empowered his lawyers in Israel to take action in court to get him an immigration visa. His lawyers in Israel argued that under the new state's proposed constitution, no Jew could be barred from immigrating to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2194&amp;dat=19490212&amp;id=14Y0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RtwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6162,3671203 Jew Threatens to Sue to Get Into Israel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stanley was still required daily to report to police but reported for the last time on 1 April and an [[arrest warrant]] was issued. Stanley, it appears, drove to [[Ramsgate]], where a personal friend took him by sea to a port near [[Boulogne]] in France, possibly [[Dunkirk]]. He was taken from there by car to [[Abbeville]]. On 13 April, Israel announced that it would accept Stanley's application for an immigration visa and admit him to the country on the eve of [[Passover]] as "an act of grace and mercy". After about a month in France, Stanley travelled to [[Marseilles]], where he boarded the Israeli ship ''Atzmaut''. On 9 May, he arrived in [[Haifa]] aboard the ''Atzmaut'' together with about 2,000 other immigrants to Israel. He then held a press conference announcing that his name was now '''Shlomo Ben-Chaim'''. He made various claims regarding his disappearance, including that he had been kidnapped and held in France for a month, that he had escaped from Britain disguised as an admiral, and then as a military officer who became a passenger on a British destroyer. His lawyer, Max Seligman, said he was a "psychological case".&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19490513&amp;id=RB0QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IZMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1590,1891857 Stanley Outstays His Welcome in Tel Aviv]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime later in 1949, Stanley returned to France with some thoughts of re-establishing himself in business, but moved back to Israel in 1950, where he spent the remainder of his life in obscurity, save for the wild allegations and stories that he continued to press on the newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Wade Baron (1966) ''pp'' 244–250&lt;/ref&gt; Stanley died in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19690526&amp;id=VZZAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6215,4192005 Death of Sidney Stanley recalls 1949 scandal]&lt;/ref&gt;

Social exclusion is the process in which individuals or people are systematically blocked from (or denied full access to) various rights, opportunities and resources that are normally available to members of a different group, and which are fundamental to social integration and observance of human rights within that particular group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adler.edu/page/institutes/institute-on-social-exclusion/about|title=About|publisher=[[Adler University]]  |work= Institute on Public Safety and Social Justice }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., housing, employment, healthcare, civic engagement, democratic participation, and due process).

Anyone who appears to deviate in any way from [[Normative social influence|perceived norms]] of a population may thereby become subject to coarse or subtle forms of social exclusion.

The outcome of social exclusion is that affected individuals or communities are prevented from participating fully in the economic, social, and political life of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;Young, I. M. (2000). Five faces of oppression. In M. Adams, (Ed.), Readings for Diversity and Social Justice (pp. 35–49). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; This may result to a resistance in form of demonstrations, protests, or lobbying from the excluded people.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, T., 2006. A right to inclusion? Homelessness, human rights and social exclusion. Australian Journal of Human Rights, 12(1), pp.185-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Most of the characteristics listed in this article are present together in studies of social exclusion, due to exclusion's multidimensionality.

Another way of articulating the definition of social exclusion is as follows:

{{quotation|Social exclusion is a multidimensional process of progressive social rupture, detaching groups and individuals from social relations and institutions and preventing them from full participation in the normal, normatively prescribed activities of the society in which they live.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shababinclusion.org/content/document/detail/558/1 Hilary Silver, ''Social Exclusion: Comparative Analysis of Europe and Middle East Youth,'' Middle East Youth Initiative Working Paper (September 2007), p.15]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an alternative conceptualization, social exclusion theoretically emerges at the individual or group level on four correlated dimensions: insufficient access to [[social rights]], material deprivation, limited [[social participation]] and a lack of normative integration. It is then regarded as the combined result of personal risk factors (age, gender, race); macro-societal changes (demographic, economic and labor market developments, technological innovation, the evolution of social norms); government legislation and social policy; and the actual behavior of businesses, administrative organisations and fellow citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G.

==Individual exclusion==
{{quotation|"The marginal man...is one whom fate has condemned to live in two societies and in two, not merely different but antagonistic cultures....his mind is the crucible in which two different and refractory cultures may be said to melt and, either wholly or in part, fuse."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert E. Park]], ''Cultural Conflict and the Marginal Man'' in Everett V Stonequist, ''The Marginal Man,'' Introduction, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Social exclusion at the individual level results in an individual's exclusion from meaningful participation in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/1323238x.2006.11910818|title = A right to inclusion? Homelessness, human rights and social exclusion| journal=Australian Journal of Human Rights| volume=12| pages=185–204|date = December 2006|last1 = Walsh|first1 = Tamara}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the exclusion of [[single mother]]s from the [[Social welfare provision|welfare]] system prior to welfare reforms of the 1900s. The modern welfare system is based on the concept of entitlement to the basic means of being a productive member of [[society]] both as an organic function of society and as compensation for the socially useful labor provided. A single mother's contribution to society is not based on [[informal sector|formal employment]], but on the notion that provision of welfare for children is a necessary social expense. In some career contexts, caring work is devalued and [[motherhood]] is seen as a barrier to employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last =Lessa | first = Iara | title=Discursive struggles within social welfare: Restaging teen motherhood | journal= [[The British Journal of Social Work]] | volume=36 | issue = 2 | pages=283–298 | doi=10.1093/bjsw/bch256 | date = February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Single mothers were previously marginalized in spite of their significant role in the socializing of [[children]] due to views that an individual can only contribute meaningfully to society through "gainful" employment as well as a cultural bias against unwed mothers. When the father's sole task was seen as the breadwinner, his marginalization was primarily a function of class condition. Solo fatherhood brings additional trials due to society being less accepting of males 'getting away with' not working and the general invisibility/lack of acknowledgement of single fathers in society. Acknowledgement of the needs participatory fathers may have can be found by examining the changes from the original clinical report on the father’s role published by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] in May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coleman|first=William L.|last2=Garfield|first2=Craig|last3=American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health|date=May 2004|title=Fathers and pediatricians: enhancing men's roles in the care and development of their children|journal=Pediatrics|volume=113|issue=5|pages=1406–1411|issn=1098-4275|pmid=15121965}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight week paternity leave is a good example of one social change. Child health care providers have an opportunity to have a greater influence on the child and family structure by supporting fathers and enhancing a father's involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yogman|first=Michael|last2=Garfield|first2=Craig F.|last3=Child|first3=the COMMITTEE ON PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF|last4=Health|first4=Family|date=2016-06-13|title=Fathers' Roles in the Care and Development of Their Children: The Role of Pediatricians|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2016/06/10/peds.2016-1128|journal=Pediatrics|volume=138|issue=1|language=en|pages=e20161128|doi=10.1542/peds.2016-1128|issn=0031-4005|pmid=27296867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More broadly, many women face social exclusion. Moosa-Mitha discusses the Western [[feminist movement]] as a direct reaction to the marginalization of white women in society.&lt;ref&gt;Moosa-Mitha, Mehmoona, (2005). Situating anti-oppressive theories within critical and difference-centred perspectives. In L. Brown &amp; S. Strega (Eds.) Research as Resistance (pp. 37–72). Toronto: Canadian Scholars' Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were excluded from the labor force and their work in the home was not valued. Feminists argued that men and women should equally participate in the labor force, in the public and private sector, and in the home. They also focused on labor laws to increase access to employment as well as to recognize [[child-rearing]] as a valuable form of labor. In some places today, women are still marginalized from [[Executive (management)|executive]] positions and continue to earn less than men in [[Senior management|upper management]] positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay | title=Did You Know That Women Are Still Paid Less Than Men? | publisher=White House | accessdate=February 7, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226155540/http://www.whitehouse.gov/equal-pay | archivedate=December 26, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of individual marginalization is the exclusion of individuals with [[disabilities]] from the [[Labour (economics)|labor]] force. Grandz discusses an employer's viewpoint about hiring individuals living with disabilities as jeopardizing [[productivity]], increasing the rate of [[absenteeism]], and creating more accidents in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)"&gt;Leslie, D.R., Leslie K. &amp; Murphy M. (2003). Inclusion by design: The challenge for social work in workplace accommodation for people with disabilities. In W. Shera (Eds.), Emerging perspectives on anti-oppression practice (pp. 157–169). Toronto: Canadian Scholar's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Cantor also discusses employer concern about the excessively high cost of accommodating people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)" /&gt; The marginalization of individuals with disabilities is prevalent today, despite the legislation intended to prevent it in most western countries, and the [[academic]] achievements, skills and training of many disabled people.&lt;ref name="Leslie (2003)" /&gt;

There are also exclusions of lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender ([[LGBT]]) and other intersexual people because of their [[sexual orientation]]s and [[gender identity|gender identities]]. The [[Yogyakarta Principles]] require that the states and communities abolish any [[stereotype]]s about LGBT people as well as stereotyped [[gender role]]s.

==Community exclusion==
Many communities experience social exclusion, such as racial  (e.g., [[Black people|black]]) (e.g., [[Untouchable (social system)|Untouchables]] or Low Castes or [[Dalits]] in [[Indian Caste System ]]) and economic (e.g., [[Romani people|Romani]]) communities.

One example is the [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] community in Australia. Marginalization of Aboriginal communities is a product of [[colonization]]. As a result of [[colonialism]], Aboriginal communities lost their land, were forced into destitute areas, lost their sources of livelihood, and were excluded from the labor market. Additionally, Aboriginal communities lost their culture and values through [[forced assimilation]] and lost their rights in society.&lt;ref&gt;Baskin, C. (2003). Structural social work as seen from an Aboriginal Perspective. In W. Shera (Ed.), Emerging perspectives on anti-oppressive practice (pp. 65–78). Toronto: Canadian Scholar's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Today various Aboriginal communities continue to be marginalized from society due to the development of practices, policies and programs that "met the needs of white people and not the needs of the marginalized groups themselves".&lt;ref name="Yee (2005)"&gt;Yee, J.

Toronto: Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; Yee also connects marginalization to [[Minority group|minority]] communities, when describing the concept of [[whiteness]] as maintaining and enforcing dominant norms and discourse.&lt;ref name="Yee (2005)" /&gt;  [[Poverty|Poor people]] living in [[sink estate|run-down council estates]] and areas with high crime can be locked into [[social deprivation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radical.org.uk/barefoot/socex.htm|title=Social Exclusion: A Social Worker's View|author=Hilary Searing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other contributors==
Social exclusion has many contributors. Major contributors include race, income, employment status, social class, geographic location, personal habits and appearance, education, religion and political affiliation.

===Global and structural===

[[Globalization]] (global-capitalism), immigration, social welfare and policy are broader social structures that have the potential to contribute negatively to one's access to resources and services, resulting in the social exclusion of individuals and groups. Similarly, increasing use of information technology and company [[outsourcing]] have contributed to [[job insecurity]] and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Alphonse, George &amp; Moffat (2007) discuss how globalization sets forth a decrease in the role of the state with an increase in support from various "corporate sectors resulting in gross inequalities, injustices and marginalization of various vulnerable groups" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). Companies are outsourcing, jobs are lost, the [[cost of living]] continues to rise, and land is being [[expropriate]]d by large companies. Material goods are made in large abundances and sold at cheaper costs, while in India for example, the [[poverty line]] is lowered in order to mask the number of individuals who are actually living in poverty as a result of globalization. Globalization and structural forces aggravate poverty and continue to push individuals to the margins of society, while governments and large corporations do not address the issues (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).

Certain language and the meaning attached to language can cause universalizing discourses that are influenced by the Western world, which is what Sewpaul (2006) describes as the "potential to dilute or even [[annihilate]] local cultures and traditions and to deny context specific realities" (p.&amp;nbsp;421). What Sewpaul (2006) is implying is that the effect of dominant global discourses can cause individual and cultural displacement, as well as an experience of "de-localization", as individual notions of security and safety are jeopardized (p.&amp;nbsp;422). Insecurity and fear of an unknown future and instability can result in displacement, exclusion, and forced [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] into the dominant group. For many, it further pushes them to the margins of society or enlists new members to the outskirts because of global-capitalism and dominant discourses (Sewpaul, 2006).

With the prevailing notion of globalization, we now see the rise of [[immigration]] as the world gets smaller and smaller with millions of individuals relocating each year. This is not without hardship and struggle of what a newcomer thought was going to be a new life with new opportunities. Ferguson, Lavalette, &amp; Whitmore (2005) discuss how immigration has had a strong link to access of welfare support programs. Newcomers are constantly bombarded with the inability to access a country's resources because they are seen as "undeserving foreigners" (p.&amp;nbsp;132). With this comes a denial of access to [[public housing]], [[health care]] benefits, [[employment]] support services, and [[social security]] benefits (Ferguson et al., 2005). Newcomers are seen as undeserving, or that they must prove their [[entitlement]] in order to gain access to basic support necessities. It is clear that individuals are [[Exploitation of labour|exploited]] and marginalized within the country they have emigrated (Ferguson et al., 2005).

[[Welfare state]]s and social policies can also exclude individuals from basic necessities and support programs. Welfare payments were proposed to assist individuals in accessing a small amount of [[material wealth]] (Young, 2000). Young (2000) further discusses how "the provision of the welfare itself produces new injustice by depriving those dependent on it of rights and freedoms that others have…marginalization is unjust because it blocks the opportunity to exercise capacities in socially defined and recognized way" (p.&amp;nbsp;41). There is the notion that by providing a minimal amount of welfare support, an individual will be free from marginalization. In fact, welfare support programs further lead to injustices by restricting certain behaviour, as well the individual is mandated to other agencies. The individual is forced into a new system of rules while facing [[social stigma]] and [[stereotypes]] from the dominant group in society, further marginalizing and excluding individuals (Young, 2000). Thus, social policy and welfare provisions reflect the dominant notions in society by constructing and reinforcing categories of people and their needs. It ignores the unique-subjective human essence, further continuing the cycle of dominance (Wilson &amp; Beresford, 2000).

===Unemployment===
{{see also|Blacklisting|Involuntary unemployment}}
Whilst recognising the multi-dimensionality of exclusion, policy work undertaken at [[European Union]] level focuses on [[unemployment]] as a key cause of, or at least correlating with, social exclusion. This is because in modern societies, paid work is not only the principal source of income with which to buy services, but is also the fount of individuals' identity and feeling of self-worth. Most people's social networks and sense of embeddedness in society also revolve around their work. Many of the indicators of extreme social exclusion, such as poverty and homelessness, depend on monetary income which is normally derived from work. Social exclusion can be a possible result of long-term unemployment, especially in countries with weak welfare safety nets.&lt;ref&gt;Furlong, Andy. ''Youth Studies: An Introduction''. Routledge, 2013, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Much policy to reduce exclusion thus focuses on the labour market:
* On the one hand, to make individuals at risk of exclusion more attractive to employers, i.e. more "employable".
* On the other hand, to encourage (and/or oblige) employers to be more inclusive in their employment policies.

The EU's [[EQUAL Community Initiative]] investigated ways to increase the inclusiveness of the labour market. Work on social exclusion more broadly is carried out through the [[Open Method of Coordination]] (OMC) among the Member State governments.

===Religion===
{{see also|Shunning#in religion}}
Some religious traditions recommend [[excommunication]] of individuals said to deviate from a religious teaching, and in some instances [[shunning]] by family members. Some religious organisations permit the censure of critics.

Across societies, individuals and communities can be socially excluded on the basis of their religious beliefs. Social hostility against religious minorities and [[communal violence]] occur in areas where governments do not have policies restricting the religious practise of minorities. A study by the [[Pew Research Center]] on international [[religious freedom]] found that&lt;ref name="prc-1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Executive summary)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=491|accessdate=29 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="prc-2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Global Restrictions on Religion (Full report)|publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|date=December 2009|url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2009/12/restrictions-fullreport.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 61% of countries have social hostilities that tend to target religious minorities.&lt;ref name="pew2013"/&gt; The five highest social hostility scores were for [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Iraq]], and [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide-SHI.pdf|title=Table: Social Hostilities Index by country|year=2012|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121005033805/http%3A//stage.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Issues/Government/RisingTide%2DSHI.pdf|archivedate=2012-10-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Pew published that social hostilities declined in 2013, but Harassment of Jews increased.&lt;ref name="pew2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/02/26/religious-hostilities/|title=Latest Trends in Religious Restrictions and Hostilities|work=Pew Forum|date=26 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social inclusion==
Social inclusion, the converse of social exclusion, is [[affirmative action]] to change the circumstances and habits that lead to (or have led to) social exclusion.
The [[World Bank]] defines social inclusion as the process of improving the ability, opportunity, and dignity of people, disadvantaged on the basis of their identity, to take part in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=World Bank|title=Inclusion Matters: The Foundation for Shared Prosperity|year=2013|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-1-4648-0010-8|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/16195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on ''The Changing Nature of Work''&lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that enhanced social protection and better investments in human capital improve equality of opportunity and social inclusion.

Social Inclusion ministers have been appointed, and special units established, in a number of jurisdictions around the world. The first [[Minister for Social Inclusion]] was Premier of South Australia [[Mike Rann]], who took the portfolio in 2004. Based on the UK's [[Social Exclusion Unit]], established by Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 1997, Rann established the Social Inclusion Initiative in 2002. It was headed by Monsignor [[David Cappo]] and was serviced by a unit within the department of Premier and Cabinet. Cappo sat on the Executive Committee of the [[South Australian Cabinet]] and was later appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner with wide powers to address social disadvantage.  Cappo was allowed to roam across agencies given that most social disadvantage has multiple causes necessitating a "joined up" rather than a single agency response.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 28 April 2006,"Cappo appointed Social Inclusion Commissioner"&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative drove a big investment by the South Australian Government in strategies to combat [[homelessness]], including establishing Common Ground, building high quality inner city apartments for "rough sleeping" homeless people, the Street to Home initiative&lt;ref&gt;Street to Home, sacommunity.org&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICAN flexible learning program designed to improve school retention rates. It also included major funding to revamp mental health services following Cappo's "Stepping Up" report, which focused on the need for community and intermediate levels of care&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mifa.org.au|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an overhaul of disability services.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News 20 Oct 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] appointed [[Julia Gillard]] as the nation's first [[Social Inclusion Minister]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Economics ===
The problem of social exclusion is usually tied to that of [[equal opportunity]], as some people are more subject to such exclusion than others. [[Marginalisation]] of certain groups is a problem in many economically more developed countries, including the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]], where the majority of the population enjoys considerable economic and social opportunities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==In philosophy==
The marginal, the processes of marginalisation, etc. bring specific interest in [[postmodernism|postmodern]] and [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] philosophy and social studies.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert McInnis, [http://www.postcolonialweb.org/poldiscourse/mcinnis1.html The Struggle of Postmodernism and Postcolonialism], Laval University, Canada&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernism question the "center" about its authenticity and postmodern sociology and cultural studies research marginal cultures, behaviours, societies, the situation of the marginalized individual, etc.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Implications for social work practice==

Upon defining and describing marginalization as well as the various levels in which it exists, one must now explore its implications for social work practice. Mullaly (2007) describes how "the personal is political" and the need for recognizing that social problems are indeed connected with larger structures in society, causing various forms of oppression amongst individuals resulting in marginalization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Structural Social Work|last=Mullaly|first=Bob|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0195419061|location=|pages=252–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important for the social worker to recognize the intersecting nature of oppression. A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary on the part of the social worker. The worker must begin to understand [[oppression]] and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Working under an anti-oppression perspective would then allow the social worker to understand the lived, subjective experiences of the individual, as well as their cultural, historical and social background. The worker should recognize the individual as political in the process of becoming a valuable member of society and the structural factors that contribute to oppression and marginalization (Mullaly, 2007).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Social workers must take a firm stance on naming and labeling global forces that impact individuals and communities who are then left with no support, leading to marginalization or further marginalization from the society they once knew (George, P, SK8101, lecture, October 9, 2007).

The social worker should be constantly [[reflexivity (social theory)|reflexive]], work to raise the consciousness, [[Empowerment|empower]], and understand the lived subjective realities of individuals living in a fast-paced world, where fear and insecurity constantly subjugate the individual from the collective whole, perpetuating the dominant forces, while silencing the oppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sakamoto|first=Izumi|last2=Pitner|first2=Ronald O.|date=June 2005|title=Use of Critical Consciousness in Anti-Oppressive Social Work Practice: Disentangling Power Dynamics at Personal and Structural Levels|url=https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/article-abstract/35/4/435/1716745|journal=The British Journal of Social Work|volume=Volume 35, Issue 4|pages=435–452|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals and groups who are not professional social workers build relationships with marginalized persons by providing [[relational care]] and support, for example, through [[homeless ministry]]. These relationships validate the individuals who are marginalized and provide them a meaningful contact with the mainstream.

==Juridical concept==
There are countries, [[Italy]] for example, that have a legal concept of ''social exclusion''. In Italy, "''esclusione sociale''" is defined as [[poverty]] combined with [[social alienation]], by the [[statute]] n. 328 (11-8-2000), that instituted a state investigation commission named "''Commissione di indagine sull'Esclusione Sociale''" (CIES) to make an annual report to the government on legally expected issues of social exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/|title=''Commissione di Indagine sull’Esclusione Sociale'', accessed February 07, 2013|website=lavoro.gov.it|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117133555/http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/CIES/|archivedate=17 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]], a document on [[international human rights instruments]] affirms that "[[extreme poverty]] and social exclusion constitute a violation of [[human dignity]] and that urgent steps are necessary to achieve better knowledge of extreme poverty and its causes, including those related to the program of development, in order to promote the human rights of the poorest, and to put an end to extreme poverty and social exclusion and promote the enjoyment of the fruits of social progress. It is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the [[decision making]] process by the community in which they live, the promotion of human rights and efforts to combat extreme poverty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/(symbol)/a.conf.157.23.en|title=unhchr.ch|website=www.unhchr.ch|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
{{over-quotation|section|date=June 2017}}
''"Social exclusion is about the inability of our society to keep all groups and individuals within reach of what we expect as a society...[or] to realise their full potential."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268539/html/x2692.html|title=JultikaUniversity of Oulu repository|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''To be "excluded from [[society]]" can take various relative senses, but social exclusion is usually defined as more than a simple [[economic]] phenomenon: it also has consequences on the social, [[symbol]]ic field.''{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

''"Women of [[Pakistan]]i, [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshi]] and [[Caribbean]] descent [in Britain] are doing well in schools but are still being penalised in the workplace...80-89% of 16-year-olds from those ethnic groups wanted to work full-time...but they were up to four times more likely to be [[jobless]]."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5320708.stm | work=BBC News | title=Career worries for minority women | date=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Axel Honneth]] thus speaks of a "struggle for [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]]",  which he attempts to theorize through [[Hegel]]'s philosophy. In this sense, to be socially excluded is to be deprived from social recognition and social value. In the sphere of [[politics]], social recognition is obtained by full [[citizenship]]; in the economic sphere (in [[capitalism]]) it means being paid enough to be able to participate fully in the life of the community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Axel Honneth]], ''The Struggle for Recognition: Moral Grammar of Social Conflicts'', 1996. {{ISBN|978-0-7456-1838-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be gleaned from considering examples of the ''"social integration crisis: poverty, professional exclusion or marginalization, social and civic disenfranchisement, absence or weakening of support networks, frequent [[Clash of Civilizations|inter-cultural conflicts]]"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbact.eu/document-library/virtual-files/childhood/france/situation-of-single-parent-households-headed-by-wo.html ''single parent households''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929101857/http://urbact.eu/document-library/virtual-files/childhood/france/situation-of-single-parent-households-headed-by-wo.html |date=2007-09-29 }} Situation of single parent households headed by women&lt;/ref&gt; These relate not only to gender, race and disability, but also to [[crime]]:

''"Social exclusion is a major cause of crime and re-offending. Removing the right to vote increases social exclusion by signalling to serving prisoners that, at least for the duration of their sentence, they are dead to society. The additional punishment of disenfranchisement is not a deterrent. There is no evidence to suggest that criminals are deterred from offending behaviour by the threat of losing the right to vote.....(and) the notion of civic death for sentenced prisoners isolates still further those who are already on the margins of society and encourages them to be seen as alien to the communities to which they will return on release"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:D-HJsClzBxYJ:www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/documents/download.asp%3Flvid%3D436%26id%3D790+social+exclusion+disenfranchisement&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=10&amp;gl=uk ''Barred from Voting: the Right to Vote for Sentenced Prisoners''] {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suppression of evidence''' is a term used in the [[United States]] [[law|legal system]] to describe the lawful or unlawful act of preventing evidence from being shown in a trial.  This could happen for several reasons. For example, if a judge believes that the evidence in question was obtained illegally, the judge can rule that it not be shown in court.  It could also refer to a prosecutor improperly or intentionally hiding evidence that does not go with their case (their theory of what happened) and could sugguest or prove to the judge or jury that the defendant is not guilty or that (s)he is legally obligated to show the defense. In the latter case, this would be a violation of the 5th amendment to the [[United States Constitution]]. Also Rule 3.8 of the [[American Bar Association Model Rules of Professional Conduct|ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct]] requires prosecutors to "make timely disclosure to the defense of all evidence or information that tends to negate the guilt of the accused or mitigates the offense." (This is not for all states.) This can result in a mistrial in the latter case and/or the dismissal of the [[prosecutor]].

==Motion to suppress==
{{Criminal procedure (trial)}}
In [[common law]] legal systems{{Explain|date=February 2018|reason=The lead says this article is about US only; so it seems this isn't a subtopic}}, a '''motion to suppress''' is a formal, written request to a [[judge]] for an order that certain [[evidence]] be excluded from consideration by the judge or [[jury]] at [[trial]].  In the [[United States]], the term "motion to suppress" typically encompasses [[Motion (legal)|motions]] in [[criminal law|criminal]] cases where the proposed basis for exclusion arises from the [[United States Constitution]], a [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]], or a specific [[statute]] permitting the exclusion of certain types of evidence (for instance, a complaint that [[police]] procedures in a given case violated the [[defendant|defendant's]] [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] [[rights|right]] to be free from unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]]).

A motion to exclude evidence where the proposed basis for exclusion arises from the [[rules of evidence]] is more commonly termed a [[motion in limine]].

==United States Law==
In the United States, the motion to suppress stems from the [[exclusionary rule]]. As the court stated in [[Simmons v. United States]]: "In order to effectuate the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures, this Court long ago conferred upon defendants in federal prosecutions the right, upon motion and proof, to have excluded from trial evidence which had been secured by means of an unlawful search and seizure."&lt;ref&gt;Simmons v. United States, Page 390 U. S. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is grounded in [[searches and seizures clause|the right to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures]], a person must have [[legal standing|standing]] to move to suppress evidence. In other words, one cannot object to evidence obtained by an illegal search if it was someone else's privacy that was violated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jec.unm.edu/resources/benchbooks/magistrate/2-5-3.htm here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925063522/http://jec.unm.edu/resources/benchbooks/magistrate/2-5-3.htm |date=2010-09-25 }} B. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;RAKAS V. ILLINOIS, 439 U. S. 128 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

On a federal level, a motion to suppress is set down in Rule 41(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;As stated in Jones v. United States: "A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property and to suppress for use as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that (1) the property was illegally seized without warrant, or (2) the warrant is insufficient on its face, or (3) property seized is not that described in the warrant, or (4) there was not probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued, or (5) the warrant was illegally executed. The judge shall receive evidence on any issue of fact necessary to the decision of the motion. If the motion is granted, the property shall be restored unless otherwise subject to lawful detention, and it shall not be admissible in evidence at any hearing or trial. The motion to suppress evidence may also be made in the district where the trial is to be had. The motion shall be made before trial or hearing unless opportunity therefore did not exist or the defendant was not aware of the grounds for the motion, but the court in its discretion may entertain the motion at the trial or hearing."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
If the discovery of an item(s) was obtained by illegal means, it may still be allowed into evidence under some circumstances.  These exceptions include:

* Inevitable discovery - if discovery of the evidence was inevitable via purely legal means
* Independent source - if the discovery involved a combination of legal and illegal means, but the illegality was of marginal significance, such that the evidence could have been discovered based on the legal source alone
* [[Standing (law)|Standing]] - the violation affects the rights of someone other than the defendant, and the defendant does not have standing to complain
* Good faith - the illegality is not the fault of the law enforcement officers who obtained the evidence, who did so pursuant to a facially valid warrant granted by a neutral and detached magistrate.
* Attenuation - If the relationship between the illegality and the nature of the evidence obtained is reduced sufficiently for the evidence to be considered untainted (e.g., use of a booking photo from an unlawful arrest to identify the defendant in a lineup)

Evidence obtained as a result of [[Miranda v. Arizona|Miranda]] violations is also subject to special analysis, depending on whether the statement is deemed voluntary or coerced, not merely whether police provided the appropriate warnings.

'''''Tedla v. Ellman''''' (280 N.Y. 124, 19 N.E. 2d 987) was a 1939 [[New York Court of Appeals]] case that was influential in establishing the bounds of the [[negligence per se|negligence ''per se'']] doctrine.  Ordinarily, a statutory violation constitutes [[negligence]].  However, the court, in an opinion written by [[Irving Lehman]], instead held that because this violation occurred in a situation not anticipated by the drafters of the statute and was in keeping with the spirit of the statute, it did not constitute negligence.

==Facts==
Anna Tedla and her brother, John Bachek (plaintiffs), were struck by a passing automobile, operated by the defendant, Ellman. Tedla was injured and Bachek was killed. Bachek was a deaf-mute. The plaintiff had engaged in collecting and selling junk. They picked up junk at the incinerator of the village of Islip, New York. At the time of the accident, plaintiffs were walking along and wheeling baby carriages containing junk and wood.  It was about six o'clock on a Sunday evening in December. Bachek was carrying a lighted lantern. The jury found that the accident was due solely to the negligence of the operator of the automobile. The place of the accident consisted of two roadways, separated by a grass plot. There were no footpaths along the highway and the center grass plot was soft. It is not unlawful for a pedestrian, wheeling a baby carriage, to use the roadway under such circumstances. The Vehicle and Traffic Law (Cons. Laws, ch. 71) provided that "Pedestrians walking or remaining on the paved portion, or traveled part of a roadway shall be subject to, and comply with, the rules governing vehicles, with respect to meeting and turning out, except that such pedestrians shall keep to the left of the center line thereof, and turn to their left instead of right side thereof, so as to permit all vehicles passing them in either direction to pass on their right. Such pedestrians shall not be subject to the rules governing vehicles as to giving signals." The plaintiffs did not and were not observing the statutory rule. At the time of the accident, they were proceeding in easterly direction on the east-bound or right-hand roadway.

==Procedural history==
The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground, among others, that violation of the statutory rule constitutes [[contributory negligence]] as a matter of law. The trial judge left to the jury the question whether failure to observe the statutory rule was a [[proximate cause]] of the accident. The trial judge found for P, which the appellate division affirmed. On this appeal, D argues the pedestrians were contributorily negligent as a matter of law for violating the statute.

Ellman appealed an order from the Appellate Division affirming a judgment entered upon a verdict in favor of Tedla in their action for negligence.

==Issue and holding==
The court delivered the following decision.

{{quote|Must a statute that the Legislature intended to preserve the life and limb of pedestrians be observed when observance would subject them to more imminent danger? No. A statute that the Legislature intended to preserve the life and limb of pedestrians may not be observed when observance would subject them to more imminent danger. Custom and common sense have always dictated that vehicles should have the right of way over pedestrians and that pedestrians should walk along the edge of a highway so that they might step aside for passing vehicles with least danger to themselves and least obstruction to vehicular traffic. The Legislature in the first five subdivisions of section 85 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law has provided regulations to govern the conduct of pedestrians and of drivers of vehicles when a pedestrian is crossing a road. Until, by chapter 114 of the Laws of 1933, it adopted subdivision 6 of section 85, there was no special statutory rule for pedestrians walking along a highway. Then for the first time it reversed, for pedestrians, the rule established for vehicles by immemorial custom, and provided that pedestrians shall keep to the left of the center line of a highway. Here, the evidence showed that there were very few cars going east at the time of the accident, but that going west there was very heavy Sunday night traffic.  Ordinary prudence would have dictated that pedestrians should not expose themselves to the danger of walking along the roadway upon which the very heavy Sunday night traffic was proceeding when they could walk in comparative safety along a roadway used by very few cars. D claims by force of the statutory rule, pedestrians are guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law when they use the safer roadway, unless that roadway is left of the center of the road. If that be true, then the Legislature has decreed that pedestrians must observe the general rule of conduct which it has prescribed for their safety even under circumstances where observance would subject them to unusual risk; that pedestrians are to be charged with negligence as matter of law for acting as prudence dictates. It is unreasonable to ascribe to the Legislature an intention.

Under the [[Restatement of the Law of Torts]], a plaintiff who has violated a legislative enactment designed to prevent a certain type of dangerous situation is barred from recovery for a harm caused by a violation of the statute if, but only if, the harm was sustained by reason of a situation of that type. That being so an "established rule" should not be weakened either by subtle distinctions or by extension beyond its letter or spirit into a field where "by the very terms of the hypothesis" it can have no proper application. Obedience to a fiat cannot add to the danger. Negligence is failure to exercise the care required by law. Where a statute defines the standard of care and the safeguards required to meet a recognized danger, then, as we have said, no other measure may be applied in determining whether a person has carried out the duty of care imposed by law. Failure to observe the standard imposed by statute is negligence, as matter of law. On the other hand, where a statutory general rule of conduct fixes no definite standard of care which would under all circumstances tend to protect life, limb or property but merely codifies or supplements a common-law rule, which has always been subject to limitations and exceptions; or where the statutory rule of conduct regulates conflicting rights and obligations in manner calculated to promote public convenience and safety, then the statute, in the absence of clear language to the contrary, should not be construed as intended to wipe out the limitations and exceptions which judicial decisions have attached to the common-law duty; nor should it be construed as an inflexible command that the general rule of conduct intended to prevent accidents must be followed even under conditions when observance might cause accidents.

These rules are, however, not inflexible, and a strict observance should be avoided when there is a plain risk in adhering to them, and one who too rigidly adheres to such rules when the injury might have been averted by variance therefrom, may be charged with fault. Statutes are intended to apply only to ordinary situations and to be subject to the qualification that the conduct prohibited thereby is not wrongful if, because of an emergency or the like, the circumstances justify an apparent disobedience to the letter of the enactment. If Ps had observed the statutory rule of the road they would have proceeded easterly along the roadway on the left of the center grass plot, and then, it must be conceded, they would not have been struck by the automobile in which D was riding, proceeding in the same direction along the roadway on the right. Here the jury might find that Ps avoided a greater, indeed an almost suicidal, risk by proceeding along the east bound roadway, that D was entirely heedless of the possibility of the presence of pedestrians on the highway; and that a pedestrian could not have avoided the accident even if he had faced oncoming traffic.

Affirmed, with costs.}}

==Analysis==
This is part of the violation of statute argument used under negligence ''per se''. However, violation of statute will not be negligence ''per se'' if there is an excuse for that violation; such as the one given in this case. So the statute will create a general duty of care but that does not alleviate the common law duties of care nor the duty to act as a reasonable person under the same or similar circumstances. One such excuse for deviation is a greater and unreasonable danger being faced while adhering to the statute. We agree with the court that only a fool would walk on the side where the traffic is extremely heavy as opposed to walking on the side where the traffic is light. So part of the prima facie case related to statutes must include a determination whether the violation of the statute was excused.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21187">The National Construction Safety Team Act (NCST Act), signed into law on October 1, 2002 by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]], mandated the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) to establish the likely technical cause or causes of the three building failures that occurred on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] at the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|World Trade Center]] as a result of a terrorist attack.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/el/disasterstudies/NationalConstructionSafetyTeamActFactsheet111212.pdf|title=NIST's Responsibility Under the National Construction Safety Team Act|last=|first=|date=November 2012|website=|publisher=www.nist.gov|format=PDF|access-date=|ref=ncst-factsheet}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIST issued its final report on the collapse of the World Trade Center Twin Towers in September 2005. It issued its final report on [[7 World Trade Center]] in November 2008.

NIST concluded that the collapse of each tower resulted from the combined effects of [[airplane]] impact damage, widespread [[fireproofing]] dislodgment, and the fires that ensued. The sequence of failures that NIST concluded initiated the collapse of both towers involved the heat-induced sagging of floor trusses pulling some of the exterior columns on one side of each tower inward until they buckled, after which instability rapidly spread and the upper sections then fell onto the floors below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banovic|first=S.W.|last2=Foecke|first2=T.|last3=Luecke|first3=W.E.|last4=McColskey|first4=J.D.|last5=McCowan|first5=C.N.|last6=Siewert|first6=T.A.|last7=Gayle|first7=F.W.|date=2007-11-01|title=The role of metallurgy in the NIST investigation of the World Trade Center towers collapse|journal=JOM|language=English|volume=59|issue=11|pages=22–30|doi=10.1007/s11837-007-0136-y|issn=1047-4838|bibcode=2007JOM....59k..22B}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Trade Center Building 7 (7WTC), which was never directly hit by an airplane, collapsed as a result of thermal expansion of steel beams and girders that were heated by uncontrolled fires caused by the collapse of the North Tower and failure of the fire-resistive material.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Context==
===Collapse of the World Trade Center===
{{Main|Collapse of the World Trade Center}}During the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]], two [[jet airliner]]s struck the Twin Towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] (WTC), one to each tower.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/index.htm|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|website=www.9-11commission.gov|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the two 110 stories-tall [[skyscraper]]s collapsed, causing complete destruction to the entire WTC complex and killing 2,997 people. The [[2 World Trade Center|South Tower]] collapsed at 9:59&amp;nbsp;a.m. (EDT) after burning for approximately 56 minutes. 29 minutes later, the [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]] collapsed having burned for 102 minutes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When the North Tower collapsed, debris fell on the nearby [[7 World Trade Center]], damaging it and starting fires that burned for almost seven hours, compromising the building's structural integrity. Seven World Trade Center collapsed at 5:21&amp;nbsp;p.m. (EDT).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/engineering-laboratory/faqs-nist-wtc-7-investigation|title=FAQs - NIST WTC 7 Investigation|last=Thompson|first=Kristy|date=2011-09-13|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of the World Trade Center buildings on September 11, 2001 was as shocking as it was tragic. The complete destruction of such massive buildings was unthinkable; never before had a [[Steel frame|steel-framed]] multi-story building suffered a complete collapse as a result of [[fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jensenhughes.com/white-papers/historical-survey-multi-story-building-collapses-due-to-fire/|title=Historical Survey of Multi-Story Building Collapses Due to Fire - JENSEN HUGHES|language=English|access-date=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate aftermath, knowledgeable structural engineers began providing a range of explanations in an attempt to help the public understand these tragic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eagar|first=Thomas W.|last2=Musso|first2=Christopher|title=Why did the world trade center collapse? Science, engineering, and speculation|journal=JOM|language=en|volume=53|issue=12|pages=8–11|doi=10.1007/s11837-001-0003-1|issn=1047-4838|year=2001|bibcode=2001JOM....53l...8E}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a coordinated effort would need to be organized to investigate and analyze the complex series of events that led to each collapse.

===FEMA World Trade Center Building Performance Study===
In the aftermath of the World Trade Center complex, researchers responded immediately by traveling to [[ground zero]] where they began collecting data. Among the first was [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] and [[American Society of Civil Engineers|American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)]], who together formed a Building Performance Study Team to understand how the building structures failed and why. The team produced the first official government report attempting to explain the destruction of the World Trade Center complex.&lt;ref name="commdocs.house.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://commdocs.house.gov/committees/science/hsy77747.000/hsy77747_0f.htm|title=Learning From 9/11--Understanding the Collapse of the World Trade Center|website=commdocs.house.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were able to make many observations and finding, including preliminary analysis of the damaged structures, analysis of the buildings' fire suppression systems, and recommendations to building codes and fire standards for including airplane impact into building design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/3544|title=FEMA 403, World Trade Center Building Performance Study (2002) {{!}} FEMA.gov|website=www.fema.gov|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEMA's final report, issued in May 2002, also provides a substantial amount of data about the event not documented elsewhere. Their findings suggested that fires, in conjunction with damage to the structural members and fire suppression systems inflicted by the jet airliners, played a key role in the collapse of the buildings.

However, the team's investigation was hampered by a number of issues. The lack of authority of investigators to impound pieces of steel for examination before they were recycled led to the loss of important pieces of evidence that were destroyed early during the search and rescue effort, and much of the steel had already been recycle in the one month that had lapsed between the attack and the deployment of the team. The team was further impeded by ongoing criminal investigations by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and [[National Transportation Safety Board|NTSB]]. In a hearing to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives']] Committee on Science on March 6, 2002, a panel of witnesses and experts described the obstacles as:&lt;ref name="commdocs.house.gov"/&gt;
* No clear authority and the absence of an effective protocol for how the building performance investigators should conduct and coordinate their investigation with the concurrent search and rescue efforts, as well as any criminal investigation
* Difficulty obtaining documents essential to the investigation, including blueprints, design drawings, and maintenance records

===National Construction Safety Team act===
{{Main|National Construction Safety Team Act}}

As a result of the inconclusive FEMA Building Performance Study team's findings and concerns over missteps in its investigation, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] drafted legislation that would give wide powers, including the right to issue subpoenas, to teams investigating building failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/01/nyregion/report-on-towers-collapse-ends-mostly-in-questions.html|title=Report on Towers' Collapse Ends Mostly in Questions|last=Glanz|first=James|date=2002-05-01|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also mandates that the teams would be centered at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) whose building and fire research laboratory in Maryland has conducted extensive investigations of building failures in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/laboratories/tools-instruments/national-fire-research-laboratory|title=The National Fire Research Laboratory|last=Thompson|first=Kristy|date=2011-04-27|newspaper=NIST|access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, cited as the National Construction Safety Team (NCST) act, passed the house and the senate and was signed into law on Oct. 1, 2002 by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ231/pdf/PLAW-107publ231.pdf|title=Public Law 107-231|last=|first=|date=October 1, 2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCST act gives NIST a clear mandate to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/el/disasterstudies/NationalConstructionSafetyTeamActFactsheet111212.pdf|title=NIST's Responsibilities Under the National Construction Safety Team Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
NIST began its investigation on 21 August 2002. Prior to this date, volunteers from NIST, FEMA, ASCE and others collected steel members important to the investigation from the four steel recycling facilities during the recovery effort. They collected and cataloged 236 steel artifacts, including exterior columns, core columns, floor trusses and other similar structural members.&lt;ref name="Banovic 22–30"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banovic|first=S.

NIST's Building and Fire Research Laboratory created a complex [[Computer simulation|computer model]] to understand the collapse of the towers.&lt;ref name="phys.org"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2008-11-nist-wtc.html|title=NIST releases final WTC 7 investigation report|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, they wanted to know if the collapse of a core column could cause the progressive collapse of the whole building. They also modeled the dispersion of the jet fuel and damage to the interior of the building that was not visible from photographic evidence and eyewitnesses. The model was used to understand the [[hypothesis]] of the collapse.

==Findings==

===The Twin Towers===
The investigation team integrated their [[metallurgy]] analysis, [[experiment]]al results and [[computer simulation]] with video and photographs of the destruction and eyewitness accounts to form their understanding for how the buildings collapsed. They came to two conclusions:&lt;ref name="Banovic 22–30"/&gt;
# A conventional fire should not have caused the collapse of the 110-story skyscrapers in the absence of structural and fire-proofing insulation damage. 
# The towers would likely not have collapsed if not for the impact and damage that the aircraft caused to the fire-proofing insulation.  
The most probable collapse sequence was similar between the [[2 World Trade Center|South Tower]] and [[One World Trade Center|North Tower]], but they were not identical. However, they both involved all major structural systems of the building design: the core columns, the exterior columns and the building floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0112/eagar/eagar-0112.html|title=Why Did the World Trade Center Collapse? Science, Engineering, and Speculation|website=www.tms.org|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# First, the floors that lost fire-proofing insulation due to debris impact began to sag as a result of the high temperature of the fire.
# The sagging floors pulled inward on the girders and caused the exterior walls to deform. 
# The exterior walls began to buckle under the combined forces of the sagging floors, the fire, and the severed core columns from aircraft impact damage.
# Finally, the exterior walls caved in and the buildings collapsed. The stories below provided little resistance to relatively tremendous energy of the falling building, allowing them to fall very quickly.   
The NIST investigation's conclusions do not support the "pancake theory" of collapse, in which there is a progressive failure of the floor system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/pba/national-institute-standards-and-technology-nist-federal-building-and-fire-safety-investigation|title=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster Answers to Frequently Asked Questions (August 30, 2006)|last=Ford|first=Susan Marie|date=2010-05-27|work=NIST|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===7 World Trade Center===
NIST released the final report of their investigation into the collapse of the 47-story World Trade Center 7 building on 20 August 2008.&lt;ref name="phys.org"/&gt;

Their conclusion is that WTC7 collapsed primarily as a result of the fire that was started when the WTC1 collapsed. The collapse of the North Tower also damaged the south exterior wall of WTC7 but it was not a contributing factor. Because [[New York City Fire Department|FDNY]] could not attempt to extinguish the fires that were burning on six floors of the building, the fire-proofing insulation began to fail. After several hours of uncontrolled fire, the steel columns, girders and trusses absorbed heat and rapidly lost their strength. As they began to sag, deform and buckle, the interior structure below the east [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse]] was brought down. The failed core columns' load was distributed to the remaining columns which all failed. This led to the progressive collapse of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nist.gov/pba/national-institute-standards-and-technology-nist-federal-building-and-fire-safety-investigation|title=National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation of the World Trade Center Disaster Answers to Frequently Asked Questions (August 30, 2006)|last=Ford|first=Susan Marie|date=2010-05-27|work=NIST|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reforms and Lessons Learned==

The National Construction Safety Team Act of 2002, which mandated NIST to perform its investigation, specifically states that NIST, which is not a regulatory agency, is not authorized to require the adoption of building codes, standards or practices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, NIST's final reports on the collapse of the WTC buildings provides the technical basis for new and improved standards, codes and practices on designing buildings to resist progressive collapse. Many NIST researchers are also key members of professional, standards-developing organizations, and NIST actively works with these organizations to ensure that lessons learned from investigations are put to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.nibs.org/resource/resmgr/Docs/DesigingforResilientAmerica.pdf|title=Designing for a Resilient America: A Stakeholder Summit on High Performance Resilient Buildings and Related Infrastructure|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fire Protection of Structural Members ===
The [[National Fire Protection Association]] has adopted many of NIST's recommended improvements to the building code. NIST's recommendation for improving a building's structural frame and support system under severe loading conditions, such as during a fire event, resulted in the adoption of a new approach to high-rise building design. Much more scrutiny is to be given to the primary and secondary structural members as well as the connections that tie them together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/news-and-research/publications/nfpa-journal/2011/september-october-2011/features/a-decade-of-difference|title=A Decade of Difference|website=www.nfpa.org|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steel columns of the WTC buildings significantly lost strength when they were subjected to the heat of the fire. Concrete heated to the same temperature, however, loses no strength at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/how-building-design-changed-after-9-11-64580|title=How building design changed after 9/11|last=Chao|first=Shih-Ho|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, new high-rise buildings, including [[One World Trade Center|One World Trade Center]], are being constructed with reinforced, high-strength concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://rew-online.com/2011/06/01/1-wtc-rising-on-super-concrete/|title=One World Trade Center rising on "super concrete" {{!}} Real Estate Weekly|date=2011-06-01|work=Real Estate Weekly|access-date=2017-12-01|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergency Communication Systems ===
Due to the fact that [[New York City]]'s [[Office of Emergency Management]] was located in [[7 World Trade Center|World Trade Center 7]] on the day of the attacks and vital communications equipment was located in the North Tower, their response was significantly impeded. They have since moved their offices to [[Brooklyn]], and disaster and emergency management teams around the country are also moving away from possible targets of [[Terrorism|terrorist attacks]], [[natural disaster]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s and other emergency scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/disaster-communications-lessons-from-9-11-65142|title=Disaster communications: Lessons from 9/11|last=Kman|first=Nicholas|work=The Conversation|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and Speculation ==
{{Main|9/11 conspiracy theories}}Critics of the final report claim that there is a disconnect between the NIST WTC report and logical reasoning. They argue that NIST had reached a predetermined conclusion by ignoring, dismissing, and denying the evidence. These concerns are frequently cited by [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11 conspiracy theorists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.europhysicsnews.org/articles/epn/abs/2016/05/contents/contents.html|title=Europhysics News|website=www.europhysicsnews.org|language=English|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|size=100%|KG|PCe}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɒ|m|w|əl|,_|-|w|ɛ|l}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cromwell|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cromwell|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{circa}} 1485 – 28 July 1540) was an English lawyer and statesman who served as chief minister to King [[Henry VIII of England]] from 1532 to 1540, when he was decapitated on orders of the king.

Cromwell was one of the strongest and most powerful advocates of the [[English Reformation]]. He helped to engineer an annulment of the king's marriage to Queen [[Catherine of Aragon|Catherine]] so that Henry could lawfully marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Henry failed to obtain [[Pope Clement VII|the Pope]]'s approval for the [[annulment]] in 1534, so Parliament endorsed the king's claim to be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], giving him the authority to annul his own marriage. Cromwell subsequently charted an evangelical and reformist course for the [[Church of England]] from the unique posts of [[vicegerent]] in spirituals and [[vicar-general]].&lt;ref name="Logan (1988)"&gt;Logan argues that these titles refer to a single position. {{cite journal|author1=F. Donald Logan|title=Thomas Cromwell and the Vicegerency in Spirituals: A Revisitation|journal=The English Historical Review|date=July 1988|volume=103|issue=408|pages=658–67|jstor=572696|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|658, fn. 2}}

During his rise to power, Cromwell made many enemies, including his former ally Anne Boleyn. He played a prominent role in her downfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter C. Herman|title=A Short History of Early Modern England: British Literature in Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XimmPRO1sQUC&amp;pg=PA82|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later fell from power, after arranging the king's marriage to German princess [[Anne of Cleves]]. Cromwell had hoped that the marriage would breathe fresh life into the Reformation in England, but Henry found his new bride unattractive and it turned into a disaster for Cromwell, ending in an annulment six months later. Cromwell was [[arraignment|arraigned]] under a [[bill of attainder]] and executed for [[treason]] and [[heresy]] on [[Tower Hill]] on 28 July 1540. The king later expressed regret at the loss of his chief minister.{{sfn|Hutchinson|2008|p=269}}

==Early life==
Thomas Cromwell was born around 1485, in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]], the son of Walter Cromwell, a blacksmith, [[fulling|fuller]] and cloth merchant, and owner of both a [[inn|hostelry]] and a [[brewery]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Walter Cromwell is considered by some to be of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.&lt;ref name="MacCulloch2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diarmaid MacCulloch|title=Thomas Cromwell: A Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qLBwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP36|date=27 September 2018|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-196766-0|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas's mother, Katherine, was the aunt of Nicholas Glossop of [[Wirksworth]] in Derbyshire. She lived in Putney in the house of a local attorney, John Welbeck, at the time of her marriage to Walter Cromwell in 1474.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

Cromwell had two sisters: the elder, Katherine, married [[Morgan ap William|Morgan Williams]], a Welsh lawyer; the younger, Elizabeth, married a farmer, William Wellyfed.  Katherine and Morgan's son, [[Richard Williams (alias Cromwell)|Richard]], was employed in his uncle's service, and changed his name to Cromwell.

Little is known about Cromwell's early life. It is believed that he was born at the top of Putney Hill, on the edge of [[Putney Heath]].  In 1878, his birthplace was still of note:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The site of Cromwell's birthplace is still pointed out by tradition and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor, quoted above, for it describes on that spot 'an ancient cottage called the smith's shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor'. The plot of ground here referred to is now covered by the Green Man public house.{{sfn|Walford|1878|pp=489–503}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cromwell declared to [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] that he had been a "ruffian… in his young days".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}  As a youth, he left his family in Putney, and crossed the Channel to the continent.  Accounts of his activities in France, Italy and the [[Low Countries]] are sketchy and contradictory.  It is alleged&lt;ref name="historyextra.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/tudors/thomas-cromwell-life-before-Henry-VIII-Tudor-court|title=Thomas Cromwell’s life before Henry VIII|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{by whom|date=April 2016}} that he first became a [[mercenary]], and marched with the French army to Italy, where he fought in the [[Battle of Garigliano (1503)|battle of Garigliano]] on 28 December 1503.  While in Italy, he entered service in the household of the Florentine banker [[Frescobaldi Family|Francesco Frescobaldi]].&lt;ref name="historyextra.com"/&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Later, he visited leading mercantile centres in the Low Countries, living among the English merchants and developing a network of contacts while learning several languages.  At some point he returned to Italy.  The records of the English Hospital in Rome indicate that he stayed there in June 1514,{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} while documents in the [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican Archives]] suggest that he was an agent for the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Christopher Bainbridge]], and handled English ecclesiastical issues before the [[Roman Rota]].{{sfn|Kinney|2001|p=172}}

==Marriage and issue==
At some time during these years, Cromwell returned to England, where around 1515 he married [[Elizabeth Wyckes]] (d. 1529).{{sfn|Fitzgerald and MacCulloch|2016}} She was the widow of Thomas Williams, a [[Yeomen of the Guard|Yeoman of the Guard]], and the daughter of a Putney shearman, Henry Wykes, who had served as a [[gentleman usher]] to [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}
The couple had three children:{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=16, 23, 33}}
* [[Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell]] (c. 1520–51), who was [[Elizabeth Seymour, Baroness Cromwell|Elizabeth Seymour]]'s second husband.
* Anne Cromwell (died c. 1529)
* Grace Cromwell (died c. 1529)

Cromwell's wife died early in 1529{{sfn|Fitzgerald and MacCulloch|2016}} and his daughters, Anne and Grace, are believed to have died not long after their mother. Provisions made for Anne and Grace in Cromwell's will, dated 12 July 1529, were crossed out at some later date.{{sfn|Schofield|2011|p=33}}{{sfn|Merriman I|1902|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/lifelettersoftho01merruoft#page/58/mode/2up 59, 60]}} Gregory outlived his father by only 11 years, succumbing to [[sweating sickness]] in 1551.{{sfn|Cokayne III|1913|pp=557–559}}{{sfn|Strype II(I)|1822|pp=[https://archive.org/stream/ecclesiasticalme0201stry#page/492/mode/2up 493–494]}}{{sfn|Hawkyard|1982}}{{sfn|Hoby|1902|p=73}}{{sfn|Winchester|1955|p=270}}

Thomas Cromwell also had an illegitimate daughter, Jane (c. 1535 – 1580),{{sfn|Beazley|1908|p=82|ps=: Jane Hough was buried 3 November 1580 at [[Neston]].}} whose early life is a complete mystery.

==Lawyer, Member of Parliament, adviser to Wolsey==
In 1517, and again in 1518, Cromwell led an embassy to Rome to obtain from [[Pope Leo X]] a [[papal bull]] for the reinstatement of [[Indulgences]] for the town of [[Boston, Lincolnshire]].{{sfn|Elton|1991a|p=2}}
[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cardinal Wolsey]]
By 1520, Cromwell was firmly established in London mercantile and legal circles.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} In 1523, he obtained a seat in the House of Commons as a Burgess, though the constituency he represented has not been identified.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} After Parliament had been dissolved, Cromwell wrote a letter to a friend, jesting about the session's lack of productivity:&lt;blockquote&gt;I amongst other have indured a parlyament which contenwid by the space of xvii hole wekes wher we communyd of warre pease Stryffe contencyon debatte murmure grudge Riches poverte penurye trowth falshode Justyce equyte dicayte [deceit] opprescyon Magnanymyte actyvyte foce [force] attempraunce [moderation] Treason murder Felonye consyli...

In 1524, he was elected a member of [[Gray's Inn]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

From around 1516 to 1530, Cromwell was a member of the household of [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Thomas Wolsey|Thomas Cardinal Wolsey]]. He was one of Wolsey's council by 1519, and his secretary by 1529.{{sfn|Bindoff|1982}} In the mid-1520s, Cromwell assisted in the dissolution of nearly thirty monasteries to raise funds for Wolsey to found [[Ipswich School|The King's School, Ipswich]] (1528), and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Cardinal College]], in Oxford (1529).{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} In 1526, Wolsey appointed Cromwell a member of his council; by 1529, Cromwell was one of Wolsey's most senior and trusted advisers. By the end of October of that year, however, Wolsey had fallen from power.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Cromwell had made enemies by aiding Wolsey to suppress the monasteries, but was determined not to fall with his master, as he told [[George Cavendish (writer)|George Cavendish]], then a Gentleman Usher and later Wolsey's biographer:&lt;blockquote&gt;I do entend (god wyllyng) this after none, whan my lord hathe dyned to ride to london and so to the Court, where I wyll other make or marre, or ere [before] I come agayn, I wyll put my self in the prese [press] to se what any man is Able to lay to my charge of ontrouthe or mysdemeanor.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Royal favourite==
Cromwell successfully overcame the shadow cast over his career by Wolsey's downfall. By November 1529, he had secured a seat in Parliament as a member for [[Taunton]]{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} and was reported to be in favour with the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} At some point during the closing weeks of 1530, the King appointed him to the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}
Cromwell held numerous offices during his career in the King's service, including:

===Anne Boleyn===
From 1527, Henry VIII had sought to have his marriage to Queen [[Catherine of Aragon]] annulled, so that he could lawfully marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king's legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], and had joined the inner circle of the Council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

The third session of what is now known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of government indecision as to the best way to proceed. Cromwell now favoured the assertion of royal supremacy, and manipulated the Commons by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier in the session of 1529. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the king, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as "the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender" of the Church. The clergy resisted the Act of 1529 where they were prevented from appealing to Church-established courts, or [[Ecclesiastical court]] to settle disputes. Instead they were forced to go through the public courts as lay people.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The clergy capitulated when faced with the threat of parliamentary reprisal. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was [[prorogued]]. Two days later, [[Sir Thomas More]] resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More's resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

The king's gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the lordship of Romney{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in Newport, Wales, and appointment to three relatively minor offices: [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the Jewels]] on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the [[Hanaper]] on 16 July, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 12 April 1533. None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}
[[File:Anneboleyn2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Anne Boleyn]]]]

On 26 January 1533, Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor, and &lt;!--on the same day?--&gt;Cromwell increased his control over the Commons through his management of by-elections. Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that historians believe took place in Calais. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid.

The parliamentary session began on 4 February, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome. On 30 March, Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] immediately declared the king's marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell's bill into law, as the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], ensuring that any verdict concerning the king's marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King a pro forma challenge to the validity of his marriage to Catherine. A formal trial began on 10 May 1533 in Dunstable and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced sentence, declaring the marriage illegal. Five days later he pronounced the King's marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

In December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy and the Pope was attacked throughout the nation in sermons and pamphlets. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell's supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England's remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer's sentence took statutory form as the Act of Succession, the Dispensations Act reiterated royal supremacy and the Act for the Submission of the Clergy incorporated into law the clergy's surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

==King's chief minister==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2014}}
In April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name. Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession, and all the King's subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King's new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later.

On 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy also clarified the King's position as head of the church and the Act for Payment of First Fruits and Tenths substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church. On 21 January 1535, the King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and commissioned him to organise visitations of all the country's churches, monasteries, and clergy. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to tax church property more effectively.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

===Fall of Anne Boleyn===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Jane Seymour]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]
The final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, an Act for the Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than £200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell's strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King's coffers.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ives "the Life and Death of Anne Boleyn"&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her [[almoner]], [[John Skip]], denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skip's diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skip was called before the Council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking 'the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth' and inviting anarchy.{{sfn|Ives|2005|pp=307–310}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=176–179}}

Anne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was growing impatient, having become enamoured of the young [[Jane Seymour]] and encouraged by Anne's enemies, particularly Nicholas Carew and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with [[Mark Smeaton]], a musician of the royal household, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norris]], the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir [[Francis Weston]], [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]] and her brother, [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|Viscount Rochford]].{{sfn|Lipscomb|April 2013|pp=18–24}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=192–205}} The Imperial Ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that: &lt;blockquote&gt;he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble...

The Queen and her brother stood trial on Monday 15 May, while the four others accused with them were condemned on the Friday beforehand. The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the second Act of Succession, securing the rights of Queen Jane's heirs to the throne.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===
[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Thomas Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, KG.png|thumb|220px|Arms of Sir Thomas Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, KG, as they were at the time of his installation as a Knight Companion of the Most Noble [[Order of the Garter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blomefield|1808|pp=486–495}} On becoming Earl of Essex, Thomas Cromwell adopted new arms; quarterly, per fess, indented, azure and or four lions passant counterchanged&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Cromwell's position was now stronger than ever. He succeeded Anne Boleyn's father, [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]], as [[Lord Privy Seal]] on 2 July 1536, resigning the office of [[Master of the Rolls]], which he had held since 8 October 1534. On 8 July 1536, he was raised to the peerage as [[Baron Cromwell]] of Wimbledon.{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=11, 202(3) and 202(14)}}

===Religious reform===
Cromwell orchestrated the dissolution of the monasteries and visitations to the universities and colleges in 1535, which had strong links to the church. This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed 'popish' and 'superstitious'. This has been described as 'easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history'. [[Oxford University]] was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley's donation in 1602.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SochIc9cRGQC&amp;pg=PT58|title=Mediaeval Education and the Reformation|author=John Lawson|publisher=Books.google.co.uk|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop [[Edward Foxe]] tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the [[Ten Articles]] and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in [[Lincolnshire]] and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular and clerical uprisings found support among the gentry and even the nobility; they were collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The rebels' grievances were wide-ranging, but the most significant was the suppression of the monasteries, blamed on the King's "evil counsellors", principally Cromwell and Cranmer. One of the leaders of the rebellion was [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy]], who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning (just prior to his execution) "others that have been in such favour with kings as you now enjoy have come to the same fate you bring me to".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}
[[File:Thomas Cromwell, portrait miniature wearing garter collar, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumbnail|right|Thomas Cromwell, portrait miniature wearing garter collar, after Hans Holbein the Younger]]
The suppression of the risings spurred further Reformation measures. In February 1537, Cromwell convened a [[vicegerent]]ial [[synod]] of bishops and doctors. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'', more commonly known as the [[Bishops' Book]]. By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell's success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a [[Privy Council]], a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

In January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what was termed "idolatry" by the followers of the old religion. Statues, [[rood screen]]s, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on "pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions" and commanding that "one book of the whole Bible in English" be set up in every church. Moreover, following the "voluntary" surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also "invited" to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

====Resistance to further religious reform====
The King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], [[Sir Edward Neville]], and Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] on charges of treason in November 1538, using evidence acquired from [[Sir Geoffrey Pole]] under interrogation in the Tower. All were executed in the following months.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of [[Miles Coverdale]]'s [[Great Bible]]. Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell's principal achievements, the first authoritative version in English.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

The King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

===Anne of Cleves===
[[Image:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|150px|''[[Anne of Cleves]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1539]]

Queen Jane had died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future [[Edward VI]]. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell's suggestion that he should marry [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of [[William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Duke Wilhelm]] of [[United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|Cleves]], partly on the basis of a portrait which [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year's Day 1540, the King met her at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and was immediately repelled by her physically: "I like her not!" The wedding ceremony took place on 6 January at Greenwich, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=377–78, 386–88, 395, 405, 410–11}}

===Earl of Essex===
On 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the [[Earl of Essex|earldom of Essex]] and the senior Court office of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell's tenure as the King's chief minister was almost over. The King's anger at being forced to marry Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell's conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, needed to topple him.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=412, 418}}

===Downfall and execution===
During 1536 Cromwell had proven himself an adept political survivor. However, the gradual slide towards Protestantism at home and the King's ill-starred marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was partly responsible for Cromwell's downfall because he had provided a very flattering portrait of Anne which may have deceived the king.

The Franco-Imperial alliance had failed to materialise, and Henry had therefore been subjected to an unnecessary conjugal difficulty which loosened his Principal Secretary's control of events. In early 1540, Cromwell's conservative, aristocratic enemies, headed by the Duke of Norfolk and assisted by [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Gardiner]] (colloquially known as 'Wily Winchester'), saw in [[Catherine Howard]] an opportunity to displace their foe.

Cromwell was arrested at a Council meeting on 10 June 1540, accused of a list of charges. He was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. His enemies took every opportunity to humiliate him: they even tore off his [[Order of the Garter]], remarking that "A traitor must not wear it." His initial reaction was defiance: "This then is my reward for faithful service!" he cried out,  and angrily defied his fellow Councillors to call him a traitor.  A [[Bill of Attainder]] containing a long list of indictments, including supporting [[Anabaptists]], corrupt practices, leniency in matters of justice, acting for personal gain, protecting Protestants accused of heresy and thus failing to enforce the [[Act of Six Articles]], and plotting to marry [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary Tudor]], was introduced into the [[House of Lords]] a week later and passed on 29 June 1540.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=yoevCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA141&amp;dq=thomas+cromwell+++10+June+1540+bill+of+attainder&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjkpJ_69KLVAhUM5YMKHYaWDLAQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas+cromwell+++10+June+1540+bill+of+attainder&amp;f=false|title=Thomas Cromwell: Tudor Minister|first=B.

Hall said of Cromwell's downfall,

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many lamented but more rejoiced, and specially such as either had been religious men, or favoured religious persons; for they banqueted and triumphed together that night, many wishing that that day had been seven years before; and some fearing lest he should escape, although he were imprisoned, could not be merry. Others who knew nothing but truth by him both lamented him and heartily prayed for him. But this is true that of certain of the clergy he was detestably hated, &amp; specially of such as had borne swynge [beaten hard], and by his means was put from it; for in deed he was a man that in all his doings seemed not to favour any kind of Popery, nor could not abide the snoffyng pride of some prelates, which undoubtedly, whatsoever else was the cause of his death, did shorten his life and procured the end that he was brought unto.{{sfn|Hall|1809|pp=838–839}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Henry came to regret Cromwell's killing and later accused his ministers of bringing about Cromwell's downfall by "pretexts" and "false accusations".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; On 3 March 1541, the French Ambassador, [[Charles de Marillac]], reported in a letter that the King was now said to be lamenting that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;under pretext of some slight offences which he had committed, they had brought several accusations against him, on the strength of which he had put to death the most faithful servant he ever had.{{sfn|Letters and Papers, Foreign and Domestic, Henry VIII|loc=16, 590}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There remains an element of what [[G. R. Elton]] describes as 'mystery' about Cromwell's demise. In April 1540, just three months before he went to the block, he was created Earl of Essex and Lord Great Chamberlain. The arbitrary and unpredictable streak in the King's personality, which more than once exercised influence during his reign, had surfaced again and washed Cromwell away in its wake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2d4qgsSLZQgC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=thomas+cromwell+temperament+Henry+VIII+unpredictable&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1mr3Og6PVAhXq1IMKHRSICwgQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas+cromwell+temperament+Henry+VIII+unpredictable&amp;f=false|title=Hume and Machiavelli: Political Realism and Liberal Thought|first=Frederick G.|last=Whelan|date=14 January 2018|page=269|publisher=Lexington Books|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Cromwell's years in power, he skilfully managed Crown finances and extended royal authority. In 1536, he established the [[Court of Augmentations]] to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] and the [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths]], owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the [[Council of the North]], extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against [[enclosure]]s, the promotion of English cloth exports and the [[poor relief]] legislation of 1536.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

==Personal religious beliefs==
Although Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the [[Henrician Reformation]] was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb. For instance, in the mid-1530s, he promoted Protestant ideas to forge an alliance with German Lutheran states, but his support for the Protestant cause is too general to be accurately explained in narrow political terms.&lt;ref&gt;William Underwood, "Thomas Cromwell and William Marshall's Protestant books". ''The Historical Journal'' 47.3 (2004): 517-539. [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/historical-journal/article/thomas-cromwell-and-william-marshalls-protestant-books/3B05EA4539D100486353138B7AFB42CE online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1535 Cromwell succeeded in having clearly identified reformers, such as [[Hugh Latimer]], [[Edward Foxe]] and [[Nicholas Shaxton]] appointed to the episcopacy. He encouraged and supported the work of reformers, such as [[Robert Barnes (martyr)|Robert Barnes]] and obtained the license to publish the [[Matthew's Bible]], provided significant funding for the printing of this English translation of the Bible and sent one to all parishes in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2AXp3GFGYXwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+cromwell+++matthew+bible+great+bible&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDxMve46fVAhUf8YMKHSTPBosQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas+cromwell&amp;f=false|title=Matthew's Bible: A Facsimile of the 1537 Edition|first1=John|last1=Rogers|first2=Joseph W.|last2=Johnson|date=14 January 2018|publisher=Hendrickson Publishers|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=05UXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=thomas+cromwell+the+great+bible&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit7vq17qfVAhUs7oMKHXwjBpUQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas+cromwell+the+great+bible&amp;f=false|title=The New King James Version: In the Great Tradition|first=Arthur L.|last=Farstad|date=8 April 2014|publisher=Thomas Nelson|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1538, it was compulsory for all churches to own a Bible, in accordance with Cromwell's injunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Cranmer-archbishop-of-Canterbury|title=Thomas Cranmer - archbishop of Canterbury|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/voices/voices_reformation_events.shtml|title=BBC - Radio 4 Voices of the Powerless - 08/08/2002 featuring the Reformation's dates|first=British Broadcasting|last=Corporation|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revised version, the [[Great Bible]] was widely available by 1539 and included a picture of Henry VIII, [[Thomas Cranmer]] and Cromwell on the title page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=2-g3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP117&amp;dq=thomas+cromwell+the+great+bible&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQi8z67qfVAhUV8YMKHVk5DHQQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=the+great+bible&amp;f=false|title=Thomas Cromwell: The Rise And Fall Of Henry VIII's Most Notorious Minister|first=Robert|last=Hutchinson|page=117|date=23 February 2012|publisher=Orion Publishing Group|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlyenglishbibles.com/earlyversions/GreatFull5b.html|title=Great Bible (Full Story) - Early English Bibles|website=Earlyenglishbibles.com|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When Cromwell fell from favour in 1540, his alleged support for [[Anabaptism]] was cited. Although the charge was spurious, the fact that it was levelled at all demonstrates the reputation for evangelical sympathies Cromwell had developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=an-eXXA3DBMC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=charge+of+anabaptism+thomas+cromwell&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTxZm-5afVAhWd3oMKHYWwBS44ChDoAQgnMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=charge+of+anabaptism+thomas+cromwell&amp;f=false|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of the Revolutions and Wars of England, Scotland, and Ireland, 1639-1660|first=Stephen C.|last=Manganiello|page=15|date=14 January 2018|publisher=Scarecrow Press|accessdate=14 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==

Until the 1950s, historians discounted Cromwell's role, calling him a doctrinaire hack who was little more than the agent of the despotic King Henry VIII; for example the 1911 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states "his power has been overrated."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.m.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclopædia_Britannica/Cromwell,_Thomas,_Earl_of_Essex&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Geoffrey Elton]], however, featured him as the central figure in the Tudor revolution in government in ''The Tudor Revolution'' (1953). Elton portrayed Cromwell as the presiding genius, much more so than the king, handling the break with Rome and creating the laws and administrative procedures that reshaped post-Reformation England. Elton wrote that Cromwell had been responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms, creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of Church lands, and largely removing the medieval features of central government.

Subsequent historians have agreed with Elton as to Cromwell's importance, though not with his claims of "revolution."{{sfn|Bernard|1998|pp=587–607 Bernard argues Elton exaggerated Cromwell's role}}{{sfn|Coby|2009|p=197}}{{sfn|Kenyon|1983|p=210}} Leithead (2004) wrote, "Against significant opposition he secured acceptance of the king's new powers, created a more united and more easily governable kingdom, and provided the crown, at least temporarily, with a very significant landed endowment."{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}

==Descendants==
Thomas Cromwell's son [[Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell]], married [[Elizabeth Seymour, Baroness Cromwell|Elizabeth Seymour]], the sister of [[Queen Jane Seymour]] and widow of Sir [[Anthony Ughtred]].

==Hans Holbein portraits==
Thomas Cromwell was a patron of [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], as were St. [[Thomas More]] and Anne Boleyn. In the New York [[Frick Collection]], two portraits by Holbein hang facing each other on the same wall of the Study, one depicting Thomas Cromwell, the other Thomas More, whose execution he had procured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Acocella |first=Joan |date=19 October 2009 |title=Tudor Tales |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/10/19/tudor-tales |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional portrayals==
Cromwell has been portrayed in a number of plays, feature films, and television [[miniseries]], usually as a villainous character. More recently, however, [[Hilary Mantel]]'s two [[Man Booker Prize]]-winning novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring up the Bodies]]'' (2012) have sought to show him in a more sympathetic light, stressing his family affections, genuine respect for Cardinal Wolsey, zeal for the Reformation, and support for a limited degree of social reform.

===Theatre===
* Cromwell is a supporting character in [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s 1613 play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]''.

''Winter King'' is the first book in this series. 
* Cromwell is the subject of [[Hilary Mantel]]'s novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'' (2012), which explore his humanity and to some extent rebut the unflattering portrait in ''A Man for All Seasons''. ''Wolf Hall'' won the 2009 and ''Bring Up the Bodies'' the 2012 [[Man Booker Prize]].
* Cromwell is one of  the major characters of "Frailty of Human Affairs" (2017), book one of the Queenmaker Series, by New Zealand author Caroline Angus Baker.

* He is one of the major characters in [[H. F. M. Prescott]]'s novel ''The Man on a Donkey'', which depicts a power struggle between Cromwell and [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Lord Darcy]], who represents the old nobility.
*He is a major character in ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' by [[Ford Madox Ford]].

===Film===
* [[Franklin Dyall]] portrayed Cromwell in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933).
* In the film [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|''A Man for All Seasons'']], Cromwell was played by [[Leo McKern]], who also played the role on stage on Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm| title = A Man for All Seasons, full cast| accessdate = 28 October 2014| publisher = Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* Cromwell was played by [[Wolfe Morris]] in the BBC miniseries ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1970), and by [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] in the Granada Television production ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]'' (2003). In the television version of ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' (2003), he was played by veteran actor [[Ron Cook]].
* In the television series ''[[The Tudors]]'' (2007), Cromwell is played by English actor [[James Frain]]; he is portrayed as Machiavellian, cunning and devoted to the English Reformation at any cost, though he is not entirely unsympathetic. Frain played the character for three seasons; Cromwell's execution brought the third season to its conclusion.
* In ''The Twisted Tale of Bloody Mary'' (2008), an independent film from TV Choice Productions, Cromwell is played by Burtie Welland.
* Thomas Cromwell, played by [[Mark Rylance]], is the central figure in the [[BBC]]'s six-part series ''[[Wolf Hall (TV series)|Wolf Hall]]'', based on [[Hilary Mantel]]'s novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' and ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'', which was first broadcast on 21 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21712688|title=Mark Rylance set for Hilary Mantel TV drama|publisher=BBC News|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Uti possidetis juris''''' or '''''uti possidetis iuris''''' ([[Latin]] for "as you possess under law") is a principle of [[international law]] which provides that newly formed [[sovereign state]]s should have the same borders that their preceding dependent area had before their independence.

==History==
''Uti possidetis juris'' is a modified form of ''[[uti possidetis]]''; created for the purpose of avoiding ''[[terra nullius]]'', the original version of ''uti possidetis'' began as a [[Roman law]] governing the rightful possession of property. During the [[medieval]] period it evolved into a law governing international relations and has recently been modified for situations of newly independent states.

==Application==
''Uti possidetis juris'' has been applied in modern history to such regions as [[South America]], [[Africa]], the [[Soviet Union]], and numerous other regions where centralized governments were broken up, or where [[Empire|imperial]] rulers were overthrown. It is often applied to prevent foreign intervention by eliminating any contested ''[[terra nullius]]'', or no man's land, that foreign powers could claim, or to prevent disputes that could emerge with the possibility of redrawing the borders of new states after their independence.

[[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] base their [[territorial claims in Antarctica]] on the ''uti possidetis juris'' principle in the same manner as their now recognized [[Patagonia]]n claims.&lt;ref name=Prieto2004&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prieto Larrain |first=M.

{{Property law}}

'''Waste''' is a term used in the [[law]] of [[real property]] to describe a [[cause of action]] that can be brought in [[court]] to address a change in condition of [[real property]] brought about by a current [[leasehold estate|tenant]] that damages or destroys the value of that property. A [[lawsuit]] for waste can be brought against a [[life tenant]] or lessee of a [[leasehold estate]], either by a current landlord or by the owner of a vested [[future interest]].  The holder of an [[executory interest]], however, has no standing to enforce an action for waste, since his future interest is not vested.  There are several different kinds of waste under the law.

==Voluntary waste==

Voluntary waste, (sometimes called ''affirmative waste'') is any change made to the estate that intentionally or negligently causes harm to the estate or depletes its resources, unless this depletion is a continuation of a pre-existing use. Some jurisdictions follow what is called the [[open mines doctrine]], which permits continued excavation from any mine on the property that is already open, but prohibits the opening of new mines. However, the majority of jurisdictions now follow a doctrine that allows ''any'' activity necessary to continue the exploitation of a particular resource, if the land has already been used for that purpose.

:Example: If there is a [[copper]] mine on the land, the current tenant can continue the mining operation to the point of extracting all available copper. If there were no such mine there originally, and the lease did not anticipate the mine, excavating property would constitute waste.

==Permissive waste==

Permissive waste is failure to maintain the estate, either physically or financially. Rather than requiring some bad act on the part of the tenant, this requires the failure to maintain ordinary [[Home repair|repairs]], pay [[Property tax|taxes]], or pay [[interest]] on the [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] by the life tenant or the lessee of a leasehold estate.

==Ameliorative waste==

Ameliorative waste is an improvement to an estate that changes its character even if the change increases the land's value. Under [[English law#Common law|English common law]], when ameliorative waste occurs, the interested party can recover from the tenant the cost of restoring the land to its original condition. This is based on traditional [[common law]] jurisprudence presuming that the grantor intended the property to be kept in its original condition.

===Example===

Person A has a present [[life estate]] to three acres of land with a beautiful forest and his family's historic home. Person B is willed to inherit the estate after A dies. B loves studying ancestry and hopes to one day live in the historic building on his family's land. Instead, A decides that the land would be more valuable as a nightclub and draws up a business plan to transform the old estate into a new late night hotspot. B can sue A for ameliorative waste and get an injunction preventing the construction of the club. Even if the club is set to make money and the old family house is a valueless wreck in terrible condition, B still has a right to stop A from improving the property.

If A does in fact build the club, then B can sue for the cost of demolishing the new structure and returning the land to its original condition.

In the United States, damages for ameliorative waste are generally not given, especially if the improvement to the property is likely to last a long time. The policy behind this change in common law is to encourage improvements and economic development, even at the cost of historical change.

===Exceptions===

There is an exception to this doctrine where a long-term tenant makes a change that increases the value of the property in a way that reflects a change in the nature and character of neighboring properties. If a tenant tears down a house and builds a factory on property in an area in which residences have generally been replaced with industry, the tenant will not be liable for waste.

In ''Melms v. Pabst Brewing Co.'', 79 N.W. 738 (Wis. 1899), the Pabst Brewing Company's plant encroached on a residential home. The owner of the home wanted to convert the land to commercial use but held an estate limiting the land to residential purposes. The court held that the neighboring properties had sufficiently changed the nature of the area and allowed the estate holder to convert the land despite the existence of potential ameliorative waste.

==Equitable waste==

Under [[English law]] and [[Australian law]], equitable waste is waste that a life tenant has a right to commit at common law but is restrained by a [[court of equity]]. This doctrine fits under the broader framework of equity, in which a legal right to do something is not so unrestrained that it is impossible to abuse that right. A life tenant who is granted an estate "without impeachment of waste" (may not be sued for waste) may not commit acts of flagrant destruction inconsistent with the fruitful use of the land. For example, a mansion may not be stripped of its glass, timber or pipes (''Vane v Lord barnard''), nor may trees of an ornamental value be cut down by the life tenant (''Turner v Wright'').

==Remedies for waste==

Where a [[court]] finds that a tenant is engaging in waste, there are a number of possible remedies which can be taken:
#The court may award sufficient money damages to compensate the injured party for the loss resulting from the waste.
#The court may directly require the party responsible for the waste to restore the property to its original condition.
#The court may accelerate the passage of title in the land, divesting a tenant or life estate holder of the property and vesting it in the landlord or remainderman.

[[Kentucky]] has a particularly harsh remedy for voluntary waste. A person found to have committed voluntary waste without the written permission of the holder of the future interest is forced to pay [[treble damages]] to the holder of the future interest, and the person's present interest (whether a life estate or a lease) is automatically terminated.&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky Revised Statutes Annotated § 381.350 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Missouri]] has two statutes that prescribe a harsh remedy for waste. There, a person found to have committed voluntary waste without the written permission of the holder of the future interest is forced to pay treble damages. In some cases, the plaintiff has been able to recover treble damages twice--once for voluntary waste and again for wantonly committed waste.&lt;ref&gt;Missouri Revisited Statutes 537.420; 537.490 (for wantonly committed waste)&lt;/ref&gt;

If the plaintiff can show that the defendant is currently engaged in voluntary or permissive waste of the land, the court may [[injunction|enjoin]] (or stop) the activity; however, courts are reluctant to enjoin ameliorative waste unless the property being destroyed has some unique historic value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8883">[[File:Free range chickens in Hainan, China - 02.jpg|thumb|During the daytime, the doors are left open for these chickens to choose whether to be in the yard or [[chicken coop|coop]]. This small poultry farm is in [[Hainan]], China.]]
In [[poultry]] keeping, '''yarding''' is the practice of providing the poultry with a fenced yard in addition to a [[Chicken coop|poultry house]]. Movable yarding is a form of [[managed intensive grazing]].

Yarding is often confused with [[free range]]. The distinction is that free-range poultry are either totally unfenced, or the [[fence]] is so distant that it has little influence on their freedom of movement.

== Historical practice ==

Before the discovery of vitamins A and D in the 1920s, green feed and sunshine were essential to the health of poultry. [[Vitamin D]] was synthesized from sunlight on the skin (as with humans), while [[Vitamin A]] was obtained through green forage plants such as grass. Yards small enough to be fenced economically were soon stripped of palatable green forage and become barren. This is followed by a build-up of manure, parasites, and other pathogens.

Free range husbandry was the most common method in these early days. Most farms had only a small free-range barnyard flock. Larger flocks were kept in small houses build on skids, which were dragged periodically to a fresh piece of ground. This method is similar to the modern practice of [[pastured poultry]].

Experts of the day estimated the sustainable level to be about fifty hens per acre (80 m² per hen), with one hundred hens per acre (40 m² per hen) as an absolute upper limit if special care was taken. These levels are sustainable in the sense that the turf can make use of the nutrients in the manure left behind by the chickens, and in the sense that, at this stocking density, the chickens will not completely destroy the turf through scratching.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
At the Oregon Station on clay soil it was found that the day droppings from 200 laying hens on an acre  [20 m² per hen] in four years made the soil too rich for the successful growth of cereal crops where cropping the ground was done every other year. The night droppings were put on other land. If the soil contains too much manure for the crops it is safe to assume that it is not in the best condition for poultry. Sooner or later it is bound to show not only in a failure of grain crops but in failure of poultry crops. For a permanent system under average conditions of soil and climate the following points are suggested for consideration.

*Maximum number of fowls per acre: 100 laying hens [40 m² per hen].
*Disposing of the night droppings on other land.
*Dividing the ground into at least two divisions or yards, and growing a crop on each yard at least every other year. In sections where crops may be grown every year the number of fowls may be increased.
*Growing crops that will use up the maximum amount of manure.
*Keeping the ground vacant [of chickens] at least six months in the year.
*Thorough underdrainage, where necessary, to carry off surplus water.

.... It is not assumed that as many as 500 hens may not be profitably kept on an acre  [8 m² per hen] for a few years under favorable conditions. It has been done, but it is a different matter when it is planned to make a permanent business of it.&lt;ref&gt;James Dryden, Poultry Breeding and Management. Orange Judd Press, 1916, pp191-192.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because fifty hens per acre represents {{convert|800|sqft|m2|0}} per hen (80 m² per hen), while the density inside the house at the time was normally four square feet per hen (0.4 m² per hen), this required that the yard be 200 times wider than the house, assuming a yard on one side of the house. That is, a house {{convert|20|ft|m|0}} wide required a yard {{convert|4000|ft|m|-1}} wide to provide the necessary area. This would normally be provided as two yards, one on either side of the house, each {{convert|2000|ft|m|-1}} wide. In reality, such yards are expensive to fence, and the chickens spend most of their time on the portion closest to the house, so sustainability was never achieved in practice except with portable houses, which were moved periodically to fresh ground. Yarded operations were operated with unsustainably small yards that were quickly denuded and which received excessive levels of manure.

The use of multiple yards, frequent plowing, and liberal use of lime would allow higher stocking levels to be used, since plowing and liming would allow much of the nitrogen to escape from the soil.

The following is typical advice for the successful use of yards in the Thirties and Forties:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All poultrymen should realize that there are no known substitutes for sunshine and young green grass in keeping poultry in the best possible state of health and in promoting growth and maintaining egg production. Where sunshine and green grass cannot be provided, as in the case of birds kept in strict confinement, the best possible substitutes must be provided. In the case of most farm and many commercial flocks, however, the growing stock is reared on range, and the adult birds are given yards or allowed to roam at will.

If the staggering losses among growing chicks and laying birds that occur annually are to be reduced materially, better methods of flock management must be employed. The losses from mortality are due largely to internal parasites and diseases of one kind or another. Bare ground over which the chickens have run for some time, mud puddles, and stagnant water are the chief sources of the spread of diseases, most of which are filth borne....

The mortality that usually occurs in growing and adult stock may be materially reduced by providing the birds with an alternate yarding system. Probably the best arrangement is to provide each colony brooder and each laying house with three yards (3 m) which the birds would be allowed to use every 3 or 4 weeks. By alternating the birds in the yards every 3 or 4 weeks each yard is kept reasonably sanitary, especially if the soil in the immediate vicinity of the house is cultivated and treated with lime, and young green grass is available for the birds throughout the season. The importance of clean range for both birds and adult stock cannot be emphasized too strongly... For adult stock a good grass sward can be maintained on fertile soil, allowing about 200 birds to the acre [20 m² per hen].&lt;ref&gt;Morley A. Jull, Poultry Husbandry. McGraw-Hill, 1938, pp. 231–233.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nutritional advances increasingly turned yarding into a liability, and it fell out of favor. Free range continued to be used, especially for breeding flocks and for pullets before they reached laying age, because of the lower rate of disease and greater overall health of grass-reared chickens. Breeding flocks (which lay eggs destined for incubation) are always given a better diet than flocks laying table eggs, since a diet that will produce table eggs cheaply will not provide eggs that hatch well. For some time after confined laying flocks produced table eggs satisfactorily, breeding flocks benefited from free range

In Britain, Geoffrey Sykes developed a new yarding system in the Fifties.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Sykes, The Henyard. 1952. Crosby Lockwood &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This used a small yard covered with a thick layer of straw, with more straw added frequently. He also recommended that shade and a windbreak be provided by a solid fence around the yard, or by other means, such as rows of haybales. Once a year, the old straw was removed by a front-end loader or similar machinery. This method eliminated mud and pathogens. It was later forgotten because the industry moved to high-density confinement before the method was widely established.

== Recent practice ==

Today, commercial poultry producers generally call yarding [[free range]] on their labels. This conflation of two very different techniques has led to confusion. The vast majority of "free-range" operations are really yarded. 

[[Pastured poultry]], as promoted by the APPPA, the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apppa.org APPPA: Pastured Poultry for Everyone&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and author/farmer [[Joel Salatin]], takes a different approach, attempting to achieve the benefits of free range while using penning or yarding. The key element of Pastured poultry is the use of portable housing and the optional use of portable electric fencing. By moving the house and yard frequently, perhaps daily, all the disadvantages of permanent yards are eliminated.

A '''zero-tolerance policy in schools''' is a strict enforcement of regulations and bans against undesirable behaviors or possession of items.  Public criticism against such policies have arisen due to their enforcement and the resulting (sometimes devastating) consequences when the behavior or possession was done in ignorance, by accident, or under [[extenuating circumstances]]. For example, a ban against guns resulting in a Rhode Island boy with a gun charm on a key chain being suspended. In schools, common zero-tolerance policies concern possession or use of illicit [[recreational drug use|drugs]] or [[weapon]]s.  Students, and sometimes staff, parents, and other visitors, who possess a banned item for any reason are always (if the policy is followed) to be punished.

In the United States and Canada, [[Zero tolerance|zero-tolerance]] policies have been adopted in various schools and other education venues.  Zero-tolerance policies in the United States became widespread in 1994, after federal legislation required states to expel any student who brought a firearm to school for one year, or lose all federal funding.&lt;ref name=Cauchon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/educate/ednews3.htm |title=Zero-tolerance policies lack flexibility |work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These policies are promoted as preventing [[drug abuse]] and [[violence in schools]]. Critics say zero tolerance in schools have resulted in punishments which have been criticised as egregiously unfair against students and teachers, especially in schools with poorly written policies. Consequently, critics describe these  policies as '''zero-logic policies''' because they treat juveniles the way that adults would be treated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delawareliberal.net/2009/10/06/zero-tolerance-is-zero-intelligence/ |title=Zero Tolerance is Zero Intelligence |date=6 October 2009 |publisher=Delaware Liberal}}&lt;/ref&gt; — or more harshly, given that children are seldom granted full permission to speak up in their own defense to adults with authority over them. Many people have been critical of zero tolerance policies, claiming that they are overly draconian, provide little if any benefit to anyone, contribute to overcrowding of the [[criminal justice system]], and/or disproportionately target blacks and Latinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/19/zero-tolerance-school.html |title=LA schools to end zero-tolerance policies and criminalization of students |work=aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There is no credible evidence that zero tolerance reduces violence or drug abuse by students.&lt;ref name=skiba2000/&gt;  Furthermore, school [[suspension (punishment)|suspension]] and [[expulsion (education)|expulsion]] result in a number of negative outcomes for both schools and students.&lt;ref name="skiba2000"&gt;Russell J.

Analysis of the suspension rate of students show that black females and other racial minorities are suspended at a greater rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civilrightsproject.ucla.edu/resources/projects/center-for-civil-rights-remedies/school-to-prison-folder/federal-reports/are-we-closing-the-school-discipline-gap/AreWeClosingTheSchoolDisciplineGap_FINAL221.pdf |title=ARE WE CLOSING THE SCHOOL DISCIPLINE GAP? |work=UCLA C E N T E R F O R C I V I L R I G H T S R E M E D I E S |date=Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Psychological Association]] concluded that the available evidence does not support the use of zero tolerance policies as defined and implemented, that there is a clear need to modify such policies, and that the policies create a number of unintended negative consequences,&lt;ref&gt;Are Zero Tolerance Policies Effective in the Schools?

In 2014, a study of [[school discipline]] figures was conducted. It was found that suspensions and expulsions as a result of zero tolerance policies have not reduced school disruptions. The study's author stated that "zero tolerance approaches to school discipline are not the best way to create a safe climate for learning".&lt;ref name=skiba2014&gt;Skiba, R. J. (2014).

Roberge |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this seems like a simple action-reaction type of situation, it often leaves out the mitigating circumstances that are often the important details in student incidents. Even civilian judges consider mitigating circumstances before passing judgement or sentencing. If zero tolerance policies were applied in adult courtroom scenarios, they would be fundamentally unjust and unconstitutional due to neglecting the laws involving due process, along with cruel and unusual punishments.

==History==
The label of zero tolerance began with the [[Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994]], when Congress authorized public-school funding subject to the adoption of zero-tolerance policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Pace Law Review |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=1999 |title=The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994: Zero Tolerance Takes Aim at Procedural Due Process |author=Kathleen M. Cerrone |url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1265&amp;context=plr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar policies of intolerance coupled with expulsions for less serious behaviors than bringing a weapon to school had long been a part of private, and particularly religious, schools. The use of zero-tolerance policies in secular, public schools increased dramatically after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], with principals declaring that safety concerns made them want zero tolerance for weapons. These have led to a large number of disproportionate responses to minor, or technical transgressions, many of which have attracted the attention of the international media. These cases include students being suspended or expelled for such offenses as possession of [[ibuprofen]] or [[Midol]] (both legal, non-prescription drugs commonly used to treat [[headaches]] and [[Dysmenorrhea|menstrual cramps]] respectively) with permission of the students' parents, keeping [[pocket knife|pocketknives]] (small utility knife) in cars, and carrying sharp tools outside of a woodshop classroom (where they are often required materials).

In the [[kids for cash scandal|"kids for cash" scandal]], judge [[Mark Ciavarella]], who promoted a platform of zero tolerance, received kickbacks for constructing a private prison that housed juvenile offenders, and then proceeded to fill the prison by sentencing children to extended stays in juvenile detention for offenses as minimal as mocking a [[Principal (academia)|principal]] on [[Myspace]], scuffles in hallways, trespassing in a vacant building, and shoplifting [[DVD]]s from [[Wal-Mart]]. Critics of zero-tolerance policies argue that harsh punishments for minor offenses are normalized.

==Promotion==
Proponents of punishment- and exclusion-based philosophy of school discipline policies claim that such policies are required to create an appropriate environment for learning.&lt;ref name=skiba2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Noguera1995&gt;Noguera, Pedro A. [http://youthjusticenc.org/download/education-justice/prevention-intervention-alternatives/Preventing%20and%20Producing%20Violence:%20A%20Critical%20Analysis%20of%20Responses%20to%20School%20Violence.pdf Preventing and Producing Violence: A Critical Analysis of Responses to School Violence] ''Harvard Educational Review'', Summer 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;189–212.&lt;/ref&gt; This rests on the assumption that strong
enforcement can act as a [[Deterrence (psychology)|psychological deterrent]] to other potentially disruptive students.&lt;ref name=skiba2014/&gt;

The policy assumption is that inflexibility is a deterrent because, no matter how or why the rule was broken, the fact that the rule was broken is the basis for the imposition of the penalty. This is intended as a [[behavior modification]] strategy:  since those at risk know that it may operate unfairly, they may be induced to take even unreasonable steps to avoid breaking the rule. This is a standard policy in rule- and law-based systems around the world on "offenses" as minor as traffic violations to major health and safety legislation for the protection of employees and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Ghezzi, Patti. "Zero tolerance for zero tolerance" ''Atlanta Constitution'', March 20, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disciplinarian parents view zero-tolerance policies as a tool to fight corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Takyi-Boadu, Charles. "On Zero-Tolerance Corruption not Province of Politicians." ''The Ghanaian Chronicle'', March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this argument, if subjective judgment is not allowed, most attempts by the authority person to encourage bribes or other favors in exchange for leniency are clearly visible.

==Criticism==
Critics of zero-tolerance policies in schools say they are part of a [[United States school-to-prison link|school-to-prison pipeline]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/publications/gpsolo_ereport/2014/june_2014/the_emergence_of_the_school-to-prison_pipeline.html|title=The Emergence of the School-to-Prison Pipeline - Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division|website=www.americanbar.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that over-polices children with behavioural problems, treating their problems as criminal justice issues rather than educational and behavioural problems. Students that may previously have been given short school suspensions before the implementation of policies are now sent to juvenile courts.&lt;ref name="ScottSteinberg2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Elizabeth S Scott |author2=Laurence D Steinberg |title=Rethinking Juvenile Justice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEkbMyBLJXIC |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-04336-7 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of zero-tolerance policies frequently refer to cases where minor offenses have resulted in severe punishments. Typical examples include the honor-roll student being expelled from school under a "no weapons" policy while in possession of [[nail clipper]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abanet.org/crimjust/juvjus/zerotolreport.html Final Report, Bi Partisan Working Group on Youth Violence] 106th Congress, February 1996 Zero Tolerance Policy Report, American Bar Association&lt;/ref&gt; or for possessing "drugs" like [[cough drop]]s and dental [[mouthwash]] or "weapons" like [[rubber band]]s.&lt;ref name=Cauchon/&gt;

A related criticism is that zero-tolerance policies make schools feel like a [[jail]] or a [[prison]].
Furthermore zero-tolerance policies have been struck down by U.S. courts&lt;ref&gt;"Pensacola honor students win zero tolerance drug ruling" article of the AP/Bradenton Herald, Sept. 8, 2002 at [http://www.overlawyered.com/archives/02/sept3.html#0930b Overlawyered.com archives Sept. 2002 pt. III]&lt;/ref&gt; and by departments of education.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/freespeech/youth/28109prs20070119.html Rhode Island Officials Rule School Can't Censor Teen's Yearbook Photo] (1/19/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that the zero-tolerance policies have actually caused schools to [[turn a blind eye]] to bullying, resulting in them refusing to solve individual cases in an attempt to make their image look better. The zero-tolerance policy also punishes both the attacker and the defender in a fight, even when the attacker was the one who started the fight unprovoked.

A particularly dismaying hypothesis about zero tolerance policies is that they may actually discourage some people from reporting criminal and illegal behavior, for fear of losing relationships, and for many other reasons. That is, ironically, zero tolerance policies may be ineffective in the very purpose for which they were originally designed.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, Mary and Bendersky, Corinne, "Workplace Justice, Zero Tolerance and Zero Barriers: Getting People to Come Forward in Conflict Management Systems," in Negotiations and Change, From the Workplace to Society, Thomas Kochan and Richard Locke (editors), Cornell University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

As schools develop responses to [[online bullying]], schools that have overly harsh approaches to zero tolerance policies may increasingly police speech of students in their own time, that would normally be protected by [[free speech]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/litigation/committees/childrights/content/articles/fall2012-0912-zero-tolerance-online-bullying-free-speech.html|title=Zero Tolerance for Online Bullying Can Hamper Free Speech - Children's Rights Litigation - ABA Section of Litigation|website=apps.americanbar.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Bar Association]] opposes "zero tolerance policies that mandate either expulsion or referral of students to juvenile or criminal court, without regard to the circumstances or nature of the offense or the students{{sic}} history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/groups/child_law/tools_to_use/attorneys/school_disciplinezerotolerancepolicies.html|title=School Discipline "Zero Tolerance" Policies - Center on Children and the Law|website=www.americanbar.org|accessdate=3 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of zero tolerance policies also argue that the large numbers of students who are suspended and expelled from school experience negative effects which can prohibit them from finishing high school. Students who experience suspension, expulsion and arrests pay higher psychological and social costs: such as depression, suicidal thoughts, academic failure, and run the risk of being incarcerated as adults. In a study by Forrest et. al., (2000), psychologists identified that a third of youths in juvenile detention centers were diagnosed with depression shortly after being incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scogin|first=Forrest|last2=Welsh|first2=Douglas|last3=Hanson|first3=Ashley|last4=Stump|first4=Jamie|last5=Coates|first5=Adriana|date=2005-09-01|title=Evidence-Based Psychotherapies for Depression in Older Adults|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1093/clipsy.bpi033/abstract|journal=Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=222–237|doi=10.1093/clipsy.bpi033|issn=1468-2850}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to being diagnosed with depression many youths found themselves having suicidal thoughts (Gnau et. al. 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Mace D, Rohde P, Gnau V |date=1997|title=Psychological patterns of depression and suicidal behavior of adolescents in a juvenile detention facility.|url=|journal=Journal for Juvenile Justice and Detention Services.|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research found that Black, Latino, and White adults with low educational attainment risked a higher propensity of being incarcerated in their lifetime (Pettit &amp; Western 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Western|first=Bruce|last2=Pettit|first2=Becky|title=Incarceration &amp; social inequality|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/DAED_a_00019|journal=Daedalus|volume=139|issue=3|pages=8–19|doi=10.1162/daed_a_00019}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same study they found that the incarceration rate in 2008 rose to 37% since the 1980’s. This showed that incarceration rates of people with low levels of education were continuing to rise and that students were not completing their high school requirements.

According to kidsdata.org for the year 2012, 21,638 students were suspended and 592 students were expelled from San Diego County schools. A total of 10.1% of students did not complete their high school diploma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kidsdata.org|title=Kidsdata: Data and Resources about the Health of Children|website=Kidsdata.org|access-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a decrease in juvenile arrest, suspensions, expulsions, and drop out rates, many still argue that these disciplinary policies have helped contribute to students not completing their high school curriculum. Schools are struggling to keep students within the walls of the educational system rather than the walls of a juvenile detention center.

==Escondido school knives case==
The '''Escondido school knives case''' is a collection of school suspensions, possible expulsions, and protests surrounding knives that were found in the cars of two students at [[San Pasqual High School (Escondido, California)|San Pasqual High School]] in [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[California]].

===Discovery and arrests=== 
Brandon Cappaletti, an 18-year-old student at the school, had been on a fishing trip in early January, 2016. He says he had used the knives to cut line and would have used them to prepare fish. After the fishing trip, he left the knives in his truck. Another 16-year-old student had a [[pocket knife]] in his [[glove compartment]].&lt;ref name=reason_zero&gt;{{cite news|url=http://reason.com/blog/2016/02/12/zero-tolerance-2-teens-face-expulsion-ja|title=Zero Tolerance: 2 Teens Face Expulsion, Jail for Fishing Knives, Advil in Their Cars|author=Soave, Robby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 27, police dogs were sniffing vehicles in the school's parking lot. Each student had [[Advil]] in the truck. In each case, the dogs alerted on the Advil. Cappaletti was called out of class to unlock the truck. The police found the Advil and the knives. In the case of the 16-year-old, the alert also which led to the police finding the pocket knife.&lt;ref name=reason_zero/&gt;

Both boys were [[arrested]]. Cappaletti was later released to his mother. The 16-year-old's case was referred to the California's [[diversion program|juvenile diversion program]]. Both boys have been charged with a [[misdemeanor]] for having a knife on school property with a blade longer than two-and-a-half [[inch]]es. Both were also immediately suspended from classes.&lt;ref name=reason_zero/&gt; A hearing on Feb. 25 will decide whether or not they will be expelled.

===Impact and protests===
Cappaletti has already joined the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines Corps]]. If convicted of the misdemeanor, he might not be able to remain. His mother Amy Cappelletti said that “He’s the most patriotic student. He never gets into trouble. These weren’t Crocodile Dundee knives.”&lt;ref name=uniontribune_zero_tolerance&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/feb/09/zero-tolerance-escondido-knife-expulsion/#sthash.GsHMyUcO.dpuf|title=Forgotten knives meet zero tolerance|author=Miao, Pat|work=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|date=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a School Board meeting on February 9, 2016, hundreds of people asked the Board not to expel the two students. Tony Coreley, the high school's [[Coach (American football)|football coach]] said that “There are rules and laws that the district has to follow, but this (situation) is unfortunate.”&lt;ref name=uniontribune_zero_tolerance/&gt;

School District spokeswoman Karyl O’Brien said that the situation was unfortunate, but under California's zero-tolerance policy, there were rules the school had to follow.

===Resolution===
On February 11, 2016, the [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] of the [[Escondido Union School District]] stated that the students would not be expelled, and that they were expected to be allowed to return to school the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Escondido-San-Pasqual-High-School-Student-Knives-Sam-Serrato-Brandon-Cappelletti-368639191.html|title=San Pasqual High School Students Found With Knives Will Not be Expelled|author=Garske, Monica}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 13, the misdemeanor charges remain unresolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbs8.com/story/31208965/too-harsh-students-face-expulsion-and-misdemeanors|title=No expulsion, students still face misdemeanors|work=[[NBC San Diego]]|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
