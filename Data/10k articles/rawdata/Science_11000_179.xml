An '''air separation''' plant separates [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmospheric air]] into its primary components, typically [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], and sometimes also [[argon]] and other rare [[inert gas]]es.

The most common method for air separation is [[fractional distillation]]. Cryogenic air separation units (ASUs) are built to provide nitrogen or oxygen and often co-produce argon.  Other methods such as membrane, [[pressure swing adsorption]] (PSA) and [[Vacuum swing adsorption|vacuum pressure swing adsorption]] (VPSA) are commercially used to separate a single component from ordinary air. High purity [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[argon]] used for [[semiconductor device fabrication]] requires cryogenic distillation. Similarly, the only viable source of the [[rare gases]] [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]] is the distillation of air using at least two [[distillation column]]s.

== Cryogenic distillation process==
[[File:Coldbox.JPG|thumb|Distillation column in a cryogenic air separation plant]]
Pure gases can be separated from air by first cooling it until it liquefies, then selectively [[Distillation|distilling]] the components at their various boiling temperatures. The process can produce high purity gases but is energy-intensive. This process was pioneered by [[Carl von Linde]] in the early 20th century and is still used today to produce high purity gases.&lt;ref name=Cool&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcetoday.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2010/831/831%20cewctw.pdf|publisher=Institution of Chemical Engineers|date=September 2010|title=Cool Inventions|access-date=2014-01-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113200813/http://www.tcetoday.com/~/media/Documents/TCE/Articles/2010/831/831%20cewctw.pdf|archive-date=2014-01-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To achieve the low distillation temperatures an air separation unit requires a [[refrigeration cycle]] that operates by means of the [[Joule–Thomson effect]], and the cold equipment has to be kept within an [[thermal insulation|insulated]] enclosure (commonly called a "cold box"). The cooling of the gases requires a large amount of energy to make this refrigeration cycle work and is delivered by an air [[Gas compressor|compressor]]. Modern ASUs use [[Turboexpander|expansion turbine]]s for cooling; the output of the expander helps drive the air compressor, for improved efficiency.
The process consists of the following main steps:

# Before compression the air is pre-filtered of dust.
# Air is compressed where the final delivery pressure is determined by recoveries and the [[fluid]] state (gas or liquid) of the products. Typical pressures range between 5 and 10 bar gauge. The air stream may also be compressed to different pressures to enhance the efficiency of the ASU. During compression water is condensed out in inter-stage coolers.
# The process air is generally passed through a [[molecular sieve]] bed, which removes any remaining water vapour, as well as [[carbon dioxide]], which would freeze and plug the cryogenic equipment. Molecular sieves are often designed to remove any gaseous [[hydrocarbons]] from the air, since these can be a problem in the subsequent air distillation that could lead to explosions.&lt;ref&gt;Particulate matter from forest fires caused an explosion in the air separation unit of a [[Gas to Liquid]] plant, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Fainshtein | first1 = V. I. | doi = 10.1007/s10556-007-0018-8 | title = Provision of explosion proof air separation units under contemporary conditions | journal = Chemical and Petroleum Engineering | volume = 43 | pages = 96–101 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The molecular sieves bed must be regenerated. This is done by installing multiple units operating in alternating mode and using the dry co-produced waste gas to desorb the water.
# Process air is passed through an integrated [[heat exchanger]] (usually a [[plate fin heat exchanger]]) and cooled against product (and waste) cryogenic streams. Part of the air liquefies to form a liquid that is enriched in oxygen. The remaining gas is richer in nitrogen and is distilled to almost pure nitrogen (typically &lt; 1ppm) in a high pressure (HP) distillation column. The condenser of this column requires [[refrigeration]] which is obtained from expanding the more oxygen rich stream further across a valve or through an [[Turboexpander|Expander]], (a reverse compressor).
# Alternatively the condenser may be cooled by interchanging heat with a reboiler in a low pressure (LP) distillation column (operating at 1.2-1.3 bar abs.) when the ASU is producing pure oxygen. To minimize the compression cost the combined condenser/reboiler of the HP/LP columns must operate with a temperature difference of only 1-2 K, requiring plate fin brazed aluminium heat exchangers. Typical oxygen purities range in from 97.5% to 99.5% and influences the maximum recovery of oxygen. The refrigeration required for producing liquid products is obtained using the [[Joule–Thomson effect]] in an expander which feeds compressed air directly to the low pressure column. Hence, a certain part of the air is not to be separated and must leave the low pressure column as a waste stream from its upper section.
# Because the boiling point of argon (87.3 K at standard conditions) lies between that of oxygen (90.2 K) and nitrogen (77.4 K), argon builds up in the lower section of the low pressure column. When argon is produced, a vapor side draw is taken from the low pressure column where the argon concentration is highest. It is sent to another column rectifying the argon to the desired purity from which liquid is returned to the same location in the LP column. Use of modern structured packings which have very low pressure drops enable argon with less than 1 ppm impurities. Though argon is present in less to 1% of the incoming, the air argon column requires a significant amount of energy due to the high reflux ratio required (about 30) in the argon column. Cooling of the argon column can be supplied from cold expanded rich liquid or by liquid nitrogen.
# Finally the products produced in gas form are warmed against the incoming air to ambient temperatures. This requires a carefully crafted heat integration that must allow for robustness against disturbances (due to switch over of the molecular sieve beds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vinson | first1 = D. R. | title = Air separation control technology | doi = 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2006.05.038 | journal = Computers &amp; Chemical Engineering | volume = 30 | issue = 10–12 | pages = 1436–1446 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It may also require additional external refrigeration during start-up.

The separated products are sometimes supplied by pipeline to large industrial users near the production plant. Long distance transportation of products is by shipping liquid product for large quantities or as [[Cryogenic storage dewar|dewar flasks]] or [[gas cylinder]]s for small quantities.

[[Pressure swing adsorption]] provides separation of oxygen or nitrogen from air without liquefaction. The process operates around ambient temperature; a [[zeolite]] (molecular sponge) is exposed to high pressure air, then the air is released and an adsorbed film of the desired gas is released. The size of compressor is much reduced over a liquefaction plant, and [[portable oxygen concentrator]]s are made in this manner to provide oxygen-enriched air for medical purposes. [[Vacuum swing adsorption]] is a similar process; the product gas is evolved from the zeolite at sub-atmospheric pressure.

[[File:Membrane nitrogen generator.jpg|thumb|right|Membrane nitrogen generator]]
[[membrane gas separation|Membrane technologies]] can provide alternate, lower-energy approaches to air separation. For example, a number of approaches are being explored for oxygen generation. Polymeric membranes operating at ambient or warm temperatures, for example, may be able to produce oxygen-enriched air (25-50% oxygen). Ceramic membranes can provide high-purity oxygen (90% or more) but require higher temperatures (800-900 deg C) to operate. These ceramic membranes include Ion Transport Membranes (ITM) and Oxygen Transport Membranes (OTM). Air Products and Chemicals Inc and Praxair are developing flat ITM and tubular OTM systems, .

Membrane gas separation is used to provide oxygen poor and nitrogen rich gases instead of air to fill the fuel tanks of jet liners, thus greatly reducing the chances of accidental fires and explosions. Conversely, membrane gas separation is currently used to provide oxygen enriched air to pilots flying at great altitudes in aircraft without pressurized cabins.

Oxygen-enriched air can be obtained exploiting the different solubility of oxygen and nitrogen. Oxygen is more soluble than nitrogen in water, so if air is degassed from water, a stream of 35% oxygen can be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Galli| first1 = F | last2 = Comazzi| first2 = A | last3 = Previtali| first3 = D| last4 = Manenti| first4 = F | last5 = Bozzano| first5 = G | last6 = Bianchi| first6 = C.

'''''Astylosternus nganhanus''''' is a species of [[frog]] in the family [[Arthroleptidae]]. It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Cameroon]] and known from Mount Nganha on the [[Adamawa Plateau]];&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt; it is probably endemic to that area.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; Common name '''Nganha night frog''' has been coined for it.&lt;ref name=Frost/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt; This poorly known species is only known from five specimens.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

==Description==
Adult measure about {{convert|45|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in snout–vent length. The head is very narrow, triangular, and flattened in shape. The eyes are rather small and do not protrude greatly. The fingers are fairly short and slender. The hind-limbs are relatively short, and the toe tips are not dilates into discs. Skin is smooth, apart for some longitudinal fine wrinkles, in particular on the flanks. The colouration is dark with black patterning. The top of arms and fore-arms have large, raised black bumps. The thighs have only few markings. Dark pigmentation is also present under the throat and along the ventral surfaces.&lt;ref name=EDGE/&gt;

==Habitat and conservation==
''Astylosternus nganhanus'' occurs along watercourses in a few narrow gallery forests, and in seepage areas in the nearby grassland, at elevations of {{convert|1400|–|1700|m|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]]. [[Tadpole]]s probably belonging to this species have been found in rock pools in streams.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

This species, known from only a single population, is probably at severe risk from [[habitat loss]] caused by smallholder farming activities and subsistence wood extraction. It is not known to occur in any protected areas.&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt;

[[File:Monumental axis.jpg|thumb| Design of [[Brasília]] – influenced by The Athens Charter]]
The '''Athens Charter''' ({{lang-fr|Charte d'Athènes}}) was a 1933 document about [[urban planning]] published by the Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]]. The work was based upon Le Corbusier’s ''[[Ville Radieuse]]'' (Radiant City) book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the [[Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne]] (CIAM) in the early 1930s.

The Charter got its name from location of the fourth CIAM conference in 1933, which, due to the deteriorating political situation in Russia, took place on the S.S. Patris bound for [[Athens]] from [[Marseilles]]. This conference is documented in a film commissioned by Sigfried Giedion and made by his friend Laszlo Moholy-Nagy: "Architects' Congress."

The Charter had a significant impact on urban planning after World War II.

==Background==

Although Le Corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city, the [[Ville Contemporaine]] in the 1920s, during the early 1930s, after contact with international planners he began work on the Ville Radieuse (Radiant City). In 1930 he had become an active member of the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] movement and proposed the Ville Radieuse as a blueprint of social reform.

Unlike the radial design of the Ville Contemporaine, the Ville Radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head, spine, arms and legs. The design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks, free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work. Le Corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third CIAM meeting in [[Brussels]] in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=118}}

==The Functional City==

The concept of the Functional City came to dominate CIAM thinking after the conference in Brussels. At a meeting in [[Zürich]] in 1931, CIAM members Le Corbusier, [[Walter Gropius]], [[Siegfried Giedion]], Rudolf Steiger and [[Werner M. Moser]] discussed with [[Cornelis van Eesteren]] the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site. Van Eesteren had been chief architect of Amsterdam's Urban Development Section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main CIAM meeting planned to be in [[Moscow]] in 1933.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=59}} The theme for these studies would be the Functional City, that is, one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=25}}

Van Eesteren employed the city planner Theodor Karel van Lohuizen to use methods developed for the Amsterdam Expansion Plan, to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city. He relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by CIAM at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=60}}

At a special congress meeting in [[Berlin]] later in 1931 van Eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues. He presented three drawings of [[Amsterdam]]. The first at a scale of 1:10000 showed land use and density, the second showed transportation networks and the third, at 1:50000 showed the regional setting of the city. He also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling, work, recreation and transport. Based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within CIAM would prepare similar presentation boards for the Moscow meeting. A standard set of notation was agreed.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp=61-63}}

In 1932 Le Corbusier's [[Palace of the Soviets]] competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and, due to the political conditions in Russia, CIAM's agenda became increasingly ignored. A new venue for the fourth CIAM conference was required.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|pp71-72}}

==CIAM 4==

The fourth CIAM conference took place on board the S.S. Patris, an ocean-going liner journeying from Marseilles to Athens in July 1933.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=121}}

The national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies, presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities. In addition, Le Corbusier and the group who had met earlier in Zürich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the Functional City.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}}

On arrival in Athens on 3 August an exhibition of the Functional City boards was held at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] and inaugurated by Greece's prime minister. The boards were separated into seven categories: metropolises, cities of administration, ports, industrial cities, pleasure cities and cities of diverse function.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=81}} The delegates remained in Athens for a number of days, some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands. On 10 August they embarked on the return journey to Marseilles.

During meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the Functional City. Van Eesteren's original Amsterdam plan had, with greater resources, a basis formed by scientific data. The plans presented by the national groups did not have this and, despite Giedion's insistence, delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=85}} Eventually, two groups agreed on two separate texts: ''observations'' and ''resolutions''.

==The Athens Charter==
[[File:Highpoint detail.jpg|thumb|Highpoint 1 by Berthold Lubetkin]]
The ''observations'' taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles: living, working, recreation and circulation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=173}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
CIAM demanded that housing districts should occupy the best sites, and a minimum amount of solar exposure should be required in all dwellings. For hygienic reasons, buildings should not be built along transportation routes, and modern techniques should be used to construct high apartment building spaces widely apart, to free the soil for large green parks.

-Mumford, 2000, The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960, The MIT Press, p85
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas. Street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport. Finally, with regards to conservation, historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions.

The ''observations'' formed the basis of [[Josep Lluís Sert|Josep Lluís Sert's]] book ''Can our cities survive?'' and were incorporated in Le Corbusier's ''Athens Charter'' published in 1943. The ''resolutions'' formed part of Le Corbusier's book ''The Radiant City'' published in 1935.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=90}}

The text of the ''Athens Charter'' as published became an extension of the content of ''The Radiant City''{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=208}} and Le Corbusier significantly re-worded the original ''observations''. As well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based. This treatment made the Athens Charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the ''observations'' that were founded before on concrete references.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=156}} Despite its title, the Athens Charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the CIAM conference, which took place ten years earlier, but largely as an expression of Le Courbusier's individual concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archiv.gta.arch.ethz.ch/research/ciam-4-the-functional-city|title=Research Project — CIAM 4. The Functional City — gta Archives — Institute gta — ETH Zurich|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-war influence==
[[File:Rotterdam van nelle fabriek.jpg|thumb|Van Nelle Factory, Netherlands]]
The CIAM 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from Switzerland, France, England, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Greece, Finland, Denmark, Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Brazil and Canada.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=77}}

After ''The Radiant City'' was published in France in 1935, Le Corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes. These included plans for Antwerp, Paris, Moscow, Algiers and Morocco.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=91}}

In the Netherlands, CIAM delegates visited the [[Van Nelle Factory|Van Nelle factory]] designed in part by [[Mart Stam]] that was to have formed a larger part of a ''Functional City'' design.

CIAM 4 was the first congress that the influential [[MARS Group]] from England was represented. In 1935 MARS member [[Berthold Lubetkin]] and his practice, the [[Tecton Group]] completed  [[Highpoint I|Highpoint]] in Highgate, London. The project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan, eight dwellings per arm. Each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings.{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=94}}

In 1937 with the fall of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], Sert suggested that England and the United States may be the best place to focus CIAM's activities.

==Post-war influence==

The ''Athens Charter'' had a huge impact on planning thought after World War II.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=120}} However, its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s CIAM attempted to replace the Functional City described in the ''Charter'' with a different ''Charter of Habitat''.{{sfnp|Mumford|2000|p=268}}

===France===
[[File:Corbusierhaus B-Westend 06-2017.jpg|thumb|The Unité d'Habitation in Marseille]]
In 1946 Le Corbusier received a commission for projects in [[La Rochelle]] and St Dié. The urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the ''Charter'', but as part of the project he proposed eight [[Unité d'Habitation]] flanked by a civic centre.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=163}} Although these proposals were unbuilt, he had more success in Marseilles where an initial study for three Unités resulted in one being built. In line with the ''Charter'', the Unité was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland. There is a public 'street' on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops, offices and a hotel. On the roof there is a nursery school, a running track and a pool.{{sfnp|Jenkins|1999}} It opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete.{{sfnp|Curtis|2006|p=172}}

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Alton Estate Roehampton London.jpg|thumb|High rises part of the Alton Estate]]
[[File:Parkhill2.jpg|thumb|Parkhill Estate, Sheffield]]
The 1949 Housing Act in England paved the way for [[Local government|Local Authorities]] to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities, not just the working class. In the socialist post war atmosphere, architectural writer [[James Maude Richards|J M Richards]] praised Le Corbusier's Unité for "putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=8-10}}

Between 1952 and 1958 [[London County Council]] built the [[Alton Estate|Alton East]] and Alton West high-rise blocks in Roehampton. Alton East comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and Alton West was 1867 dwellings in 5, 6 and 12 storey blocks. Both projects are set within parkland and have since been [[Listed building|listed]].{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|pp=147-149}}

In Sheffield in 1958, the city architect, Lewis Womersley, designed the [[Park Hill, Sheffield|Park Hill Estate]]. The product of an entire [[slum clearance]], three times the size of the Unité, dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks. These 'streets in the air' are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and [[milk float]]s.{{sfnp|Banham|1978|pp=141-143}} Initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme. [[Harold Macmillan]] said it would "draw the admiration of the world".{{sfnp|Colquhoun|2008|p=13}}

In Scotland, the Department of Housing for Scotland encouraged Local Authorities to build more unified and open schemes. The ''Functional City'' prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland. This concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in Scottish cities. From 1956 the [[Gorbals|Hutchesontown Gorbals]] area of Glasgow was redeveloped. The architect [[Robert Matthew]] designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns.{{sfnp|MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie|1999|pp=105-108}}

The [[Golden Lane Estate|Golden Lane]] London, was designed by [[Chamberlin, Powell and Bon]], who also designed the [Barbican], adjacent. It has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings. Like the Unité it has a terrace on the roof.

The Smithsons (Alison and Peter Smithson) were against the four functions explored for the ''Functional City'', renaming them ''House'', ''Street'', ''District'' and ''City''. In the Golden Lane development the ''House'' became the family unit, the ''Street'' was an elevated access deck but the ''District'' and ''City'' lay outside the project's boundaries. Their work was never built at Golden Lane, but these ideas can be viewed in their book "Urban Structuring".

===The Americas===
[[File:Esplanadabsb12.jpg|thumb|Ministers Esplanade in Brasília]]
[[Lúcio Costa|Lúcio Costa's]] conception of the plan for [[Brasília]] saw the city as a manifestation of the Functional City. Like Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse, it was seen as a method of imposing order, progress and stability to Brazil's new capital. Like Le Corbusier, Costa and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=226}}

In a variation of the ''Functional City'', Sert designed married-student housing for [[Harvard University]] in 1964. Known as Peabody Terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes. It avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=292}}

===The rest of the world===

In Japan in 1957, [[Kunio Maekawa]] designed the Harumi Apartment block in Tokyo based upon the idea of the Unité. Meanwhile, In [[Tel Aviv]] in 1963 CIAM member [[Jacob B. Bakema]] designed a ''Functional City'' proposal based upon Le Corbusier's Algiers scheme.

==Criticism==
[[File:Pruitt-igoeUSGS02.jpg|thumb|[[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri]]
The [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing scheme in St Louis, Missouri was designed in accordance with CIAM ideals for the ''Functional City''. It was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award when it was built in 1951, but no evidence of such exists. [[Charles Jencks]] proclaimed that the death of [[Modern Architecture]] was on 15 July 1972 at 3.32pm when the Pruitt–Igoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite.{{sfnp|Jencks|1978|p=9}}

Architectural critic [[Reyner Banham]] was concerned that the supposed universality of the ''Charter'' concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of CIAM. The emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide, green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing.{{sfnp|Curtis|1991|p=208}}

In planning terms the ''Charter'' had set rigid geometries for urban planning, increasingly there became an awareness of words like 'neighbourhood', 'cluster' and 'association' that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=288}}

Even by 1954 during the [[Aix-en-Provence]] meeting of CIAM the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the Charter represented. This disillusionment would lead to the formation of [[Team 10|Team X]] at the [[Dubrovnik]] meeting of CIAM that would eventually lead to the breakup of the Conference as an organisation.{{sfnp|Curtis|1986|p=287}}

In the case of Brasília, whilst Niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces, his revised urban [[utopia]] became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=228}} In 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it. At its inauguration the city was branded a [[Kafkaesque]] Nightmare with an [[Orwellian]] environment.{{sfnp|Philippou|2008|p=247}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;
To reduce the matter to high density when no due attention was given to communal facilities was to court disaster; to create open space without greenery was to devalue the idea of the community living in nature. The imitations of the Unité usually involved such drastic omissions. Does this mean that the prototype should be blamed for the later disastrous variations?

−Curtis, 1986, Modern Architecture since 1900, Phaidon, p293
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Recent history==
In 2003 the [[ECTP-CEU|European Council of Spatial Planners]] wrote a new version of the Charter.

==Trivia==

[[J. G. Ballard|J. G. Ballard's]] book [[High Rise (novel)|''High Rise'']] is set in a 40 storey block set in parkland with other high-rises in central London. On the tenth floor is a wide concourse with supermarket, shops and gymnasium and a swimming pool. On the 35th floor there is a smaller swimming pool, a sauna and a restaurant. As the affluent tenants embark upon an orgy of destruction, Ballard tells the story of how the whole block slowly degenerates into chaos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">In [[information theory]], the '''bar product''' of two [[linear code]]s ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;C_1 \mid C_2 = \{ (c_1\mid c_1+c_2) : c_1 \in C_1, c_2 \in C_2 \}, &lt;/math&gt;

where (''a''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''b'') denotes the concatenation of ''a'' and ''b''. If the [[code word]]s in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are of length ''n'', then the code words in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are of length 2''n''.

The bar product is an especially convenient way of expressing the [[Reed–Muller code|Reed–Muller]] RM&amp;thinsp;(''d'',&amp;nbsp;''r'') code in terms of the Reed–Muller codes RM&amp;thinsp;(''d''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''r'') and RM&amp;thinsp;(''d''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1,&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;thinsp;&amp;minus;&amp;thinsp;1).

The bar product is also referred to as the |&amp;nbsp;'''''u'''''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;'''''u'''''+'''''v'''''&amp;nbsp;| construction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=F.J. MacWilliams | authorlink=Jessie MacWilliams |author2=N.J.A. Sloane | title=The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes | publisher=North-Holland | year=1977 | isbn=0-444-85193-3 | page=76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
or ('''''u'''''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;'''''u'''''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''''v''''') construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J.H. van Lint | title=Introduction to Coding Theory | edition=2nd | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics|GTM]] | volume=86 | year=1992 | isbn=3-540-54894-7 | page=47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

===Rank===
The [[dimension (vector space)|rank]] of the bar product is the sum of the two ranks:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{rank}(C_1\mid C_2) = \operatorname{rank}(C_1) + \operatorname{rank}(C_2)\,&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
Let &lt;math&gt; \{ x_1, \ldots , x_k \} &lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;C_1&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;\{ y_1, \ldots , y_l \} &lt;/math&gt; be a basis for &lt;math&gt;C_2&lt;/math&gt;. Then the set

&lt;math&gt;\{ (x_i\mid x_i) \mid 1\leq i \leq k \} \cup \{ (0\mid y_j) \mid 1\leq j \leq l \} &lt;/math&gt;

is a basis for the bar product &lt;math&gt;C_1\mid C_2&lt;/math&gt;.

===Hamming weight===
The [[Hamming weight]] ''w'' of the bar product is the lesser of (a) twice the weight of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and (b) the weight of ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;w(C_1\mid C_2) = \min \{ 2w(C_1) , w(C_2) \}. \,&lt;/math&gt;

====Proof====
For all &lt;math&gt;c_1 \in C_1&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;(c_1\mid c_1 + 0 ) \in C_1\mid C_2&lt;/math&gt;

which has weight &lt;math&gt;2w(c_1)&lt;/math&gt;. Equally

:&lt;math&gt; (0\mid c_2) \in C_1\mid C_2&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;c_2 \in C_2 &lt;/math&gt; and has weight &lt;math&gt;w(c_2)&lt;/math&gt;. So minimising over &lt;math&gt;c_1 \in C_1, c_2 \in C_2&lt;/math&gt; we have

:&lt;math&gt;w(C_1\mid C_2) \leq \min \{ 2w(C_1) , w(C_2) \} &lt;/math&gt;

Now let &lt;math&gt;c_1 \in C_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2 \in C_2&lt;/math&gt;, not both zero. If &lt;math&gt;c_2\not=0&lt;/math&gt; then:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
w(c_1\mid c_1+c_2) &amp;= w(c_1) + w(c_1 + c_2) \\
&amp; \geq w(c_1 + c_1 + c_2) \\
&amp; = w(c_2) \\
&amp; \geq w(C_2)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;c_2=0&lt;/math&gt; then

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
w(c_1\mid c_1+c_2) &amp; = 2w(c_1) \\
&amp; \geq 2w(C_1)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

so 

:&lt;math&gt;w(C_1\mid C_2) \geq \min \{ 2w(C_1) , w(C_2) \} &lt;/math&gt;

'''''Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials''''' (1979; second edition 1987) is a [[science fiction]] book by artist [[Wayne Barlowe]], with [[Ian Summers]] and [[Beth Meacham]] (who provided the text). It contains Barlowe's visualizations of different extraterrestrial life forms from various works of science fiction, with information on their planetary location or range, biology, and behaviors, in the style of a real field guide for animals. It was nominated for an [[American Book Award]] and for the 1980 [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]].

The second edition has an added foreword by [[Robert Silverberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barlowe | first = Wayne | title = Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials | publisher = [[Workman Publishing Company]] | location = New York | year = 1987 | isbn = 0-89480-500-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials'' received a mixed review from Wendy Bousfield in ''[[Library Journal]]''. Bousfield commented that the book's drawings were "colorful", but also "somewhat static and artificial-looking, with less vitality than the preparatory sketches from the artist's notebook included at the end." She also criticized the omission of "the facts of publication of the novels", but concluded that public libraries might still be interested in the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bousfield |first=Wendy |date= 1 January 1980|title=Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials (Book Review) |journal=Library Journal |page=190}}{{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}} &lt;/ref&gt; The book received a positive review from Claudia J. Morner in ''[[School Library Journal]]''. Morner praised the book's "colorful drawings" and "fold-out comparative size chart" showing the size of aliens relative to human beings. She concluded that it was a "fun browsing book" that would appeal to "young people fascinated by monsters" as well as to science fiction readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morner |first=Claudia J. |date= May 1980|title=Barlowe's Guide to Extra-Terrestials (Book) |journal=School Library Journal |pages=92-93}}{{subscription needed|via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Academic Search Complete}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Barlowe's work was nominated for an [[American Book Award]] and for the 1980 [[Hugo Award for Best Related Work]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1980-hugo-awards/ 1980 Hugo Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211163121/http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1980-hugo-awards/ |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liptak |first=Andrew |title=Wayne Barlowe's Illustrated Aliens |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/wayne-barlowes-illustrated-aliens/ |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=2017-02-16 |access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mass-spring-damper-bond-graph.png|thumb|266x266px|A simple [[mass–spring–damper]] system, and its equivalent bond-graph form]]

A '''bond graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphical representation]] of a physical [[Dynamical system|dynamic system]]. It allows the conversion of the system into a [[state-space representation]]. It is similar to a [[block diagram]] or [[signal-flow graph]], with the major difference that the arcs in bond graphs represent [[Undirected graph|bi-directional]] exchange of physical [[energy]], while those in block diagrams and signal-flow graphs represent [[Directed graph|uni-directional]] flow of information. Bond graphs are multi-energy domain (e.g. mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc) and domain neutral. This means a bond graph can incorporate multiple domains seamlessly.

The bond graph is composed of the "bonds" which link together "single port", "double-port" and "multi-port" elements (see below for details). Each bond represents the instantaneous flow of energy (''dE''/''dt'') or [[Power (physics)|power]]. The flow in each bond is denoted by a pair of variables called power variables, whose product is the instantaneous power of the bond. The power variables are broken into two parts: flow and effort. For example, for the bond of an electrical system, the flow is the current, while the effort is the voltage. By multiplying current and voltage in this example you can get the instantaneous power of the bond.

A bond has two other features described briefly here, and discussed in more detail below. One is the "half-arrow" sign convention. This defines the assumed direction of positive energy flow. As with electrical circuit diagrams and free-body diagrams, the choice of positive direction is arbitrary, with the caveat that the analyst must be consistent throughout with the chosen definition. The other feature is the "causality". This is a vertical bar placed on only one end of the bond. It is not arbitrary. As described below, there are rules for assigning the proper causality to a given port, and rules for the precedence among ports. Causality explains the mathematical relationship between effort and flow. The positions of the causalities show which of the power variables are dependent and which are independent.

If the dynamics of the physical system to be modeled operate on widely varying time scales, fast continuous-time behaviors can be modeled as instantaneous phenomena by using a [[hybrid bond graph]]. Bond graphs were invented by [[Henry Paynter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analysis and Design of Engineering Systems|date=1961|publisher=The M.I.T. Press|author=Paynter, Henry M.|ISBN=0-262-16004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tetrahedron of state ==
[[File:Tetrahedron-of-state.png|thumb|Tetrahedron of state]]
The tetrahedron of state is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The adjacent image shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.

Using the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if you wanted to find the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the ''f(t)'' and then integrate it to get ''q(t)''. More examples of equations can be seen below.

Relationship between generalized displacement and generalized flow.

&lt;math&gt;q(t) = \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized momentum.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \cdot p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized momentum and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized involving the constant C.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

All of the mathematical relationships remain the same when switching energy domains, only the symbols change. This can be seen with the following examples.

Relationship between displacement and velocity.

&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \int v(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between current and voltage, this is also known as [[Ohm's law]].

&lt;math&gt;i(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot V(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between force and displacement, also known as [[Hooke's law]]. It should be noted that the negative sign is dropped in this equation because the sign is factored into the way the arrow is pointing in the bond graph. 

&lt;math&gt;F(t) = k \cdot x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

== Components ==
If an engine is connected to a wheel through a shaft, the power is being transmitted in the rotational mechanical domain, meaning the effort and the flow are torque (τ) and angular velocity (ω) respectively. A word bond graph is a first step towards a bond graph, in which words define the components. As a word bond graph, this system would look like:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
A half-arrow is used to provide a sign convention, so if the engine is doing work when τ and ω are positive, then the diagram would be drawn:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
This system can also be represented in a more general method. This involves changing from using the words, to symbols representing the same items. These symbols are based on the generalized form, as explained above. As the engine is applying a torque to the wheel, it will be represented as a source of effort for the system. The wheel can be presented by an impedance on the system.  Further, the torque and angular velocity symbols are dropped and replaced with the generalized symbols for effort and flow. While not necessary in the example, it is common to number the bonds, to keep track of in equations. The simplified diagram can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle e_1}{\underset{\textstyle f_1}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Given that effort is always above the flow on the bond, it is also possible to drop the effort and flow symbols altogether, without losing any relevant information. However, the bond number should not be dropped. The example can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

The bond number will be important later when converting from the bond graph to state-space equations.

=== Single-port elements ===
Single port elements are elements in a bond graph that can have only one port.

==== Sources and sinks ====
Sources are elements that represent the input for a system. They will either input effort or flow into a system. They are denoted by a capital "S" with either a lower case "e" or "f" for effort or flow respectively. Sources will always have the arrow pointing away from the element. An examples of sources include: motors (source of effort, torque), voltage sources (source of effort), and current sources (source of flow).

&lt;math&gt;S_e \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
S_f \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J&lt;/math&gt;

Sinks are elements that represent the output for a system. They are represented the same way as sources, but have the arrow pointing into the element instead of away from it.

&lt;math&gt;J \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ S_e
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ S_f&lt;/math&gt;

==== Inertance ====
Inertance elements are denoted by a capital "I", and always have power flowing into them. Inertance elements are elements that store kinetic energy. Most commonly these are a mass for mechanical systems, and inductors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ I&lt;/math&gt;

==== Resistance ====
Resistance elements are denoted by a capital "R", and always have power flowing into them. Resistance elements are elements that dissipate energy. Most commonly these are a dampener, for mechanical systems, and resistors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ R&lt;/math&gt;

==== Capacitance ====
Capacitance elements are denoted by a capital "C", and always have power flowing into them. Capacitance elements are elements that store potential energy. Most commonly these are springs for mechanical systems, and capacitors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Two-port elements ===
These elements have two ports. They are used to change the power between or within a system. When converting from one to the other, no power is lost during the transfer. The elements have a constant that will be given with it. The constant is called a transformer constant or gyrator constant depending on which element is being used. These constants will commonly be displayed as a ratio below the element.

====Transformer====
A transformer applies a relationship between flow in flow out, and effort in effort out. Examples include an ideal electrical [[transformer]] or a [[lever]].

Denoted

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ TR\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{r:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''r'' denotes the modulus of the transformer. This means
: &lt;math&gt;f_1 \cdot r = f_2&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 \cdot r = e_1&lt;/math&gt;

====Gyrator====
A [[gyrator]] applies a relationship between flow in effort out, and effort in flow out. An example of a gyrator is a DC motor, which converts voltage (electrical effort) into Angular velocity (angular mechanical flow).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ GY\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{g:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 = g \cdot f_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_1 = g \cdot f_2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-port elements ===
Junctions, unlike the other elements can have any number of ports either in or out. Junctions split power across their ports. There are two distant junctions, the 0-junction and the 1-junction which differ only in the how effort and flow are carried across. It should be noted that the same junction in series can be combined, but different junctions in series cannot.

==== 0-junctions ====
0-junctions behave such that all efforts values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the flow values in equals the sum the flow values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ e's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum f_{in} = \sum f_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{0}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 = e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 + f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==== 1-junctions ====
1-junctions behave opposite of 0-junctions. 1-junctions behave such that all flow values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the effort values in equals the sum the effort values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ f's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum e_{in} = \sum e_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{1}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 = f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 + e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==Causality==
Bond graphs have a notion of causality, indicating which side of a bond determines the instantaneous effort and which determines the instantaneous flow. In formulating the dynamic equations that describe the system, causality defines, for each modeling element, which variable is dependent and which is independent.  By propagating the causation graphically from one modeling element to the other, analysis of large-scale models becomes easier.  Completing causal assignment in a bond graph model will allow the detection of modeling situation where an algebraic loop exists; that is the situation when a variable is defined recursively as a function of itself.

As an example of causality, consider a capacitor in series with a battery. It is not physically possible to charge a capacitor instantly, so anything connected in parallel with a capacitor will necessarily have the same voltage (effort variable) as the capacitor. Similarly, an inductor cannot change flux instantly and so any component in series with an inductor will necessarily have the same flow as the inductor. Because capacitors and inductors are passive devices, they cannot maintain their respective voltage and flow indefinitely&amp;#x2014;the components to which they are attached will affect their respective voltage and flow, but only indirectly by affecting their current and voltage respectively.

Note: Causality is a symmetric relationship. When one side "causes" effort, the other side "causes" flow.

In bond graph notation, a causal stroke may be added to one end of the power bond to indicate that the opposite end is defining the effort. Consider a constant-torque motor driving a wheel, i.e. a source of effort (''SE''). That would be drawn as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[b]{r}\text{motor}\\SE\end{array}\;
\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--

   motor      τ    \|
      SE  ----------| wheel
              ω     |
--&gt;

Symmetrically, the side with the causal stroke (in this case the wheel) defines the flow for the bond.

Causality results in compatibility constraints. Clearly only one end of a power bond can define the effort and so only one end of a bond can have a causal stroke. In addition, the two passive components with time-dependent behavior, ''I'' and ''C'', can only have one sort of causation: an ''I'' component determines flow; a ''C'' component defines effort. So from a junction, ''J'', the preferred causal orientation is as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;I
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
          \|
  J -------| I
           |

    |      \
  J |------- C
    |
--&gt;

The reason that this is the preferred method for these elements can be further analyzed if you consider the equations they would give shown by the tetrahedron of state.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting equations involve the integral of the independent power variable. This is preferred over the result of having the causality the other way, which results in derivative. The equations can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = I \cdot \dot{f}(t)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
f(t) = C \cdot \dot{e}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible for a bond graph to have a casual bar on one of these elements in the non-preferred manner. In such a case a "casual conflict" is said to have occurred at that bond. The results of a causal conflict are only seen when writing the [[state-space]] equations for the graph. It is explained in more details in that section.

A resistor has no time-dependent behavior: apply a voltage and get a flow instantly, or apply a flow and get a voltage instantly, thus a resistor can be at either end of a causal bond:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;R
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         \|               |       \
 J -------| R           J |-------- R
          |               |
--&gt;

Sources of flow (''SF'') define flow, sources of effort (''SE'') define effort. Transformers are passive, neither dissipating nor storing energy, so causality passes through them:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         | ..      |          |       .. |
   ------| TF -----|    or    |------ TF |------
         |         |          |          |
--&gt;

A gyrator transforms flow to effort and effort to flow, so if flow is caused on one side, effort is caused on the other side and vice versa:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
   |       ..      |                | .. |     
   |------ GY -----|    or    ------| GY |------
   |               |                |    |
--&gt;
; Junctions
In a 0-junction, efforts are equal; in a 1-junction, flows are equal. Thus, with causal bonds, only one bond can cause the effort in a 0-junction and only one can cause the flow in a 1-junction. Thus, if the causality of one bond of a junction is known, the causality of the others is also known. That one bond is called the 'strong bond'
: &lt;math&gt;\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\dashv\!\overset{\textstyle \top}{\underset{\textstyle\bot}{0}}\!\dashv
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\vdash\!\overset{\textstyle \bot}{\underset{\textstyle\top}{1}}\!\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
                 ___

=== Determining causality ===
In order to determine the causality of a bond graph certain steps must be followed. Those steps are:
# Draw Source Causal Bars
# Draw Preferred causality for C and I bonds
# Draw causal bars for 0 and 1 junctions, transformers and gyrators
# Draw R bond causal bars
# If a causal conflict occurs, change C or I bond to differentiation
A walk-through of the steps is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to draw causality for the sources, over which there is only one. This results in the graph below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the preferred causality for the C bonds.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1}&amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next apply the causality for the 0 and 1 junctions, transformers, and gyrators.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, it should be noted that there is an issue with 0-junction on the left. The 0-junction has two causal bars at the junction, but the 0-junction wants one and only one at the junction. This was caused by having &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C_2
&lt;/math&gt; be in the preferred causality. The only way to fix this is to flip that causal bar. This results in a causal conflict, the corrected version of the graph is below, with the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\star
&lt;/math&gt; representing the causal conflict.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft} \star    &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Converting from other systems ==
One of the main advantages of using bond graphs is that once you have a bond graph it doesn't matter the original energy domain. Below are some of the steps to apply when converting from the energy domain to a bond graph.

=== Electromagnetic ===
The steps for solving an Electromagnetic problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place an 0-junction at each node
# Insert Sources, R, I, C, TR, and GY bonds with 1 junctions
# Ground (both sides if a transformer or gyrator is present)
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Linear mechanical ===
The steps for solving an Linear Mechanical problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place 1-junctions for each distinct velocity (usually at a mass)
# Insert R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1 junctions where they act
# Insert Sources and I bonds on the 1 junctions where they act
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Simplifying ===
The simplifying step is the same regardless if the system was electromagnetic or linear mechanical. The steps are:
# Remove Bond of zero power (due to ground or zero velocity)
# Remove 0 and 1 junctions with less than three bonds
# Simplify parallel power
# Combine 0 junctions in series
# Combine 1 junctions in series
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Parallel power ===
Parallel power is when power runs in parallel in a bond graph. An example of parallel power is shown below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-example.png|frameless]]

Parallel power can be simplified, by recalling the relationship between effort and flow for 0 and 1-junctions. To solve parallel power you will first want to write down all of the equations for the junctions. For the example provided, the equations can be seen below. (Please make note of the number bond the effort/flow variable represents).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
f_1=f_2=f_3 &amp;  &amp; e_2=e_4=e_7 \\
e_1=e_2+e_3 &amp;  &amp; f_2=f_4+f_7 \\
            &amp;  &amp;             \\
e_3=e_5=e_6 &amp;  &amp; f_7=f_6=f_8 \\
f_3=f_5+f_6 &amp;  &amp; e_7+e_6=e_8
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By manipulating these equations you can arrange them such that you can find an equivalent set of 0 and 1-junctions to describe the parallel power.

For example because &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_3=e_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_2=e_7&lt;/math&gt; you can replace the variables in the equation &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_2+e_3&lt;/math&gt; resulting in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_6+e_7&lt;/math&gt; and since

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_6+e_7=e_8&lt;/math&gt;, we now know that &lt;math&gt;e_1=e_8&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship of two effort variables equaling can explained by an 0-junction. Manipulating other equations you can find that &lt;math&gt;f_4=f_5&lt;/math&gt; which describes the relationship of a 1-junction. Once you have determined the relationships that you need you can redraw the parallel power section with the new junctions. The result for the example show is seen below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-solved.png|frameless]]

=== Examples ===

==== Simple electrical system ====
A simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source, resistor, and capacitor in series.

[[File:Simple-RC-circuit.png|frameless]]

The first step is to draw 0-junctions at all of the node. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to add all of the elements acting at their own 1-junction. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; R &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\ 
    &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
S_e &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; C  \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; \underline{0} &amp; - &amp; - &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to pick a ground. The ground is simply an 0-junction that is going to be assumed to have no voltage. For this case, the ground will be chosen to be the lower left 0-junction, that is underlined above. The next step is to draw all of the arrows for the bond graph. The arrows on junctions should point towards ground (following a similar path to current). For resistance, inertance, and compliance elements, the arrows always point towards the elements. The result of drawing the arrows can be seen below, with the 0-junction marked with a star as the ground.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that we have the Bond graph, we can start the process of simplifying it. The first step is to remove all the ground nodes. Both of the bottom 0-junctions can be removed, because they are both grounded. The result is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|199x199px]]

Next, the junctions with less than three bonds can be removed. This is because flow and effort pass through these junctions without be modified, so they can be removed to allow us to draw less. The result can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|140x140px]]

The final step is to apply causality to the bond graph. Applying causality was explained above. The final bond graph is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|140x140px]]

==== Advanced electrical system ====
A more advanced electrical system with a current source, resistors, capacitors, and a transformer

[[File:Transformer-rc-circuit.png|frameless|464x464px]]

Following the steps with this circuit will result in the bond graph below, before it is simplified. The nodes marked with the star denote the ground.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|463x463px]]

Simplifying the bond graph will result in the image below.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|355x355px]]

Lastly, applying causality will result in the bond graph below. It should be noted that the bond with star denotes a causal conflict.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|348x348px]]

==== Simple linear mechanical ====
A simple linear mechanical system, consisting of a mass on a spring that is attached to a wall. The mass has some force being applied to it. An image of the system is shown below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-corrected.png|frameless|291x291px]]

For a mechanical system, the first step is to place a 1-junction at each distant velocity, in this case there are two distant velocities, the mass and the wall. It is usually helpful to label the 1-junctions for reference. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{mass} &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{wall} &amp;  &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1-junctions where they act. For this example there is only one of these bonds, the C bond for the spring. It acts between the 1-junction representing the mass and the 1-junction representing the wall. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;   
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to add the sources and I bonds on the 1-junction where they act. There is one source, the source of effort (force) and one I bond, the mass of the mass both of which act on the 1-junction of the mass. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_e:F(t)      &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp; - &amp; I:m           \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;  
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to assign power flow. Like the electrical examples, power should flow towards ground, in this case the 1-junction of the wall. Exceptions to this are R,C, or I bond, which always point towards the element. The resulting bond graph is below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that the bond graph has been generated, it can be simplified. Because the wall is grounded (has zero velocity), you can remove that junction. As such the 0-junction the C bond is on, can also be removed because it will then have less than three bonds. The simplified bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-2.png|frameless]]

The last step is to apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-3.png|frameless]]

==== Advanced linear mechanical ====
A more advanced linear mechanical system can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech.png|frameless]]

Just like the above example, the first step is to make 1-junctions at each of the distant velocities. In this example there are three distant velocity, Mass 1, Mass 2, and the wall. Then you connect all of the bonds and assign power flow. The bond can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|318x318px]]

Next you start the process of simplifying the bond graph, by removing the 1-junction of the wall, and removing junctions with less than three bonds. The bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mechanical-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|375x375px]]

It should be noted that there is parallel power in the bond graph. Solving parallel power was explained above. The result of solving it can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|370x370px]]

Lastly, apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|348x348px]]

== State equations ==
Once a bond graph is complete, it can be utilized to generate the [[state-space representation]] equations of the system. State-space representation is especially powerful as it allows complex multi-order [[Differential equation|differential]] system to be solved as a system of first-order equations instead. The general form of the state equation can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}} (t) = \textbf{A}\cdot \textbf{x}(t) + \textbf{B}\cdot \textbf{u}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt; is a column matrix of the [[state variable]]s, or the unknowns of the system. &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time derivative]] of the state variables. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;is a column matrix of the inputs of the system. And &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are matrices of constants based on the system. The state variables of a system are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; values for each C and I bond without a causal conflict. Each I bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; while each C bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if you have the bond graph shown below.

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

Would have the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{ x} }(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
\dot{p}_3(t) \\
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{x}(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
p_3(t) \\
q_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{ u} (t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
e_1(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrices of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are solved by determining the relationship of the state variables and their respective elements, as was described in the tetrahedron of state. The first step to solve the state equations, is to list all of the governing equations for the bond graph. The table below, shows the relationship between bonds and their governing equations.

For the example provided,

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

The governing equations are the following.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
input=e_1                                                                   &amp; eq. 1  \\
e_1=e_2+e_3+e_4                                                             &amp; eq. 2  \\
f_1=f_2=f_3=f_4                                                             &amp; eq. 3  \\
e_2=R_2 \cdot f_2                                                           &amp; eq. 4  \\
f_3 = \frac{1}{I_3} \int e_3 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac{1}{I_3} \cdot p_3  &amp; eq. 5  \\
f_4 \cdot r = f_5                                                           &amp; eq. 6  \\
e_5 \cdot r = e_4                                                           &amp; eq. 7  \\
e_5 = e_6= e_7                                                              &amp; eq. 8  \\
f_5=f_6+f_7                                                                 &amp; eq. 9  \\
e_6 = \frac{1}{C_5} \int f_6 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac {1}{C_6} \cdot q_6 &amp; eq. 10 \\
f_7 = \frac{1}{R_7} \cdot e_7                                               &amp; eq. 11
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be manipulated to yield the state equations. For this example, you are trying to find equations that relate &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

To start you should recall from the tetrahedron of state that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;starting with equation 2, you can rearrange it so that &lt;math&gt;e_3 = e_1 - e_2 - e_4&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; can be substituted for equation 4, while in equation 4, &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;f_3&lt;/math&gt;due to equation 3, which can then be replaced by equation 5. &lt;math&gt;e_4&lt;/math&gt; can likewise be replaced using equation 7, in which &lt;math&gt;e_5&lt;/math&gt;can be replaced with &lt;math&gt;e_6&lt;/math&gt; which can then be replaced with equation 10. Following these substituted yields the first state equation which is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t) = e_1(t) - \frac {R_2}{I_3} \cdot p_3(t) - \frac{r}{C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The second state equation can likewise be solved, by recalling that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t) = f_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The second state equation is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)=f_6(t)=\frac{r}{I_3}\cdot p_3(t) - \frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Both equations can further be rearranged into matrix form. The result of which is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{p}_3(t)\\ 
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
- \frac{R_2}{I_3} &amp; - \frac{r}{C_6}\\ 
 \frac{r}{I_3} &amp; -\frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_3(t)\\ 
q_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\ 
0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1(t)
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point the equations can be treated as any other [[state-space representation]] problem.

'''Boyer Glacier''' ({{Coord|73|18|S|167|21|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a short tributary [[glacier]] situated {{convert|10|nmi|km|0}} west of [[Index Point]] in the eastern part of the [[Mountaineer Range]]. It flows north into lower [[Mariner Glacier]], [[Victoria Land]]. It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey]] from surveys and from [[U.S. Navy]] air photos, 1960–64, and named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] for [[Jack W. Boyer]], a U.S. Navy radioman at [[Hallett Station]], 1962.&lt;ref name=gnis/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7515">In [[coding theory]], a '''constant-weight code''', also called an '''''m''-of-''n'' code''', is an [[error detection and correction]] code where all codewords share the same [[Hamming weight]].
The [[one-hot]] code and the '''balanced code''' are two widely used kinds of constant-weight code.

The theory is closely connected to that of [[Combinatorial design|designs]] (such as [[block design|''t''-design]]s and [[Steiner system]]s). Most of the work on this very vital field of [[discrete mathematics]] is concerned with ''binary'' constant-weight codes.

Binary constant-weight codes have several applications, including [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum|frequency hopping]] in [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]] networks.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;D. H. Smith, L. A. Hughes and S. Perkins (2006). "[http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_13/Abstracts/v13i1a2.html A New Table of Constant Weight Codes of Length Greater than 28]".  ''The Electronic Journal of Combinatorics'' '''13'''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most [[barcode]]s use a binary constant-weight code to simplify automatically setting the threshold.
Most [[line code]]s use either a constant-weight code, or a nearly-constant-weight [[paired disparity code]].
In addition to use as error correction codes, the large space between code words can also be used in the design of [[asynchronous circuit]]s such as [[delay insensitive circuit]]s.

Constant-weight codes, like [[Berger code]]s, can detect all unidirectional errors.

== ''A''(''n'', ''d'', ''w'') ==
The central problem regarding constant-weight codes is the following: what is the maximum number of codewords in a binary constant-weight code with length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, [[Hamming distance]] &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, and weight &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;? This number is called &lt;math&gt;A(n,d,w)&lt;/math&gt;.

Apart from some trivial observations, it is generally impossible to compute these numbers in a straightforward way. Upper bounds are given by several important theorems such as the [[first Johnson bound|first]] and [[second Johnson bound]]s,&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 526–527 of F. J. MacWilliams and N. J. A. Sloane (1979). ''The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes''.  Amsterdam: North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt; and better upper bounds can sometimes be found in other ways.  Lower bounds are most often found by exhibiting specific codes, either with use of a variety of methods from discrete mathematics, or through heavy computer searching.  A large table of such record-breaking codes was published in 1990,&lt;ref name="brouwer"&gt;A. E. Brouwer, James B. Shearer, N. J. A. Sloane and Warren D. Smith (1990). "A New Table of Constant Weight Codes".  ''IEEE Transactions of Information Theory'' '''36'''.&lt;/ref&gt; and an extension to longer codes (but only for those values of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; which are relevant for the GSM application) was published in 2006.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

== 1-of-''N'' codes ==
{{main|one-hot}}

A special case of constant weight codes are the one-of-''N'' codes, that encode &lt;math&gt;\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt; bits in a code-word of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; bits. The one-of-two code uses the code words 01 and 10 to encode the bits '0' and '1'. A one-of-four code can use the words 0001, 0010, 0100, 1000 in order to encode two bits 00, 01, 10, and 11.

Some of the more notable uses of one-hot codes include
[[biphase mark code]] uses a 1-of-2 code;
[[pulse-position modulation]] uses a 1-of-''n'' code;
[[address decoder]],
etc.

== Balanced code ==

In [[coding theory]], a '''balanced code''' is a [[binary numeral system|binary]] [[forward error correction]] code for which each codeword contains an equal number of zero and one bits. Balanced codes have been introduced by [[Donald Knuth]];&lt;ref name="knuth"&gt;{{cite journal|author=D.E. Knuth|title=Efficient balanced codes|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=32|issue=1|pages=51–53|date=January 1986|doi=10.1109/TIT.1986.1057136|url=http://www.costasarrays.org/costasrefs/knuth86efficient.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are a subset of so-called unordered codes, which are codes having the property that the positions of ones in a codeword are never a subset of the positions of the ones in another codeword. Like all unordered codes, balanced codes are suitable for the detection of all [[unidirectional error]]s in an encoded message. Balanced codes allow for particularly efficient decoding, which can be carried out in parallel.&lt;ref name="knuth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="optimal"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sulaiman Al-Bassam|author2=Bella Bose|title=On Balanced Codes|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=36|issue=2|pages=406–408|date=March 1990|doi=10.1109/18.52490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the more notable uses of balanced-weight codes include
[[biphase mark code]] uses a 1 of 2 code;
[[6b/8b encoding]] uses a 4 of 8 code;
the [[Hadamard code]] is a &lt;math&gt;2^k/2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;2^k&lt;/math&gt; code (except for the zero codeword),
the [[IEEE 1355#Slice: TS-FO-02|three-of-six]] code;
etc.

== ''m''-of-''n'' codes==

An '''''m''-of-''n'' code''' is a separable [[error detection]] code with a code word length of ''n'' bits, where each code word contains exactly ''m'' instances of a "one". A single bit error will cause the code word to have either {{nowrap|''m'' + 1}} or {{Nowrap|''m'' &amp;minus; 1}} "ones". An example ''m''-of-''n'' code is the [[Two-out-of-five code|2-of-5 code]] used by the [[United States Postal Service]].

The simplest implementation is to append a string of ones to the original data until it contains ''m'' ones, then append zeros to create a code of length ''n''.

Example:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ 3-of-6 code
|-
! Original 3 data bits !! Appended bits 
|-
|000 || 111 
|-
|001 || 110 
|-
|010 || 110
|-
|011 || 100
|-
|100 || 110
|-
|101 || 100
|-
|110 || 100
|-
|111 || 000
|-
|}

Some of the more notable uses of constant-weight codes, other than the one-hot and balanced-weight codes already mentioned above, include
[[Code 39]] uses a 3-of-9 code;
[[bi-quinary coded decimal]] code uses a 2-of-7 code,
the [[Two-out-of-five code|2-of-5 code]],
etc.

Since North India and Pakistan are coursed by a multiplicity of Himalayan rivers that divide the plains into ''doabs'' (i.e. regions between two rivers), the Indo-Gangetic plains consist of alternating regions of river, ''khadir'' and ''bangar''. The regions of the ''doabs''  near the rivers consist of low-lying, [[floodplains]], but usually very fertile ''khadir'' and the higher-lying land away from the rivers consist of ''bangar'', less prone to flooding but also less fertile on average.&lt;ref name="encybritt2010"&gt;{{Citation | title=Pakistan: Soils | author= | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010 | isbn= | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1404392/bhangar | quote=''... khaddar soils.

The '''Yamuna-Ganga Doab''' or '''Uttar Pradesh Doab''' designates the flat alluvial tract between the [[Ganges]] and [[Yamuna]] rivers extending from the [[Sivalik Hills]] to the two rivers' confluence at [[Allahabad]]. The region has an area of about 23,360 square miles (60,500 square km); it is approximately {{convert|500|mi|km|0}} in length and {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} in width.&lt;ref name=ymd1&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Ganges-Yamuna-Doab Ganges-Yamuna Doab], [[Encyclopedia Britannica]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans to send a spacecraft to Europa were initially conceived with projects such as ''[[Europa Orbiter]]'' and ''[[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]]'', in which a spacecraft would be injected into orbit around Europa. However, due to the strong impact of radiation from [[Magnetosphere of Jupiter|Jupiter's magnetosphere]] in Europan orbit, it was decided that it would be safer to inject a spacecraft into an elliptical orbit around Jupiter and make 45 close flybys of the moon instead. The mission began as a joint investigation between the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] and the [[Applied Physics Laboratory]].

The mission will complement [[ESA]]'s [[Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer]] launching in 2022, which will fly-by Europa twice and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] multiple times before moving into orbit around [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. Launching around the same time as the ''Europa Clipper'', the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer will have a cruise phase some three times as long.

The ''Europa Clipper'' orbiter will be built and manufactured with a scientific payload of nine instruments, contributed by the JPL, APL, [[Southwest Research Institute]], [[University of Texas]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[University of Colorado Boulder]].

==Objectives==
[[Image:EuropaClipper.jpg|thumb|200px|The concept to achieve global-regional coverage of Europa during successive flybys.]]
The goals of ''Europa Clipper'' are to explore Europa, investigate its [[Natural satellite habitability|habitability]] and aid in the selection of a landing site for the future [[Europa Lander (NASA)|Europa Lander]].&lt;ref name="Lander funding"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Europa Lander 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Science Potential from a Europa Lander |journal=Astrobiology | year=2013 |first=Robert T. |last=Pappalardo |first2=S. |last2=Vance |first3=F. |last3=Bagenal |first4=B.G. |last4=Bills |first5=D.L. |last5=Blaney |first6=D.D. |last6=Blankenship |first7=W.B. |last7=Brinckerhoff |first8=J.E.P. |last8=Connerney |volume=13 |issue=8 |pages=740–73 |doi=10.1089/ast.2013.1003 |pmid=23924246 |url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/ast.2013.1003 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |last9=Hand |first9=K.P. |last10=Hoehler |first10=T.M. |last11=Leisner |first11=J.S. |last12=Kurth |first12=W.S. |last13=McGrath |first13=M.A. |last14=Mellon |first14=M.T. |last15=Moore |first15=J.M. |last16=Patterson |first16=G.W. |last17=Prockter |first17=L.M. |last18=Senske |first18=D.A. |last19=Schmidt |first19=B.E. |last20=Shock |first20=E.L. |last21=Smith |first21=D.E. |last22=Soderlund |first22=K.M. |bibcode=2013AsBio..13..740P }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exploration is focused on understanding the three main requirements for life: liquid water, chemistry, and energy.&lt;ref name='ASC 2017'&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7943832/?part=1 Europa mission update: Beyond payload selection].

===Strategy===
[[File:Europa Clipper orbit away from Jupiter radiation.jpg|thumb|left|A wide orbit of Jupiter with several flybys of Europa will minimize radiation exposure and increase data transfer speed]]
Because Europa lies well within the harsh radiation fields surrounding Jupiter, even a radiation-hardened spacecraft in near orbit would be functional for just a few months.&lt;ref name="Kane 2014"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kane |first=Van |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/van-kane/20140826-europa-how-less-can-be-more.html |title=Europa: How Less Can Be More |work=Planetary Society |date=26 August 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another key limiting factor on science for a Europa orbiter is not the time the instruments can make observations. Rather, it is the time available to return data to Earth.&lt;ref name="Kane 2014"/&gt;  Most instruments can gather data far faster than the communications system can transmit it to Earth because there are a limited number of antennas available to receive the scientific data.&lt;ref name="Kane 2014"/&gt;

Studies by scientists from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory show that by performing several flybys with many months to return data, the ''Europa Clipper'' concept will enable a $2B mission to conduct the most crucial measurements of the cancelled $4.3B [[Jupiter Europa Orbiter]] concept.&lt;ref name="Kane 2014"/&gt; Between each of the flybys, the spacecraft will have seven to ten days to transmit data stored during each brief encounter. That will let the spacecraft have up to a year of time to transmit its data compared to just 30 days for an orbiter. The result will be almost three times as much data returned to Earth, while reducing exposure to radiation.&lt;ref name="Kane 2014"/&gt; The ''Europa Clipper'' will not orbit Europa, but instead orbit [[Jupiter]] and conduct 45 [[Planetary flyby|flyby]]s of Europa at altitudes from {{convert|25|to|2700|km|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} each during its 3.5-year mission.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Europa Clipper Mission Concept: |journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union |date=20 May 2014 |last=Phillips |first=Cynthia B. |last2=Pappalardo |first2=Robert T. |volume=95 |issue=20 |pages=165–167 |doi=10.1002/2014EO200002 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EO200002/pdf |accessdate=2014-10-01 |bibcode=2014EOSTr..95..165P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.wmflabs.org/makeref/ |title=Europa Clipper |work=NASA - JPL |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of the mission concept is that
the ''Clipper'' would use gravitational attraction from Europa, [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]] and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]] to change its trajectory, allowing the spacecraft to return
to a different close approach point with each flyby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014EO200002/pdf Europa Clipper Mission Concept: Exploring Jupiter's Ocean Moon] (PDF). Cynthis B. Phillips, and Robert T. Pappalardo. ''Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union'', Volume 95, Issue 20. 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Each flyby would cover a different sector of Europa in order to achieve a medium-quality global topographic survey, including ice thickness.&lt;ref name="FPE"&gt;{{cite news |first=Van |last=Kane |title=Europa Clipper Update |date=26 May 2013 |url=http://futureplanets.blogspot.com/2013/05/europa-clipper-update.html |work=Future Planetary Exploration }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Europa Clipper'' could conceivably flyby at low altitude through the plumes of water vapor erupting from the moon's icy crust, thus sampling its subsurface ocean without having to land on the surface and drill though the ice.&lt;ref name="March 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark 2014" /&gt;

The ''Europa Clipper'' will inherit tested technology of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'']] and [[Juno (spacecraft)|''Juno'']] Jupiter orbiters with regards to radiation protection. Shielding will be provided by 150 kilograms of [[titanium]]. To maximize its effectiveness, the electronics will be nested in the core of the spacecraft for additional radiation protection.&lt;ref name="FPE" /&gt;

==Design and construction==
===Power===
Both [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] and [[photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] power sources were assessed to power the orbiter.&lt;ref name= "Eremenko2014"&gt;A. Eremenko ''et al.'', "Europa Clipper spacecraft configuration evolution," ''2014 IEEE Aerospace Conference'', pp. 1–13, Big Sky, MT, March 1–8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although solar power is only 4% as intense at Jupiter as it is in Earth's orbit, powering a Jupiter orbital spacecraft by [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] was demonstrated by the [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno Mission]].  The alternative to solar panels was a [[Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator]], fueled with [[plutonium-238]].&lt;ref name="Phillips 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FPE" /&gt; The power source has already been demonstrated in the [[Mars Science Laboratory]] mission. Five units were available, with one reserved for the [[Mars 2020 rover mission]] and another as backup. In September 2013 it was decided that the solar array was the less expensive option to power the spacecraft, and on October 3, 2014, it was announced that solar panels were chosen to power ''Europa Clipper''. The mission's designers determined that solar was both cheaper than plutonium and practical to use on the spacecraft.&lt;ref name= "Eremenko2014"/&gt; Despite the increased weight of solar panels compared to plutonium-powered generators, the vehicle's mass had been projected to still be within acceptable launch limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spacenews.com/42121europa-clipper-opts-for-solar-power-over-nuclear/ | title=Europa Clipper Opts for Solar Power over Nuclear | first=Jeff | last=Foust | date=8 October 2014 | accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial analysis suggest that each panel will have a surface area of {{convert|18|sqm|sqft|abbr=on}} and produce 150 watts continuously when pointed towards the Sun while orbiting Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Solar panels"&gt;{{cite news |first=Casey |last=Dreier | title=NASA's Europa Mission Concept Rejects ASRGs – May Use Solar Panels at Jupiter Instead |date=5 September 2013 |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/2013/20130905-no-asrgs-for-europa.html |work=The Planetary Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Europa's shadow, batteries will enable the spacecraft to continue gathering data. However, [[ionizing radiation]] can damage solar panels. The ''Europa Clipper''{{'s}} orbit will pass through Jupiter's intense magnetosphere, which is expected to gradually degrade the solar panels as the mission progresses.&lt;ref name="FPE" /&gt; The solar panels will be provided by Airbus Defense and Space Netherlands.&lt;ref name=SextantMarch2018-Highlights&gt;{{cite newsletter |url=https://europa.nasa.gov/system/internal_resources/details/original/116_Europa-Clipper-Newsletter-External-vol2issue1_FINAL.pdf |title=Spacecraft Highlights |work=The Sextant – Europa Clipper Newsletter |publisher=[[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=3 |date=March 2018 |access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible secondary elements===
The ''Europa Clipper'' mission considers an extra mass of about 250&amp;nbsp;kg to carry an additional flight element.&lt;ref name="Benedetto 2016"/&gt; About a dozen proposals have been suggested, a few of which are described next:
;Nanosatellites
[[File:CubeSat in hand.jpg|thumb|1U [[CubeSat]] is a 10 cm (4 in) cube]]
Since the ''Europa Clipper'' mission may not be able to easily modify its orbital trajectory or altitude to fly through the episodic water [[Europa (moon)#Plumes|plumes]], scientists and engineers working on the mission have investigated deploying from the spacecraft several [[miniaturized satellite]]s of the [[CubeSat]] format, possibly driven by [[ion thruster]]s, to fly through the plumes and assess the habitability of Europa's internal ocean.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4330 |title=JPL Selects Europa CubeSat Proposals for Study |work=Jet Propulsion Laboratory |publisher=NASA |date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=2015-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some early proposals include ''Mini-MAGGIE'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/1928.pdf Mini-MAGGIE: CubeSat MAGnetism and Gravity Investigation at Europa.] (PDF) 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; ''DARCSIDE'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/smallsat/2016/S1BeyondLEO/4/ CubeSat Session I: Beyond LEO]. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jossonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Final-Thelen-A-Europa-CubeSat-Concept-Study-for-Measuring-Atmospheric-Density-and-Heavy-Ion-Flux.pdf A Europa CubeSat Concept Study for Measuring Atmospheric Density and Heavy Ion Flux]. Thelen, A. et al.

With propulsion, some nanosatellites could also be capable of entering orbit around Europa.&lt;ref name="FPE" /&gt;

;Secondary orbiters
;*''Biosignature Explorer for Europa''
:NASA is also assessing the release of an additional {{convert|250|kg|abbr=on}} probe called ''Biosignature Explorer for Europa'' (BEE), that would be equipped with a basic bi-propellant engine and cold gas thrusters to be more agile and responsive to the episodic activity on Europa and sample and analyze the water plumes for [[biosignature]]s and life evidence before they are destroyed by radiation.&lt;ref name="BEE 2016"/&gt; The BEE plume probe would be equipped with a proven [[mass spectrometer]] combined with [[gas chromatograph]] separation. It would also carry a UV plume targeting camera as well as visible and [[Infrared camera|IR cameras]] to image the active region with better resolution than the ''Clipper'' mother ship instruments.&lt;ref name="BEE 2016"/&gt; The BEE probe would fly through at 2–10&amp;nbsp;km altitude, then make a quick exit and perform its analysis far from the radiation belts.
;*''Europa Tomography Probe'' (ETP)
:A European proposal is an independent powered spacecraft equipped with a [[magnetometer]] that would orbit Europa on a polar orbit for at least six months. It would determine the deep interior structure of Europa and provide a good determination of the ice shell thickness and ocean depth, which arguably cannot be done accurately by multiple flybys.&lt;ref name="Benedetto 2016"/&gt;

;Impactor probes
:Some proposed impactor probe concepts include those by the Netherlands,&lt;ref name='Wurs 2017'&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11038-017-9508-7 An Impacting Descent Probe for Europa and the Other Galilean Moons of Jupiter].

;Flyby sample return
The ''Europa Life Signature Assayer'' (ELSA) concept by the University of Colorado consists of a probe that is flown as a secondary payload. ELSA would use a small impactor to create a plume of subsurface particles and catapult them to altitudes where it would be able to pass through to collect samples and analyze them on board.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20170002063.pdf TRAJECTORY AND NAVIGATION DESIGN FOR AN IMPACTOR MISSION CONCEPT] (PDF).

University of Colorado, Boulder. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A variation of this concept is the 1996 ''Ice Clipper'', which involves a 10&amp;nbsp;kg impactor that would be jettisoned from the main spacecraft to impact Europa, thereby creating a debris cloud in nearby space about 100&amp;nbsp;km altitude, subsequently sampled by a small spacecraft on a close flyby and use Europa's gravitational force for a free return trajectory.&lt;ref name='Jones 2016'&gt;[http://drewryanjones.com/assets/conf_paper_2016_no3.pdf Trajectories for Europa Flyby Sample Return] (PDF).

Proposal from NASA Ames Research Center to NASA HQ submitted 11 Dec 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection mechanism is tentatively considered to be [[Aerogel]] (similar to [[Stardust (spacecraft)|''Stardust'' mission]]).

===Add-on lander history ===
An early ''Europa Clipper'' concept called for including a stationary lander about 1 meter in diameter, perhaps about {{convert|230|kg|abbr=on}} with a maximum of {{convert|30|kg|abbr=on}} for instruments&lt;ref name="Lander funding"/&gt; plus propellant. Suggested instruments were a [[mass spectrometer]] and a [[Raman spectrometer]] to determine the chemistry of the surface.&lt;ref name="Lander funding"/&gt; The lander was proposed to be delivered to Europa by the main spacecraft and possibly require the [[Mars Science Laboratory#Sky crane|sky crane system]] for a high precision, soft landing near an active crevasse.&lt;ref name="lander 2015 concept"&gt;{{cite news |last=Berger |first=Eric |url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/11/attempt-no-landing-there-yeah-right-were-going-to-europa/ |title=Attempt no landing there? Yeah right—we’re going to Europa |work=ARS Technica |date=17 November 2015 |pages=1–3 |accessdate=2016-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lander would operate about 10 days on the surface using battery power.&lt;ref name="Lander funding"/&gt; In January 2016 it was determined that including the additional mass of a lander and detachable probes, meant the ''Europa Clipper'' may need be launched with NASA's [[Space Launch System]] (SLS) [[heavy lift launch vehicle]]&lt;ref name="2016 Funds"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lander funding"/&gt; that could arrive at Jupiter on a direct trajectory in less than three years.&lt;ref name="Phillips 2014"/&gt;

The ''Europa Clipper'' would take about three years to image 95% of the surface of Europa at about 50 meters per pixel. With this data, scientists could then find a suitable landing site.&lt;ref name="lander 2015 concept"/&gt; By one estimate, including a lander could add as much as $1 billion to the mission's cost.&lt;ref name="lander 2015 concept"/&gt;

;Separate launch
[[File:PIA21048 - Europa Lander Mission Concept (Artist's Rendering).jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of the separately launched Europa lander mission (2017 design)]]
It was determined that designing a system capable of landing on a surface about which very little is known, is too much risk, and that the ''Europa Clipper'' will lay the foundation for a future landing mission by performing detailed reconnaissance first.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/feature/nasa-receives-science-report-on-europa-lander-concept NASA Receives Science Report on Europa Lander Concept].

'''Evidence-based library and information practice''' (EBLIP) or '''evidence-based librarianship''' (EBL) is the application of the interdisciplinary approach known as [[evidence-based practice]] (EBP) to problems in the field of [[library and information science]] (LIS). This means that all practical decisions made within LIS should 1) be based on research studies and 2) that these research studies are selected and interpreted according to some specific norms characteristic for EBP. Typically such norms disregard theoretical studies and qualitative studies and consider quantitative studies according to a narrow set of criteria of what counts as evidence. If such a narrow set of methodological criteria are not applied, it is better instead to speak of ''research based library and information practice.'' &lt;ref name="HjorlandBirger"&gt;Hjørland, Birger (2011). Evidence based practice: An analysis based on the philosophy of science. ''Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology'', 62(7), 1301–1310.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Evidence-based practice in general has been characterised as a [[Positivism|positivist]] approach;&lt;ref name="HjorlandBirger" /&gt; EBLIP is therefore also a positivist approach to LIS.&lt;ref&gt;Hjørland, B. (2005). Empiricism, rationalism and positivism in library and information science. Journal of Documentation, 61(1), 130-155.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, EBLIP is an approach in contrast to other approaches to LIS. The use of statistical approaches known as [[meta-analysis]] to conclude what evidence has been reported in the literature is one among other methods which is typical for the evidence-based approach.

In 2002, Booth noted the three schools of EBILP had some commonalities, including the context of day-to-day decision-making, an emphasis on improving the quality of professional practice, a pragmatic focus on the 'best available evidence', incorporation of the user perspective, the acceptance of a broad range of quantitative and qualitative [[research design]]s, and access, either first-hand or second-hand, to the (process of) evidence-based
practice and its products.  He added one more, that EBILP is concerned with getting the best value for money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Booth |first1=Andrew |title=From EBM to EBL: Two Steps Forward or One Step Back? |journal=Medical Reference Services Quarterly |date=March 2002 |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=51–64 |doi=10.1300/J115v21n03_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of library and information science in EBP==
Evidence-based practice in general is based on a very thorough search of the scientific literature and a very thorough selection and analysis of the retrieved literature. A close familiarity with database searching is needed, and library and information professionals have important roles to play in this respect.  Therefore LIS professionals should be well suited to help professionals in other disciplines doing EBP. EBLIP is the application of this approach on LIS itself. It should be mentioned, however, that EBP started in medicine as evidence-based medicine (EBM) from which it spread to other fields. Only slowly and to a limited extent has EBP moved on to LIS. The EBLIP process can be applied to a variety of scenarios in LIS, including customer service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbott|first1=Wendy|title=Persuasive Evidence: Improving Customer Service through Evidence Based Librarianship|journal=Evidence based library and information practice|date=2006|volume=1|issue=1|pages=58–68|url=http://epublications.bond.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=library_pubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[collection development]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eldredge|first1=Jonathan|title=Evidence‐based librarianship: The EBL process|journal=Evidence‐based librarianship|date=2006|volume=24|issue=3|pages=341–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[library management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=Helen|last2=Cleeve|first2=Marigold|title=Embracing change: evidence‐based management in action|journal=Library Management|date=2008|volume=29|issue=3|pages=173–184|doi=10.1108/01435120810855304}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[information literacy]] instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Melissa|last2=Latham|first2=Don|last3=Armstrong|first3=Bonnie|title=Improving below-proficient information literacy skills: designing an evidence-based educational intervention|journal=College Teaching|date=2012|volume=60|issue=3|pages=104–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, quantitative methods are used in LIS research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=VanScoy |first1=Amy |last2=Fontana |first2=Cady |title=How reference and information service is studied: Research approaches and methods |journal=Library &amp; Information Science Research |date=April 2016 |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=94–100 |doi=10.1016/j.lisr.2016.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study revealed that professionals experienced evidence-based practice as variously: not relevant; learning from published research; service improvement; a way of being and as a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;https://eprints.qut.edu.au/32798/1/PIL_21_Ch13_201004.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Route of the Far Eastern party.png|thumb|upright=2|The route of the Far Eastern Party, from the Main Base at [[Cape Denison]] in the north-west, across the Mertz and [[Ninnis Glacier]]s, and return.
{{legend|blue|Mawson, Mertz and Ninnis, 10 November – 14 December 1912}}{{legend|red|Mawson and Mertz, 14 December 1912 – 8 January 1913}}{{legend|green|Mawson alone, 8 January – 8 February 1913}}]]

The '''Far Eastern Party''' was a sledging component of the 1911–14 [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], which investigated the previously unexplored coastal regions of Antarctica west of [[Cape Adare]]. Led by expedition commander [[Douglas Mawson]], the party aimed to explore the area far to the east of their main base in [[Adélie Land]], pushing about {{convert|500|mi}} towards [[Victoria Land]]. Accompanying Mawson were [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis]], a lieutenant in the [[Royal Fusiliers]], and the Swiss ski expert [[Xavier Mertz]]; the party used [[sledge dog]]s to increase their speed across the ice. Initially they made good progress, crossing two huge glaciers on their route south-east.

On 14 December 1912, with the party more than {{convert|311|mi}} from the safety of the main base at [[Cape Denison]], Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside broke through the snow lid of a [[crevasse]] and were lost. Their supplies now severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz turned back west, gradually shooting the remaining sledge dogs for food to supplement their scarce rations. As they crossed the first glacier on their return journey Mertz became sick, making progress difficult. After almost a week of making very little headway Mertz died, leaving Mawson to carry on alone.

For almost a month he pulled his sledge across the Antarctic, crossing the second glacier, despite an illness that increasingly weakened him. Mawson reached the comparative safety of Aladdin's Cave—a food depot {{convert|5.5|mi}} from the main base—on 1 February 1913, only to be trapped there for a week while a [[blizzard]] raged outside. As a result, he missed the ship back to Australia; the [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] had sailed on 8 February, just hours before his return to Cape Denison, after waiting for more than three weeks. With a relief party, Mawson remained at Cape Denison until the ''Aurora'' returned the following summer in December 1913.

The causes of Mertz's death and Mawson's related illness remain uncertain; a 1969 study suggested [[hypervitaminosis A]], presumably caused by the men eating the livers of their [[Greenland Dog|Greenland Huskies]], which are now known to be unusually high in [[vitamin A]]. While this is considered the most likely theory, dissenting opinions suggest prolonged cold exposure or psychological stresses. In 1976 explorer and mountaineer [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] described Mawson's month-long journey as "probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration".&lt;ref name="Bickel p. x"&gt;Edmund Hillary (1976) in Bickel (2000), p. ''x''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Final photograph of the Far Eastern party.jpg|thumb|The last photograph taken of the Far Eastern Party, by [[Archibald Lang McLean]] of the Eastern Coastal Party, after the parties separated on 17 November 1912]]

The [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], commanded by [[Douglas Mawson]], explored part of [[East Antarctica]] between 1911 and 1914. The expedition's main base was established in January 1912 at [[Cape Denison]] in [[Commonwealth Bay]], [[Adélie Land]].&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 63"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; This was much farther west than originally intended; dense [[Drift ice|pack ice]] had prevented the expedition ship [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] from landing closer to [[Cape Adare]], the original eastern limit.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 43"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Only after the ''Aurora''—heading west—had rounded the ice tongue of the [[Mertz Glacier]]{{refn|For simplicity, this article refers to the Mertz and [[Ninnis Glacier]]s by the names given to them following the expedition. During the expedition itself they remained unnamed.|group="nb"}} was a landing made.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 63"/&gt;

Battling [[katabatic wind]]s that swept down from the [[Antarctic Plateau]], the shore party erected their hut and began preparations for the following summer's sledging expeditions.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 63"/&gt; The men readied clothing, sledges, tents and rations,{{refn|The men's sledging rations consisted mainly of [[pemmican]] and [[plasmon biscuit]]s, which could be ground, mixed with water and boiled to make a stew or soup known as [[hoosh]]. Added to the rations were basics such as butter, chocolate and tea; the daily ration was set at around {{convert|34|oz}} per man.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 88-89"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 88–89&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} conducted limited survey parties, and deployed several caches of supplies.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 67"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 87"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these depots was Aladdin's Cave, excavated from the ice on the slope {{convert|5.5|mi}} to the south of the main hut.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 90"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 October 1912 Mawson outlined the summer sledging program.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 98"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Of the seven sledging parties that would depart from Cape Denison, three would head east. The Eastern Coastal Party, led by the geologist [[Cecil Madigan]], was charged with exploring beyond the Mertz Glacier tongue;&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 135"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; they would initially be supported by the Near Eastern Party led by [[Frank Leslie Stillwell|Frank Stillwell]], which would then turn to mapping the area between Cape Denison and the glacier.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 99"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

The final party, led by Mawson, would push rapidly inland to the south of the Coastal Party towards [[Victoria Land]], an area he had explored during [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Nimrod Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]] in 1908–09. He hoped to travel about {{convert|500|mi}} east, collecting geological data and specimens, mapping the coast, and claiming territory for the crown.&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 78-79"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt;

Assisting him on this Far Eastern Party would be [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis]], a lieutenant in the [[Royal Fusiliers]], and the Swiss ski expert [[Xavier Mertz]].&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 78-79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 42"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; They were in charge of the expedition's [[sledge dogs]]—[[Greenland Dog|Greenland Huskies]]—who would be crucial if the party was to cover the distance at the speed Mawson intended. Ninnis and Mertz had spent the winter preparing the dogs for the journey, sewing harnesses and teaching them to run in teams with the sledges.{{refn|There was division as to which method of securing the dogs to the sledge was best; Mawson favoured the [[Yukon]] method, whereby the dogs were arranged in pairs, attached to a single line, with a man pulling in front, while Ninnis and Mertz preferred the [[Eskimo]] method, where the dogs were arranged in a fan-shape. Ninnis recorded that Mawson was concerned that in [[crevasse]]d country the Eskimo method would mean "the whole show—sledges, dogs and men—would be more likely to go down [into a crevasse] together, whereas by the [Yukon] method only the man would go, and could be hoicked out again." While Ninnis continued to express his reservations about the Yukon method—chiefly that the lines easily became tangled and the long line put the farthest dogs out of range of the whip—by late October Mawson had settled on the technique, and Ninnis and Mertz devoted their time to accustoming the dogs.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 107"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 67"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 77"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the parties was required to return to Cape Denison by 15 January 1913, to allow time for the ''Aurora'' to collect them and escape Antarctic waters unencumbered by the winter sea ice.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 81"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;

== Journey eastwards ==
[[File:Douglas Mawson resting.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Mawson rests on one of the sledges at Aladdin's Cave during the outward journey]]
Blizzards prevented the parties from leaving Cape Denison until 10 November 1912, four days after the scheduled start date. In his diary, Mertz recorded the clearing weather as "definitely a good omen".&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 70"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson wrote a short letter to his fiancée, Paquita Delprat:

{{quote|The weather is fine this morning though the wind still blows. We shall get away in an hour's time. I have two good companions, Dr Mertz and Lieut. Ninnis. It is unlikely that any harm will happen to us, but should I not return to you in Australia, please know that I truly loved you. I must be closing now as the others are waiting.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 70"/&gt;}}

Allowing Madigan and Stillwell's parties a head-start, Mawson, Ninnis, Mertz and the seventeen dogs left Cape Denison early in the afternoon, reaching Aladdin's Cave four hours later.&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 86-87"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 103"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Stopping for the night, they took on extra supplies and rearranged the sledges. The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half the weight of the party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.{{refn|Mawson calculated the weight of the supplies (including sledges) at {{convert|1723|lb}}, of which food (for humans and dogs) and fuel made up {{convert|1260|lb}}.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 87"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 103"/&gt;

Heading south the following day to avoid [[crevasse]]s to the east, they travelled about {{convert|8|mi}} before poor weather forced them to stop and camp. Strong winds confined them to the tent until 13 November, and they were able to travel just a short distance before the weather picked up again. For three more days they remained in their tent, unable even to light the stove.&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 90-91"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; When the weather cleared on 16 November, Madigan and Stillwell's parties joined them.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 105"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The three parties travelled together for much of the following day, before Mawson's party separated and pushed on ahead in the late afternoon.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 92"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers ===
Heading south-east towards the Mertz Glacier, with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis driving the dogs, the party covered {{convert|15|mi}} on 18 November.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 106-107"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite encountering [[sastrugi]]—ridges in the ice caused by wind—as high as {{convert|3|ft|cm}}, that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 96"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 132"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; During the day they passed two peaks, which Mawson named [[Madigan Nunatak]] and [[Aurora Peak]], after the leader of the Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition's ship.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 106"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier. After the sledges several times overtook the dogs, the huskies were allowed to run free down the slope.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 108"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a particularly steep descent the following day, half of Mawson's team of dogs—reattached to his sledges—were almost lost when they fell into a crevasse. They were hauled out, but Mawson decided to camp when one of the dogs, Ginger Bitch, gave birth to the first in a litter of fourteen pups.{{refn|Mawson's diary on 21 November records "Dogs fed with Jappy [one of the other dogs, killed the previous day] and pups".&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 134"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson biographer Philip J. Ayres suggests the sledge dogs' consumption of the pups was "normal in these conditions".&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 72"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 99-100"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 99–100&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several days, the party continued across the glacier. They developed a method of crossing the many crevasses; the forerunner, on skis, would cross the snow covering the hole (the lid), and once across the first of the two dog teams would follow. Only after the first dog team was across would the second follow, "otherwise", wrote Mawson, "the dogs in the rear would make a course direct for wherever the front dogs happened to be, cutting across corners and probably dragging their sledge sideways into a crevasse".&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 109-110"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; But despite their precautions Ninnis fell down and was rescued from three crevasses, once when they found they had pitched their tent on its lip.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 108-109"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

After Mawson slipped into a crevasse, they began to tie themselves to their sledges as a precaution.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 102"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Ninnis developed [[photokeratitis]] (snow-blindness), which Mawson treated with [[zinc sulfate]] and [[cocaine hydrochloride]].&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 146"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; They were also losing dogs; one broke his leg and was shot, another fell ill, and a third was lost down a crevasse.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 101"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, the party reached the eastern side of the glacier and ascended to the plateau.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 151"&gt;Mawson (1996), p. 151&lt;/ref&gt;

On level ground again, they began to make quick progress. They awoke on the morning of 27 November to find another glacier (later known as the [[Ninnis Glacier]]) far larger than the first.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 105"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 110"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; As with the first glacier, they had to unhitch the dogs from the sledges and slowly make the treacherous descent. Once at the bottom of the glacier they spent four days crossing fields of crevasses, battling strong winds and poor light that made navigation difficult.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 110-111"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;

In the harsh conditions, the dogs began to grow restless; one of them, Shackleton, tore open the men's food bag and devoured a {{convert|2.5|lb|adj=on}} pack of butter, crucial for their nourishment to supplement the [[hoosh]].&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 106"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 November, the party reached the eastern limit of the glacier and began the ascent to the plateau beyond, only to find themselves confronted at the top by [[sastrugi]] so sharp-edged the dogs were useless.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 107"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still, temperatures rose to {{convert|1|°C}}, melting the snow and making pulling difficult; the party switched to travelling at night to avoid the worst of the conditions.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 112"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

From atop the ridge on the eastern side of the Ninnis Glacier, Mawson began to doubt the accuracy of the reports of land to the east by [[Charles Wilkes]] during the 1838–42 [[United States Exploring Expedition]].&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 112"/&gt; By Wilkes' reckoning, Mawson recorded in his diary, "We now appear to be off the real continent edge."&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 140"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Concerned about overlap with Madigan's party to the north, he turned his party south. They made good progress initially, but beginning on 6 December a blizzard confined them to their tent for three days.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 112"/&gt; On 9 December, they set off again, but Ninnis was struggling. He had developed [[neuralgia]] on the left side of his face and a [[whitlow]] on one of his fingers. The latter was making sleep difficult for him, and on 13 December Mawson lanced the finger.&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 109-112"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 109–112&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of Ninnis ===
[[File:B. E. S. Ninnis.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Ninnis, in his Royal Fusilier uniform before the expedition. "We could do nothing," wrote Mertz in his diary after Ninnis' death. "We were standing, helplessly, next to a friend's grave, my best friend of the whole expedition."&lt;ref name="Catastrophe"&gt;{{cite web

On the evening of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge;&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 113"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 115"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 113"/&gt; At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and a tent cover, without the floor or poles.&lt;ref name="Hall and Scanlan, p. 126"&gt;Hall and Scanlan (2000), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

By noon the next day they had covered {{convert|311|mi}} from the Cape Denison hut.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 72"/&gt; Mertz was ahead on skis, breaking trail. Mawson sat on the first sledge; Ninnis walked beside the second.&lt;ref name="Hall and Scanlan, p. 126"/&gt; In his diary that night, Mertz recounted:

{{quote|Around 1&amp;nbsp;pm, I crossed a crevasse, similar to the hundred previous ones we had passed during the last weeks. I cried out "crevasse!", moved at right angle, and went forward. Around five minutes later, I looked behind. Mawson was following, looking at his sledge in front of him. I couldn't see Ninnis, so I stopped to have a better look. Mawson turned round to know the reason I was looking behind me. He immediately jumped out of his sledge, and rushed back. When he nodded his head, I followed him, driving back his sledge.&lt;ref name="Catastrophe"/&gt;}}

Ninnis, his sledge and dog team had fallen through a crevasse {{convert|11|ft}} wide with straight, ice walls.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 148"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; On a ledge deep in the hole, Mawson and Mertz could see the bodies of two dogs—one still alive, but seriously injured—and the remains of Ninnis' sledge. There was no sign of their companion.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 119"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; They measured the distance to the ledge as {{convert|150|ft}}, too far for their ropes to reach.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 73"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; "Dog ceased to moan shortly", wrote Mawson in his diary that night. "We called and sounded for three hours, then went a few miles to a hill and took position observations. Came back, called &amp; sounded for an hour. Read the burial service."&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 148"/&gt;

== Return ==
Along with the heavy-weather tent, most of their own food and all of the dogs' food, they had lost the [[pickaxe]], the shovel, and Mertz's [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] overpants and helmet. On Mawson's sledge they had their stove, fuel, [[sleeping bag]]s, and ten days' worth of food.&lt;ref name="Hall and Scanlan, p. 126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 121"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Their best immediate hope was to reach the camp of two days earlier where they had left the abandoned sledge and supplies, {{convert|15|mi}} west. They reached it in five-and-a-half-hours, where Mertz used the tent cover, with the runners from the abandoned sledge and a ski as poles, to erect a shelter.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 74"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

They were faced with two possible routes back to Cape Denison. The first option was to make for the coast, where they could supplement their meagre supplies with [[seal meat]], and hope to meet with Madigan's party; that would considerably lengthen the journey, and the sea ice in summer could not be relied on. Or, pushing slightly to the south of their outward route, they could hope to avoid the worst of the crevasses and aim for speed.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 74-75"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson chose the inland route, which meant that in the absence of fresh seal meat they would have to resort to [[dog meat|eating their remaining dogs]].&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 75"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The first dog—George—was killed the following morning, and of his meat some was fried for the men and the rest fed to the now starving dogs. "On the whole it was voted good" wrote Mawson of the meat, "though it had a strong, musty taste and was so stringy that it could not be properly chewed".&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 121"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xavier Mertz.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Mertz, photographed before the expedition]]

Before setting off again they raised the flag—which they had forgotten to do at their furthest point—and claimed the land for the crown.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 75"/&gt; With the temperature rising, they switched to travelling at night to take advantage of the harder surface the cold provided.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 121"/&gt; With the five remaining dogs, Mawson and Mertz pushed on. Starving, the dogs began to struggle; two more—Johnson and Mary—were shot and divided between men and dogs over the following days.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 148"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson and Mertz found most of the meat tough, but enjoyed the liver; it, at least, was tender.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 121"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; With the pulling power of the dogs now severely depleted, Mertz stopped making trail and instead helped Mawson to pull the sledge. Despite the challenges, they made good progress; in the first four nights they travelled {{convert|60|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 147"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; As they approached the Ninnis Glacier on 21 December, Haldane—once the largest and strongest of the dogs—was shot.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 152"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 123–124"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of Mertz ===
Both men were suffering, but Mertz in particular started to feel ill. He complained of stomach pains, and this began to slow them down.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 153"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Pavlova was killed, leaving only one remaining dog. Mawson decided to lighten their sledge, and much of the equipment—including the camera, photographic films, and all of the scientific equipment save the [[theodolite]]—was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 125"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 December, the day they cleared the Ninnis Glacier, the last dog was killed. Mawson recorded: "Had a great breakfast off Ginger's skull—thyroids and brain".&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 155"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 127"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later Mawson recorded that Mertz was "off colour"; Mertz wrote that he was "really tired [and] shall write no more".{{refn|Mertz's last entry in his diary was on 1 January, a week before his death. After he died, Mawson tore the remaining blank pages from the diary to save weight.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 76"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 76"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 156"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

They made {{convert|5|mi}} on 31 December, no progress for the following two days, and 5&amp;nbsp;miles more on 3 January. "[The] cold wind frost-bit Mertz's fingers" recorded Mawson, "and he is generally in a very bad condition. Skin coming off legs, etc—so had to camp though going was good."&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 156"/&gt; Not until 6 January did they make any more progress; they went {{convert|2|mi}} before Mertz collapsed.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 76-77"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt; The following day Mawson placed Mertz onto the sledge in his sleeping bag and continued, but was forced to stop and camp when Mertz's condition again deteriorated. Mawson recorded:

{{quote|He is very weak, becomes more and more delirious, rarely being able to speak coherently. He will eat or drink nothing. At 8&amp;nbsp;pm he raves &amp; breaks a tent pole. Continues to rave &amp; call 'Oh Veh, Oh Veh' [''O weh!'', 'Oh dear!'] for hours. I hold him down, then he becomes more peaceful &amp; I put him quietly in the bag. He dies peacefully at about 2&amp;nbsp;am on morning of 8th.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 158"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 77"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Strong winds prevented Mawson from continuing for two days. Instead, he prepared for travelling alone, removing the rearmost half from the sledge, and rearranging its cargo. To save having to carry excess [[kerosene]] for the stove, he boiled the remainder of the dog meat. Dragging Mertz's body in the sleeping bag from the tent, Mawson constructed a rough cairn from snow blocks to cover it, and used two spare beams from the sledge to form a cross, which he placed on the top. The following day he read the burial service.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 131–133"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 131–133&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alone ===
[[File:Mawson's half sledge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Mawson's half sledge, which he used during the final stage of the journey]]
As the weather cleared on 11 January, Mawson continued west, estimating the distance back to Cape Denison at {{convert|100|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 158"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 79"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled 2&amp;nbsp;miles before pain in his feet forced him to stop; he found that the soles of his feet had separated as a complete layer. Applying [[lanolin]] to his feet and wrapping them in several pairs of socks under his boots, he continued.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 135"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; "My whole body is apparently rotting from lack of nourishment" he recorded, "frost-bitten fingertips festering, mucous membrane of nose gone, saliva glands of mouth refusing duty, skin coming off whole body".&lt;ref name="Mawson p. 159"&gt;Mawson (1988), p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Averaging around 5&amp;nbsp;miles a day, he began to cross the Mertz Glacier. On 17 January he broke through the lid of a crevasse, but the rope around his waist held him to the sledge and halted his fall.&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 198-199"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 198–199&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I had time to say to myself "So this is the end" [Mawson recorded], expecting every moment the sledge to crash on my head and both of us to go to the bottom unseen below. Then I thought of the food left uneaten in the sledge—and, as the sledge stopped without coming down, I thought of Providence again giving me a chance. The chance looked very small as the rope had sawed into the overhanging lid, my finger ends all damaged, myself weak&amp;nbsp;... With the feeling that Providence was helping me I made a great struggle, half getting out, then slipping back again several times, but at last just did it. Then I felt grateful to Providence&amp;nbsp;... who has so many times already helped me.&lt;ref name="Mawson pp. 161–162"&gt;Mawson (1988), pp. 161–162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 79–80"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To save himself from future crevasses, Mawson constructed a rope ladder, which he carried over his shoulder and was attached to the sledge. It paid off almost immediately, and twice in the following days it allowed him to climb from crevasses.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 139"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Once out of the Mertz Glacier his mileage increased, and on 28 January Madigan Nunatak came into view. The following day, after travelling 5&amp;nbsp;miles, a cairn covered with black cloth appeared about {{convert|300|yd}} to his right. In it he found food and a note from [[Archibald Lang McLean]], who along with [[Frank Hurley]] and [[Alfred Hodgeman]] had been sent out by ''Aurora'''s captain [[John King Davis]] to search for the Far Eastern Party.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 81"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 215"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 215&lt;/ref&gt;

From the note, Mawson learned he was {{convert|21|mi}} south-east of Aladdin's Cave, and near two further food depots. The note also reported on the other parties of the expedition—all had returned to the hut safely—and on [[Roald Amundsen]]'s [[Amundsen's South Pole expedition|attainment of the South Pole]] in December 1911.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 81"/&gt; The cairn had been left there just six hours before, when the three men had returned to the hut.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 142"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Struggling on his injured feet and lacking [[crampons]] (he had thrown his away after he crossed the Mertz Glacier), Mawson took three days to reach Aladdin's Cave.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 81"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 143"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Although supplies had been left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases.&lt;ref name="Bickel pp. 229–230"&gt;Bickel (2000), pp. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 144"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed up the hill to meet him.&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 82"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Douglas Mawson recuperating.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Mawson shortly after his return to Cape Denison]]
The ''Aurora'' arrived at Cape Denison on 13 January 1913. When Mawson's party failed to return, Davis sailed her east along the coast as far as the Mertz Glacier tongue, searching for the party. Finding no sign and reaching the end of the navigable ice-free water, they returned to Cape Denison. The oncoming winter concerned Davis, and on 8 February—just hours before Mawson's return to the hut—the ship departed Commonwealth Bay, leaving six men behind as a relief party. Upon Mawson's return, the ''Aurora'' was recalled by [[wireless]] radio, but powerful [[katabatic wind]]s sweeping down from the plateau prevented the ship's boat from reaching the shore to collect the men.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 86–87"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Aurora'' returned to Cape Denison the following summer, in mid-December, to take the men home.&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 257"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The delay may have saved Mawson's life; he later told [[Phillip Law]], then-director of [[Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions]] (ANARE), that he did not believe he could have survived the sea journey so soon after his ordeal.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 154"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause of Mawson and Mertz's illnesses remains in part a mystery. At the time, McLean—the expedition's chief surgeon and one of the men who had remained at Cape Denison—attributed their sickness to [[colitis]]; Mawson wrote in ''The Home of the Blizzard'', his official account of the expedition, that Mertz died of fever and [[appendicitis]].&lt;ref name="Bickel p. 259"&gt;Bickel (2000), p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 136"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; A 1969 study by [[John Burton Cleland|Sir John Cleland]] and [[Ronald Vernon Southcott|R. V. Southcott]] of the [[University of Adelaide]] concluded that the symptoms Mawson described—hair, skin and weight loss, [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], [[dysentery]] and persistent skin infections—indicated the men had suffered [[hypervitaminosis A]], an excessive intake of [[vitamin A]]. This is found in unusually high quantities in the livers of Greenland Huskies, of which both Mertz and Mawson consumed large amounts.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 136"/&gt;

While hypervitaminosis A is the generally accepted medical diagnosis for Mertz's death and Mawson's illness, the theory has its detractors.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh p. 137"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Law believed it was "completely unproven ... The symptoms that were described are exactly the ones you get from cold exposure. You don't have to predicate a theory of this sort to explain the soles coming off your feet."&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 80–81"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 article in ''[[The Medical Journal of Australia]]'' by Denise Carrington-Smith suggested it may have been "the psychological stresses related to the death of a close friend and the deaths of the dogs he had cared for", and a switch from a predominately vegetarian diet that killed Mertz, not hypervitaminosis A.&lt;ref name="Carrington-Smith p. 641"&gt;Carrington-Smith (2005), p. 641&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis.jpg|thumb|upright=1|The memorial cross erected at Cape Denison in 1913 for Mertz and Ninnis]]
Suggestions of [[cannibalism]]—that Mawson may have eaten Mertz after his death—surfaced during Mawson's lecture tour of the United States following the expedition. Several reports in American newspapers quoted Mawson as saying he considered eating Mertz, but these claims were denied by Mawson, who labelled them "outrageous" and an "invention".&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 131–132"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 131–132&lt;/ref&gt; Mawson's biographers believe the suggestion of cannibalism is probably wrong; [[Beau Riffenburgh]] notes that Mawson nursed Mertz for days, even at the possible risk to his own life. Moreover, he notes, Mawson had no way of knowing why Mertz died; eating his flesh could possibly have been very dangerous.&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 132–133"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 132–133&lt;/ref&gt; These sentiments are echoed by Philip Ayres, who also notes that with Mertz's death Mawson had sufficient rations without having to resort to cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 78–79"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; Law, who knew Mawson well, believed "He was a man of very solid, conservative morals. It would have been impossible for him to have considered it."&lt;ref name="Ayres p. 78"&gt;Ayres (1999), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1913, shortly before the ''Aurora'' arrived to return them to Australia, the men remaining at Cape Denison erected a memorial cross for Mertz and Ninnis on Azimuth Hill to the north-west of the main hut.&lt;ref name="Last gasp"&gt;{{cite web

Mawson's return was celebrated at the [[Adelaide Town Hall]], in an event attended by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[Thomas Denman, 3rd Baron Denman|Lord Denman]]. A typical speaker stated that "Mawson has returned from a journey that was absolutely unparalleled in the history of exploration—one of the greatest illustrations of how the sternest affairs of Nature were overcome by the superb courage, power and resolve of man".&lt;ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 177–178"&gt;Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; Including the Far Eastern Party, sledging parties from the Cape Denison base covered over {{convert|2600|mi}} of previously unexplored land; the expedition's [[Western Base Party]] on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]], under [[Frank Wild]], covered a further {{convert|800|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Ayres pp. 95–96"&gt;Ayres (1999), pp. 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

The expedition was the first to use wireless radio in the Antarctic—transmitting back to Australia via a relay station established on [[Macquarie Island]]—and made several important scientific discoveries.&lt;ref name="Mawson ADB"&gt;{{cite web

A later analysis by J. Gordon Hayes, while commending most of the expedition, was critical of Mawson's decision not to use skis, but Fred Jacka, writing in the ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]'', suggests that "for Mawson and Ninnis, who were manoeuvring heavy sledges, this would have been difficult much of the time".&lt;ref name="Mawson ADB"/&gt; In his 1976 foreword to Lennard Bickel's book on the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, explorer and mountaineer [[Edmund Hillary|Sir Edmund Hillary]] described Mawson's journey as "probably the greatest story of lone survival in Polar exploration".&lt;ref name="Bickel p. x"/&gt;{{clear}}

'''Federation of European Microbiological Societies''' ('''FEMS''') is an international European scientific organization, formed by the union of a number of national organizations; there are now 54 members from 38 European countries, regular and provisional.&lt;ref&gt;"The Federation of European Microbiological Societies: An Historical Review" by A. Dawes, ''FEMS Microbiology Letters'' 100 (1992) 15-24,&lt;/ref&gt; Members can apply for fellowships, grants and/or support when organising a meeting. FEMS facilitates exchange of scientific knowledge to all microbiologists in Europe and worldwide by publishing five microbiology journals and organising a biennial congress for microbiologists around the world. It also initiates campaigns such as the European Academy of Microbiology (EAM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fems-microbiology.org/about-fems.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, it is the sponsor of ''FEMS Microbiology Letters'', a single journal, that was later on followed by 4 more journals:

* ''[[FEMS Microbiology Letters]]''
* ''[[FEMS Microbiology Reviews]]''
* ''[[Pathogens and Disease]]'' a journal preceded by ''[[FEMS Immunology and Medical Microbiology]]''
* ''[[FEMS Microbiology Ecology]]''
* ''[[FEMS Yeast Research]]''

Originally published for the Society by [[Elsevier]], then by [[Wiley-Blackwell]], they are now published by [[Oxford University Press]].

:''This article is about the history of the discipline, for linguistic phenomena, see [[Germanic languages]] and the navigation template below.''

'''Germanic philology''' is the [[philology|philological]] study of the [[Germanic languages]], particularly from a [[Comparative method|comparative]] or historical perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://signumuniversity.org/departments/language-literature/germanic-philology/|website=signumuniversity|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of research into the Germanic languages began in the 16th century, with the discovery of literary texts in the earlier phases of the languages. Early modern publications dealing with [[Old Norse]] culture appeared in the 16th century, e.g. ''Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus'' (Olaus Magnus, 1555) and the first edition of the
13th century ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' ([[Saxo Grammaticus]]), in 1514.
In 1603, [[Melchior Goldast]] made the first edition of [[Middle High German]] poetry, Tyrol and Winsbeck, including a [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] which focused on linguistic problems and set the tone for the approach to such works in the subsequent centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Dunphy, “Melchior Goldast und Martin Opitz: Mittelalter-Rezeption um 1600” in: Nicola McLelland, Hans-Jochen Schiewer and Stefanie Schmitt, ''Humanismus in der deutschen Literatur des Mittelalters und der Frühen Neuzeit'', Tübingen: Max Niemeyer, 2008, 105-121 ([https://www.academia.edu/3455592/Melchior_Goldast_und_Martin_Opitz_Mittelalter-Rezeption_um_1600 PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;  He later gave similar attention to the Old High German Benedictine Rule. In England, Cotton's studies of the manuscripts in his collection marks the beginnings of work on Old English language.
The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the [[Edda]] (notably Peder Resen's ''Edda Islandorum'' of 1665).

Germanic philology, together with [[history of linguistics|linguistics]] as a whole, emerged as a serious academic discipline in the early 19th century, pioneered particularly in [[Germany]] by such linguists as [[Jacob Grimm]], who discovered [[Grimm's law]], on the sound change across Germanic languages. Important 19th century scholars include [[Henry Sweet]] and [[Matthias Lexer]].

The structure of the modern university means that for the most part work on the field is focused on medieval English studies, medieval German studies, etc. Only relatively few universities can afford to offer Comparative linguistics as a discrete field.

==Overview==
An investigation into an emerging new movement of young women rediscovering their capacity for innocence.

Critical reception for ''Girls Gone Mild'' has been mixed. Some positive reviews have praised Shalit for her message that girls can be modest in an over-sexualized society. As one reviewer notes, “Adults in authority—school administrators, commentators, and government officials—often seem to want teens to get only one side of the sexuality story. But girls need—and want—an alternative. In letting more and more young Americans know the alternative is out there.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez|first1=Kathryn Jean|title=Mild, Mild Life|journal=National Review|date=2007|volume=59|issue=18|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have criticized Shalit’s stance on modesty. Some argue that Shalit’s argument implies that a girl’s end goal is to remain modest for her ultimate end goal of marriage. Another critique is that Shalit appears to argue that women are responsible for men’s behavior. As one critic notes, “Revamping outdated notions of femininity and positioning them as cutting edge may be a smart way to sell a glut of baggy bathing suits then, but it sure doesn't sound like a revolution.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Valenti|first1=Jessica|title=G2: Women: Chastity Is Chic: . . .

Early models used two variables, but the most complex behaviour they could demonstrate was period oscillations due to the [[Poincaré–Bendixson theorem]], so later models introduced further variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1142/9789814374439_0013 | first = C. | last = Letellier| chapter = Chaos in Biology and Biomedicine | title = Chaos in Nature | series = World Scientific Series on Nonlinear Science Series A | volume = 81 | pages = 277–322 | year = 2013 | isbn = 978-981-4374-42-2 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hologram bracelet''' or ''' energy bracelet'''&lt;ref name="SBD29102011" /&gt; is a small [[gel bracelet|rubber wristband]] supposedly fitted with a [[hologram]]. Manufacturers have said supposedly that the holograms "optimise the natural flow of [[energy (esotericism)|energy]] around the body, and supposedly improve an athlete's strength, balance and flexibility".&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt; Only [[anecdotal evidence]] supports these claims and tests performed by the [[Australian Skeptics]],&lt;ref name="Guard01082010" /&gt; the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff]],&lt;ref name="BBC22112010"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-11805616 Power Balance band is placebo, say expert], [[BBC News]], 22 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[RMIT]]'s School of Health Sciences&lt;ref name="Brice" /&gt; have been unable to identify any effect on performance.

==Response==
Mark Hodgkinson, writing in the [[Daily Telegraph]] in 2010, called hologram bracelets a fad&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt; with many professional athletes seen wearing them and several actively endorsing them. Footballers [[David Beckham]]&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt;  and [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]&lt;ref name="Guard01082010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/01/sports-sensation-power-balance|title=Sport's latest sensation: a rubbery bracelet|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Patrick Kingsley|date=1 August 2010|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have worn them, and tennis players [[Sam Querrey]] and [[Mardy Fish]] both wore them during the final of the [[2010 Queen's Club Championships]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guard01082010"/&gt; Endorsements for the Power Balance bracelet have come from [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Rubens Barrichello]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt; and the [[Wasps RFC|London Wasps]] rugby team,&lt;ref name="Guard01082010"/&gt; while ice hockey team the [[Cardiff Devils]] announced a partnership with Power Balance in early 2010.&lt;ref name="BBC22112010" /&gt; [[NASCAR]] reported in 2011 that many drivers wore EFX Performance bracelets with the [[Hendrick Motorsports]] and [[Stewart-Haas Racing]] teams entering into licensing deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110513/efx-hendrick-stewart-haas/index.html|title=EFX Performance partners with Hendrick, SHR|publisher=NASCAR.com|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several groups have investigated the effects of hologram bracelets on athletic performance. A 2011 study by RMIT University's School of Health Sciences found that there was an overall decrease in the balance and stability of wearers, although it was not statistically significant and the overall conclusion was that the bracelets had no effect on performance.&lt;ref name="Brice"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= J Bodyw Mov Ther |year=2011 |volume=15 |issue = 3 |pages=298–303 |title= The effect of close proximity holographic wristbands on human balance and limits of stability: A randomised, placebo-controlled trial |vauthors=Brice SR, Jarosz BS, Ames RA, Baglin J, Da Costa C |url= |doi= 10.1016/j.jbmt.2011.01.020|pmid=21665105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Skeptics]] group found that the bracelets has no more than a placebo effect.&lt;ref name="Guard01082010" /&gt;

Research by the [[University of Wales Institute, Cardiff]], commissioned by the BBC, also found that wearing the bracelets had no effect on performance in standard sports industry tests, adding that neither the physiology or the biology of wearers was changed.&lt;ref name="BBC22112010"/&gt; However, Dr Gareth Irwin who carried out the tests said that there may be changes in performance because of the [[placebo effect]], a view which has been echoed by sports psychologists.&lt;ref name="Time04102010"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2021057,00.html|title=Wrist Watch|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Bruce Crumley|date=4 October 2010|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports psychologist Victor Thompson says the bracelets play on superstition, simply giving people the expectation that they can improve their sporting performance.&lt;ref name="Guard01082010" /&gt; Cricket coach [[Jeremy Snape]] said he prefers that athletes have belief in themselves rather than in an external product, while Roberto Forzoni described the bracelets as "gimmicks" which allow athletes to avoid addressing real issues in their performance, with the high-profile endorsements giving the sense of belonging to an elite group of athletes.&lt;ref name="Telegraph15102010" /&gt;

[[File:Hostile waters bbc.jpg|thumb|150px|Cover of 1998 BBC VHS release of the film]]
'''''Hostile Waters''''' is a British [[1997 in film|1997]] [[television movie|television film]] about the loss of the [[Soviet Navy]]'s ''[[K-219]]'', a Yankee I class nuclear ballistic missile sub. The film stars [[Rutger Hauer]] as the commander of ''K-219'' and claims to be based on the true story. The film was produced by [[World Productions]] for the [[BBC]] and [[HBO]], in association with Invision Productions and [[Universum Film AG|UFA Filmproduktions]]. It was written by [[Troy Kennedy Martin]] and directed by David Drury, and was first transmitted on [[BBC One]] on 26 July 1997.

==Plot==
''[[Soviet submarine K-219|K-219]]'' performs a [[Crazy Ivan]], and USS ''Aurora'' collides with her, causing a rupture of the seal on one of its ballistic missile tubes. The leaking seawater causes a corrosive reaction which floods the sub with toxic gas. The corrosive reaction starts a fire that floods the sub with more toxic gas, and smoke.

The captain surfaces the boat and moves the crew out to the deck, and attempts to vent the sub. The chief engineer informs the captain that the fire may cook off the nukes and cause a nuclear explosion. The launch doors are opened on the sub to vent smoke.

''Aurora'' ascertains that a fire is aboard ''K-219'', and informs the Pentagon. The Pentagon, fearing radiological contamination of the Eastern Seaboard, orders ''Aurora'' to prepare to sink ''K-219''. The fact that the launch doors are open on the SLBMs causes consternation in [[Washington D.C.]], with calls for the immediate sinking of the sub, should it appear to be preparing to launch.

The captain of ''K-219'' prepares a bold plan to dive with the launch doors open, to flood the missile bay and quench the fires. As the captain dives the sub, ''Aurora'' prepares to fire, assuming ''K-219'' is setting about to launch its missiles. After a brief but heated argument the U.S. commander is convinced to wait before launching and realises that the Soviet sub is diving, rather than launching its [[SLBM]]s.

''K-219'''s tactic works, and the sub resurfaces with the fires out. A new crisis develops: Both nuclear reactors are overheating, and the cooling rods must be lowered manually by two crew members who have only limited oxygen left. The rods are lowered, and both reactors are shut down, averting disaster, but one crew member remains locked inside the reactor room, running out of oxygen. With seawater flooding the submarine, the captain of ''K-219'' decides to abandon ship. Throughout the crisis, Washington insists that no information on the possibility of nuclear fallout along the eastern American coastline be leaked to the Governors and no evacuation plans be activated to protect the population, in order not to derail the forthcoming [[Reykjavik Summit]] between Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan.

Capt. Britanov and his surviving crew members return safely to Moscow with some crew decorated and he being dismissed from the navy. The Reykjavik Summit takes place as planned.

The film's postscript details that as a legacy almost a decade after the end of the Cold War, fifty one nuclear war heads and seven nuclear reactors from nuclear submarines litter the North Atlantic ocean floor.

'''''In the Name of Identity: Violence and the Need to Belong''''' is a 1998 book by [[Amin Maalouf]]. 

In this work, Maalouf discusses the identity crisis which Arabs have experienced since the establishment of continuous relationships with the west, adding his personal dimension as a Lebanese Christian. The book is intended for both Arabs and Westerners (as well as for people with mixed heritage).

This work is divided into five major chapters, "Identity and Belonging", "When Modernity Comes From the Other", "The Era of Cosmic Tribals", "Taming the Shrew" and a glossary. He begins with universal values of identity, which he dissects, describes the extremes, then applies them to the [[Levant]]. He tries to describe how the average modern Arab feels, along a wide spectrum of ideologies in practice throughout the Arab world...from religious beliefs and traditional practices to total [[Islam and secularism|secularism]].
 
The book also sheds light on recent events in the Arab world, from civil wars to relations with the west.

'''Jerzy Kroh''' (28 August 1924 – 15 February 2016) was a Polish chemist, the founder of a [[radiation chemistry]] school in [[Łódź]], and the author or co-author of about 400 publications and several books.

From 1981-1987, Kroh was [[rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Lodz University of Technology|Technical University of Lodz]], and from 1962-1994 was in charge of the Interministerial Institute of Applied Radiation, of which he was a founder. From 1996-1998, Kroh was Vice President of Łódź, responsible for science and education. He received honorary doctorates from the [[University of Leeds]] and the [[University of Strathclyde]] in the United Kingdom, the [[University of Pavia]] in Italy, and the Technical University of Lodz.

Kroh has many other awards as well, including the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, Knight Commander of the Order of the Rebirth of Poland, and the Imperial Japanese Order of the Silver and Gold Star. He is an honorary member of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] HFRS, of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]], and of the Scientific Society of Lodz. He died on 15 February 2016 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiolodz.pl/posts/22592-zmarl-profesor-jerzy-kroh|title=Zmarł profesor Jerzy Kroh|author=Radio Łódź|work=Radio Łódź|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225053716/https://www.radiolodz.pl/posts/22592-zmarl-profesor-jerzy-kroh|archivedate=25 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[software]] that provides an alternative [[graphical user interface]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s. The technical term for this interface is a ''[[Shell (computing)|shell]]''. Windows' standard user interface is called [[Windows shell]]; [[Windows 3.0]] and [[Windows 3.1x]] have a different shell, called [[Program Manager]]. The programs in this list do not restyle the Windows shell, but replace it; therefore, they look and function differently, and have different configuration options.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8547">The following is a partial '''list of social science journals''', including [[history]] and [[area studies]]. There are thousands of [[academic journals]] covering the [[social science]]s in publication, and many more have been published at various points in the past. The list given here is far from exhaustive, and contains the most influential, currently publishing journals in each field. As a rule of thumb, each field should be represented by at most ten positions, chosen by their [[impact factor]]s and other ratings. There are many important academic magazines that are not true peer-reviewed journals. They are not listed here.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1506">'''LiveBench''' is a continuously running [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] project for assessing the quality of [[protein structure prediction]] and [[Protein structure prediction#Secondary structure|secondary structure prediction]] methods. LiveBench focuses mainly on [[homology modeling]] and [[protein threading]] but also includes [[Protein structure prediction#Secondary structure|secondary structure prediction]], comparing publicly available [[webserver]] output to newly deposited [[protein structure]]s in the [[Protein Data Bank]]. Like the [[EVA (benchmark)|EVA]] project and unlike the related [[CASP]] and [[CAFASP]] experiments, LiveBench is intended to study the accuracy of predictions that would be obtained by non-expert users of publicly available prediction methods. A major advantage of LiveBench and EVA over CASP projects, which run once every two years, is their comparatively large data set.

[[File:Alan Shepard in Mercury Control Center.jpg|thumb|Alan Shepard watches launch at the CAPCOM console in Mercury Control during Gus Grissom's [[Mercury-Redstone 4]] (''Liberty Bell 7'') flight]]
The '''Mercury Control Center''' (also known as building 1385 or simply MCC) provided control and coordination of all activities associated with the NASA's [[Project Mercury]] flight operation as well as the first [[Project Gemini]] flight, [[Gemini 3]]. It was located on the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] near [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 14|Launch Complex 14]].

The facility was expanded in 1963 to support [[Project Gemini]] by contractor [[Pan American World Airways]] to provide more meeting space along with space for data analysis, and a large space for a new Gemini spacecraft trainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mercury Mission Control, 1962-63 Addition|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/MCCgallery/LOC-63-1017.html|publisher=[[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more complex requirements of later Gemini and [[Apollo program|Apollo]] flights forced control operations to move to [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|a larger facility]] located in [[Houston, Texas]], but the MCC continued to be used for training and meeting space until it was added as a historic tour stop on June 1, 1967 for public tours which continued through the mid-1990s.

{{Clear}}

==Configuration==
[[File:MCC layout.jpg|thumb|MCC layout]]
The MCC was organized into three rows and was smaller and simpler than subsequent control centers. It needed only support a mission of no more than 36 hours with a spacecraft less complex than those used on future missions. Positions included those for monitoring the spacecraft and astronauts during flight as well as positions for supporting the launch and recovery of the capsule.

The MCC also featured a large backlit status map for display of the capsule position. Unlike later mission control centers which featured computer generated graphics, this Mercury era display operated with a physical two-dimensional representation of the capsule suspended and lit in front of the map.

More modern mission control centers were split between launch control, which is located at the launch site such as Cape Canaveral, and Mission Control which is located at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] for the Apollo and Space Shuttle programs or the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for unmanned missions.&lt;ref name=inventory/&gt;

==Tracking and ground facilities==
[[File:Mercury stations.jpg|thumb|Mercury tracking stations]]Though the MCC provided command and control, it was not the only facility involved in supporting Mercury or Gemini flights. The Computing and Communications Center was located at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in Greenbelt Maryland and provided compute power for missions.

To minimize the time that the spacecraft was out of communications range with the ground, additional ground stations were established at US military facilities, tracking ships, and in cooperation with the governments of Spain, Great Britain, Nigeria and Australia:&lt;ref name=summary&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-45/ch1.htm MERCURY PROJECT SUMMARY (NASA SP-45)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was erected between 1956 and 1958 and was used throughout Project Mercury (1961–63) and for [[Project Gemini]] through [[Gemini 3]] (1964–65). In 1999, much of the equipment and furnishings from the Flight Control Area were moved to the Visitor Complex where they became part of the exhibit there. They currently are on display to the public in the complex's Dr. Kurt H. Debus Conference Facility.&lt;ref name=inventory&gt;{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Joan|title=INVENTORY OF HISTORIC ARTIFACTS FROM THE MISSION CONTROL CENTER,  CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION,  BREVARD COUNTY, FLORIDA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/476786main_ACI%20Final%20Assessment%20Report_Artifact%20Inventory%20at%20MCC_508.pdf|publisher=Archaeological Consultants, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1984, as a [[contributing property]] to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], asbestos removal, other repairs and restoring the center to its original state would have cost $6 million. The decision was made to preserve the consoles and other equipment and destroy the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASA's first Mission Control demolished|url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-050410a.html|newspaper=Collect Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Control Center|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/history/MCCgallery/MCC-sign.html|publisher=NASA / State of Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Naga fireballs''' ({{lang-th|บั้งไฟพญานาค}}; {{RTGS|bang fai phaya nak}}), also known as ''bung fai phaya nak'' or "Mekong lights", and formerly, "ghost lights"&lt;ref name="BP-20181028" /&gt; are a phenomenon said to be seen annually on the [[Mekong River]]. Glowing balls are alleged to naturally rise from the water high into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/wilderness-resources/photos/5-natural-events-that-science-cant-explain/the-naga-fireba|last=Knoblauch|first=Jessica|title=5 natural events that science can't explain|website= Mother Nature News|date=15 March 2010|accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ball|balls]] are said to be reddish and to range in size from smaller sparkles up to the size of basketballs. They quickly rise up to a couple of hundred metres before disappearing. The number of fireballs reported varies between tens and thousands per night.&lt;ref name=Nation-20110921/&gt; The phenomenon is attributed to ''[[Phaya Naga|phaya nak]]'', a giant serpent said to live in the Mekong.&lt;ref name="BP-20181028"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Biggs |first1=Andrew |title=A Spiritual land |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/lifestyle/social-and-lifestyle/1565906/a-spiritual-land |accessdate=29 October 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |issue=Brunch |date=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The fireballs are most often reported around the night of [[Wan Ok Phansa]] at the end of [[Buddhist Lent]] in late-October.&lt;ref name=Nation-20110921&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nationmultimedia.com/travel/Let-there-be-lights-30165777.html|title=Let there be lights|work=The Nation|first= Phoowadon|last=Duangmee|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naga fireballs have been reported over an approximately 250 kilometre-long section of the Mekong River centered approximately on Phon Phisai in the [[Phon Phisai District]]. Fireballs have also been reported rising from smaller rivers, lakes, and ponds in the region.

The fireballs were called "ghost lights" by locals until the mid-1980s, when the local council, not unaware of their tourism potential, officially named them "phaya nak lights". One observer noted that, "...the 'age-old' tradition is, actually, 35 years old."&lt;ref name="BP-20181028"/&gt;

== Explanations ==
{{See also|Ball lightning|St. Elmo's fire|Will-o'-the-wisp }}

Although the fireballs are regularly seen on the river during the Phayanak Festival, a 2002 [[iTV (Thailand)|iTV]] documentary showed [[Lao People's Armed Forces|Laotian]] soldiers firing [[tracer rounds]] into the air across the river from the festival. Skeptic [[Brian Dunning (skeptic)|Brian Dunning]] suggests that it would be impossible for anyone across the half-mile river to hear a gunshot because it would take 2.5 seconds for the sound to travel to the spectators, and by then the crowd watching would have already noticed the light and started cheering, drowning out any sound to reach them.&lt;ref name=dunning /&gt; Thai biologist Jessada Denduangboripant analysed footage of a Naga fireball event and concluded that the effect was caused by the firing of [[flare gun]]s from the other side of the river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krausz|first1=Tibor|title=Myth busters: Thai scientists debunk sweating crystals, boiling oil and other superstitions|url=http://www.scmp.com/culture/article/1984141/myth-busters-thai-scientists-debunk-sweating-crystals-boiling-oil-and-other|accessdate=4 March 2017|work=South China Morning Post|date=4 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some individuals have attempted to explain the phenomenon scientifically. One explanation is that the fireball is a result of flammable [[phosphine]] gas generated by the marshy environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/Science-Ministry-solves-Naga-fireballs-mystery-87105.html|title=Science Ministry solves Naga fireballs mystery|work=The Nation}}{{nonspecific|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning writes that such fireballs are very unlikely to spontaneously ignite, and would not stay lit when at the speeds the fireballs travel, and that there is no science that can explain "the Naga Fireballs to be naturally produced burning gas bubbles."&lt;ref name=dunning&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4183|number=183|title=The Naga Fireballs |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar explanation involves a similar phenomenon in [[plasma physics]]. A free-floating plasma orb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Free Floating Plasma Orb|url=http://www.aps.org/about/physics-images/archive/plasma-orb.cfm |website=American Physical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; created when surface electricity (e.g., from  a capacitor) is discharged into a solution. However, most [[Ball lightning#Laboratory experiments|plasma ball experiments]] are conducted using high voltage capacitors, [[microwave]] oscillators, or [[microwave oven]]s, not under natural conditions.

'''''Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist''''' is an [[historical novel]] by [[historian of science]] [[Russell McCormmach]], published in 1982 by [[Harvard University Press]].  Set in 1918, the book explores the world of physics in the early 20th century—including the advent of [[modern physics]] and the role of [[physicist]]s in [[World War I]]—through the recollections of the fictional Viktor Jakob. Jakob is an old German physicist who  spent most of his career during the period of [[classical physics]], a paradigm being confronted by the rapid and radical developments of [[relativistic physics]] in 1900s and 1910s. This conflict allows for extensive examination of the various tensions placed on Jakob by the academic environment, the German academic system, and the changing academic culture of the early [[20th century]].

The character of Jakob, a professor at a minor German university, is an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgam]] of German physicists based on archival research by McCormmach. In the novel, he recalls interactions and events, documented in extensive footnotes to genuine publications and archival sources, involving many of the well-known physicists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ''Night Thoughts'', pointedly criticized for its lack of literary merit by some reviewers, was generally praised for its attempt at forging a new approach to history and [[historical fiction]] by incorporating extensive research into the text.

==Style==
The novel is written as a traditional fictional biography.&lt;ref name=Steiner&gt;{{cite journal|first=George|last=Steiner|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]]|volume= 73|number=3|date=Sep 1982|pages=427–429|jstor=231449|title=Review:Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist|doi=10.1086/353047}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it uses footnotes to provide examples of historical proof for events and situations in Jakob's life as a way to prove the feasibility of situations.&lt;ref name=Mirowski/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weisskopf&gt;{{cite journal|first=Victor|last=Weisskopf|url=http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=AJPIAS000050000011001053000002&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;doi=10.1119/1.12948&amp;prog=normal|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|date=Nov 1982|volume=50|issue=11|pages=1053–1054|doi=10.1119/1.12948|title=Review: Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist|bibcode = 1982AmJPh..50.1053M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, alongside the historical footnotes which point to the lives of historical scientists, his study is decorated with photographs of the same scientists, creating a reflection of how he has been shaped by their precedence.&lt;ref name=Steiner/&gt;

Historical reflections, and flashbacks – focusing mostly on the [[Franco-Prussian war]] and [[World War I]] – form a considerable part of the narrative.&lt;ref name=Steiner/&gt;

[[George Steiner]] called McCormmach "no novelist" pointing to how he "wisely ... avoids dialogue," commits numerous [[Social skills#Social ineptitude|gaucheries]], and how many of the dream sequences are flat. He felt that the work fails to show the passion which scientists feel for science.&lt;ref name=Steiner/&gt; On the other hand, [[Mary Jo Nye]] wrote that McCormach's work "might have pleased [[Michael Polanyi|Polanyi]]", who "wanted to see passion, not only reason, in the depiction of the scientist’s life".&lt;ref name="Nye"/&gt;

==Plot summary==
Victor Jakob, a Physics professor in a small German university, reflects on his life as a physicist, recalling major discoveries and ideas of recent decades and his interactions with prominent physicists whose ideas challenge the [[classical physics]] worldview. Meanwhile, the tide of [[World War I]] is turning against [[Germany]], as the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] mount [[Second Battle of the Somme (1918)|The Second Battle of the Somme]], pushing the German Second Army back over a 34&amp;nbsp;mi (55&amp;nbsp;km) front.

As he meditates on the changing world, Jakob hikes to a mountain overlooking his university, where he becomes trapped in a muddy ditch, while gunfire rings out below. In an apparently hopeless situation, he takes out his [[revolver]] and "open[s] his mouth."  (Some reviewers characterize his apparent death as an accident, while others interpret it as [[suicide]], a parallel to that of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]]; [[John Maddox]] considered it open to interpretation whether Jakob succeeds in killing himself.)&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt;

==Themes==
A major theme of ''Night Thoughts'' is the reinforcement of [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s conception of [[history of science]] as a convoluted mesh of non-linear progress effected by the biography of the scientists. Jakob's research becomes the central means by which the author expresses Kuhn's theory, reinforcing each situation with footnotes which point to events in Jakob's life that mirror historical events. Jakob does not progress linearly in constructing his scientific theories, instead he must handle "intellectual upheaval" caused by factions in the study of physics, competition for recognition in the hierarchical German University system, tension caused by his students and his own feelings of incompetency.&lt;ref name=Mirowski&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Night thoughts of a classical physicist''|journal=History of Political Economy|volume=15|number=1|year=1983|doi=10.1215/00182702-15-1-145|first=Philip|last=Mirowski|url=http://hope.dukejournals.org/cgi/reprint/15/1/145.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kuhn reviewed the manuscript before publication.)&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt;

The conflict between classical physics and relativistic physics is reflective of more than just the non-linear approach to science; it represents a larger conflict between the "klassiche Bildung", or a concept of education imbued from the greats of the past, and the newer forms of learning which were breaking away from this reliance on old knowledge.&lt;ref name=Weisskopf/&gt; Jakob's reflections are similar to the reflections found in commentary on other aspects of society, including art and literature, comparing them to classical and romantic approaches to physics.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

A more traditional theme, indicated by the novel's title, is the crumbling world of an old man as he nears death and meditates on his life. The world of Physics that Jakob has known for most of his career is being overthrown by new theories and discoveries of younger scientists, while at the same time his country is nearing defeat in World War I. Jakob struggles with his own relative meager place in the German academic system, as professor at a minor university who is increasingly out of place in the world of modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|issn=0363-3276|volume=6|issue=5|pages=140–141|last=MacLeod|first=Roy|title=Review of ''Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist''|journal=[[The Wilson Quarterly]] (1976–)|year=1982|jstor=40256399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jakob's desperation leads him to thoughts of suicide again and again.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: A Portrait|first=Laurie M.|last=Brown|journal=Science, New Series|volume=216|number=4548|date=May 21, 1982|pages=880–881|jstor=1687544|doi=10.1126/science.216.4548.880|bibcode=1982Sci...216..880M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The character of Viktor Jakob was based on extensive archival research and studies of personnel files of many German physicists who were contemporaries of the fictional professor, who (apparently) dies at the novel's conclusion at the age of 69, in 1918.&lt;ref name ="Nye"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1086/504738|volume=97|issue=2|pages=322–329|last=Nye|first=Mary Jo|title=Scientific Biography: History of Science by Another Means?|journal=Isis|date=2006-06-01|url=http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/1957/22155/1/NyeMaryJo.History.ScientificBiography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt; McCormmach's research was supported by a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Lawson"/&gt;

[[Victor Frederick Weisskopf|Victor Weisskopf]] points out that there are several "strange omissions" from the historical context of the novel including [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]]'s discovery of the [[Rutherford model|planetary atom]] and [[radioactivity]] which was the work of Rutherford, [[Kazimierz Fajans]] and [[Frederick Soddy]].&lt;ref name=Weisskopf/&gt;

==Reception==
Due in part to its hybrid nature as both a novel and a work of historical scholarship, ''Night Thoughts'' was widely reviewed soon after publication from an unusually wide variety of perspectives. Literary critics, historians of science, and physicists took an interest in the book, and described its genre in a number of ways: from [[novel]] to [[historical novel]] to an "intellectual-historical novel" to "a new art form: the scientific historical novel". The novelty of the book was widely noted, with many reviewers calling it an experiment—in literary genre, or in historiographical technique. While generally praised as a work of history of science, the book received mixed reviews as a novel, with the emphasis on science and historical detail a detraction from a successful narrative.&lt;ref name=Lawson/&gt;

In a review of the book's varied reception and interpretation, Lewis A. Lawson concluded that "the book is a bad novel. Yet it would be a valuable addition to college courses&amp;nbsp;... most valuable in one of the new interdisciplinary courses that transcend specific disciplines in order to distinguish several different approaches to the acquisition of knowledge and to the validation of experience".&lt;ref name=Lawson&gt;{{Cite journal|issn=0021-3667|volume=36|issue=3|pages=197–205|last=Lawson|first=Lewis A.|title=An Academic Novel and its Impact: Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist|journal=[[JGE: The Journal of General Education|The Journal of General Education]]|year=1984|jstor=27796999}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Steiner responded similarly, saying that while the novel was poor and the writing "no literary masterpiece", "they nevertheless constitute a very remarkable imaginative deed" for "bridging the gap between the ideals of literature and ... history of science".&lt;ref name = Steiner/&gt;

Philip Mirowski of [[Tufts University]] said that he "would recommend this volume to any and all historians of economic thought who are dissatisfied with the self-satisfied air and narrow theoretical scope of existing texts."&lt;ref name=Mirowski/&gt; Similarly, Laurie Brown, a physicist at [[Northwestern University]], noting that "the idea of this book as a possible new genre in science history is so appealing that I should like to recommend it to a large audience." However, he also pointed out that it may not be very appealing as a novel because Jakob is not a "fully developed character in the social world."&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

Caitlin McKenna said McCormmach was wrong in referring to Jakob as an underdeveloped character; she praised Jakob and the novel extremely: "What emerges is a whole and wholly believable character who single-handedly embodies the bafflement of the Western mind at the dawn of modernity. At once writer and scientist, McCormmach has called on both these roles to create a novel of imagination and intellect."&lt;ref name=McKenna&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Narrative Magazine]]|url=http://www.narrativemagazine.com/issues/fall-2007/night-thoughts-classical-physicist|date=Fall 2007|first=Caitlin|last=McKenna|title=First &amp; Second Looks: Night Thoughts of a Classical Physicist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1995, [[Steven Weinberg]] presented a lecture, ''Night Thoughts of a Quantum Physicist'', to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] which expounded his view on the manner by which a new "standard model" for physics requires a change, similar to the paradigm shift which Jakob saw in the change from classical physics to [[quantum mechanics]].&lt;ref name=Weinberg&gt;{{cite journal|title=Night Thoughts of a Quantum Physicist|first=Steven|last=Weinburg|journal=Bulletin of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|volume=49|number=3|date=Dec 1995|pages=51–64|jstor=3824157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

octopus employs [[pseudopotential]]s and real-space numerical grids to propagate the Kohn&amp;ndash;Sham orbitals in real time under the influence of time-varying electromagnetic fields. Specific functionality is provided for simulating one-, two-, and three-dimensional systems. octopus can calculate static and dynamic [[Polarizability|polarizabilities]] and first [[Hyperpolarizability|hyperpolarizabilities]], static [[Magnetic susceptibility|magnetic susceptibilities]], [[absorption spectra]], and perform [[molecular dynamics]] simulations with Ehrenfest and [[Car–Parrinello method]]s.

The code is written predominantly in [[Fortran]], with some [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Perl]]. It is released under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]].

* Photo-induced reactions of molecules (e.g., photo-dissociation, photo-isomerization, etc.).
* In the immediate future, extension of these procedures to systems that are infinite and periodic in one or more dimensions ([[polymer]]s, slabs, [[Carbon nanotube|nanotubes]], solids), and to electronic transport.

==Theoretical basis==

* The underlying theories are DFT and TDDFT. Also, the code may perform dynamics by considering the classical (i.e. point-particle) approximation for the nuclei. These dynamics may be non-adiabatic, since the system evolves following the Ehrenfest path. It is, however, a mean-field approach.
* Regarding TDDFT, one can use three different approaches:
** the standard TDDFT-based linear-response theory of Casida, which provides the excitation energies and oscillator strengths for ground-state to excited-state transitions.
** the explicit time-propagation of the TDDFT equations, which allows for the use of large external potentials, well beyond the range of validity of [[perturbation theory]].
** the Sternheimer equation (density-functional perturbation theory) in the frequency domain, using only occupied states.

==Methodology==

* As numerical representation, the code works without a [[Basis set (chemistry)|basis set]], relying on numerical meshes. Nevertheless, auxiliary basis sets ([[plane wave]]s, [[atomic orbital]]s) are used when necessary. Recently, the code offers the possibility of working with non-uniform grids, which adapt to the inhomogeneity of the problem, and of making use of multigrid techniques to accelerate the calculations.
* For most calculations, the code relies on the use of [[pseudopotential]]s&lt;ref&gt;W. E. Pickett, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-7977(89)90002-6 Comput. Phys. Rep. '''9''', 115] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; of two types: Troullier-Martins,&lt;ref&gt;N. Troullier and J. L. Martins, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v43/i3/p1993_1 Phys. Rev. B  '''43''', 1993] (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and Hartwigsen-Goedecker-Hutter.&lt;ref&gt;C. Hartwigsen, S. Goedecker and J. Hutter, [http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRB/v58/i7/p3641_1 Phys. Rev. B '''58''', 3641] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In addition to being able to treat systems in the standard 3 dimensions, 2D and 1D modes are also available. These are useful for studying, e.g., the two-dimensional electron gas that characterizes a wide class of quantum dots.

==Technical aspects==

* The code has been designed with emphasis on parallel scalability. In consequence, it allows for multiple task divisions, this utilises mesh division software, [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] and [[OpenMP]]
* The language of most of the code is [[Fortran]] 90 (almost 50.000 lines at present). Other languages, such as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Perl]], are also used.
* The package is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). In consequence, it is available for use, inspection, and modification for anyone, at [http://www.tddft.org/programs/octopus the octopus web page.]

Organizational ecology utilizes insights from [[biology]], [[economics]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Douma, Sytse]] and [[Hein Schreuder]], 2013. "Economic Approaches to Organizations". 5th edition. London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page] {{ISBN|0273735292}} • {{ISBN|9780273735298}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]], and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die.

The ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levels&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hannan, M., &amp; Freeman, J. (1977). The population ecology of organizations. ''American Journal of Sociology 82''(5), 929-964.&lt;/ref&gt;).

What is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Baum, J., &amp; Shipilov, A. (2006). Ecological approaches to organizations. In S. Clegg, C. Hardy, T. Lawrence, &amp; W. Nord (Eds.) ''The Sage handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 55-110.) London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development  ==

Wharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the ''organization-set'', and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Evan, W. (1966). "The organization-set" in J. Thompson (ed.) ''Approaches to Organizational Design''. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also [[adaptive management]] and [[adaptive performance]]). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as "the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field". He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also [[Open and closed systems in social science]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E. (1977). A Concept of Organizational Ecology. ''Australian Journal of Management 2''(2),  161-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by [[Michael T. Hannan]] and the late [[John H. Freeman]] in their 1977 ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' piece "The population ecology of organizations" and later refined in their 1989 book ''[[Organizational Ecology]]'', examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like [[natural selection]] occurs.  This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change.

Organizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in [[organizational studies]], and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books ''The Demography of Corporations and Industries'' by Glenn Carroll and Michael Hannan (2000) and ''Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies'' by Michael Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.

== Key concerns ==
Organizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect:
* rates of creation of new organizational forms
* rates of demise of organizations and organizational forms
* the rates of change in organizational forms.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, J., &amp; Lumsden, C. (1990). Theory and research in organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 16''(1), 161-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational mortality ===
Organizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called ''Organizational Mortality''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Inertia and change ====
This factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality.

Theories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.

Hannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (See also [[Bounded rationality]]).

==== Niche theory ====

Niche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security.

Niche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that "generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments". The exception is produced by environments which "place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization".

Thus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Density dependence ====

Organizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and [[competition]]. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.

The founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, G. (1984). Organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 10''(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age dependence ====

How an organization's risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns:

* '''Liability of newness'''. Here, the risk of failure is high initially but declines as the organization ages.
* '''Liability of adolescence'''. The risk of mortality will be low at first as the organization is buffered from failure due to support by external constituents and initial endowments. But when these initial resources become depleted, the mortality hazard shoots up and then declines following the liability of newness pattern.
* '''Liabilities of aging'''. Here, the risk of failure increases with organizational age. This could be due to a ''liability of senescence'' (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a ''liability of obsolescence'' (a growing external mismatch with the environment).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary approaches to organizations ==
Organizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology's perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989, pp 20–22), while Nelson &amp; Winter (1982, p.&amp;nbsp;11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective.  Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- 'organizational forms', as in organizational ecology, or 'routines' as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands.

A social networks perspective on the evolution of large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al.&lt;ref&gt;Braha, Dan, Blake Stacey, and Yaneer Bar-Yam, 2011. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Journal_Version_SON_Braha.pdf “Corporate competition: A self-organized network”,] ''Social Networks'' 33 (3): 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are positively correlated with the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.

In [[chemistry]], '''peroxydicarbonate''' (sometimes '''peroxodicarbonate''') is a [[valence (chemistry)|divalent]] [[anion]] with formula {{chem|C|2|O|6|2−}}. It is one of the [[oxocarbon anion]]s, which consist solely of [[carbon]] and [[oxygen]]. Its molecular structure can be viewed as two [[carbonate]] anions joined so as to form a [[peroxide]] bridge –O–O–.

The anion is formed, together with [[peroxocarbonate]] {{chem|C|O|4|2−}}, at the negative [[electrode]] during [[electrolysis]] of molten [[lithium carbonate]].&lt;ref name="chen"&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/jp035749l |pages= 7553–7556 |title= First Spectroscopic Observation of Peroxocarbonate/ Peroxodicarbonate in Molten Carbonate |year= 2004 |last1= Chen |first1= Li-Jiang |last2= Lin |first2= Chang-Jian |last3= Zuo |first3= Juan |last4= Song |first4= Ling-Chun |last5= Huang |first5= Chao-Ming |journal= The Journal of Physical Chemistry B |volume= 108 |issue= 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anion can also be obtained by electrolysis of a saturated solution of rubidium carbonate in water.&lt;ref name=dinnebier3/&gt;

Scientists often refer to this period as the “[[Anthropocene]]” and define it as the era in which humans first began to alter the earth’s [[climate]] and [[ecosystems]].  Ruddiman contends that human induced climate change began as a result of the advent of [[agriculture]] thousands of years ago and resulted in warmer temperatures that could have possibly averted another [[ice age]]; this is the [[early anthropocene]] hypothesis.

==Synopsis==
Ruddiman begins the book with a brief introduction to the science of climate change and the various individuals that have been key in influencing the field over the years. He also notes that the earth’s climate has been drifting toward cooler temperatures for the last 55 million years. The dominant hypothesis for this trend is that large volcanic eruptions have subsided while increasing amounts of [[carbon dioxide]] have been absorbed out of the [[atmosphere]] due to interactions between [[monsoon]] rains and ground up rock exposed by [[India]] pushing into [[Asia]] and creating the [[Himalayas]].  Additionally it is believed that the melting ice that produced higher sea levels resulted in the ocean absorbing more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.  These two natural occurrences resulted in less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hence possibly producing the general cooling trend.

According to Ruddiman, beginning about 900,000 years ago the earth has begun to go through regular glacial cycles in which [[glaciers]] or ice have covered approximately one quarter of the earth’s total surface.  These conditions typically last for about 100,000 years and are followed by brief [[interglacial]] periods of more temperate weather.  Ruddiman cites various researchers in [[geology]] and [[astronomy]] who pioneered the understanding of earth’s climate as a function of its orbit.  The various cycles of earth’s climate seem to be explained by the [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], [[axial tilt]], and precession of the Earth's orbit as well as cycles in the amount of [[solar radiation]].  Ruddiman primarily relies on the groundwork by [[Milutin Milankovitch]] to explain the effects of solar radiation and earth’s orbit on the climate.  By examining [[ice cores]] from around the world scientists have been able to link levels of [[greenhouse gases]] such as carbon dioxide and [[methane]] to the various cycles of earth’s climate history.  The discovery of [[carbon dating]] aided a great deal in developing this understanding.  Upon investigating the levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the earth’s atmosphere in the most recent interglacial period--10,000 years ago--Ruddiman noticed that levels of carbon dioxide and methane were steadily rising despite the fact that the earth’s natural cycles determined that they should have been decreasing.  It was this discovery that lead to Ruddiman’s search for an explanation and ultimately the creation of this book.

Ruddiman’s central argument is that this most recent interglacial period has deviated from the natural cycle because of [[human]] activities, most importantly farming.  Approximately 10,000 years ago the ice that once covered large portions of the [[northern hemisphere]] began to recede and gave rise to a new way of life for early humans.  In the beginning these early humans had little impact on the [[Natural environment|environment]] because they were primarily [[hunter gatherer]] societies that moved from location to location allowing previously inhabited locations to be reclaimed by nature.  However, about 8,000 years ago humans first developed agriculture and a domesticated lifestyle that allowed them to continually inhabit regions and build large civilizations.  Ruddiman claims that carbon dioxide emission records indicate that levels in the atmosphere began to rise at about this same time.  This process was intensified as the centuries passed and new technologies such [[animal husbandry]] and the [[plow]] made their way into more and more cultures.  These new technologies allowed for more efficient methods of clearing forests and making room for increasing populations.  According to previous interglacial periods the concentration of carbon dioxide should have fallen by about 20 parts per million instead of rising by 20 parts per million. Ruddiman uses estimates of population, forest cleared per person and carbon emitted per each square kilometer cleared to approximate the total impact and concludes that the magnitude is reasonably close to the extra carbon dioxide accumulated during the period.
 
Ruddiman also attributes the rise of methane gas in the atmosphere to human related activities.  The most notable of these activities is the cultivation of rice in artificial [[wetlands]] in Asia and increased animal waste due to increasing populations of domesticated animals.  According to Ruddiman methane concentrations should have peaked about 11,000 years ago slightly above 700 parts per billion and then declined to about 450 parts per billion today. Methane levels followed this cycle at first, but about 5000 years ago they began to rebound and currently the concentration is about 275 parts per billion above the previous trends.

According to Ruddiman farming and related activities resulted in large amounts of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) being released into the atmosphere at a time when natural cycles of the earth indicated they should have been falling.  The result has been an unintended warming cycle that prevented the earth from entering into another ice age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~claussen/papers/ruddiman+al_qsr_05.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003050034/http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~claussen/papers/ruddiman+al_qsr_05.pdf |archivedate=2006-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ruddiman goes as far as to say that if these gases had not been released into the atmosphere, areas in northern [[Canada]] such as [[Hudson Bay]] and [[Baffin Island]] would currently be covered in ice today.  The implications of this theory are wide-ranging and most certainly worthy of further exploration.

Throughout the record of carbon dioxide and methane emissions there are drops and rises in the amount of concentrations present in the atmosphere.  Ruddiman explains these “wiggles” by claiming that they appear at times of major outbreaks of disease such as the [[bubonic plague]] in the 1,300’s and the prevalence of [[old world]] diseases in the Americas after the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].  Both of these events resulted in large numbers of people dying and the land they once inhabited being reclaimed by the forest.  This resulted in increased amounts of carbon dioxide being taken out of the atmosphere, hence causing global temperatures to cool down.  Ruddiman claims that the [[little ice age]], starting in the 13th century and ending sometime in the early 19th century was caused by the decreased population and the re-forestation of previously cleared lands as a result from the diseases that killed off so many people.

The last aspect of Ruddiman's discussion of climate change relates to the future of petroleum use on earth.  It is commonly known that the world’s supply of fossil fuels is rapidly depleting and even conservative estimates claim that the supply will not last much more than 150-200 more years.  Ruddiman claims that when this sources of natural fuels has been depleted, human kind will have to resort to using the large quantities of coal that still exist all over the planet.  This, according to Ruddiman, will result in a continued warming trend that will only stop when technology either produces a new source of fuel or figures out a way to separate the carbon dioxide emissions prior to being released into the atmosphere.  Ruddiman is quite skeptical of both scenarios in the near future because of the increased costs and technological advancements that would have to be made in such a short time.  Eventually carbon and methane emissions will be controlled and lowered a great deal and Ruddiman asserts when this happens the earth will most likely begin an era of cooling temperatures.

==Critical assessment==
[[Gavin Schmidt]], a climate scientist at the [[NASA]] Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, described Ruddiman's ideas as intriguing, but the conclusions largely depended on a comparison of methane changes in the current warm period with those in the Vostok ice core which correlated with orbital changes, and more recent research indicated that these might not be applicable to present changes. The newer EPICA core showed only a small increase in methane during the last 5,000 years, which was generally attributed to the development of the boreal wetlands and major river deltas after the ice from the previous ice age melted and caused the sea level to rise to its current location. It was very uncertain that the relatively small human populations and cultivated areas could have made a significant difference. More research was needed to quantify relevant factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmidt |first=Gavin |url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/methane/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040910184208/http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/methane/|title=NASA GISS: Research Features: Methane: A Scientific Journey from Obscurity to Climate Super-Stardom |publisher=Giss.nasa.gov |date=September 2004 |archivedate= 2004-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--preview of relevant page available in google, but Ruddiman does discuss burning forests…..Other criticism suggests that Ruddiman shortchanged the impact of burning forests in his synopsis of early human activity.  According to Michael Williams author of Deforesting the Earth, early humans used fire a great deal for either hunting and or clearing purposes.  Ruddiman does not discuss the role of fire at any length and instead decides to focus on the impact of the plow on human agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0226899268&amp;id=mW8Fl2ieJFsC&amp;pg=PA560&amp;lpg=PA560&amp;ots=1KkMUulerC&amp;dq=book+review+of+deforesting+the+earth&amp;sig=H-i8nnIoUpq8ywtAAuu81BjTwW0#PPP1,M1 |title=Deforesting the Earth: From Prehistory to Global Crisis - Michael Williams - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2002-12-15 |accessdate=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1408">'''Qiwam al-Din Muhammad al-Hasani''' was a [[Iran|Persian]] physician of the late 17th century. Hasani was a scholar who is known to have been working in the city of [[Qazvin]] in Persia in the year 1694 CE. The [[National Library of Medicine]] has in its collections a rare copy of a collection of five Arabic poems concerned with [[medicine]], [[astronomy]], [[arithmetic]], [[calligraphy]], and proper conduct. These five poems were collectively titled ''al-Khamsah al-Qazwiniyah'' (The Five Qazwini works). The copy at NLM was copied by a professional scribe for the author, whose stamps are in the volume, next to a statement that he corrected the volume in the year 1719–1720 CE. Thus we learn from this volume that Qiwan al-Din Muhammad al-Hasani was still working by 1719 CE.

The '''selection process for Mission 13 and 14 of the [[Discovery program]]''' began in February 2014, as [[NASA]] drafted an Announcement of Opportunity (AO) for the next Discovery mission. The winning mission proposals received $450 million in funding towards mission development and construction, along with bonus funding if missions were able to incorporate certain technologies. For Discovery Mission 13 and 14, NASA received 28 proposals, 16 of which notably centered around [[small solar system body|small Solar System bodies]]. ''[[Lucy (spacecraft)|Lucy]]'', a multiple-flyby mission to the [[Jupiter trojans]], and ''[[Psyche (spacecraft)|Psyche]]'', a mission to the metallic [[asteroid]] [[16 Psyche]], were announced as the winners of the competition in January 2017, with launches in October 2021 and October 2023, respectively.

Both ''Lucy'' and ''Psyche'' were part of a finalist shortlist that was announced by NASA in September 2015, which also included ''[[DAVINCI]]'', a [[Venus]] atmospheric probe, ''[[VERITAS (spacecraft)|VERITAS]]'', a Venus orbiter in the style of ''[[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]]'', and ''[[Near-Earth Object Camera|NEOCam]]'', a [[space observatory]] focusing on the detection of [[Potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous]] [[Near-Earth object]]s. It was the first time since the Discovery Mission 7 and 8 selection in 1999 that five finalists were chosen, as opposed to the traditional three. Each finalist received $3 million to develop their mission proposals, with the ''NEOCam'' concept winning additional year in funding from NASA at the end of the competition. It was also the first time since the selection of Discovery Mission 9 and 10 in 2001 that two missions were chosen to fly in a single round.

==Background==
[[File:PIA19664-MarsInSightLander-Assembly-20150430.jpg|thumb|Construction of the ''[[InSight]]'' spacecraft. Its launch would be delayed to 2018, leaving a 7-year gap in Discovery program launches.]]

Following the conclusion of the Discovery Mission 12 competition, the congressional deadline for the next Announcement of Opportunity (AO) was set for May 1, 2014. The [[United States Congress]] approved of a $75 million increase in the budget for the Discovery program from the [[Obama Administration]]'s original [[2014 United States federal budget|FY14]] request, as with other divisions and projects at NASA.&lt;ref name="vankane-budget"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kane|first1=Van|title=NASA Budget: Will there be money for the mortgage payments?|url=http://futureplanets.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/nasa-budget-will-there-be-money-for.html|website=Future Planetary Exploration|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105022309/http://futureplanets.blogspot.com.au/2014/01/nasa-budget-will-there-be-money-for.html|archivedate=January 5, 2017|date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials from NASA's [[Science Mission Directorate]], however, stated in January 2014 that this deadline would not be met, and that it would possibly be delayed by several months. [[James L. Green|James "Jim" Green]], Director of NASA's Planetary Science Division, noted in a press conference that "they gave us the date of May 1st, and that's not realistic," stating that the deadline was not feasible in context of the declining budget allocated for the Discovery program over the past decade.&lt;ref name="planetarysociety-ao"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Foust|first1=Jeff|title=NASA Will Miss Congressional Deadline for Next Discovery Solicitation|url=http://spacenews.com/39231nasa-will-miss-congressional-deadline-for-next-discovery-solicitation/|website=[[SpaceNews]]|publisher=Pocket Ventures, LLC|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170105021918/http://spacenews.com/39231nasa-will-miss-congressional-deadline-for-next-discovery-solicitation/|archivedate=January 5, 2017|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, a draft AO for the 13th mission of the Discovery Program was released by the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], outlining a process in which three finalists will be chosen to receive $3 million to further develop their proposals, with the winner receiving $450 million in funding to construct their spacecraft and operate the mission, excluding launch costs – a $50 million decrease from the $500 million in funding originally anticipated by NASA.&lt;ref name="vankane-budget"/&gt; The draft AO, which included potential financial incentives for technologies that would eventually make it into the final AO for Discovery Mission 13, such as the Heat Shield for Extreme Entry Environment Technology (HEEET) and the [[Deep Space Optical Communications]] (DSOC)&lt;ref name="DSOC"/&gt; The device will be able to increase spacecraft communications performance and efficiency by 10 to 100 times over conventional means.&lt;ref name=DSOC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greicius"/&gt; stated an anticipated release date for the final AO in September 2014 – four months after the original congressional deadline.&lt;ref name="planetarysociety-ao"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=NASA Science Mission Directorate|title=NASA Discovery Program Draft Announcement of Opportunity|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=45337|website=SpaceRef|publisher=SpaceRef Interactive Inc.|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140222205001/http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=45337|archivedate=February 22, 2014|date=February 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official text of the draft was released in full on July 2, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DRAFT Announcement of Opportunity - Discovery 2014|url=https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/viewrepositorydocument/cmdocumentid=422861/solicitationId=%7BE688B67C-F571-CD88-D577-5DBEE9C425F6%7D/viewSolicitationDocument=1/Discovery2014draftAOFINAL.pdf|website=NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES)|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]]|accessdate=5 January 2017|date=July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the final AO being released on November 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Releases Discovery Call for Proposals|url=https://discovery.msfc.nasa.gov/news/index.cfml?ID=1122|website=[[Discovery Program|Discovery Program Office]]|publisher=[[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)]]|accessdate=January 5, 2017|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tygielski|first1=Julie|title=Release of Discovery 2014 Announcement of Opportunity|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/planetary_news/2014/11/05/release-of-discovery-2014-announcement-of-opportunity/|website=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]|accessdate=January 5, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105025438/http://www.lpi.usra.edu/planetary_news/2014/11/05/release-of-discovery-2014-announcement-of-opportunity/|archivedate=January 5, 2017|date=November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal investigator Linda Elkins-Tanton stated that the ''Psyche'' team had spent up to six months preparing for the visit, though remarking that "was almost not enough time [...] presenting answers to these complex and technical questions about our mission really took the team of about 140 people many long and hard-worked days."&lt;ref name="asu-sitevisit"/&gt;

The '''serfdom in Tibet controversy''' rests on [[China|Chinese]] claims of [[moral authority]] for governing [[Tibet]], portraying Tibet as a "feudal serfdom" and a "hell on earth" prior to its [[Invasion of Tibet (1950)|invasion in 1950]].&lt;ref name="Powers 122"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 122&lt;/ref&gt;  Claims of [[unfree labour]] practices have been a recurrent theme, covering periods both before and after the Chinese takeover. Supporters of the Chinese position highlight statements by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that, prior to 1959, 95% of Tibetans lived in "feudal serfdom",&lt;ref name="white" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/features/Tibetpaper/tb1.html|title=White Paper on Tibet's March Forward|accessdate=2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cite cases of abuse and cruelty in the traditional Tibetan system.&lt;ref name="Goldstein 199756"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; Western responses have tended to attempt to discredit the Chinese claims as part of an effort to discredit the takeover of Tibet.

== The idea of Tibet and the concept of serfdom ==

One of the central points of contention in the debate about labour and human rights in the historical region of Tibet before and after its incorporation into the modern state of the People's Republic of China is the very definition of Tibet and serfdom itself, with some scholars claiming that the debate is framed around [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric]] and [[Anachronism|anachronistic]] ideas about statehood and society which are projected onto the history of the area in a way that distorts understanding. Some western scholars reject claims of "serfdom in Tibet" outright based on the view that "Tibet" cannot be defined as one political entity or [[social system]]; its political and [[socioeconomic]] structures have varied greatly over time and between sub-districts. The various polities comprising Tibet have changed significantly over the past 2,000 years, and even during the modern period there have been dramatic changes in what Tibet is, as anthropologist Geoff Childs writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Tibet] has undergone numerous political transformations from a unified empire (640–842) incorporating parts of what are now Nepal, India, Pakistan, and several provinces of China (Gansu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan), to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (842–1248), to protectorate under the power of an expanding Mongol empire (1248–1368), back to a collection of independent and sometimes antagonistic kingdoms and polities associated with various monasteries (1368–1642), to a centralized state under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1642–1720), to a protectorate of the Manchu Qing Dynasty (1720–1911), and finally to a nation having de facto independence under the clerical administration of the Dalai Lamas (1911–1951)"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Childs|first=Geoff|date=2003|title=Polyandry and population growth in a historical Tibetan society|url=http://case.edu/affil/tibet/booksAndPapers/childs.polyandry.and.population.growth.pdf|journal=The History of the Family|volume=8|pages=423–444|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Although  the central leadership in [[Lhasa]] had authority of these areas for various periods, some Western writers claim that this did not imply the kind of political control of modern Western states. According to [[Luciano Petech]], "K'ams [the [[Kham]] region, largely synonymous with the province of XIkang which was abolished in 1950] was practically independent of Lhasa under its great lamas"  in the 18th century CE.&lt;ref name="Petech 5198"&gt;Petech 1973, pp. 51, 98&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the areas of [[Qinghai]] with large Tibetan populations were not continuously ruled by Lhasa, including in the period leading up to the establishment of the PRC (in the late 1930s and 1940s) when the [[Kuomintang]] Muslim warlord [[Ma Bufang]] ruled Qinghai within the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g3C2B9oXVbQC&amp;dq=ma+bufang+son&amp;q=genocidal#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20chairmen%20lords%20and%20slaves&amp;f=false|title=Dilemmas The Mongols at China's edge: history and the politics of national unity |author=Uradyn Erden Bulag|year=2002|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=|page=54|isbn=0-7425-1144-8|pages=|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[definitions of Tibet|definition of Tibet]] has been contested with a map of competing claims identifying six distinct types of Tibetan regions claimed by various entities. In the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912) and in the ROC (1912-1949), the part of Tibet governed by Lhasa was limited to the modern [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], and did not include the Kham ([[Xikang Province|Xikang) Province]] of China. Meanwhile, the western part of Xikang (i.e. [[Qamdo, Tibet|Qamdo]]) and [[Qinghai]] was only occupied by Lhasa in the Tibet-Kham War which lasted from the 1910s to 1930s.

Generally, the government of the PRC also limits Tibet to the area it has designated the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], consisting of the traditional areas of Ü, Tsang, [[Ngari Prefecture|Ngari]], along with Qamdo (i.e. the western Kham/Xikang) which was legally incorporated into the TAR when Xikang Province was abolished by the [[National People's Congress|NPC]] in 1955. The Tibetan government in exile claims that other ethnically Tibetan areas to the east and to the north also belong to Tibet, i.e. "[[Greater Tibet]]". These areas now respectively belong to Qinghai Province, [[Gansu Province]], [[Sichuan Province]] and [[Yunnan Province]] of China.&lt;ref name="Powers 163"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 163&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhanghao"&gt;{{cite journal |language=zh-hans |last1=Zhang |first1=Hao (张皓) |script-title=zh:1931年中国内部各方关于康藏冲突的协商 |journal=''{{lang|zh-hans|西北民族大学学报(哲学社会科学版)}}' ([[Northwest University for Nationalities]] university paper |year=2015 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;{{cite journal |language=zh-hans |last1=Wang |first1=Xiaobin (王小彬) |script-title=zh:“中华人民共和国昌都地区人民解放委员会”隶属关系的历史沿革 |journal=''{{lang|zh-hans|中国藏学}}'' [China Tibetology] |year=2010 |issue=3 |page=41&amp;ndash;47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholarship frequently represents a limited survey, restricted to the central region of Tibet, and may not accurately represent the whole of cultural Tibet or all Tibetan speaking peoples.

Discussing the [[Social classes of Tibet|social structure of Tibet]] inevitably leads to difficulties with defining terms. Not only may [[serf]] and [[feudalism]] be Western terms inappropriate for Asian use but the geography and peoples of Tibet vary according to interpreter. The lack of agreement of the various sides as to terminology highlights that the "serfdom in Tibet" controversy is a politicised debate, with the term "feudal serfdom" largely being used by the People's Republic of China as a justification for their taking control of Tibet. According to the PRC:&lt;blockquote&gt;...there was a historically imperative need for the progress of Tibetan society and the welfare of the Tibetan people to expel the imperialists and shake off the yoke of feudal serfdom. The founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 brought hope for the deeply distressed Tibetan people. In conforming to the law of historical development and the interests of the Tibetan people, the Central People's Government worked actively to bring about Tibet's peaceful liberation. After that, important policies and measures were adopted for Tibet's Democratic Reform, regional autonomy, large-scale modernization and reform and opening-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17564.htm|title=Tibet's March Toward Modernization|year=2001|publisher=People's Republic of China|accessdate=2008-07-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515222305/http://english.gov.cn/official/2005-07/27/content_17564.htm|archivedate=2008-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the Tibetan government in exile responds: &lt;blockquote&gt;
...the Chinese justifications make no sense. First of all, international law does not accept justifications of this type. No country is allowed to invade, occupy, annex and colonize another country just because its social structure does not please it. Secondly, the PRC is responsible for bringing more suffering in the name of liberation. Thirdly, necessary reforms were initiated and Tibetans are quite capable of doing so.&lt;ref name="tibet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white4.html|title=Traditional society and democratic framework for future Tibet  |year=1996|publisher=Tibetan Government-in-Exile|accessdate=2008-07-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080410151700/http://www.tibet.com/WhitePaper/white4.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Competing versions of Tibetan history==
It is difficult to find academic consensus on the nature of society in Tibetan history. Sources on the [[history of Tibet]] are available from both pro-Chinese and pro-Tibetan writers.

Pro-Chinese materials may be published by mainstream Western printers, or within the People's Republic of China. Tibetan materials, similarly, may be published by mainstream Western printers, or by the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]]. Both sides hope to persuade foreign readers to support their own point of view through these publications.&lt;ref name="Powers6 7"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the pro-Chinese works in English on the subject were translated from Chinese. Translators are not named, but censors are.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Asian studies scholar John Powers concludes that ideology was the most powerful influence on the translations: "In contemporary China, the Communist Party strictly controls the presentation of history, and several formal resolutions have been issued by the Central Committee, which are intended to guide historians in the "correct" interpretation of historical events and actors." &lt;ref name="Powers 12"&gt;Powers 2004, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  The writings of contemporary Chinese historians conform to [[Marxist-Leninist]] doctrine, which asserts that societies progress from primitive communism, to slave societies, which are then overthrown and replaced by feudalism, which are in their turn overthrown and replaced by capitalism, which is followed - via rebellion, again - by socialism, which may progress peacefully toward communism. Several Chinese sources insert peasant rebellions into their accounts of Tibetan history, to achieve conformity with this structure required by political [[dogma]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Historians in China are prevented from performing research that could challenge orthodoxy. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Marx]] condemned religion as "the opiate of the masses", and this doctrine is also infused in Chinese writings on history.&lt;ref name="Powers 12 14"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance with their political perspectives, Chinese sources claim that the common Tibetans suffered appallingly before the Chinese takeover.&lt;ref name="Powers19 20"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Western authors' writings on Tibetan history are sometimes controversial. For example, whilst Hugh Richardson, who lived in Lhasa in the 1930s and 1940s, before the takeover by the PRC in 1951, writes in ''Tibet and Its History'' that Chinese versions of Tibetan history are contemptible and he considers the Chinese rule brutal and illegal,&lt;ref name="Powers 16"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Israel Epstein]], a naturalized Chinese citizen born in Poland  who similarly claims the authority of first-hand knowledge, although following the Chinese takeover, supports Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="Powers 17 18"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 17-18&lt;/ref&gt; There are few academic assessments of the recent history of Tibet. Anthropologist and historian [[Melvyn Goldstein]], who is fluent in Tibetan and has done considerable fieldwork with Tibetans in exile and in Tibet, considers pre-1950 Tibet to have been a feudal theocracy impaired by corrupt and incompetent leaders.&lt;ref name="Powers 21"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 21&lt;/ref&gt; It was ''de facto'' independent of China from 1911 to 1949, but not recognised as ''de jure'' independent of China by any nation, including its protective power Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein 1989, ps. 815-824&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese side seeks to persuade international perception as to the appropriate nature and justifiability of Chinese rule in Tibet. Their position is that Tibet truly and historically belongs to China, that affairs of Tibet are internal matters, and Tibetans seek to internationalize their cause, in part by convincing readers that Tibet was independent.&lt;ref name="Powers 8"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrating as it does on questions of national sovereignty, the official position of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] is more moderate in tone than that of some of its more extreme supporters who conflate the rule of the lamas with [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan Buddhist]] ideals, seeking to promote a Buddhist dogma that competes with the Marxist dogma of "feudal serfdom" by portraying Tibet under the [[lama]]s as, in [[Robert Thurman]]'s words: "a mandala of the peaceful, perfected universe".&lt;ref&gt;Inner Revolution: Robert Thurman&lt;/ref&gt;

Tibetologist Robert Barnett&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/weai/faculty/barnett.html|title=The Faculty and Scholars of the Weatherhead East Asian Institute: Robert J. Barnett|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes:

:"Chinese references to preliberation conditions in Tibet thus appear to be aimed at creating popular support for Beijing's project in Tibet. These claims have particular resonance among people who share the assumption—based on nineteenth-century Western theories of "social evolution" that are still widely accepted in China—that certain forms of society are "backward" and should be helped to evolve by more "advanced" societies. This form of prejudice converges with some earlier Chinese views and with vulgar Marxist theories that imagine a vanguard movement liberating the oppressed classes or nationalities in a society, whether or not those classes agree that they are oppressed. Moreover, the Chinese have to present that oppression as very extensive, and that society as very primitive, in order to explain why there were no calls by the Tibetan peasantry for Chinese intervention on their behalf.

:The question of Tibet's social history is therefore highly politicized, and Chinese claims in this respect are intrinsic to the functioning of the PRC, and not some free act of intellectual exploration. They have accordingly to be treated with caution. From a human rights point of view, the question of whether Tibet was feudal in the past is irrelevant. A more immediate question is why the PRC does not allow open discussion of whether Tibet was feudal or oppressive. Writers and researchers in Tibet face serious repercussions if they do not concur with official positions on issues such as social conditions in Tibet prior to its "liberation," and in such a restrictive climate, the regime's claims on this issue have little credibility."&lt;ref name="barnett84"&gt;Barnett 2008, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===The political debate===
Chinese sources portray Tibet before 1950 as a feudal serfdom in which serfs suffered terribly under the despotic rule of [[lama]]s and [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]s. Some Tibetan sources describe the people as happy, content, and devoted to Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Powers18 19"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand the Tibetan [[Phuntsok Wangyal]], who founded the Tibetan communist party in the 40's, describes the old system as unequal and exploitative.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, and Siebenschuh 2004, pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest publications in English to apply the term "serf" to Tibet was [[Marxist]] sympathiser [[Anna Louise Strong]]'s work from 1960, ''When Serfs Stood up in Tibet'', published by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="Powers 167"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Another seminal promoter of the term is historian&lt;ref name="nych"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyhumanities.org/speakers/adult_audiences/speaker.php?speaker_id=223|title=A.

[[Melvyn Goldstein]] has produced many works on Tibetan society since the 1960s and used "serf" to translate the Tibetan term ''mi ser'' (literally "yellow person";&lt;ref name="Powers 168"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 168&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as peasant"&lt;ref name="wmc4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and to describe both the landless peasant classes and the wealthier land holding and taxpaying class of families. He has written, "with the exception of about 300 noble families, all laymen and laywomen in Tibet were serfs (''Mi ser'') bound via ascription by parallel descent to a particular lord (dPon-po) though an estate, in other words sons were ascribed to their father's lord but daughters to their mother's lord."&lt;ref name="CAJ7115"&gt;Goldstein, Central Asiatic Journal, pg. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1989 book ''A History of Modern Tibet'' Goldstein argued that although serfdom was prevalent in Tibet, this did not mean that it was an entirely static society. There were several types of serf sub-status, of which one of the most important was the "human lease", which enabled a serf to acquire a degree of personal freedom. This was an alternative which, despite retaining the concept of lordship, partially freed the ''mi ser'' from obligations to a landed estate, usually for an annual fee.&lt;ref name="Goldstein JAS7152134"&gt;Goldstein, ''Journal of Asian Studies'', May 1971, pp. 521-34&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1997 Goldstein used the term "serf" in the following, more cautious, way "...monastic and aristocratic elites ... held most of the land in Tibet in the form of feudal estates with hereditarily bound serflike peasants."&lt;ref name="Goldstein 199735"&gt;Goldstein 1997, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; Powers has characterized Goldstein as "generally pro-China"&lt;ref name="Powers 24"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; but also called his ''History of Modern Tibet'' "the most balanced treatment".&lt;ref name="Powers 17"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein describes himself as having conservative political views.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to WTN by Goldstein July 2008, quoted on http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?id=22134&amp;article=Goldstein's+Response+to+Jamyang+Norbu.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to William Monroe Coleman, China misrepresents Goldstein's usage as support for their version of Tibetan history.&lt;ref name="wmc4"/&gt;

Goldstein distinguished serfdom from feudalism, and applied the term "serfdom" but not "feudalism" to old Tibet.&lt;ref name="wmc11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, he made some effort to avoid appearing to support China's invasion of Tibet, writing that the PRC left the traditional system in place, not only after the invasion of 1950, but even after the Dalai Lama's flight into exile in 1959.  He pointed out that in 1950, Chinese rhetoric claimed that China was freeing Tibet, not from serfdom, but from imperialist influence.&lt;ref name="exchoice109"&gt;Goldstein, "Reexamining Choice" (1986), pg. 109&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, his usage has been misinterpreted as support for the Chinese Marxist viewpoint, in which feudalism and serfdom are inseparable, and old Tibet is consistently described as "feudal serfdom".&lt;ref name="wmc11"/&gt;

Not all writers who use the term "serfdom" to describe pre-Communist society in Tibet do so pejoratively. [[Pico Iyer]], a journalist whose father is a friend of the Dalai Lama and who has himself been in private conversation with him for over thirty years writes: "Almost as soon as he came into exile, in 1959, the Dalai Lama seized the chance to get rid of much of the red tape and serfdom that had beset Tibet in the past".&lt;ref name="Iyer 176"&gt;Iyer 2008, p.176&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama himself used the term "serf" in 1991, saying: "The relationship between landlord and serf was much milder in Tibet than in China and conditions for the poor were much less harsh."&lt;ref&gt;Freedom in Exile, HHDL 1991. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Tibetan sources portray Tibetan peasants and workers to support their own view of a Tibetan people who were not only independent of China, but found the Chinese alien and incomprehensible, and who suffered genocide under Chinese rule.&lt;ref name="Powers9 12"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Edward Richardson|Richardson]], the British Trade Envoy to Tibet in the 1940s, agrees with Tibetan authors, stating there was little difference between the rich and the poor.&lt;ref name="Powers22"&gt;Powers 2004, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Thomas Laird notes that scholars debate the applicability of these terms to Tibet, and struggle with a lack of sufficient data.&lt;ref name="Laird 3179"&gt;Laird 2006, pp.317-9&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Barbara Crossette asserted in 1998 that "scholars of Tibet mostly agree that there has been no systematic serfdom in Tibet in centuries."&lt;ref&gt;Crossette 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibetan Government-in-Exile says about conditions in Tibet pre-Communism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Traditional Tibetan society was, by no means, perfect and was in need of changes. The Dalai Lama and other Tibetan leaders have admitted as much. That is the reason why the Dalai Lama initiated far-reaching reforms in Tibet as soon as he assumed temporal authority. The traditional Tibetan society, however, was not nearly as bad as China would have us believe.
&lt;ref name="tibet.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The academic debate===
The academic debate as to whether "serf" is an applicable term for a society such as pre-Communist Tibet continues to this day. Goldstein and Miller's exchanges in an academic journal between 1986 and 1989 were a notable part of this debate. The applicability of the concept of serfdom to Tibet was debated between Melvyn Goldstein and anthropologist Beatrice D. Miller of Wisconsin University over a series of five articles in the ''Tibet Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.case.edu/affil/tibet/tibetanSociety/social.htm|title=Tibetan History and Social &amp; Political Structure|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate was initiated by Goldstein in the XI edition of the ''Tibet Journal'', in which he defended his description of the features of Tibetan society as being very comparable to European serfdom.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1986) pp.80-86&lt;/ref&gt; He based the comparison on the features of serfdom described by French historian Marc Bloch including:&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1986) p.81&lt;/ref&gt;

* The status was hereditary.
* A serf, unlike a slave, had rights and possessed but did not own productive resources (land).
* The lord had the legal right to command his serfs, including judicial authority over him or her.

Goldstein argued that Tibetan society fulfilled all these requirements, and argued in detail against the specific diverging opinions of fellow scholars Miller, Micheal, Dargyay and Aziz. He underpinned his assertions by research, first hand accounts and case studies, and responded to criticisms which had been voiced by these researchers in the preceding years.

Only Miller responded in the next ''The Tibet Journal'', in a short letter, in 1987. She acknowledged Goldstein's scholarship, stating "Goldstein's article ... cannot be faulted. It is an outstanding example of his exemplary collection of fine data."&lt;ref name="miller65"&gt;Miller (1987) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; She disagreed however with his interpretation, specifically the use of the word "serf" and challenged him by asserting the following:

* That a lord also had obligations to the central government, so the specific obligations of a peasant (Tibetan: "mi ser") to a lord were only examples of societal obligations which everyone had.&lt;ref name="miller65" /&gt;
* That the obligations owed to a lord were by the family collective, and not "personal" or individual.&lt;ref name="miller66"&gt;Miller (1987) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;
* That the obligations of a peasant were not so onerous as it was easy to run away.&lt;ref name="miller66-67"&gt;Miller (1987) pp.66-67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following issue Goldstein replied in brief arguing:

* The nature of the lord's relation with the central government was radically different from the peasant/lord relation and not relevant to the peasant/lord relation he was discussing.
* While corvee obligations fell primarily on households, a peasant's legal status very much related to his person, was hereditary and not rescindable.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.62&lt;/ref&gt;
* He pointed out that running away was illegal, punishable, and that European serfs also ran away.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.64&lt;/ref&gt;
* He strongly disagreed with Miller's assertion that the peasant/lord relation was fundamentally contractual.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1988) p.65&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later publication and response Goldstein agreed to differ on the use of the word "serf" to prevent a terminological discussion distracting from the examination of societal conditions. He argued that running away was an act of desperation severing familial, social and economic ties.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989) p.56&lt;/ref&gt; He discussed the form of partial manumission known as "human lease" and argued that: it only temporarily freed from daily service but not occasional service at the lord's discretion; the payment of an annual fee decided by the lord was required; it was revocable at will by the lord. Thus he felt it was a very weak form of manumission.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein (1989) pp.56-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleman, integrating Goldstein's research with subsequent work done by other scholars including Rebecca French, Graham Clarke, and Franz Michael, argues that Goldstein overemphasized the ''de jure'' status of the ''mi ser'' at the expense of ''de facto'' characteristics - a high degree of social and economic mobility, and hence autonomy; frequently successful negotiations with lords to improve their status; and flight from untenable situations such as unpayable debts and exorbitant labor requirements.&lt;ref name="wmc710"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that "serf" is a misleading term for the Tibetan ''mi ser''.&lt;ref name="wmc2022"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/ealac/barnett/pdfs/link3-coleman-ch3-4.pdf|title=The Discourse of Serfdom in Tibet|accessdate=2010-03-29|pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human rights in Tibet==
{{Main|Human rights in Tibet}}
In the political debate regarding the nature of pre-Communist Tibet, Chinese sources assert [[human rights]] abuses as a justification for the Communist invasion. Both before and after the Communist takeover of 1950 there have been examples of human rights abuses, both state-sanctioned and otherwise. The political debate associated with the Serfdom in Tibet controversy rests on whether these incidents justify the positions of the opposing parties. Sympathisers of the Chinese government's position view the pre-1950s abuses as justifying the Communist regime in the [[Tibetan Autonomous Region]]. Supporters of the Tibetan Government in Exile argue that the 13th Dalai Lama had already effected reforms which were ahead of the world at the time, and that further reforms were underway, and no outside intervention was justified.

===Prior to 1950===
Judicial mutilation - principally the gouging out of eyes, and the cutting off of hands or feet - was formalized under the [[Sakya]] school as part of the 13th century Tibetan legal code, and was used as a legal punishment until being declared illegal in 1913 by a proclamation of the [[13th Dalai Lama]].&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Barnett 2008, pp. 81-83&lt;/ref&gt; In this same reform, the Dalai Lama banned capital punishment, making Tibet one of the first countries to do so (preceding, for instance, Switzerland, Britain, and France).&lt;ref name="acme"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamyangnorbu.com/blog/2008/08/17/acme-of-obscenity/|title=Acme of Obscenity|accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 14th Dalai Lama's brother Jigme Norbu reports that, along with these reforms, living conditions in jails were improved, with officials being designated to see that these conditions and rules were maintained."&lt;ref name="Norbu 317"&gt;Norbu 1968, pg. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laird 244"&gt;Laird 2006, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of mutilation have been recorded in Tibet in the period between the start of the 20th century and the Chinese occupation. Tibetan communist Phuntso Wangye recalled his anger at seeing freshly severed human ears hanging from the gate of the county headquarters in Damshung north of Lhasa in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Sherap, Siebenschuh 2004 p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert W. Ford]], one of the few Westerners to have been appointed by the [[Tibet (1912–51)|Government of Tibet]] at the time of ''de facto'' [[Tibet (1912–1951)|independent Tibet]], spent five years in Tibet, from 1945 to 1950, before his arrest by the invading Chinese army. In his book ''Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet'', he writes

{{quote|"All over Tibet I had seen men who had been deprived of an arm or a leg for theft (...) Penal amputations were done without antiseptics or sterile dressings".&lt;ref&gt;''Wind Between the Worlds: Captured in Tibet'' by [[Robert W. Ford]] (1957), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Heinrich Harrer]] who lived in Tibet at the same time (1944 to 1951) wrote in his book "Return to Tibet" that these treatments had already ceased at that time:
{{quote|"The so-called "chamber of horrors" at the foot of the Potala is also no longer shown. I believe that the Chinese were perfectly well aware that they were conning the tourists with displays of desiccated human arms, flutes made from femurs, and silver-mounted skulls; these objects, they used to maintain, testified to torture, flogging and other atrocities. Even Wangdu was so much under Chinese influence that he confirmed the atrocity stories spread by the Chinese about the Tibetans. He reminded me that in the days of the fifth Dalai Lama (in the eighteenth century), and even under the thirteenth (1900- 33), Tibetans still had their hands and feet chopped off. In reply to my direct question he had to admit that this had ceased to happen during my time in Tibet."&lt;ref&gt;''Return to Tibet'' by [[Heinrich Harrer]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because Tibetan Buddhism prohibits killing, mutilation and other extremely cruel punishments were widely used instead in old Tibet. The mutilation of top level Tibetan official [[Lungshar]] in 1934 gave an example. Tsepon [[Lungshar]], an official educated in England, introduced reform in the 1920s; after losing a political struggle the reformist was sentenced to be blinded by having his eyeballs pulled out. "The method involved the placement of a smooth, round yak's knucklebone on each of the temples of the prisoner. These were then tied by leather thongs around the head and tightened by turning the thongs with a stick on top of the head until the eyeballs popped out. The mutilation was terribly bungled. Only one eyeball popped out, and eventually the ragyaba had to cut out the other eyeball with a knife. Boiling oil was then poured into the sockets to cauterize the wound." &lt;ref name="Lee Feigon"&gt;Demystifying Tibet: unlocking the secrets of the Land of the Snows pp. 127&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GoldHist208"&gt;A History of Modern Tibet, 1913-1951, Melvyn C. Goldstein pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt; This was sufficiently unusual that the untouchables (''ragyaba'') carrying it out had no previous experience of the correct technique and had to rely on instructions heard from their parents. An attempt was made at anesthetizing the alleged criminal with intoxicants before performing the punishment, which unfortunately did not work well.&lt;ref name="GoldHist208" /&gt;

As late as 1949 the Tibetan government still sentenced people to mutilation. When an CIA officer [[Douglas Mackiernan]] was killed against official entry permit, six Tibetan border guards were tried and sentenced in Lhasa. "The leader was to have his nose and both ears cut off. The man who fired the first shot was to lose both ears. A third man was to lose one ear, and the others were to get 50 lashes each." The sentence was reduced to 200, 50 and 25 lashes, respectively, after another CIA agent [[Frank Bessac]] requested leniency.&lt;ref name="These Tibetans killed an American"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frank Bessac]]|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ksEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA131| date=13 November 1950|publisher=Time Inc|pages=131–141|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whipping was legal and common as punishment&lt;ref&gt;French (1995) pp. 276, 316, 321-322&lt;/ref&gt; in Tibet including in the 20th century, also for minor infractions and outside judicial process. Whipping could also have fatal consequences, as in the case of the trader Gyebo Sherpa subjected to the severe ''corca'' whipping for selling cigarettes. He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 1989 p163&lt;/ref&gt; Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13-year-old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, Tsering, and Siebenschuh, 1997 pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In its ''100 Questions and Answers About Tibet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|title=100 Questions and Answers About Tibet|publisher=China Tibet Information Center|accessdate=2008-06-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060331121008/http://zt.tibet.cn/tibetzt/question_e/1/menu.htm|archive-date=2006-03-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[People's Republic of China]] states that [[human rights]] were 'severely infringed upon' by the [[Dalai Lama]]'s administration. The evidence for these accusations is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Barnett, Robert, in: Blondeau, Anne-Marie and  Buffetrille, Katia (eds).  ''Authenticating Tibet: Answers to China's 100 Questions''  (2008) University of California Press. {{ISBN|978-0-520-24464-1}} (cloth); {{ISBN|978-0-520-24928-8}} (paper)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to writer Rebecca French, Tibetans viewed criminal offenses as uncommon, but there are few records to establish frequency. However, Tibetans also believe that theft and banditry were common especially along trade routes.&lt;ref name="French315"&gt;French (1995) p.315-316&lt;/ref&gt; Because it was considered harsh by most Tibetans, they tended to seek alternative settlements and leniency from local courts instead of pursuing government action in disputes. Local officials were also more likely to find peaceful outcomes in a community setting than to resort to harsher government resolution.&lt;ref name="French315" /&gt;

Political power could play a role in a judicial process in Tibet. In the eye gouging case above the alleged criminal was a deposed member of the Kashag called Lungshar who had proposed democratic reform. The charge was planning a coup and the attempted murder of another Kashag member who opposed reform. It was strenuously denied by the accused. Conviction was based on the evidence of one informer who claimed to have seen a document which was never produced. He was richly rewarded, and the trial seems to have been a show trial by traditionalists seeking to prevent reform. From arrest to execution of the sentence was only ten days, limiting the possibilities of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, pp. 200-210&lt;/ref&gt;

One evidence of Chinese brutality in Eastern Tibet was reported by an American missionary in the following terms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no method of torture known that is not practised in here on these Tibetans, slicing, boiling, tearing asunder and all …To sum up what China is doing here in eastern Tibet, the main things are collecting taxes, robbing, oppressing, confiscating, and allowing her representatives to burn and loot and steal.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Believing that the American missionary's account might be a mistake, Sir Eric Teichman, a British diplomat, noted that whatever brutality existed, it was "in no way due to any action of the Chinese government in Peking or the provincial authorities in Szechuana."&lt;ref name="Teichman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Teichman|title=Travels of a Consular Officer in Eastern Tibet: Together with a History of the Relations Between China, Tibet and India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un88AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA228|year=1983|publisher=Cambridge University Archive|page=228|id=GGKEY:C7S43JE1DN6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slavery===
[[Israel Epstein]] wrote that prior to the Communist takeover, poverty in Tibet was so severe that in some of the worst cases peasants had to hand over children to the manor as household slaves or [[nangzan]], because they were too poor to raise them.&lt;ref name="Laird 46"&gt;Epstein 1983, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Laird asserted that in the 1940s Tibetan peasants were well off and immune to famine, whereas starvation was common in China.&lt;ref name="Laird 3189"&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 318-9&lt;/ref&gt; According to other sources, the so-called "slaves" were domestic servants (nangtsen) and managers of estates in reality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://savetibet.ru/img/2010/tibet-book-eng.pdf Kuzmin, S.L. ''Hidden Tibet: History of Independence and Occupation''. Dharamsala, LTWA, 2011, p. 135]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 the British army invaded and held the Tibetan [[Chumbi Valley]], in the border region adjacent to Bhutan and India. [[Charles Alfred Bell|Sir Charles Bell]] was put in charge of the district from September 1904 to November 1905&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992, pg. xviii&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote that slavery was still practiced in Chumbi but had declined greatly over the previous thirty years. He noted that only a dozen or two dozen slaves remained, unlike nearby [[Bhutan]] where [[slavery in Bhutan|slavery was more widespread]]. Bell further remarked, "The slavery in the Chumpi valley was of a very mild type. If a slave was not well treated, it was easy for him to escape into [[Sikkim]] and [[British Raj|British India]]."&lt;ref&gt;Bell 1992, pp. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibetan welfare after the Chinese takeover===
Just as the Chinese and the Tibetan exile community argue over whether common Tibetans suffered or flourished before the Chinese takeover, they take diametrically opposing views on the fate of ordinary Tibetans since 1950.  This is understood to be highly important in persuading readers of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of Chinese rule.  Chinese sources in English claim rapid progress for prosperous, free, and happy Tibetans participating in democratic reforms. Tibetans, on the other hand, write of Chinese genocide in Tibet, comparing the Chinese to the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Powers11 12"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cultural Revolution]], according to Powers, scholar Warren Smith, whose work became focused on Tibetan history and politics after spending five months in Tibet in 1982, portrays the Chinese as chauvinists who believe they are superior to the Tibetans, and claims that the Chinese use torture, coercion and starvation to control the Tibetans.&lt;ref name="Powers23 24"&gt;Powers 2004, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tibet Autonomous Region is much poorer than other provinces of China. In 1980, in order to help Tibet out of poverty, the 1st Tibet Work Forum (moderated by [[Hu Yaobang]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]), decided to give the Tibet Autonomous Region financial support, in order to build a "united, prosperous, civilized new Tibet". After this Forum, in the Tibet Autonomous Region, all taxes on agriculture and animal husbandry were waived, while other provinces had to wait until 2006 for the same. The old “[[people's commune]]” economic system was dismantled (while in other provinces it was ended in 1985), so farmland started to be used by the household, and livestock started to be owned and used by the household. In the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region is the only provincial level administrative region that enjoys some tax incentives, and after 1988 is the only provincial level administrative region that receives growing substantial quota subsidies from the central government. Under the "partner assistance" policy, all the rich provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government, most of the Central Government organs, and some central enterprises respectively assist the prefectures and cities of the Tibet Autonomous Region. With this assistance, in 1988, the Tibet Autonomous Region eliminated its fiscal deficit for the first time in history. As the only provincial level "poverty-stricken areas which lie in vast, contiguous stretches" in the People's Republic of China, the Tibet Autonomous Region developed a lot of anti-poverty programs, and the impoverished population has been shrinking substantially. However, there are still many difficulties in poverty reduction.&lt;ref name=you/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|zh-hans|罗绒战堆, 西藏的贫困与反贫困问题研究, 中国藏学出版社}}, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Until the end of 2012, the social security system in the Tibet Autonomous Region has been completely established. This system not only includes ordinary people, but also all the 29,000 monks and nuns of Tibetan Buddhism in the Tibet Autonomous Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=zh-hans |url=http://xw.sinoins.com/2013-12/17/content_82593.htm|script-title=zh:西藏2.9万在编僧尼全部纳入社会保障体系|date=2013-12-17|publisher=中国保险报·中保网|accessdate=2015-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence of human rights infringements, including the 2006 [[Nangpa La shootings]]. See [[human rights in the People's Republic of China]] and [[Human rights in Tibet]] (include all the Tibetan areas) for an overview. The ''Human Rights Watch World Report 2008: Events in China 2007'' states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Widespread and numerous instances of repression target ordinary citizens, monks, nuns, and even children in an effort to quash alleged "separatism." Seven Tibetan boys in [[Gansu Province|Gansu province]] were detained for over a month in early September after they allegedly wrote slogans on the walls of a village police station and elsewhere calling for the return of the Dalai Lama and a free Tibet. Ronggyal Adrak was detained and charged under state security offenses by police on August 1 after he called for the Dalai Lama's return at a horse race festival in [[Sichuan Province|Sichuan province]]. He is awaiting trial. The Chinese government has failed to bring to justice those responsible for the shooting death by People's Armed Police officers of a 17-year-old nun, Kelsang Namtso, while trying to cross the border into Nepal on September 30, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://china.hrw.org/press/other_news/hrw_world_report_2008_events_in_china_in_2007|title=Overview of key developments relating to human rights in China in 2007|year=2008|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2008-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is notable in this Report that most of the examples are not in the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]], but in other provinces of China, such as Gansu Province and Sichuan Province (Tibetan areas in Sichuan are the eastern part of Kham). These areas (i.e. the Tibetan areas in Sichuan Province, Gansu Province, Yunnan Province and Qinghai Province) were not included in political Tibet, so they were not involved in the Serfs' Emancipation, which was in the Tibet Autonomous Region. During the "[[reform and opening up]]" after 1978, when the central government of the PRC gave numerous support policies and substantial financial support to the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan areas in the four provinces did not get the same. Although some of them (such as the [[Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] in Yunnan) are rich enough, others of them are not rich, and some of them in Sichuan, Gansu and Qinghai are poor enough. The Tibetan areas in the four provinces ask the central government to benefit them as the Tibet Autonomous Region. And the poverty in these areas makes some of their Tibetan residents support the idea of "[[Greater Tibet]]" which is claimed by Tibetan exile groups.&lt;ref name=you&gt;尤力, 杨明洪, [http://www.scfpym.gov.cn/show.aspx?id=32294 新形势下西藏与四省藏区协调发展基点研究], 西南民族大学学报(人文社会科学版) 2014年09期&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;廖桂蓉, [http://www.sass.cn/109005/19679.aspx 四川藏区贫困状况及脱贫障碍分析], 农村经济2014年第1期&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, on the 5th Tibet Work Forum, the central government declared its intention to make the Tibetan areas in the four provinces steadily progress as well as the Tibet Autonomous Region. The goal is to bring the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Tibetan areas in the four provinces in line together with the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way in 2020.&lt;ref name=you/&gt;

==Comparison to other regions==

Debate continues as to whether pre-Communist Tibetan society was especially oppressive or was comparable to, or better than, similar social structures in nearby regions. According to the Tibetan Government-in-Exile: "In terms of social mobility and wealth distribution, independent Tibet compared favourably with most Asian countries"&lt;ref name="tibet.com"/&gt; the fact that most [[Dalai Lama]]s, including [[Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama]] and [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama]], came from [[peasant]] families being cited as an example of this. Travelers who witnessed conditions in both China and Tibet in the 1940s found the Tibetan peasants to be far better off than their Chinese counterparts.&lt;ref name="Laird 3189"&gt;Laird 2006, pp. 318-9&lt;/ref&gt;  Academics debate whether tribal cultures, such as the Mongolian nomadic steppe culture, are feudal in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Di Cosmo, Nicola, State Formation and Periodization in ''Inner Asian History Journal of World History'' - Volume 10, Number 1, Spring 1999, pp. 1-40&lt;/ref&gt; Much of [[Mongolia]]n, [[Tibetan history|Tibetan]] and [[History of China|Chinese]] political history is inter-related but the extent of their shared social culture is uncertain.

According to the 'United Nations Research Institute for Social  Development', [[Bonded labour|bonded labor]] and other forms of economic exploitation currently exist in nearby regions including India, Nepal, and {{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}several Chinese provinces.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Research Institute for Social Development. [http://www.unrisd.org/80256B3C005BCCF9/(httpAuxPages)/B4D9538DE438A5F3C1256BB900324E59/$file/shah.pdf ''Layers of Silence:Links between women's vulnerability, trafficking and HIV/AIDS in Bangladesh, India and Nepal''] Draft paper, 2002.

According to the U.S. Dept of State "Trafficking in Persons Report 2008"&lt;ref name="DOSReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2008/|title=US Dept. of State:Trafficking in Persons Report 2008|accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Mongolia]] and [[Pakistan]] are all Tier 2 countries, with China and India both on the Tier 2 watchlist. However no local regions are in Tier 3.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14840">In [[Jungian psychology]], the "'''shadow'''", "'''Id'''", or "'''shadow aspect/archetype'''" may refer to (1) an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious aspect]] of the [[personality]] which the conscious [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] does not identify in itself, or (2) the entirety of the unconscious, i.e., everything of which a person is not fully conscious. In short, the shadow is the "dark side".

Because one tends to reject or remain ignorant of the least desirable aspects of one's personality, the shadow is largely negative. There are, however, positive aspects that may also remain hidden in one's shadow (especially in people with low [[self-esteem]], [[anxieties]], and false beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;Young-Eisendrath, P. and Dawson, T. (1997). The Cambridge Companion to Jung., Cambridge University Press, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; 

Contrary to a [[Freudian]] definition of shadow, the Jungian shadow can include everything outside the light of consciousness and may be positive or negative. "Everyone carries a shadow," Jung wrote, "and the less it is embodied in the individual's conscious life, the blacker and denser it is."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (1938). "Psychology and Religion." In CW 11: ''Psychology and Religion: West and East''. p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; It may be (in part) one's link to more primitive animal instincts,&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (1952). "Answer to Job." In CW 11: ''Psychology and Religion: West and East''. p.1 2&lt;/ref&gt; which are superseded during early childhood by the conscious mind.

[[Carl Jung]] stated the shadow to be the unknown dark side of the personality.&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Diamond&amp;nbsp;– [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evil-deeds/201204/essential-secrets-psychotherapy-what-is-the-shadow article] published April 20, 2012 by ''[[Psychology Today]]'' [Retrieved 2015-11-01]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr G. Wyn Roberts, Dr A. Machon&amp;nbsp;– [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=zlodCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=unknown+%E2%80%98%E2%80%98dark+side%E2%80%99%E2%80%99+of+our+personality&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t6VrzkeDii&amp;sig=kZOxEWOUfAjjuARqKM8PDH37SgE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwB2oVChMIlbL5mPbuyAIVy3IUCh2fxAUR#v=onepage&amp;q=unknown%20%E2%80%98%E2%80%98dark%20side%E2%80%99%E2%80%99%20of%20our%20personality&amp;f=false Appreciative Healthcare Practice: A guide to compassionate, person-centred care (c.f. p. 71)] published by M&amp;K Update Ltd, 8 Jul 2015 {{ISBN|1907830936}} [Retrieved 2015-11-01]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jung, the shadow, in being instinctive and [[Irrationality|irrational]], is prone to [[psychological projection]], in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else. Jung writes that if these projections remain hidden, "The projection-making factor (the Shadow archetype) then has a free hand and can realize its object—if it has one—or bring about some other situation characteristic of its power."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, C.G. (1951). "Phenomenology of the Self" in ''The Portable Jung''. p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; These projections insulate and harm individuals by acting as a constantly thickening veil of illusion between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and the real world.

From one perspective, "the shadow...is roughly equivalent to the whole of the Freudian unconscious";&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Stevens, ''On Jung'' (London 1990) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; and Jung himself asserted that "the result of the Freudian method of elucidation is a minute elaboration of man's shadow-side unexampled in any previous age".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Practice of Psychotherapy'' (London 1993) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaufman wrote that "in spite of its function as a reservoir for human darkness—or perhaps because of this—the shadow is the seat of [[creativity]]";&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, C. Three-Dimensional Villains: Finding Your Character's Shadow [http://archetypewriting.com/articles/articles_ck/archetypes2_shadow.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; so that for some, it may be, "the dark side of his being, his sinister shadow... represents the true spirit of life as against the arid scholar".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'' (London 1983) p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance==
The shadow may appear in [[dream]]s and [[Vision (religion)|vision]]s in various forms and typically 'appears as a person of the same sex as that of the dreamer'.&lt;ref&gt;M-L von Franz, "The Process of Individuation" in C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow's appearance and role depend greatly on the living experience of the individual because much of the shadow develops in the individual's mind rather than simply being inherited in the [[collective unconscious]]. Nevertheless, some Jungians maintain that ''The shadow'' contains, besides the personal shadow, the shadow of society ... fed by the neglected and repressed collective values'.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fordham, ''Jungian Psychotherapy'' (Avon 1978) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Interactions with the shadow in [[dream]]s may shed light on one's state of mind. A conversation with an aspect of the shadow may indicate that one is concerned with conflicting desires or intentions. Identification with a despised figure may mean that one has an unacknowledged difference from the character, a difference which could point to a rejection of the illuminating qualities of ego-consciousness. These examples refer to just two of many possible roles that the shadow may adopt and are not general guides to interpretation. Also, it can be difficult to identify characters in dreams—"all the contents are blurred and merge into one another ... 'contamination' of unconscious contents"&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, "Process" p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;—so that a character who seems at first to be a shadow might represent some other [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] instead.

Jung also made the suggestion of there being more than one layer making up the shadow. The top layers contain the meaningful flow and manifestations of direct personal experiences. These are made unconscious in the individual by such things as the change of attention from one thing to another, simple forgetfulness, or a repression. Underneath these idiosyncratic layers, however, are the archetypes which form the psychic contents of all human experiences. Jung described this deeper layer as "a psychic activity which goes on independently of the conscious mind and is not dependent even on the upper layers of the unconscious—untouched, and perhaps untouchable—by personal experience" ([[Joseph Campbell|Campbell]], 1971).

==Encounter with==

The eventual encounter with the shadow plays a central part in the process of [[individuation]]. Jung considered that "the course of individuation...exhibits a certain formal regularity.  Its signposts and milestones are various archetypal symbols" marking its stages; and of these "the first stage leads to the experience of the SHADOW".&lt;ref&gt;J. Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung'' (London 1946) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;  If "the breakdown of the [[Persona (psychology)|persona]] constitutes the typical Jungian moment both in therapy and in development",&lt;ref name="Context 102"&gt;Peter Homans, ''Jung in Context'' (London 1979) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; it is this that opens the road to the shadow within, coming about when "Beneath the surface a person is suffering from a deadly boredom that makes everything seem meaningless and empty ... as if the initial encounter with the [[Self in Jungian psychology|Self]] casts a dark shadow ahead of time."&lt;ref name="Process 170"&gt;von Franz, "Process"  p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Jung considered as a perennial danger in life that "the more consciousness gains in clarity, the more monarchic becomes its content...the king constantly needs the renewal that begins with a descent into his own darkness"&lt;ref name="Mysterium  334"&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;—his shadow—which the "dissolution of the persona"&lt;ref name="Two Essays 277"&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; sets in motion.

"The shadow personifies everything that the subject refuses to acknowledge about himself" and represents "a tight passage, a narrow door, whose painful constriction no one is spared who goes down to the deep well".&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 284 and p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; If and when 'an individual makes an attempt to see his shadow, he becomes aware of (and often ashamed of) those qualities and impulses he denies in himself but can plainly see in others—such things as egotism, mental laziness, and sloppiness; unreal [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]], schemes, and plots; carelessness and cowardice; inordinate love of money and possessions—...[a] painful and lengthy work of self-education".&lt;ref&gt;von Franz, "Process" p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissolution of the persona and the launch of the individuation process also brings with it 'the danger of falling victim to the shadow ... the black shadow which everybody carries with him, the inferior and therefore hidden aspect of the personality'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, "Psychology of the Transference'' ''Collected Works 16'' (London 1954) p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;—of a merger with the shadow.

==Merger with==

According to Jung, the shadow sometimes overwhelms a person's actions; for example, when the conscious mind is shocked, confused, or paralyzed by indecision. 'A man who is possessed by his shadow is always standing in his own light and falling into his own traps ... living below his own level':&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; hence, in terms of the story of ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'', 'it must be Jekyll, the conscious personality, who integrates the shadow ... and ''not'' vice versa. Otherwise the conscious becomes the slave of the autonomous shadow'.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''Jung'' p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuation inevitably raises that very possibility. As the process continues, and "the [[libido]] leaves the bright upper world ... sinks back into its own depths...below, in the shadows of the unconscious",&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Psychology of the Unconscious'' (London 1944) pp. 181–2&lt;/ref&gt; so too what comes to the forefront is "what was hidden under the mask of conventional adaptation: the shadow", with the result that "[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] and shadow are no longer divided but are brought together in an—admittedly precarious—unity."&lt;ref&gt;Jung "Psychology" pp. 238–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of such "confrontation with the shadow produces at first a dead balance, a stand-still that hampers moral decisions and makes convictions ineffective...''[[tenebrositas]]'', chaos, [[melancholia]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Mysterium'' p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, (as Jung knew from personal experience) "in this time of descent—one, three, seven years, more or less—genuine courage and strength are required",&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly/Marion Woodman, ''The Maiden King'' (Dorset 1999) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; with no certainty of emergence. Nevertheless, Jung remained of the opinion that while "no one should deny the danger of the descent ... every descent is followed by an ascent ...[[enantiodromia]]";&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Symbols of Transformation'' (London 1956) p. 357 and p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; and assimilation of—rather than possession by—the shadow becomes at last a real possibility.

==Assimilation of==

Enantiodromia launches a different perspective. "We begin to travel [up] through the healing spirals...straight up."&lt;ref&gt;Bly/Woodman, ''Maiden'' p. 160–1&lt;/ref&gt; Here the struggle is to retain ''awareness'' of the shadow, but not identification with it. "Non-identification demands considerable moral effort...prevents a descent into that darkness"; but though "the conscious mind is liable to be submerged at any moment in the unconscious... understanding acts like a life-saver.  It integrates the unconscious"&lt;ref&gt;Jung, "Psychology" pp. 260, 266, and 269&lt;/ref&gt;—reincorporates the shadow into the personality, producing a stronger, wider consciousness than before. "Assimilation of the shadow gives a man body, so to speak",&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Practice'' p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; and provides thereby a launching-pad for further individuation. "The integration of the shadow, or the realisation of the personal unconscious, marks the first stage of the analytic process...without it a recognition of [[anima and animus]] is impossible."&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Aion'' (London 1959) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely "to the degree to which the shadow is recognised and integrated, the problem of the anima, i.e., of relationship, is constellated",&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 270n&lt;/ref&gt; and becomes the centre of the individuation quest.

Nevertheless, Jungians warn that "acknowledgement of the shadow must be a continuous process throughout one's life";&lt;ref&gt;David L. Hart, "The classical Jungian school" in Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson, ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1977) p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and even after the focus of individuation has moved on to the animus/anima, "the later stages of shadow integration" will continue to take place—the grim "process of washing one's dirty linen in private",&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, ''On Jung'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; accepting one's shadow.

'''Steric factor''' ''ρ''&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef|file=S05998|title=Steric factor}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in collision theory.

It is defined as the ratio between the  experimental  value of the [[rate constant]] and the one predicted by collision theory. It can also be defined as the ratio between the [[preexponential factor]] and the [[collision frequency]], and it is most often less than unity.  Physically, the steric factor can be interpreted as the ratio of the [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for reactive collisions to the total collision cross section.

Usually, the more complex the reactant [[molecule]]s, the lower the steric factors. Nevertheless, some reactions exhibit steric factors greater than unity: the [[harpoon reaction]]s, which involve atoms that exchange electrons, producing ions. The deviation from unity can have different causes: the molecules are not spherical, so different geometries are possible; not all the [[kinetic energy]] is delivered into the right spot; the presence of a [[solvent]] (when applied to solutions); and so on.

When collision theory applied to reactions in solution the [[solvent cage]] has an effect on the reactant molecules, as several collisions can take place in a single encounter, which leads to predicted preexponential factors being too large. ''ρ'' values greater than unity can be attributed to favorable entropic contributions.

Usually there is no simple way to accurately estimate steric factors without performing trajectory or scattering calculations.

'''''The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia''''' is a 1974 [[utopian]] [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[Ursula K. Le Guin]], set in the same [[fictional universe]] as that of ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (the [[Hainish Cycle]]). The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="WWE-1974"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received a nomination for the [[John W. Campbell]] Memorial Award in 1975.&lt;ref name="WWE-1975"/&gt; It achieved a degree of literary recognition unusual for science fiction works due to its exploration of many themes, including anarchism and revolutionary societies, capitalism and individualism and collectivism.

It features the development of the mathematical theory underlying the fictional [[ansible]], an instantaneous communications device that plays a critical role in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. The invention of the ansible places the novel first in the [[Hainish Cycle#Novels|internal chronology of the Hainish Cycle]], although it was the fifth Hainish novel published.&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Word for World is Forest]]'', the newly created ansible is brought to Athshe, a planet being settled by [[Earth]]-[[humans]]. In other tales in the Hainish Cycle, the ansible already exists. The word "ansible" was coined in ''[[Rocannon's World]]'' (first in order of publication but third in internal chronology), where it is central to the plot.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In her new introduction to the [[Library of America]] reprint in 2017, the author wrote:
{{bquote|''The Dispossessed'' started as a very bad short story, which I didn’t try to finish but couldn’t quite let go. There was a book in it, and I knew it, but the book had to wait for me to learn what I was writing about and how to write about it. I needed to understand my own passionate opposition to the war that we were, endlessly it seemed, waging in Vietnam, and endlessly protesting at home. If I had known then that my country would continue making aggressive wars for the rest of my life, I might have had less energy for protesting that one. But, knowing only that [[Down by the Riverside|I didn’t want to study war no more]], I studied peace. I started by reading a whole mess of utopias and learning something about pacifism and [[Gandhi]] and [[nonviolent resistance]]. This led me to the nonviolent anarchist writers such as [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Paul Goodman]]. With them I felt a great, immediate affinity. They made sense to me in the way [[Lao Tzu]] did. They enabled me to think about war, peace, politics, how we govern one another and ourselves, the value of failure, and the strength of what is weak.

So, when I realised that nobody had yet written an anarchist utopia, I finally began to see what my book might be. And I found that its principal character, whom I’d first glimpsed in the original misbegotten story, was alive and well—my guide to Anarres. &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.tor.com/2017/08/30/introduction-from-ursula-k-le-guin-the-hainish-novels-stories-volume-one/ “Introduction” from Ursula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels &amp; Stories, Volume One], retrieved 9/8/2017 &lt;/ref&gt;}}

Le Guin's parents, academic anthropologists [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Alfred]] and [[Theodora Kroeber]], were friends with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]; Le Guin stated that Oppenheimer was the model for Shevek, the book's protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spivack|first=Charlotte|title=Ursula K. Le Guin|year=1984|publisher=Twayne Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=0805773932}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

==Setting==

''The Dispossessed'' is set on [[Anarres]] and [[Urras (fictional planet)|Urras]], the twin inhabited worlds of [[Tau Ceti in fiction|Tau Ceti]]. Urras is divided into several [[State (polity)|states]] and dominated by its two largest, the rivals A-Io and Thu. The former has a [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy and [[patriarchy|patriarchal system]], and the latter is an authoritarian system that claims to rule in the name of the [[proletariat]]. A-Io has oppositional [[left-wing]] parties, one of which is closely linked to the rival society Thu.

The other world, Anarres, represents a third ideological structure: [[anarcho-syndicalism]]. Its society has weakened influence due to their ancestors' self-imposed exile from Urras. Some citizens of A-Io contact the Anarresti protagonist Shevek, chiding him for betraying his beliefs by working at the university and accepting the government's hospitality.

A revolution sparks in the major, yet undeveloped third area of Benbili. A-Io invades the Thu-supported revolutionary area, generating a [[proxy war]]. Although there are a wide variety of political parties in A-Io, there are none on Anarres.

== Plot summary ==
The chapters alternate between the two planets and in time. The even-numbered chapters, which are set on Anarres, take place first chronologically and are followed by  the odd-numbered chapters, which take place on Urras. The only exceptions occur in the first and last chapters, which take place in both worlds.

|}
In order to forestall an [[Anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] rebellion, the major Urrasti states gave the revolutionaries (inspired by a visionary named Odo) the right to live on Anarres, along with a guarantee of non-interference, approximately two hundred years before the events of ''The Dispossessed''. (The story is told in Le Guin's "[[The Day Before the Revolution]]".)  Before this, Anarres had had no permanent settlements, apart from some mining facilities.

The economic and political situation of Anarres and its relation to Urras is ambiguous. The people of Anarres consider themselves as being free and independent, having broken off from the political and social influence of the old world. However, the powers of Urras consider Anarres as being essentially their mining colony, as the annual consignment of Anarres' [[precious metals]] and their distribution to major powers on Urras is a major economic event of the old world.

===Anarres (chapters 1,2,4,6,8,10,12,13)===
Chapter One begins in the middle of the story. The protagonist Shevek is a physicist attempting to develop a General Temporal Theory. The physics of the book describes time as having a much deeper, more complex structure than we understand it. It incorporates not only mathematics and physics, but also philosophy and ethics. Shevek finds his work blocked by a jealous superior, as his theories conflict with the prevailing political philosophy and are thus distrusted by the society. His work is further disrupted by his obligation to perform manual labor during a drought in this anarchist society; in order to ensure survival in a harsh environment, the people of Anarres must put the needs of  society ahead of their own personal desires, so Shevek performs hard agricultural labor in a dusty desert instead of working on his research. He arranges to go to Urras to finish and publish his theory.

===Urras (chapters 1,3,5,7,9,11,13)===
Arriving on Urras, Shevek is feted. Shevek soon finds himself disgusted with the social, sexual and political conventions of the hierarchical capitalist society of Urras. He joins in a labor protest that is violently suppressed, but he escapes to safety. Finally, he is sponsored by ambassadors of Terra who provide him safe passage back to Anarres.

==Themes==

=== Symbolism ===
The ambiguity of Anarres' economic and political situation in relation to Urras is symbolically manifested in the low wall surrounding Anarres' single spaceport. This wall is the only place on the [[anarchist]] planet where "No Trespassing!" signs may be seen, and it is where the book begins and ends. The people of Anarres believe that the wall divides a free world from the corrupting influence of an oppressor's ships. On the other hand, the wall could be a prison wall keeping the rest of the planet imprisoned and cut off. Shevek's life attempts to answer this question.

In addition to Shevek's journey to answer questions about his society's true level of freedom, the meaning of his theories themselves weave their way into the plot; they not only describe abstract physical concepts, but they also reflect ups and downs of the characters' lives, and the transformation of the Anarresti society. An oft-quoted saying in the book is "true journey is return."&lt;ref&gt;Said by Shevek near the end of Chapter 13&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of Shevek's theories—which deal with the nature of time and simultaneity—have been subject to interpretation. For example, there have been interpretations that the non-linear nature of the novel is a reproduction of Shevek's theory.&lt;ref&gt;Rigsby, Ellen M. (2005), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anarchism and capitalism ===
Le Guin's foreword to the novel notes that her anarchism is closely akin to that of [[Peter Kropotkin]], whose ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]'' closely assessed the influence of the natural world on competition and cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Kropotkin]], ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution|Mutual Aid]]'' (1902).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many conflicts occur between the freedom of anarchism and the constraints imposed by authority and society, both on Anarres and Urras. These constraints are both physical and social. Physically, Odo was imprisoned in the Fort for nine years. Socially speaking, 'time after time the question of who is being locked out or in, which side of the wall one is on, is the focus of the narrative.' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/7/barbour7art.htm|title=Wholeness and Balance|last=Barbour|first=Douglas|publisher=Science Fiction Studies (1975)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Tunik emphasises that ''the wall'' is the dominant metaphor for these social constraints. Shevek hits ‘the wall of charm, courtesy, indifference.” He later notes that he let a “wall be built around him” that kept him from seeing the poor people on Urras. He had been co-opted, with walls of smiles of the rich, and he didn’t know how to break them down. Shevek at one point speculates that the people on Urras are not truly free, precisely because they have so many walls built between people and are so possessive. He says, “You are all in jail. Each alone, solitary, with a heap of what he owns. You live in prison, die in prison. It is all I can see in your eyes – the wall, the wall!” ‘ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7017991/The_New_Utopian_Politics_of_Ursula_K._Le_Guins_The_Dispossessed|title=The Need for Walls: Privacy, Community, and Freedom in The Dispossessed|last=Tunik|first=Mark|publisher=Lexington Books (2005)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not just the state of mind of those inside the prisons that concerns Shevek, he also notes the effect on those outside the walls. Steve Grossi says, ‘by building a physical wall to keep the bad in, we construct a mental wall keeping ourselves, our thoughts, and our empathy out, to the collective detriment of all." Shevek himself later says, “those who build walls are their own prisoners.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevegrossi.com/on/the-dispossessed|title=The Dispossessed|last=Grossi|first=Steve|publisher=Steve Grossi (2013)|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Guin makes this explicit in chapter two, when the schoolchildren construct their own prison and detain one of their own inside. The deleterious effect on the children outside parallels the effect on the guards in the [[Stanford Prison Experiment]] of 1971 (three years before ''The Dispossessed'' was published).&lt;ref name="paul_brians2"&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html "Study Guide for Ursula LeGuin: '''The Dispossessed''' (1974)" - Paul Brians] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107225601/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/science_fiction/dispossessed.html |date=2005-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doukhobor666.wordpress.com/2015/12/20/the-dispossessed/|title=The Dispossessed|publisher=Samizdat (2015)|accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language spoken on Anarres also reflects anarchism. [[Pravic]] is a [[constructed language]] in the tradition of [[Esperanto]]. Pravic reflects many aspects of the philosophical foundations of utopian anarchism.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence, Davis and Peter G. Stillman. ''The New Utopian Politics of Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispossessed'', Lexington Books (2005). Pp. 287-298.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the use of the [[possessive case]] is strongly discouraged, a feature that also is reflected by the novel's title.&lt;ref&gt;Conley, Tim and Stephen Cain. ''Encyclopedia of Fictional and Fantastic Languages''. Greenwood Press, Westport (2006). Pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Children are trained to speak only about matters that interest others; anything else is "egoizing" (pp.&amp;nbsp;28–31). There is no property ownership of any kind. Shevek's daughter, upon meeting him for the first time, tells him, "You can share the handkerchief I use"&lt;ref name="Dispossessed2"&gt;Ursula K. Le Guin, ''The Dispossessed'', p.69.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than "You may borrow my handkerchief", thus conveying the idea that the handkerchief is not owned by the girl, but is merely used by her.&lt;ref name="Burton-19852"&gt;Burton (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Utopianism ===
The work is sometimes said to represent one of the few modern revivals of the [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopian genre]].&lt;ref name="Davis-20052"&gt;Davis and Stillman (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; When first published, the book included the tagline: "The magnificent epic of an ambiguous utopia!" which was shortened by fans to "An ambiguous utopia" and adopted as a subtitle in certain editions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.gizmodo.com/5607981/ursula-le-guins-the-dispossessed-when-you-want-to-like-a-book-but-dont Book review discussing meanings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20719930?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents Penn State University Press listing]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many characteristics of a utopian novel found in this book. For example, Shevek is an outsider when he arrives on Urras, which capitalizes on the utopian and scientific fiction theme of the "estrangement-setting".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/7/bierman7art.htm|title=Judah Bierman- Ambiguity in Utopia: The Dispossessed|website=www.depauw.edu|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Guin's utopianism, however, differs from the traditional "anarchist commune." Whereas most utopian novels attempt to convey a society that is absolutely good, this world differs as it is portrayed only as "ambiguously good."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Feminism ===
There is some disagreement as to whether ''The Dispossessed'' should be considered a [[Feminism|feminist]] utopia or a [[feminist science fiction]] novel. According to Mary Morrison of the State University of New York at Buffalo, the anarchist themes in this book help to promote feminist themes as well. Other critics, such as William Marcellino of SUNY Buffalo and Sarah Lefanu, writer of "Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction," argue that there are distinct anti-feminist undertones throughout the novel.

Morrison argues that Le Guin's portrayed ideals of [[Taoism]], the celebration of labor and the body, and desire or sexual freedom in an anarchist society contribute greatly to the book's feminist message. Taoism, which rejects dualisms and divisions in favor of a [[Yin and Yang]] balance, brings attention to the balance between not only the two planets, but between the male and female inhabitants. The celebration of labor on Anarres stems from a celebration of a mother's labor, focusing on creating life rather than on building objects. The sexual freedom on Anarres also contributes to the book's feminist message.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Mary I. Anarcho-Feminism and Permanent Revolution in Ursula K. Le Guin's ‘‘The Dispossessed’’, State University of New York at Buffalo, Ann Arbor, 2011, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I; ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/878894517&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some critics believe that Le Guin's feminist themes are either weak or not present. Some believe that the Taoist interdependence between the genders actually weakens Le Guin's feminist message. Marcellino believes that the anarchist themes in the novel take precedence and dwarf any feminist themes.&lt;ref&gt;Marcellino, William. "Shadows to Walk: Ursula Le Guin's Transgressions in Utopia." The Journal of American Culture, vol. 32, no. 3, 2009, pp. 203-213, Music Periodicals Database; Performing Arts Periodicals Database, &lt;nowiki&gt;https://search.proquest.com/docview/200658410&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Lefanu adds that there is a difference between the feminist messages that the book explicitly presents and the anti-feminist undertones. For example, the book says that women created the society on Anarres. However, female characters seem secondary to the male protagonist, who seems to be a traditional male hero; this subversion weakens any feminist message that Le Guin was trying to convey.&lt;ref&gt;Lefanu, Sarah. "Popular Writing and Feminist Intervention in Science Fiction." Gender, Genre and Narrative Pleasure. Ed. Derek Longhurst. Vol. 9. New York: Routledge, 2012. 177-92. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
It has been suggested that Le Guin's title is a reference to [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoyevsky's]] novel about anarchists, ''[[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)|Demons]]'' ({{lang-ru|Бесы}}, ''Bésy''), one popular English-language translation of which is titled ''The Possessed''.&lt;ref name="paul_brians2"/&gt; Much of the philosophical underpinnings and ecological concepts came from [[Murray Bookchin]]'s ''[[Post-Scarcity Anarchism]]'' (1971), according to a letter Le Guin sent to Bookchin.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Biehl, Bookchin biographer; letter in UKL archive&lt;/ref&gt; Anarres citizens are ''dispossessed'' not just by political choice, but by the very lack of actual resources to possess. Here, again, Le Guin draws a contrast with the natural wealth of Urras, and the competitive behaviors this fosters.&lt;ref&gt;Mathiesen.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proposed time ==
In the last chapter of ''The Dispossessed'', we learn that the Hainish people arrived at Tau Ceti 60 years previously, which is more than 150 years after the secession of the Odonians from Urras and their exodus to Anarres. [[Terra (Hainish cycle)|Terrans]] are also there, and the novel occurs some time in the future, according to an elaborate chronology worked out by science fiction author [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] in 1975: "the baseline date of AD 2300 for The Dispossessed is taken from the description of Earth in that book (§11) as having passed through an ecological and social collapse with a population peak of 9 billion to a low-population but highly centralized recovery economy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first= Ian |last= Watson | title= Le Guin's ''Lathe of Heaven'' and the Role of Dick: The False Reality as Mediator| publisher= Science Fiction Studies # 5 = Volume 2, Part 1 | date=March 1975 | accessdate=2017-02-26 |url= http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/5/watson5art.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same article, Watson assigns a date of  AD 4870 to [[The Left Hand of Darkness]]; both dates are problematic — as Watson says himself, they are contradicted by "Genly Ai's statement that Terrans 'were ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero' ".

==Reception==
The novel received generally positive reviews. [[Baird Searles]] characterized the novel as an "extraordinary work", saying Le Guin had "created a working society in exquisite detail" and "a fully realized hypothetical culture [as well as] living breathing characters who are inevitable products of that culture".&lt;ref&gt;"The Dispossessed: Visit from A Small Planet", ''[[Village Voice]]'', November 21, 1974, pp.56, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Jonas, writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', said that "Le Guin's book, written in her solid, no-nonsense prose, is so persuasive that it ought to put a stop to the writing of prescriptive Utopias for at least 10 years".&lt;ref&gt;"Of Things to Come", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', October 26, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; [[Theodore Sturgeon]] praised ''The Dispossessed'' as "a beautifully written, beautifully composed book", saying "it performs one of [science fiction's] prime functions, which is to create another kind of social system to see how it would work. Or if it would work."&lt;ref&gt;

"Galaxy Bookshelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', June 1974, pp.97-98&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lester del Rey]], however, gave the novel a mixed review, citing the quality of Le Guin's writing but claiming that the ending "slips badly", a ''[[deus ex machina]]'' that "destroy[s] much of the strength of the novel".&lt;ref&gt;"Reading Room", [[If (magazine)|''If'']], August 1974, pp.144-45&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Jupiter Effect''''' is a 1974 book by [[John Gribbin]] and Stephen Plagemann, in which the authors predicted that an alignment of the planets of the [[Solar System]] would create a number of catastrophes, including a great earthquake on the [[San Andreas Fault]], on March 10, 1982. The book became a best-seller.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;

 |quote=In 1974, John Gribbin and Stephen Plagemann wrote a best-selling book, The Jupiter Effect, warning that in March 1982, an alignment of the major planets on the same side of the Sun would trigger a series of cosmic events - culminating in an earthquake along the [[San Andreas Fault]] that would wipe out Los Angeles. ... One year after the non-doomsday event, Gribbin and Plagemann published The ''Jupiter Effect Reconsidered''. It was also a best-seller.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The predicted catastrophes did not occur.

==History==
Astronomers had long been aware that there would be an [[Syzygy (astronomy)|alignment]] of the [[planet]]s on that date, when [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]] and [[Pluto]] would be on the same side of the [[Sun]], within an arc 95 degrees wide. But no effect could be expected as the [[tidal force]]s of the other planets affecting the Earth's crust are negligible even at the planets' closest approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interplanetary Low Tide {{!}} Science Mission Directorate |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast04may_1m/ |website=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] |accessdate=9 August 2018 |language=en |date=4 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book, the authors sought to partially sidestep these objections by considering the effect of the alignment on the Sun, and hence on the solar wind, which in turn is known to affect weather on the Earth.  Atmospheric conditions on the Earth can alter the [[Earth's rotation|speed of its rotation]]. The effect on the Sun would also be quite small, however, and in fact there had been an even closer alignment in the year 1128 without any incident.&lt;ref&gt;''Facts on File 1982 Yearbook''&lt;/ref&gt;

There was some influence by the planets mentioned above, with the [[high tide]]s calculated as being about 40 [[micrometre]]s higher than normal.&lt;ref&gt;"Jupiter Effect Only For Partygoers," ''Elyria Chronicle-Telegram'', March 11, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1982, Gribbin and Plagemann published a lesser-selling book, ''The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered''.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; In it they theorized that the effect had actually taken place in 1980, despite the lack of planetary alignment then, and that it had triggered the [[volcanic eruption]] of [[Mount St. Helens]]. 

In his book, ''The Little Book of Science'' (pub. 1999), Gribbin admitted about his "Jupiter Effect" theory "...I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it."

An example of a stable 3-body interaction would be between two protons and one neutron, the helium-3 isotope]]
A '''three-body force''' is a [[force]] that does not exist in a system of two objects but appears in a three-body system. In general, if the behaviour of a system of more than two objects cannot be described by the two-body interactions between all possible pairs, as a first approximation, the deviation is mainly due to a three-body force. 

The fundamental [[strong interaction]] does exhibit such behaviour, the most important example being the stability experimentally observed for the [[helium-3]] isotope, which can be described as a 3-body quantum cluster entity of two protons and one neutron [PNP] in stable superposition.  Direct evidence of a 3-body force in helium-3 is known: [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993PhDT.......234S].  The existence of stable [PNP] cluster calls into question models of the atomic nucleus that restrict nucleon interactions within shells to 2-body phenomenon.  The three-nucleon-interaction is fundamentally possible because [[gluon]]s, the mediators of the strong interaction, can couple to themselves. In [[particle physics]], the interactions between the three quarks that compose [[hadron]]s can be described in a [[diquark]] model which might be equivalent to the hypothesis of a three-body force. There is growing evidence in the field of [[nuclear physics]] that three-body forces exist among the [[nucleon]]s inside [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] for many different isotopes ('''three-nucleon force''').

''' Western Head''' is a community in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Nova Scotia]], located in the [[Region of Queens Municipality, Nova Scotia|Region of Queens Municipality]]. The [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] maintains a weather station in Western Head ID: CWWE.

Western Head is prone to [[tropical storm]]s and [[hurricane]]s that track up the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. However, effects are usually quick and minimal as the cool waters may weaken the storm, and storms usually move very quickly across Western Head. For example, [[Hurricane Earl (2010)|Hurricane Earl]] made landfall near Western Head as a large Category One hurricane in 2010.

(2009). In ''Penguin dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was introduced, but not fully developed, by psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896&amp;ndash;1934) during the last ten years of his life.&lt;ref name="bioBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. (2018). [https://www.routledge.com/Vygotsky-An-Intellectual-Biography/Yasnitsky/p/book/9781138806740 Vygotsky: An Intellectual Biography].

Vygotsky: ''Mind in Society: Development of Higher Psychological Processes'', p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky and some other educators believe that the role of education is to give children experiences that are within their zones of proximal development, thereby encouraging and advancing their individual learning such as skills and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  Vygotsky also felt that social interaction was very important when it came to learning. "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. Of Young Children. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934.jpg|thumb|Lev Vygotsky 1896-1934]]

The concept of the zone of proximal development was originally developed by Vygotsky to argue against the use of academic, knowledge-based tests as a means to gauge students' intelligence. He also created ZPD to further develop [[Jean Piaget]]'s theory of children being lone learners.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"&gt;''Zone of Proximal Development'' and ''Cultural Tools Scaffolding, Guided Participation'', 2006. In ''Key concepts in developmental psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky spent a lot of time studying the impact of school instruction on children and noted that children grasp language concepts quite naturally, but that maths and writing don’t come naturally, that these are concepts taught in schools and tend to come along with some difficulty, while Piaget believed that there was a clear distinction between development and teaching. He said that development is a spontaneous process that is initiated and completed by the children, stemming from their own efforts. Piaget was a proponent of independent thinking and critical of the standard teacher-led instruction that was common practice in schools.&lt;ref name="Theories"&gt;Crain, W. (2010). Theories of development: Concepts and applications, 6th ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Vygotsky saw natural, spontaneous development as important, but not all-important. He believed that children would not advance very far if they were left to discover everything on their own. It's crucial for a child's development that they are able to interact with more knowledgeable others. They would not be able to expand on what they know if this wasn't possible. He noted cultural experiences where children are greatly helped by knowledge and tools handed down from previous generations. Vygotsky noted that good teachers shouldn't present material that is too difficult and “pull the students along.”&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

Vygotsky argued that, rather than examining what a student knows to determine intelligence, it is better to examine their ability to solve problems independently and ability to solve problems with an adult's help.&lt;ref&gt;Berk, L &amp; Winsler, A. (1995).  "Vygotsky: His life and works" and "Vygotsky's approach to development".  In ''Scaffolding children's learning: Vygotsky and early childhood learning''. Natl. Assoc for Educ. of Young Children. pp. 25&amp;ndash;34&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a question: "if two children perform the same on a test, are their levels of development the same?" He concluded that they were not.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Stages of development. (2010). In Curriculum connections psychology: Cognitive development. Retrieved from Credo Reference Database&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vygotsky's untimely death interrupted his work on the zone of proximal development, and it remained mostly incomplete.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaretskii|first=V.

==Definition==
Since Vygotsky's original conception, the definition for the zone of proximal development has been expanded and modified. The zone of proximal development is an area of learning that occurs when a person is assisted by a teacher or peer with a higher skill set.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The person learning the skill set cannot complete it without the assistance of the teacher or peer. The teacher then helps the student attain the skill the student is trying to master, until the teacher is no longer needed for that task.&lt;ref&gt;Burkitt, E. (2006). Zone of proximal development. In ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of psychology.'' Retrieved from Credo Reference database&lt;/ref&gt;

Any function within the zone of proximal development matures within a particular internal context that includes not only the function’s actual level but also how susceptible the child is to types of help, the sequence in which these types of help are offered, the flexibility or rigidity of previously formed stereotypes, how willing the child is to collaborate, along with other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Bozhovich, E. D. (2009). Zone of Proximal Development: The Diagnostic Capabilities and Limitations of Indirect Collaboration. Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology, 47(6), 48-69. Retrieved from EBSCOHost Database&lt;/ref&gt; This context can impact the diagnosis of a function’s potential level of development.&lt;ref name="Zaretskii 2009" /&gt;

Vygotsky stated that we can’t just look at what students are capable of doing on their own; we have to look at what they are capable of doing in a social setting. In many cases students are able to complete a task within a group before they are able to complete it on their own. He notes that the teacher’s job is to move the child’s mind forward step-by-step (after all, teachers can’t teach complex chemical equations to first-graders). At the same time, teachers can’t teach all children equally; they must determine which students are ready for which lessons.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt; An example is the often-used [[Accelerated Reader|accelerated reading]] program in schools. Students are assessed and given a reading level and a range. Books rated below their level are easy to read, while books above their level challenge the student. Sometimes students are not even allowed to check out books from the school library that are outside their range. Vygotsky argued that a major shortcoming of [[standardized test]]s is that they only measure what students are capable of on their own, not in a group setting where their minds are being pushed by other students.&lt;ref name="Theories" /&gt;

In the context of [[Second-language acquisition|second language learning]], the ZPD can be useful to many adult users. Prompted by this fact as well as the finding that adult peers don't necessarily need to be more capable to provide assistance in the ZPD, Vygotsky’s definition has been adapted to better suit the adult L2 developmental context &lt;ref&gt;Fani, Tayebeh &amp; Ghaemi, Farid. (2011). Implications of Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) in Teacher Education: ZPTD and Self-scaffolding. Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences. 29. 1549-1554. 10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.11.396. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Scaffolding==

The concept of the ZPD is widely used to study children's mental development as it relates to education. The ZPD concept is seen as a [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]], a structure of "support points" for performing an action.&lt;ref&gt;Obukhova, L. F., &amp; Korepanova, I. A. (2009). The Zone of Proximal Development: A Spatiotemporal Model. ''Journal of Russian &amp; East European Psychology'', 47(6), 25-47. {{doi|10.2753/RPO1061-0405470602}}&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to the help or guidance received from an adult or more competent peer to permit the child to work within the ZPD.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"&gt;Morgan, A. (2009, July 28). What is "Scaffolding" and the "ZPD"? Retrieved October 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Vygotsky himself never mentioned the term, scaffolding was first developed by [[Jerome Bruner]], David Wood, and Gail Ross, while applying Vygotsky's concept of ZPD to various educational contexts.&lt;ref name="Scaffolding"/&gt; According to Wass and Golding, giving students the hardest tasks they can do with scaffolding leads to the greatest learning gains.&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wass, R., &amp; Golding, C. (2014). Sharpening a tool for teaching: the zone of proximal development. ''Teaching in Higher Education'', 19(6), 671-684.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scaffolding is a process through which a teacher or a more competent peer helps a student in their ZPD as necessary and tapers off this aid as it becomes unnecessary—much as workers remove a scaffold from a building after they complete construction. "Scaffolding [is] the way the adult guides the child's learning via focused questions and positive interactions."&lt;ref&gt;Balaban, Nancy. (1995). "Seeing the Child, Knowing the Person." In Ayers, W. ''To Become a Teacher''. Teachers College Press. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been further developed by [[Mercedes Chaves Jaime]], [[Ann Brown]], among others. Several instructional programs were developed based on this interpretation of the ZPD, including [[reciprocal teaching]] and [[dynamic assessment]]. For scaffolding to be effective, one must start at the child's level of knowledge and build from there.&lt;ref name="Morgan, A. 2009"/&gt; 

One example of children using ZPD is when they are learning to speak. As their [[speech]] develops, it influences the way the child thinks, which in turn influences the child's manner of speaking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; This process opens more doors for the child to expand their vocabulary. As they learn to convey their thoughts in a more effective way, they receive more sophisticated feedback, therefore increasing their vocabulary and their speaking skills. Wells gives the example of dancing: when a person is learning how to dance, they look to others around them on the dance floor and imitate their moves. A person does not copy the dance moves exactly, but takes what they can and adds their own personality to it.&lt;ref name="Wells 1999"&gt;Wells, G. (1999). ''Dialogic Inquiries in education: Building on the legacy of Vygotsky''. Cambridge University Press. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mathematics, proximal development uses [[mathematical exercise]]s for which students have seen one or more worked examples. In secondary school some scaffolding is provided, and generally much less at the tertiary level. Ultimately students must find library resources or a tutor when presented with challenges beyond the zone.

Another example of scaffolding is learning to drive. Parents and [[driving]] instructors guide driving students along the way by showing them the mechanics of how the car operates, the correct hand positions on the steering wheel, the technique of scanning the roadway, etc. As the student progresses, less and less instruction is needed, until they are ready to drive on their own.

The concept of scaffolding can be observed in various life situations and arguably in the basis of how everyone learns. One does not (normally) begin knowing everything that there is to know about a subject. The basics must be learned first so one can build on prior knowledge towards mastery of a particular subject or skill. 

== Implications for educators ==
Various investigations, using different approaches and research frameworks have proved collaborative learning to be effective in many kinds of settings and contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, P., Wineburg, S., &amp; Woolworth, S. (2001). Toward a theory of teacher community. ''[[Teachers College Record]]'', ''103''(6), 942-1012.&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers should assign tasks that students cannot do on their own, but which they can do with assistance; they should provide just enough assistance so that students learn to complete the tasks independently and then provide an environment that enables students to do harder tasks than would otherwise be possible.&lt;ref name="Wass" /&gt; Teachers can also allow students with more knowledge to assist students who need more assistance. Especially in the context of collaborative learning, group members who have higher levels of understanding can help the less advanced members learn within their zone of proximal development. &lt;ref&gt;McLeod, S. A. (2012). Zone of proximal development. Retrieved from www.simplypsychology.org/Zone-of-Proximal-Development.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of adults, peers should challenge each other in order to support collaboration and success.&lt;ref&gt;Kuusisaari, H. (2014). Teachers at the zone of proximal development: Collaboration promoting or hindering the development process. ''Teaching and Teacher Education'', ''43'', 46-57.&lt;/ref&gt;
