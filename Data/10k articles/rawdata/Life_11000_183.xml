'''Antireligion''' is opposition to [[religion]] of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-religion|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anti-religion|website=Merriam-Webster Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antireligion|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/antireligion|website=Collins Dictionary|publisher=Collins Dictionary Online|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bullivant|first1=Stephen|last2=Lee|first2=Lois|title=A Dictionary of Atheism|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191816819}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used to describe opposition to [[organized religion]], [[religious ritual|religious practices]] or [[religious institutions]]. This term has also been used to describe opposition to specific forms of supernatural worship or practice, whether organized [[spiritual but not religious|or not]]. Opposition to religion also goes beyond the [[Misotheism|misotheistic]] spectrum. As such, antireligion is distinct from deity-specific positions such as [[atheism]] (the denial of belief in deities) and [[antitheism]] (an opposition to belief in deities); although "antireligionists" may also be atheists or antitheists.

== Historical perspectives ==

An early form of mass antireligion was expressed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], as early as the 17th century. [[Baron d'Holbach]]'s book ''Christianity Unveiled'' published in 1761, attacked not only Christianity but religion in general as an impediment to the moral advancement of humanity.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} According to historian [[Michael Burleigh]], antireligion found its first mass expression of barbarity in [[French Revolution|revolutionary France]] as "organised ... irreligion...an 'anti-clerical' and self-styled 'non-religious' state" responded violently to religious influence over society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Burleigh]] ''Earthly Powers'' p 96-97 {{ISBN|0-00-719572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Hitchens]] was a well-known antireligionist and [[Criticism of religion|critic of religion]]  of the 20th century who maintained opposition to religion, arguing that [[Freedom of speech|free expression]] and scientific discovery should replace religion as the method of teaching [[ethics]] and defining human civilization.

The [[Soviet Union]] adopted the political ideology of [[Marxism-Leninism]] and viewed religion as closely tied with foreign nationality.  It thus directed varying degrees of antireligious efforts at varying faiths, depending on what threat they posed to the Soviet state, and their willingness to subordinate itself to political authority.  These antireligious campaigns were directed at all faiths,&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;http://www.countrystudies.us/russia/38.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12521.html| title=Soviet Union: Policy toward nationalities and religions in practice| date=May 1989| website=www.country-data.com| accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Christian]], [[Islamic]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jewish]], and [[Shamanist]] religions. In the 1930s, during the [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]ist period, the government destroyed church buildings or put them into secular use (as museums of religion and atheism, clubs or storage facilities), executed clergy, prohibited the publication of most religious material and persecuted some members of religious groups.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=125428|pages=20–30|last1=Timasheff|first1=N. S.|title=The Church in the Soviet Union 1917 - 1941|volume=1|issue=1|journal=Russian Review|year=1941|doi=10.2307/125428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USGOV1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revelations from the Russian Archives: ANTI-RELIGIOUS CAMPAIGNS|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/archives/anti.html|website=Library of Congress|quote=The Soviet Union was the first state to have as an ideological objective the elimination of religion. Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organized religions were never outlawed.|publisher=US Government|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less violent attempts to reduce or eliminate the influence of religion in society were also carried out at other times in Soviet history. For instance, it was usually necessary to be an atheist in order to acquire any important political position or any prestigious scientific job; thus many people became atheists in order to advance their careers. In the years of 1921-1950, some estimate that 15 million Christians were killed in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;World Christian trends, AD 30-AD 2200, p.243 Table 4-10 By David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, Christopher R. Guidry, Peter F. Crossing&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 500,000 [[Russia]]n [[Orthodox Christians]] were persecuted by the Soviet government, not including other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravmir.ru/skolko-repressirovannyx-v-rossii-postradali-za-xrista Емельянов Н.Е. Сколько репрессированных в России пострадали за Христа?]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] targeted numerous clergy for arrest and interrogation as enemies of the state,&lt;ref name="mphdr"&gt;{{ro}}Martiri pentru Hristos, din România, în perioada regimului comunist, Editura Institutului Biblic și de Misiune al Bisericii Ortodoxe Române, București, 2007, pp.34–35&lt;/ref&gt; and many churches, mosques, and synagogues were converted to secular uses.&lt;ref name="BrezianuSpânu2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brezianu|first1=Andrei|title=The A to Z of Moldova|date=26 May 2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0-8108-7211-0|page=98|quote=Communist Atheism. Official doctrine of the Soviet regime, also called "scientific atheism." It was aggressively applied to Moldova, immediately after the 1940 annexation, when churches were profaned, clergy assaulted, and signs and public symbols of religion were prohibited, and it was applied again throughout the subsequent decades of the Soviet regime, after 1944. ... churches were either pulled down or turned into facilities designed to serve secular or even profane purposes ... the Transfiguration Cathedral (previously dedicated to St. Constantine and Helena) housed the city's planetarium.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[People's Republic of Albania]] had an objective for the eventual elimination of all religion in [[Albania]] with the goal of creating an atheist nation, which it declared it had achieved in 1967.  In 1976, Albania implemented a constitutional ban on religious activity and propaganda.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://countrystudies.us/albania/56.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The government nationalised most property of religious institutions and used it for non-religious purposes, such as cultural centers for young people. Religious literature was banned. Many clergy and theists were tried, tortured, and executed. All foreign [[Roman Catholic]] clergy were expelled in 1946.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Christian trends, AD 30-AD 2200, p.230-246 Tables 4-10 By David B. Barrett, Todd M. Johnson, Christopher R. Guidry, Peter F. Crossing&lt;/ref&gt; Albania was the only country that ever officially banned religion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Authorities in the [[People's Republic of Romania]] aimed to move towards an atheistic society, in which religion would be considered as the ideology of the bourgeoisie; the régime also set to propagate among the laboring masses in science, politics and culture to help them fight [[superstition]] and [[mysticism]], and initiated an anti-religious campaign aimed at reducing the influence of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Leustean|first1=Lucian|title=Orthodoxy and the Cold War: Religion and Political Power in Romania, 1947-65|date=2009|publisher=la University of Michigan|isbn=3447058749|pages=92–93|url=|quote= One of the main aims of the regime was to transform Romania into a communist atheist society in which religion was considered the ideology of the bourgeoise. Thus in 1949, the Society for the Popularisation of Science and Culture was established. The main objective of this anti-religious society was 'to propagate among the labouring masses political and scientific knowledge to fight obscurantism, superstition, mysticism, and all other influences of bourgeois ideologies'. ...the regime's anti-religious campaign aimed to discredit the church and to reduce the influence of religion in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the communist takeover in 1948, some church personnel were imprisoned for political crimes.&lt;ref name="Referenceb"&gt;January 23, 1999, issue of the London Tablet by Jonathen Luxmoore,  Published by Chesterton Review Feb/May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Khmer Rouge]] attempted to eliminate Cambodia's cultural heritage, including its religions, particularly Theravada Buddhism.&lt;ref name="NYTi"&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE163CF931A35752C0A964958260 Philip Shenon, Phnom Penh Journal; Lord Buddha Returns, With Artists His Soldiers] ''[[The New York Times]]'' - January 2, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Over the four years of Khmer Rouge rule, at least 1.5 million Cambodians perished.

== Notable antireligious people ==
{{expand list|date=November 2014}}
;Intellectuals
* [[Lucretius]] (99 BC – 55 BC)
* [[Thomas Paine]] (1737–1809), English-American author and [[Deism|deist]] who wrote a scathing critique on religion in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' (1793–4): "All national institutions of churches, whether Jewish, Christian, or Turkish [i.e. Muslim], appear to me no other than human inventions set up to terrify and enslave mankind, and monopolize power and profit".&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Thomas Paine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Karl Marx]] (1818–1883), German philosopher, social scientist, socialist. He is well known for his antireligious views. He said religion was "[[The opium of the people|the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976. ''[https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right]''. [[Marx/Engels Collected Works|Collected Works]], v. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]] (1844–1900), German philosopher, cultural critic, poet, composer, and Latin and Greek scholar. He wrote several critical texts on religion, morality, contemporary culture, philosophy, and science, displaying a fondness for metaphor and irony.
* [[John Dewey]] (1859–1952), an American [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosopher, who believed neither religion nor [[metaphysics]] could provide legitimate moral or social values, though scientific [[empiricism]] could (see [[science of morality]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Dewey felt that science alone contributed to 'human good,' which he defined exclusively in naturalistic terms. He rejected religion and metaphysics as valid supports for moral and social values, and felt that success of the scientific method presupposed the destruction of old knowledge before the new could be created. ... (Dewey, 1929, pp. 95, 145) "William Adrian, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15363750590925929 TRUTH, FREEDOM AND (DIS)ORDER IN THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY], ''Christian Higher Education', 4:2, 145-154&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), English logician and philosopher who believed that authentic philosophy could only be pursued given an atheistic foundation of "unyielding despair". In 1948, he famously debated the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and [[History of philosophy|philosophical historian]] Father [[Frederick Copleston]] on the [[existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;''"I think all the great religions of the world{{spaced ndash}}[[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Communism]]{{spaced ndash}}both untrue and harmful. It is evident as a matter of logic that, since they disagree, not more than one of them can be true.&amp;nbsp;... I am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that they are untrue."'' Bertrand Russell in "My Religious Reminiscences" (1957), reprinted in ''The Basic Writings of Bertrand Russell'' [http://russell.cool.ne.jp/beginner/DBR-K1E.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ayn Rand]] (1905–1982), Russian-American novelist and philosopher, founder of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]].
* [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]] (1919–1995), American atheist activist, founder of American Atheists organization.
* [[Richard Dawkins]] (born 1941), English biologist, one of the "four horsemen" of [[New Atheism]]. He wrote ''[[The God Delusion]]'', criticizing [[Theism|belief in the divine]], in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Many of us saw religion as harmless nonsense. Beliefs might lack all supporting evidence but, we thought, if people needed a crutch for consolation, where's the harm? September 11th changed all that. Revealed faith is not harmless nonsense, it can be lethally dangerous nonsense. Dangerous because it gives people unshakeable confidence in their own righteousness. Dangerous because it gives them false courage to kill themselves, which automatically removes normal barriers to killing others. Dangerous because it teaches enmity to others labelled only by a difference of inherited tradition. And dangerous because we have all bought into a weird respect, which uniquely protects religion from normal criticism. Let's now stop being so damned respectful!'' The Guardian, 2001-10-11 "[http://books.guardian.co.uk/writersreflections/story/0,1367,567546,00.html Has the world changed?]." ''The Guardian''. Accessed 2006-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christopher Hitchens]] (1949–2011), English-American author and journalist, one of the "four horsemen" of [[New Atheism]]. He wrote ''[[God Is Not Great]]: How Religion Poisons Everything'' in 2007.&lt;ref name=hitchensobit&gt;{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/16/arts/christopher-hitchens-is-dead-at-62-obituary.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Christopher Hitchens, Polemicist Who Slashed All, Freely, Dies at 62|last=Grimes|first=William|date=16 December 2011|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Steven Pinker]] (born 1954), Canadian-American cognitive scientist who believes religion incites violence.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he Bible, contrary to what a majority of Americans apparently believe, is far from a source of higher moral values. Religions have given us stonings, witch-burnings, crusades, inquisitions, jihads, fatwas, suicide bombers, gay-bashers, abortion-clinic gunmen, and mothers who drown their sons so they can happily be united in heaven." [http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm The Evolutionary Psychology of Religion], presentation by Steven Pinker to the annual meeting of the [[Freedom from Religion Foundation]], [[Madison, Wisconsin]], October 29, 2004, on receipt of “The Emperor’s New Clothes Award.”&lt;/ref&gt;

;Politicians
* [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870–1924), Soviet leader from 1917 until 1924, who, like most [[Marxist]]s,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} believed all religions to be "the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class".&lt;ref&gt;''"Religion is the [[opium of the people]]: this saying of [[Marx]] is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about the religion. All modern religions and churches, all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction, used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class."''{{cite web |url=http://www.psylib.ukrweb.net/books/maenl01/txt17 |last=Lenin |first=V.

'''Arthur Honegger''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁtyʁ ɔnɛɡɛːʁ|lang}}; 10 March 1892 – 27 November 1955) was a Swiss composer, who was born in France and lived a large part of his life in Paris. He was a member of [[Les Six]]. His most frequently performed work is probably the orchestral work ''[[Pacific 231]]'', which was inspired by the sound of a [[steam engine|steam]] [[locomotive]].

==Biography==
Born '''Oscar-Arthur Honegger''' (the first name was never used) to Swiss parents in [[Le Havre]], France, he initially studied [[harmony]] and [[violin]] in Le Havre. After studying for two years at the [[Zurich University of the Arts|Zurich Conservatory]] he enrolled in the [[Paris Conservatoire]] from 1911 to 1918, studying with both [[Charles-Marie Widor]] and [[Vincent d'Indy]]. He made his Paris compositional debut in 1916 and in 1918 wrote the [[ballet (music)|ballet]] ''Le dit des jeux du monde'', generally considered to be his first characteristic work. In 1926 he married [[Andrée Vaurabourg]], a pianist and fellow student at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]], on the condition that they live in separate apartments. They lived apart for the duration of their marriage, with the exceptions of one year from 1935 to 1936 following Vaurabourg's injury in a car accident, and the last year of Honegger's life, when he was not well enough to live alone. They had one daughter, Pascale, born in 1932. Honegger also had a son, Jean-Claude (1926–2003), with the singer [[Claire Croiza]].

In the early 1920s, Honegger shot to fame with his "dramatic psalm" ''[[Le Roi David]]'' ([[King David]]), which is still in the choral repertoire. Between World War I and World War II, Honegger was very prolific. He composed the music for [[Abel Gance]]'s epic 1927 film, ''[[Napoléon (1927 film)|Napoléon]]''. He composed nine ballets and three vocal stage works, amongst other works. One of those stage works, ''[[Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher]]'' (1935), a "dramatic [[oratorio]]" (to words by [[Paul Claudel]]), is thought of as one of his finest works. In addition to his pieces written alone, he collaborated with [[Jacques Ibert]] on both an opera, ''[[L'Aiglon (opera)|L'Aiglon]]'' (1937), and an [[operetta]]. During this time period he also wrote ''[[Danse de la chèvre]]'' (1921), an essential piece of flute repertoire. Dedicated to [[René Le Roy]] and written for flute alone, this piece is lively and charming, but with the same directness of all Honegger's work.

Honegger always remained in touch with Switzerland, his parents' country of origin, until the outbreak of the war and the invasion of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] made it impossible for him to leave Paris. He joined the [[French Resistance]] and was generally unaffected by the Nazis themselves, who allowed him to continue his work without too much interference. He also taught composition at the [[École Normale de Musique de Paris]], where his students included [[Yves Ramette]]. However, he was greatly depressed by the war. Between its outbreak and his death, he wrote his last four [[symphony|symphonies]] (numbers two to five) which are among the most powerful symphonic works of the 20th century. Of these, the second, for strings, featuring a solo trumpet which plays a chorale tune by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] in the final movement, and the third, subtitled ''[[Symphonie Liturgique]]'' with three movements that evoke the [[Music for the Requiem Mass|Requiem Mass]] ([[Dies irae]], [[Psalm 130|De profundis clamavi]] and [[Dona nobis pacem]]), are probably the best known. Written in 1946 just after the end of the war, it has parallels with [[Benjamin Britten]]'s ''[[Sinfonia da Requiem]]'' of 1940. In contrast with this work is the lyrical, nostalgic Symphony No. 4, subtitled "Deliciae Basilienses" ("The Delights of Basel"), written as a tribute to days of relaxation spent in that Swiss city during the war.

Honegger was widely known as a train enthusiast, and once notably said: "I have always loved locomotives passionately. For me they are living creatures and I love them as others love women or horses." His "mouvement symphonique" ''[[Pacific 231]]'' (a depiction of a steam locomotive) gained him early notoriety in 1923.

Many of Honegger's works were championed by his longtime friend [[Georges Tzipine]], who conducted the premiere recordings of some of them (''Cris du Monde'' oratorio, ''Nicolas de Flüe'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resmusica.com/imprimer.php3?art=1569 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211141751/http://www.resmusica.com/imprimer.php3?art=1569 |date=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 he wrote his last composition, ''[[A Christmas Cantata (Honegger)|A Christmas Cantata]]''. After a protracted illness, he died at home in Paris of a heart attack on 27 November 1955 and was interred in the [[Saint-Vincent Cemetery]] in the [[Montmartre]] Quarter.

The principal elements of Honegger's style are: Bachian counterpoint, driving rhythms, melodic amplitude, highly coloristic harmonies, an impressionistic use of orchestral sonorities, and a concern for formal architecture. His style is weightier and more solemn than that of his colleagues in [[Les Six]]. Far from reacting against German romanticism as the other members of Les Six did, Honegger's mature works show evidence of a distinct influence by it. Despite the differences in their styles, he and fellow Les Six member [[Darius Milhaud]] were close friends, having studied together at the [[Conservatoire de Paris|Paris Conservatoire]]. Milhaud dedicated his fourth string quintet to Honegger's memory, while Francis Poulenc similarly dedicated his [[Clarinet Sonata (Poulenc)|Clarinet Sonata]].

==Legacy==
Honegger was pictured on the Swiss [[Swiss franc#Banknotes|twenty franc banknote]] (eighth series), issued October 1996 and replaced in 2017.

Honegger's symphonic movement ''Rugby'' was recorded with him conducting the Paris Symphony Orchestra in a 1929 electrical recording, which can be heard on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsxqjP0oFXs |title=Arthur Honegger, Rugby (Mouvement symphonique No 2) rec.1929 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Honegger's recordings as conductor of his music have been reissued on CD by Pearl and Dutton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dpopular&amp;field-keywords=honegger+conducts |title=honegger conducts: CDs &amp; Vinyl |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2009-09-09 |accessdate=2014-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Henry 'Bill' Benson''' (1893-1968) was an Australian rugby league player of the 1910s and 1920s.

==Career==

Bill "Binghi" Benson was a pioneer halfback in the early years of the [[NSWRFL]]. He played halfback for the [[Glebe (rugby league team)|Glebe Dirty Reds]] for ten seasons between 1916-1924. He then switched to [[St George Dragons]] for his final season with his Glebe team-mate [[Frank Burge]], and the two of them took [[St George Dragons|St George]] to the [[1927 NSWRFL season|1927 Final]] after the club got the wooden spoon the year before. He represented [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] on five occasions between 1921-1924, but was never selected to play for Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Whiticker/Glen Hudson: Encyclopedia of Rugby League Players, 1995 ({{ISBN|1875169571}})&lt;/ref&gt;

A resident of [[Forest Lodge, New South Wales]] for his entire life, Bill Benson died after watching a world cup match between Australia and England at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] on 25 May 1968. He was aged 75. His funeral was held two days later and he was cremated at Woronora Crematorium, [[Sutherland, New South Wales]] &lt;ref&gt;Sydney Morning Herald: Death Notice 27/5/1968&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12543">'''COLD-PCR''' ('''co'''-amplification at '''l'''ower '''d'''enaturation temperature-'''PCR''') is a modified [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]] (PCR) protocol that enriches variant [[alleles]] from a mixture of wildtype and [[mutation]]-containing [[DNA]].  The ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low-level [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] DNA mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations. Detection of mutations is important in the case of early [[cancer]] detection from [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] [[biopsies]] and body fluids such as [[blood plasma]] or [[Serum (blood)|serum]], assessment of residual [[disease]] after [[surgery]] or [[chemotherapy]], disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients, and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse.  Common PCR will amplify both the major (wildtype) and minor (mutant) alleles with the same efficiency, occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low-level mutations.  The capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant/wildtype DNA is valuable because this mixture of variant DNAs can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample – as is often the case with cancer biopsies.  Currently, traditional PCR is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for [[genotyping]] or the detection of [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] mutations.  These can include the use of amplified DNA for [[RFLP]] analysis, [[MALDI-TOF]] (matrix-assisted laser-desorption–time-of-flight) genotyping, or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by [[Sanger sequencing]] or [[pyrosequencing]].  Replacing traditional PCR with COLD-PCR for these downstream assays will increase the reliability in detecting mutations from mixed samples, including [[tumors]] and body fluids.

==COLD-PCR Method Overview==
[[File:COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of COLD-PCR compared to regular PCR.|Conventional PCR compared to COLD-PCR.]]
The underlying principle of COLD-PCR is that single [[nucleotide]] mismatches will slightly alter the melting temperature (Tm) of the double-stranded DNA.  Depending on the sequence context and position of the mismatch, Tm changes of 0.2-1.5&amp;nbsp;°C (0.36-2.7&amp;nbsp;°F). are common for sequences up to 200bp or higher. Knowing this the authors of the protocol took advantage of two observations:
*Each double-stranded DNA has a ‘critical temperature’ (Tc) lower than its Tm.  The PCR amplification efficiency drops measurably below the Tc.
*The Tc is dependent on DNA sequence.  Two template DNA fragments differing by only one or two nucleotide mismatches will have different amplification efficiencies if the denaturation step of PCR is set to the Tc.

Keeping these principles in mind the authors developed the following general protocol:
#Denaturation stage.  DNA is denatured at a high temperature{{spaced ndash}}usually {{Convert|94|C|F}}.
#Intermediate annealing stage.  Set an intermediate annealing temperature that allows hybridization of mutant and wildtype allele DNA to one another.  Because the mutant allele DNA forms the minority of DNA in the mixture they will be more likely to form mismatch heteroduplex DNA with the wildtype DNA.
#Melting stage.  These heteroduplexes will more readily melt at lower temperatures.  Hence they are selectively denatured at the Tc.
#Primer annealing stage.  The homo-duplex DNA will preferentially remain double stranded and not be available for primer annealing.
#Extension stage.  The DNA polymerase will extend complementary to the template DNA.  Since the heteroduplex DNA is used as template, a larger proportion of minor variant DNA will be amplified and be available for subsequent rounds of PCR.

There are two forms of COLD-PCR that have been developed to date.  Full COLD-PCR and Fast COLD-PCR.
[[File:Fast versus Full COLD-PCR.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|alt=An overview of Full COLD-PCR in comparison to Fast COLD-PCR.|Full COLD-PCR versus Fast COLD-PCR.]]

===Full COLD-PCR===
Full COLD-PCR is identical to the protocol outlined above.  These five stages are used for each round of amplification.

===Fast COLD-PCR===
Fast COLD-PCR differs from Full COLD-PCR in that the denaturation and intermediate annealing stages are skipped.  This is because, in some cases, the preferential amplification of the mutant DNA is so great that ensuring the formation of the mutant/wildtype heteroduplex DNA is not needed.  Thus the denaturation can occur at the Tc, proceed to primer annealing, and then polymerase-mediated extension.  Each round of amplification will include these three stages in that order.  By utilizing the lower denaturation temperature, the reaction will discriminate towards the products with the lower Tm – i.e. the variant alleles.  Fast COLD-PCR produces much faster results due to the shortened protocol.  However, it is important to note that Full COLD-PCR is essential for amplification of all possible mutations in the starting mixture of DNA.

Two-round COLD-PCR is a modified version of Fast COLD-PCR.  During the second round of Fast COLD-PCR nested primers are used.  This improves the sensitivity of mutation detection compared to one-round Fast COLD-PCR.&lt;ref name=nested&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Milbury CA, Li C, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Two-round COLD-PCR-based Sanger sequencing identifies a novel spectrum of low-level mutations in lung adenocarcinoma |journal=Human Mutation |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1583–90 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19760750 |pmc=2784016 |doi=10.1002/humu.21112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of COLD-PCR to Date==
COLD-PCR has been used to improve the reliability of a number of different assays that traditionally use conventional PCR.
[[File:COLD-PCR applications.jpg|thumb|alt=Some of the downstream applications for COLD-PCR.|Downstream applications using conventional PCR that can be replaced by COLD-PCR.]]

===RFLP and COLD-PCR===
A restriction fragment length polymorphism results in the cleavage (or absence thereof) of DNA for a specific mutation by a selected restriction enzyme that will not cleave the wildtype DNA.  In a study using a mixture of wildtype and mutation containing DNA amplified by regular PCR or COLD-PCR, COLD-PCR preceding RFLP analysis was shown to improve the mutation detection by 10-20 fold.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Wang L, Mamon H, [[Matthew Kulke|Kulke MH]], Berbeco R, Makrigiorgos GM |title=Replacing PCR with COLD-PCR enriches variant DNA sequences and redefines the sensitivity of genetic testing |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=579–84 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18408729 |doi=10.1038/nm1708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanger Sequencing and COLD-PCR===
Sanger sequencing recently was used to evaluate the enrichment of mutant DNA from a mixture of 1:20 mutant:wildtype DNA.  The variant DNA containing a mutation was obtained from a [[breast cancer]] cell line known to contain [[p53]] mutations.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt;  Comparison of Sanger sequencing chromatograms indicated that the mutant allele was enriched 13 fold when COLD-PCR was used compared to traditional PCR alone.&lt;ref name=nested /&gt;  This was determined by the size of the peaks on the chromatogram at the variant allele location.

As well, COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 mutations from lung-[[adenocarcinoma]] samples.  The study was able to detect 8 low level (under 20% abundance) mutations that would likely have been missed using conventional methods that don’t enrich for variant sequence DNA .

===Pyrosequencing and COLD-PCR===
Similar to its use in direct Sanger sequencing, with pyrosequencing COLD-PCR was shown to be capable of detecting mutations that had a prevalence 0.5-1% from the samples used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zuo Z, Chen SS, Chandra PK |title=Application of COLD-PCR for improved detection of KRAS mutations in clinical samples |journal=Modern Pathology |volume=22 |issue=8 |pages=1023–31 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19430420 |doi=10.1038/modpathol.2009.59|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; COLD-PCR was used to detect p53 and KRAS mutations by pyrosequencing, and was shown to outperform conventional PCR in both cases.

===MALDI-TOF and COLD-PCR===
The same research group that developed COLD-PCR and used it to compare the sensitivity of regular PCR for genotyping with direct Sanger sequencing, RFLP, and pyrosequencing, also ran a similar study using MALDI-TOF as a downstream application for detecting mutations.  Their results indicated that COLD-PCR could enrich mutation sequences from a mixture of DNA by 10-100 fold and that mutations with an initial prevalence of 0.1-0.5% would be detectable.&lt;ref name=review&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=COLD-PCR: a new platform for highly improved mutation detection in cancer and genetic testing |journal=Biochemical Society Transactions |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=427–32 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19290875 |doi=10.1042/BST0370427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the 5-10% low-level detection rate expected with traditional PCR.

===QPCR and COLD-PCR===
COLD-PCR run on a [[quantitative PCR]] machine, using [[TaqMan]] probes specific for a mutation, was shown to increase the measured difference between mutant and wildtype samples.&lt;ref name=review /&gt;

==Advantages of COLD-PCR==
*Single-step method capable of enriching both known and unknown minority alleles irrespective of mutation type and position.
*Does not require any extra reagents or specialized machinery.  Therefore, the cost is not increased.
*Better than conventional PCR for the detection of mutations in a mixed sample.
*Does not significantly increase experiment run time compared to conventional PCR.

==Disadvantages of COLD-PCR==
*Optimal Tc must be measured and determined for each amplicon.  Adding an extra step to conventional PCR-based procedures.
*Requirement for precise denaturation temperature control during PCR to within ± 0.3&amp;nbsp;°C (0.54&amp;nbsp;°F).
*A suitable critical temperature may not be available that differentiates between mutant and wildtype DNA sequences.
*Restricted to analyzing sequences smaller than approximately 200bp.
*Vulnerable to polymerase-introduced errors.
*Variable overall mutation enrichment which depends on DNA position and nucleotide substitution.
*No guarantee that all low-level mutations will be preferentially enriched.

==History==
COLD-PCR was originally described by Li ''et al.'' in a Nature Medicine paper published in 2008 from Dr. Mike Makrigiorgos’s lab group at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute of Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name=original /&gt;  As summarized above, the technology has been used in a number of proof-of-principle experiments and medical research diagnostic experiments.

Recently, the COLD-PCR technology has been licensed by Transgenomic, Inc.  The licensing terms include the exclusive rights to commercialize the technology combined with Sanger sequencing.  The plans are to develop commercial applications that will allow for rapid high-sensitivity detection of low-level somatic and mitochondrial DNA mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Laboratorytalk editorial team|date=Oct 2009|title=Transgenomics licenses COLD-PCR technology|url=http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html|access-date=2010-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718232900/http://www.laboratorytalk.com/news/trb/trb121.html#|archive-date=2011-07-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
Other technologies are available for the detection of minority DNA mutations, and these methods can be segregated into their ability to enrich for and detect either known or unknown mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Milbury CA, Li J, Makrigiorgos GM |title=PCR-Based Methods for the Enrichment of Minority Alleles and Mutations |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=632–40 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19201784 |pmc=2811432 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.113035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">The '''''Davidsbündler''''' ('''League of David''') was a music [[society]] created by [[Robert Schumann]] in his writings.  It was inspired by [[literary society|literary societies]], real and imagined ones, such as the ''Serapionsbrüder'' ([[The Serapion Brethren]]) of [[ETA Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name="Daverio"&gt;Daverio, John. ''Robert Schumann: Herald of a "New Poetic Age"''. Oxford University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The group was created to defend the cause of contemporary music against its detractors. Its two main members were supposed to be named Florestan and Eusebius, respectively symbolising the extroverted and introspective sides of his personality.&lt;ref name="Schonberg 177"&gt;Schonberg, Harold C. ''The Lives of the Great Composers'', p. 177. W.W. Norton, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The name "Davidsbündler" already appears in Schumann's first musical essay, "The Davidsbündler" which was published in Karl Herloßsohn’s newspaper "Der Komet" (The Comet) in December 1833. Its narrator finds a paper shred thrown out of a window by a "Swedish head with a crooked nose" bearing the following message on its backside: "Finder! To the Good and to the Great you have been chosen! Davidsbündler you shall become, [you shall] translate the secrets of the Society of the World, i.e. of the society, which shall swat the Philistines, musical and otherwise! Here you know all – take action then! By no means organize provincially however, but deliver wildly and crazily! Master Raro, Florestan, Eusebius, Friedrich, Bg., St., Hf., Knif, bellows treader at St. Georg." The continuation of this "Davidsbündler" fantasizing can be found in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]'', which Schumann founded in April 1834.&lt;ref name="Geck"&gt;Geck, Martin. ''Robert Schumann: Mensch und Musiker der Romantik''. Siedler Verlag, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year 1834 Schumann composed three pieces carrying the titles "Florestan", "Eusebius" and "Marche des Davidsbündler contre les Philistins" in his ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]''.

In 1837 Schumann wrote a piano suite, ''[[Davidsbündlertänze]]'',  Op. 6, named after the Davidsbündler.

A '''designer baby''' is a human [[embryo]] which has been [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]], usually following guidelines set by the parent or scientist, to produce desirable traits. This is done using [[germinal choice technology|various methods]], such as [[human germline engineering|germline engineering]] or [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD). This technology is the subject of ethical debate, bringing up the concept of genetically modified "superhumans" to interbreed with and eventually replace modern humans.

==Preimplantation genetic diagnosis==
{{Main article|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}

In [[medicine]] and (clinical) [[genetics]] '''pre-implantation genetic diagnosis''' (PGD or PIGD) (also known as '''embryo screening''') is a procedure performed on [[embryo]]s  prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], sometimes even on [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. The methods of PGD help to identify and locate genetic defects in early embryos that were conceived through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stankovic|first=Bratislav|date=2005-02-07|title='It's a Designer Baby!' - Opinions on Regulation of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis|ssrn=1756573|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVF procedure is carried out by the removal of one or two cells when the embryo is at a specific stage in development. The PGD uses the IVF technique to obtain [[oocyte]]s or [[embryo]]s for evaluation of the organism's genome.

The PGD procedures allow scientists to identify damaged or mutated genes associated with diseases in the oocytes or embryos by using [[In situ hybridization|in-situ hybridization]] (ISH).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Mark|year=2008|title=Designer babies’ and Harm to Supernumerary Embryos|url=|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=45.4|pages=349–364|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISH technique labels specific nucleic acid sequences on a gene that can help detect genetic abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Ryan|year=2010|title=Applications of Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) in Detecting Genetic Aberrations of Medical Significance|url=|journal=Bioscience Horizons|volume=3.1|pages=85–95|via=|doi=10.1093/biohorizons/hzq009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, this technique can also help select for desirable traits by avoiding implanting embryos with genes that have serious diseases or disabilities. Examples of desirable traits that could be selected would be increased muscle mass, voice pitch, or high intelligence. Overall, the procedure of PGD to select for a positive trait is referred to the creation of a "designer baby".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This is not a new technology - the first PGD babies, and thus also the first designer babies were created in 1989 and born in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handyside AH, Kontogianni EH, Hardy K, Winston RM |title=Pregnancies from biopsied human preimplantation embryos sexed by Y-specific DNA amplification |journal=Nature |volume=344 |issue=6268 |pages=768–70 |year=1990 |pmid=2330030 |doi=10.1038/344768a0 |bibcode=1990Natur.344..768H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 article by Carolyn Abraham in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' stated that "Recent breakthroughs have made it possible to scan every chromosome in a single embryonic cell, to test for genes involved in hundreds of 'conditions,' some of which are clearly life-threatening while others are less dramatic and less certain". There is already a "[[DNA microarray|microchip]] that can test a remarkable 1,500 genetic traits at once, including [[heart disease]], [[seasonal affective disorder]], [[obesity]], [[Athletics (U.S.)|athletic]] ability, [[Human hair color|hair]] and [[eye color]], [[Human height|height]], susceptibility to [[alcohol]] and [[nicotine]] addictions, [[lactose intolerance]] and one of several genes linked to [[intelligence]]. It is still difficult to get enough DNA for such extensive testing but the chip designer thinks this technical problem will be solved soon.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Abraham, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/pregnancy/pregnancy-trends/unnatural-selection-is-evolving-reproductive-technology-ushering-in-a-new-age-of-eugenics/article2294636/singlepage/ Unnatural selection: Is evolving reproductive technology ushering in a new age of eugenics?],  January  07, 2012, ''The Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis===
PGD has been used primarily for medical purposes, but as the possibilities of the procedure increase the idea of non-medical uses has become a popular topic of debate. Non-medical motivations could lead to potential problems when trying to make the distinction of when the procedure is needed or desired.

For example, PGD has the ability to select an embryo based on gender preferences (Stankovic). Since changing a gender is not needed, but desired this could cause much controversy. Additionally, the procedure is able to create a donor offspring or a “savior sibling”, which can assist a pre-existing offspring for medical purposes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The “savior sibling” is a brother or sister that is created to donate life-saving tissue to an existing child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=S.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=S.|date=2004-12-01|title=Should selecting saviour siblings be banned?|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/6/533|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=30|issue=6|pages=533–537|doi=10.1136/jme.2003.004150|issn=1473-4257|pmc=1733988|pmid=15574438}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been arguments against the procedures of  “savior siblings” because many believe that this will lead humans closer to the creation of designer babies. For example, one critique said, “the new technique is a dangerous first step towards allowing parents to use embryo testing to choose other characteristics of the baby, such as eye colour and sex”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2125482.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Pro-life challenge to embryo testing|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]] of traits through the use of PGD has become a widely debated topic and governments have started to regulate this procedure.

Many countries completely prohibit PGD, including [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], and [[Switzerland]]. Other countries restrict PGD to medical use only, including [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

In contrast, the United States federal law does not have any regulation of PGD. Those who are in favor of PGD believe the government should not be involved in the procedure and parents should have a reproductive choice. The opposing side has argued that PGD will allow embryo selection based on trivial traits. While other critics believe that this procedure could lead to a new form of [[Eugenics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The regulation of PGD has become an important topic, however much of the artificial trait selection remains only prospective until technology advances. For example, scientist do not know which specific gene is associated with specific traits, like voice pitch or intelligence. Nevertheless, with the current rate of technological advancements, it is believed that in the next twenty years the artificial selection of desirable traits will exist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Human germline engineering==

The other use for ''designer babies'' concerns possible uses of [[human germline engineering]] techniques (such as [[CRISPR]]) to create desired genetic traits of a child, such as disease resistance, athletic ability, and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon JW |title=Genetic enhancement in humans |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5410 |pages=2023–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10206908 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5410.2023 |bibcode=1999Sci...283.2023G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding of genetics for human traits===
{{Expand Section|date=December 2012}}
[[Genetics]] explains the process of parents passing down certain genes to their children. Genes are inherited from both biological parents, and each gene expresses a specific trait. The traits expressed by genes can be something physically seen—such as hair color, eye color, or height—or can be things such as diseases and disorders.&lt;ref name="What is Genetics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Genetics.aspx|title=What is Genetics?|date=2009-12-11|newspaper=News-Medical.net|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human genes are found within chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 individual chromosomes. 23 chromosomes are inherited from the father, and 23 from the mother. Each chromosome can carry about 20,000 genes.&lt;ref name="What is Genetics"/&gt;

Researchers have already connected the genes in the striped zebra fish which control the colour of the fish to genes in humans that determine skin colour.&lt;ref name="Green 2007" /&gt; Many other things could be discovered in further years especially with the new possibilities of cloning animals.

Scientists have been able to better understand the genetic traits of humans through projects such as The [[Human Genome Project]]. This project was launched around 1990 and was an international research project that had an end goal of mapping and understanding every gene in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/12011238/an-overview-of-the-human-genome-project/|title=An Overview of the Human Genome Project - National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the Human Genome Project, we have been able to pin point specific locations for about 12,800 specific genes within different chromosomes.&lt;ref name="What is Genetics"/&gt;

In recent times, the cost of gene sequencing has been radically reduced due to technological developments such as [[next generation sequencing]]. This enables the development of [[Biobank]]s that can store genetic information about a large number of people, enabling studies such as [[Genome-wide association study]] on genetic variants that cause common phenotypic traits in many people.

=== Germline modification ===
Germline modification has been around since the 1980s, as there have been successful animal trials dating back to that time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kevin R.|last2=Chan|first2=Sarah|last3=Harris|first3=John|title=Human Germline Genetic Modification: Scientific and Bioethical Perspectives|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0188440912002445|journal=Archives of Medical Research|volume=43|issue=7|pages=491–513|doi=10.1016/j.arcmed.2012.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order for [[germline]] modification to be successful, medical professionals must know how to introduce a gene into the patient's’ cell and the germline so that it will be transferred subsequent generations and still maintain the proper functionality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The way in which genes are integrated into the DNA is what determines that difference between germline modification and [[somatic cell]] modification.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lappé|first=Marc|date=1991-12-01|title=Ethical Issues in Manipulating the Human Germ Line|url=http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/6/621|journal=Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=621–639|doi=10.1093/jmp/16.6.621|issn=0360-5310|pmid=1787391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to be transferred to subsequent generations, these changes need to be carried out through the development of [[germ cell]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8852-0_12|title=Medical Enhancement and Posthumanity|last=Dresser|first=Rebecca|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402088513|editor-last=Gordijn|editor-first=Bert|series=The International Library of Ethics, Law and Technology|pages=191–205|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8852-0_12|editor-last2=Chadwick|editor-first2=Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the germline result in permanent and heritable changes to the DNA.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While amplification of positive effects would occur, there is also the risk that amplification of possible negative effects would also occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since the results are generational, it is more complicated to study the long-term effects and therefore it is not a simple task to figure out if the benefits of germline modification outweigh the harm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Allowing families to have the ability to design their children and select for desirable traits is another major concern that germline modification presents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Germline modification can be accomplished through different techniques that focus on modification of the [[epithelium|germinal epithelium]], [[germ cell]]s, or the [[fertilized egg]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Most of the techniques include transporting [[transgene]]s and then the transgenes are integrated with the DNA of the zygote.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  After integration, the transgene becomes a stable and functioning portion of the host’s genome.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  One technique involves a specific sequence of cloned DNA being inserted into the fertilized egg using the [[microinjection]] technique.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The sequence is inserted directly into the pronucleus.  The second technique uses the [[transfection]] process.  Stem cells obtained from the embryo during the [[blastocyst]]s stage are modified, combined with [[naked DNA]], and the resulting cell is reinserted into the embryo that is developing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The third technique focuses on carrying DNA into the embryo by using [[retrovirus]]es.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Feasibility of gene therapy===
{{Main article|Gene therapy}}

Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a pharmaceutical agent to treat disease.  [[Gene therapy vector|Gene]] therapy was first conceptualized in 1972, with the authors urging caution before commencing gene therapy studies in humans.&lt;ref name="Friedman 1972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=Gene therapy for human genetic disease? |journal=Science |volume=178 |issue=4061 |pages=648–9 |year=1972 |pmid=4343766 |doi=10.1126/science.178.4061.648 |bibcode=1972Sci...175..949F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first FDA-approved gene therapy experiment in the [[United States]] occurred in 1990, on a four-year-old girl named, Ashanti DeSilva, she was treated for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA]]-[[severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]].&lt;ref name="Gene Therapy Finds Its Niche"&gt;Sheridan, C. (2011). Gene therapy finds its niche. Nature Publishing Group, 29(2), 121–128. Nature Publishing Group. {{doi|10.1038/nbt.1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/genetics/sect4.htm|title=Gene Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a disease that had left her defenseless against infections spreading throughout her body. Dr. [[William French Anderson|W French Anderson]] was a major lead on this clinical trial, he worked for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/genetics/sect4.htm|title=Gene Therapy - A Revolution in Progress: Human Genetics and Medical Research|website=history.nih.gov|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, over 1,700 clinical trials have been conducted using a number of techniques for gene therapy.&lt;ref name="JGenMed Database"&gt;''J. Gene Med.'' [http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/ Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Database].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techniques in gene therapy ===
The techniques used in gene therapy, which are also referred to as vectors, have a method of using a healthy gene to attack and replace an infected gene. The number of techniques or vectors that have been used to conduct these clinical trials vary. A few of the techniques are basic processing, [[gene doping]], and [[viral vector]]s. Viral infections can be life-threatening in patients who are immune-compromised because they cannot mount an effective immune response. Approaches to protection from infection using gene therapy include T cell-based immunotherapy, stem-cell based therapy, genetic vaccines, and other approaches to genetic blockade of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asgct.org/about_gene_therapy/diseases.php|title=Gene Therapy for Diseases {{!}} ASGCT - American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy|website=www.asgct.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other approaches known as T cell-based approaches, cell therapy, stem-cell-based approaches, and genetic vaccines.

Basic processing can be achieved through replacement of a mutated gene, inactivation of a mutated gene, or introduction of a new gene to help fight a disease caused by mutation. Secondly, gene doping is a procedure of gene therapy that modulates gene expression of a particular gene. This procedure is mainly used to improve athletic ability for sporting events. This is a genetic form of human enhancement that is able to treat muscle-wasting disorders. It is a highly controversial procedure because the results do nothing unusual to the bloodstream, so athletic officials would be unable to detect chemicals in a blood or urine test. An example of gene doping would be proving athlete with [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), a hormone that increases the red blood cell count. Lastly, viral vectors are able to mimic the methods of a normal virus in the human body to introduce favorable genes into a human cell. For instance, scientists are able to positively change the host's genome by removing the genes that cause disease from a virus and replacing it with genes of the desired trait (“Types of Gene Therapy”).

The aforementioned techniques have been used by scientists, but the most popularized techniques are [[naked DNA]] and DNA complexes. The injection of the naked DNA is the simplest form of the vector delivery method. The naked DNA is a histone-free, modified DNA sequence that removes proteins that would normally surround these structures. This form of delivery is sometimes used as a natural compound, but the United States has been making large waves of synthetic compounds for gene delivery. The other form, which is DNA complexes, has been used when a compound is crossed with a chemical mix in order to produce the desired compound. There are other studies that are currently underway that have been referred to as the hybrid method because there is a combination of two or more gene therapy techniques used. This can instill the idea that the desired gene will stick during the delivery, transfer, and implant.

The manipulation of an organism’s genome for a desirable trait is related to the medical procedure of [[cloning]]. The process of [[cloning]] results in making genetically identical organisms. Moreover, scientists can use gene therapy vectors to modify the DNA to be identical to a particular organism. Moreover, the techniques established by the field of gene therapy can potentially be used to create “designer babies”. This can be achieved through the use of IVF to assist in creating a genetically designed baby.

==== Disease control in gene therapy ====
Gene therapy is being studied for the treatment of a wide variety of acquired and inherited disorders. Retroviruses, adenoviruses, poxviruses, herpesviruses, and others are being engineered to serve as gene therapy vectors and are being administered to patients in a clinical setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Martin E.|last2=Lesnaw|first2=Judith A.|date=2002-09-01|title=Infection Control for Gene Therapy: A Busy Physician's Primer|url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/5/597|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=35|issue=5|pages=597–605|doi=10.1086/342194|issn=1058-4838|pmid=12173136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other genetic disorders that could potentially be implemented in clinical trials are [[Adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA-SCID]], which as stated earlier is [[Severe combined immunodeficiency|severe combined immune deficiency]] [[Chronic granulomatous disease|CGD]] which is a chronic [[granulomatous]] [[Disorder (medicine)|disorder]], and [[haemophilia]]. These examples of disorders are only a few among numerous others that are being discovered.  Some of the acquired diseases that can be potentially controlled in a clinical trial with gene therapy are cancer and [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]] or [[Huntington's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asgct.org/about_gene_therapy/diseases.php|title=Gene Therapy for Disease|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and risks==

Lee Silver has projected a [[dystopia]] in which a race of [[Übermensch|superior humans]] look down on those without genetic enhancements, though others have counseled against accepting this vision of the future.&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"&gt;{{cite book| author=Silver, Lee M.| title=Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World| publisher=Harper Perennial| year=1998| isbn=0-380-79243-5| authorlink=Lee M.

There are risks associated with genetic modifications to any organism.  When focusing on the ethics behind this treatment, medical professionals and clinical ethicists take many factors into consideration.  They look at whether or not the goal and outcome of the treatment are supposed to impact an individual and their family lineage or a group of people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The main ethical issue with pure germline modification is that these types of treatments will produce a change that can be passed down to future generations and therefore any error, known or unknown, will also be passed down and will affect the offspring.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=W. French|date=1985-08-01|title=Human Gene Therapy: Scientific and Ethical Considerations|url=http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/275|journal=Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=275–292|doi=10.1093/jmp/10.3.275|issn=0360-5310|pmid=3900264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New diseases may be introduced accidentally.&lt;ref name = "Green 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Green | first = Ronald M. | title = Babies By Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2007 | location = New Haven | pages = 96–97 | id = 129954761 | isbn = 978-0-300-12546-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agar2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agar|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Designer Babies: Ethical Considerations|url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/agar.html|journal=ActionBioscience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of germline modification is justified when it is used to correct genetic problems that cannot be treated with somatic cell therapy, stabilize DNA in a mating that has the potential to be high risk, provide an alternative to the abortion of embryos that genetically problematic for a family, and intensify the incidence of genes that are favorable and desirable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This can ultimately lead to perfected lineages on a genotypic level and possibly a phenotypic level.  Ultimately, these issues raise potential questions about the welfare and identity of individuals that have been genetically modified through the germline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Safety is a major concern when it comes to the gene editing and mitochondrial transfer. Since the effects of germline modification can be passed down to multiple generations, experimentation of this treatment brings forth many questions and concerns about the ethics of completing this research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  If a patient has undergone germline modification treatment, the coming generations, one or two after the initial treatment, will be used as trials to see if the changes in the germline have been successful.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This extended waiting time could possess harmful implications since the effect of the treatment is not known until it has been passed down to a few generations.  Problems with the gene editing may not appear until after the child with edited genes is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2016|title=Designer babies|journal=Obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive medicine|volume=26|issue=2|pages=59–60|doi=10.1016/j.ogrm.2015.11.011|last1=Pang|first1=Ronald T.K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the patient assumes the risk alone, consent may be given for the treatment, but it is less justified when it comes to giving consent for future generations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  On a larger scale, germline modification has the potential to impact the gene pool of the entire human race in a negative or positive way.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Germline modification is considered a more ethically and morally acceptable treatment when a patient is a carrier for a harmful trait and is treated to improve the genotype and safety of the future generations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  When the treatment is used for this purpose, it can fill the gaps that other technologies may not be able to accomplish.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since experimentation of the germline occurs directly on embryos, there is a major ethical deliberation on experimenting with fertilized eggs and embryos and killing the flawed ones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The embryo cannot give consent and some of the treatments have long-lasting and harmful implications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In many countries, editing embryos and germline modification for reproductive use is illegal.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishii|first=Tetsuya|title=Germline genome-editing research and its socioethical implications|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471491415001070|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|volume=21|issue=8|pages=473–481|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2015.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2017, the United States of America restricts the use of germline modification and the procedure is under heavy regulation by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The American [[National Academy of Sciences]] and [[National Academy of Medicine]] gave qualified support to human genome editing in 2017 once answers have been found to safety and efficiency problems "but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/health/human-gene-editing-panel.html|title=Human Gene Editing Receives Science Panel’s Support|last=Harmon|first=Amy|date=2017-02-14|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germline modification would be more practical if sampling methods were less destructive and used the polar bodies rather than embryos.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another risk involved with having a designer baby is the lack of regulation of egg freezing centers as shown by failures in egg clinics at the Pacific Fertility Clinic in San Francisco and at the Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Jane. “Egg Freezing Industry Reeling After Two Major Malfunctions.” NBC News, 12 Mar. 2018, www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/egg-freezing-industry-reeling-after-two-major-malfunctions-n856016. Accessed 25 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these centers lost hundreds of eggs after some of the tanks holding the eggs failed. Egg freezing centers are not required to report their failures to any government agency and don't have to tell the public unless a negative news report comes out about the incident. One of these facilities already knew that the tank that malfunctioned had issues long before, and the eggs were supposed to be transferred from the defective tank but they never were.

In 2018, the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] issued a report which concluded that under certain circumstances, editing of the DNA of human embryos could be acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=Nigel|date=2018-07-17|title=Human genome editing is not unethical, says Nuffield Council|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3140|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=362|pages=k3140|doi=10.1136/bmj.k3140|issn=0959-8138|pmid=30018086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nuffield Council is a British independent organisation that evaluates ethical questions in medicine and biology.

[[Euthanasia]] is illegal in [[New Zealand]]. Two attempts at passing legislation to legalise euthanasia failed to get through Parliament. It is also illegal to 'aid and abet [[suicide]]' under Section 179 of the New Zealand [[Crimes Act 1961]].&lt;ref&gt;Butterworth: Crimes Act 1961: Wellington: [[Lexis/Nexis]]: 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The clauses of this act make it an offence to 'incite, procure or counsel' and 'aid and abet' someone else to commit suicide, regardless of whether a suicide attempt is made or not. Section 179 covers both assisted suicide and true suicide, such as that caused by bullying.

The controversial book ''[[The Peaceful Pill Handbook]]'' describing how to perform euthanasia was initially banned in New Zealand. Since May 2008 it has been allowed for sale to readers over eighteen years of age, if it is sealed and an indication of the censorship classification is displayed. In addition, author [[Philip Nitschke]] excised a section that dealt specifically with methods of suicide, which might otherwise have fallen afoul of Section 179.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Annual Report 2007/08, Peaceful Pill | publisher=[[Office of Film and Literature Classification (New Zealand)]] | author=Hastings, W K | authorlink=Bill Hastings (censor) | year=2008 | location=Wellington | pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advance directive==
Patients are able to withhold treatment if it may shorten their life and [[Advance healthcare directive|advance directives]] are recognised by law.

Right 7 of the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdc.org.nz/theact/theact-thecodeclause2 |title=The HDC Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights Regulation 1996 |publisher=Health and Disability Commissioner |accessdate=2009-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106120919/http://www.hdc.org.nz/theact/theact-thecodeclause2 |archivedate=January 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"5) Every consumer may use an advance directive in accordance with the common law."

:"7) Every consumer has the right to refuse services and to withdraw consent to services."

This code is enshrined in law under the [[Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994]].

The New Zealand Medical Association oppose voluntary euthanasia and doctor assisted suicide maintaining that it is unethical regardless of whether the patient or relatives wishes to have it carried out.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nzma.org.nz/news/policies/euthanasia.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
A survey done by [[Massey University]] in 2003 showed that 73% wanted [[assisted suicide]] legalised if it was performed by a doctor, but if done by others support dropped to 49%. The wording of the questions were:
:"Suppose a person has a painful incurable disease. Do you think that doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient’s life if the patient requests it?"
:"Still thinking of that person with a painful incurable disease. Do you think that someone else, like a close relative, should be allowed by law to help end the patient’s life, if the patient requests it?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/2003/press_releases/30_01_03a.html|title=Massey survey shows support for euthanasia|date=2003-01-30|publisher=Massey University|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey carried out on behalf of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society in 2008 showed that 71% of New Zealanders want to have it legalised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/25502/most-support-voluntary-euthanasia-survey|title=Most support voluntary euthanasia: survey |date=2008-10-03|publisher=ODT|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The question read:
:"In some countries, though not all, if you have an illness that results in your being unable to have an acceptable quality of life, you are legally allowed to get help from a doctor to help you to die. If you had an illness or condition which resulted in your having a quality of life that was totally unacceptable to you, would you like to have the legal right to choose a medically assisted death?"&lt;ref name="ves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.org.nz/polls.php|title=Poll Results|publisher=Voluntary Euthanasia Society|accessdate=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 survey by Massey University gave similar results.&lt;ref name="ves"/&gt;

In 2015 a 3 News/Reid Research poll showed 71% want the law changed with 24% opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Poll: Kiwis want euthanasia legalised|url = http://www.3news.co.nz/nznews/poll-kiwis-want-euthanasia-legalised-2015072717#ixzz3xagQ5UlR|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stance by religious organisations==
{{Disputed-section|date=August 2016}} The [[Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia]], part of the [[Anglican Communion]] is the second largest church in New Zealand,&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"&gt;http://www.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013-census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-culture-identity/religion.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. On February 1, 2016 nine bishops made an oral submission to the Health Select Committee concerning medically assisted dying and Maryan Street's petition. In this submission they reiterated the importance of protecting human life and in conclusion made these three points:
1. New Zealand should not enact legislation that would establish medically-assisted dying as an authorised form of terminating life, thus undermining a fundamental ethical principle.
2. We should take steps to increase resources for palliative care, and the provision of social support for the lonely, ageing and depressed.
3. We should enhance support for families caring for those with terminal illnesses to assist them in understanding what is happening and likely to happen, how to manage stress and grief, and how to build positive relationships with the dying, remembering that dying can be an important last phase of life in resolving conflicts of the past and establishing new relationships of love and care. &lt;ref name="anglicantaonga.org.nz"&gt;http://www.anglicantaonga.org.nz/features/extra/bishops_parliamentary_submission&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.catholic.org.nz/ Catholic Church in Aotearoa New Zealand], the largest Christian denomination in New Zealand,&lt;ref name="stats.govt.nz"/&gt; is broadly opposed to legalising euthanasia/physician assisted suicide. There are several reasons put forth by the New Zealand Catholic Bishops Bioethics Agency, [http://nathaniel.org.nz/ The Nathaniel Centre], against legalising euthanasia/physician assisted suicide. Firstly, safeguards such as limiting of access to a narrow group of people will not eliminate the possibility of abuses occurring. They say that it is inevitable that when following a liberal philosophy in this instance, boundaries established initially will likely be widened to allow for other interest groups to access euthanasia. Secondly, granting the choice to be killed, or receive aided death will undermine the choice and/or will of many others to live. Thirdly, legalising physician assisted suicide/euthanasia infers acceptance of the notion that 'some suicides are okay'. They say this would undermine work undertaken in recent years by various non-government and government groups to remove the various stigmas associated depression and other mental illnesses that are known to be influencing factors in an individual not seeking treatment, which ultimately leads to some individuals ending their own life. This is particularly so in relation to youth suicide. Finally, broad societal support is given to the ongoing effort within the practice of palliative care to address the needs of the whole patient and their families. They say that legalising euthanasia/physician assisted suicide may hamper progress in supporting quality of life for those who want to live. "The key issue is not compassion or morality—people on both sides of the debate want to prevent intolerable suffering. The key issue is the long-term consequences of a law change for public safety. This is an issue of social justice—protecting the vulnerable."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.org.nz/news/fx-view-article.cfm?ctype=BSART&amp;loadref=51&amp;id=239&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salvation Army opposes euthanasia. They do not see it as "death with dignity" and say that individuals do not have the right to take their own life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salvationarmy.org.nz/explore-connect/about-us/position-statements/euthanasia/&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion/pro-life]] organisations such as [[Voice for Life]] and [[Right to Life New Zealand]] are also opposed to decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia or physician assisted suicide, although this has usually been subordinate to their opposition to [[abortion in New Zealand]].

However, according to the New Zealand census, New Zealand is an increasingly secular society and it is probable that it is medical practitioners organisations that have greater credibility when it comes to opposition to euthanasia law reform. The New Zealand Medical Association and Hospice New Zealand do not support the legalisation of euthanasia.

==Attempts at legalisation==
Two attempts to allow for legal euthanasia in New Zealand have failed to get through Parliament. In 1995 [[Michael Laws]] championed the Death with Dignity Bill, which aimed to legalise voluntary euthanasia. The terminal illness of [[Cam Campion]], a colleague in Laws' first term in Parliament, prompted this advocacy. It failed by 61 votes against and 29 for the Bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dignitynz.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=59 |title=The Voluntary Euthanasia Issue |publisher=Dignity New Zealand |accessdate=2009-06-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014022616/http://dignitynz.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=43&amp;Itemid=59 |archivedate=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Brown (New Zealand politician)|Peter Brown]], when he was an MP for the [[New Zealand First]] political party, introduced a Death with Dignity Bill in 2003, but it was defeated by 59 to 58 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://votes.wotfun.com/bill/3|title=Parliamentary Conscience Votes Database |accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown became an advocate for euthanasia after his wife died of cancer in 1984.

On 11 March 2012, [[New Zealand Labour Party]] list MP [[Maryan Street]] announced that she was forwarding another private members bill to the parliamentary ballot box to forward the debate after witnessing the deaths of her mother and sister from incurable illnesses. The proposed legislation was known as the End of Life Choices Bill.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/6554876/Street-in-fresh-bid-for-right-to-die-law&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-July 2013, there were reports that her party colleagues were requesting that Street withdraw the bill, given the possibility that it would distract from other issues during 2014 General Election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&amp;objectid=10899034 Euthanasia bill under party pressure]". ''New Zealand Herald''. 17.07.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 June 2015, [[ACT New Zealand]] MP [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]] confirmed that he was preparing a private members bill that would legalise medical aid in dying after ''[[Seales v Attorney-General]]'' found that only Parliament had the ability to address assisted dying laws.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/69148392/euthanasia-debate-back-on-the-political-agenda Euthanasia debate back on the political agenda]". ''Stuff''. 06.06.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He entered the [[End of Life Choice Bill]] into the ballot on 14 October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seymour|first1=David|title=Seymour lodges assisted dying Bill|url=http://www.act.org.nz/posts/seymour-lodges-assisted-dying-bill|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed its first reading on 13 December 2017, with 76 votes in favour, 44 opposed.

Recent petitions to parliament asking for legalisation have been met with opposition from 16,000 submissions to a Health select committee inquiry from experts and members of the public.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.16000voices.org.nz/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisations==
'''For euthanasia'''
The two main organisations lobbying for euthanasia in New Zealand are:
*the Voluntary Euthanasia Society
*the New Zealand chapter of [[Exit International]]

There were internal disagreements between Dignity New Zealand's Lesley Martin and Exit International's Philip Nitschke over the best way to provide voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide for those who desire it. Martin favoured the introduction of legislation and regulation to control assisted suicide while Nitschke promotes autonomy and individual choice and responsibility at the end of life irrespective of existing legislation. Similar divisions occurred between organisations that sanction decriminalised and regulated voluntary euthanasia/physician assisted suicide and the late [[Jack Kevorkian]] in the United States, over similar tactical and strategic questions.


'''Against euthanasia'''
The main organisation lobbying against euthanasia in New Zealand is [http://carealliance.org.nz The Care Alliance], a broad coalition of organisations from medical, family values, social, ethics, faith, disability, and other areas of society that advocates for better conversations around dying and improved access to palliative and other end of life medical and health practices. The Care Alliance members, however, share an understanding that compassionate and ethical end of life care does not include euthanasia and assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;http://carealliance.org.nz/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of The Care Alliance are:
* Australian &amp; New Zealand Society of Palliative Medicine
* Christian Medical Fellowship 
* Euthanasia-Free NZ
* Family First New Zealand
* Hospice New Zealand
* Lutherans for Life
* New Zealand Health Professionals Alliance
* Not Dead Yet Aotearoa
* Pacific Leadership Forum
* Palliative Care Nurses New Zealand
* The Nathaniel Centre
* The Salvation Army in New Zealand

==Criticism of reform movement==
[[GayNZ.com]] has run articles that question whether the aforementioned fragmentation of euthanasia reformists, coupled with their lack of professional allies and the opposition of the New Zealand Medical Association and other medical groups will hamper decriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide in New Zealand. This is based on analysis of the successful reform movements in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Oregon]], where organised medical groups took a neutral stance on decriminalisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8359.php&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Anthony Castillo''' (April 1, 1969 – July 28, 2013) was an American [[Major League Baseball]] [[starting pitcher]]. Castillo played for the [[Chicago Cubs]] (1991–1997), [[Colorado Rockies]] (1997), [[Detroit Tigers]] (1998), [[Toronto Blue Jays]] (2000), [[Boston Red Sox]] (2001–2002, 2004), and [[Florida Marlins]] (2005).

A sixth-round pick by the Cubs in the 1987 amateur draft, Castillo made his major league debut in 1991.

On September 25, 1995, in a 7–0 [[shutout]] victory over the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] at [[Wrigley Field]], Castillo had a [[no-hitter]] broken up with two out in the ninth inning by inches. [[Bernard Gilkey]] hit a two-strike, line drive that fell in for a [[hit (baseball)|hit]], despite an all-out attempt by [[Sammy Sosa]] to make a diving catch.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The ball rolled to the wall for a [[triple (baseball)|triple]], the only hit Castillo allowed. He [[struck out]] a career-high 13, including the first two batters in the ninth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1995/B09250CHN1995.htm |title=Retrosheet Box Score – Chicago Cubs 7, St. Louis Cardinals 0 |date=September 25, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castillo was trying to become the first Cubs pitcher to throw a no-hitter since [[Milt Pappas]] against the [[San Diego Padres]] on September 2, 1972, which also was the last no-hitter hurled at Wrigley Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1995/PM-BBN-Cardinals-Cubs/id-e5b0d6ee2d24f1c792d80c990836c422 |title=Frank Castillo delivered his pitches with control and velocity |first=Rick |last=Gano |agency=Associated Press |date=September 26, 1995 |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His most productive season came in 1995, when he posted career numbers in wins (11), [[earned run average]] (ERA) (3.21) and shutouts (2), while matching a career-high 135 strikeouts in 188 [[innings pitched]].

Castillo briefly retired from [[Major League Baseball]] after receiving a [[World Series ring]] as a member of the [[2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 Boston Red Sox]]. He pitched one game with the [[Florida Marlins]] in 2005. He returned to baseball in 2007 with the [[York Revolution]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]] and again played for them in 2008. He collected an 84–56 record and a 3.72 ERA in 14 minor league seasons spanning 1987–2008.

==Death==

Castillo drowned in [[Bartlett Lake]] in Arizona on July 28, 2013, at the age of 44, while boating near his home with his family. At the time of his death, the last position in baseball he held was [[pitching coach]] for the Rookie League [[Mesa Cubs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Former Cubs pitcher Frank Castillo, 44, drowned in Arizona lake |date=July 29, 2013 |url=http://www.suntimes.com/sports/21609191-419/former-cubs-pitcher-frank-castillo-44-drowned-in-arizona-lake.html |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |accessdate=July 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses}}
In terms of [[nuclear explosion]]s and other large [[bomb]]s, the term "'''ground zero'''" (also known as "'''surface zero'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5214|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: surface zero|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) describes the point on the Earth's surface closest to a detonation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nmbook/appendices/ap_B.htm Nuclear Matters: A Practical Guide, Appendix B] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201082850/http://www.acq.osd.mil/ncbdp/nm/nmbook/appendices/ap_B.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of an explosion above the ground, ''ground zero'' refers to the point on the ground directly below the nuclear detonation and is sometimes called the '''hypocenter''' (from [[Greek Language|Greek]] ὑπο- "under-" and [[center (disambiguation)|center]]). 

Generally, the term "ground zero" is also used in relation to [[earthquake]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and other [[disaster]]s to mark the point of the most severe damage or destruction. The term is distinguished from the term '''zero point''' in that the latter can also be located in the air, underground, or underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militaryfactory.com/dictionary/military-terms-defined.asp?term_id=5818|title=U.S. DoD Terminology: zero point|publisher=|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trinity, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki==
[[File:Hiroshima Damage Map.gif|right|thumb|In mapping the effects of an atomic bomb, such as on the city of [[Hiroshima]] here, concentric circles are drawn centered on the point below the detonation and numbered at radial distances of 1,000 feet (305 meters). This point below the detonation is called "Ground Zero".]]
The origins of the term "ground zero" began with the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] in [[Jornada del Muerto desert]] near [[Socorro, New Mexico]], and the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] in [[Japan]]. The [[Strategic Bombing Survey (Atomic attacks)|Strategic Bombing Survey]] of the atomic attacks, released in June 1946, used the term liberally, defining it as: "For convenience, the term 'ground zero' will be used to designate the point on the ground directly beneath the point of detonation, or 'air zero.'"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&amp;documentid=65&amp;documentdate=1946-06-19&amp;studycollectionid=abomb&amp;groupid= U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey: The Effects of the Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]. June 19, 1946. President's Secretary's File, Truman Papers. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Laurence]], an [[embedded reporter]] with the [[Manhattan Project]], reported that "Zero" was "the code name given to the spot chosen for the [Trinity] test" in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Laurence]], ''Dawn over Zero'' (London: Museum Press, 1947), 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', citing the use of the term in a 1946 ''[[New York Times]]'' report on the destroyed city of [[Hiroshima]], defines ''ground zero'' as "that part of the ground situated immediately under an exploding bomb, especially an atomic one."
The term was military slang, used at the Trinity site where the weapon tower for the first [[nuclear weapon]] was at "point zero", and moved into general use very shortly after the end of [[World War II]]. At Hiroshima, the hypocenter of the attack was [[Shima Hospital]], approximately {{convert|800|ft|m|abbr=on}} away from the intended aiming point at [[Aioi Bridge]]. 
{{wide image|NagasakiHypocentre.jpg|800px|Panoramic view of the monument marking the hypocenter, or ground zero, of the atomic bomb explosion over [[Nagasaki]].}}

==The Pentagon==
[[File:PentagonHotDogStand.jpg|thumb|left|The former hot dog stand nicknamed Cafe Ground Zero&lt;ref name="Pentagon" /&gt; in the Pentagon's center courtyard.]]
During the [[Cold War]], [[The Pentagon]], the headquarters of the [[United States Department of Defense]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia]], was an assured target in the event of [[nuclear war]]. The open space in the center of the Pentagon became known informally as ground zero. A snack bar that used to be located at the center of this open space was nicknamed "Cafe Ground Zero".&lt;ref name="Pentagon" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=1049|title=Pentagon Hot Dog Stand, Cold War Legend, to be Torn Down|quote ='It's rumored that a portion of their (Soviet) nuclear arsenal was directed at that building, the Pentagon hot dog stand,' tour guides tell visitors as they pass the stand. 'This is where the building earned the nickname Cafe Ground Zero, the deadliest hot dog stand in the world.'|date= September 20, 2006|publisher=United States Department of Defense |accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Trade Center==
[[File:Wtc-photo.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[World Trade Center site]] in September 2001.]]
During the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], two aircraft [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by 10 [[al-Qaeda]] [[Terrorism|terrorists]] flew into the North and South Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing massive damage and starting fires that [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|caused the weakened 110-story skyscrapers to collapse]]. The destroyed [[World Trade Center site]] soon became known as "ground zero." Rescue workers also used the phrase "The Pile", referring to the pile of rubble that was left after the buildings collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamill | first= Denis|title=Rescue Workers Keep Up Quest for Signs of Life Ruin All Over, But Not One Unkind Word|work=[[Daily News (New York)]]|date=16 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:World Trade Center site 2004.jpg|thumb|right|The [[World Trade Center site]], as it appeared in October 2004.]]
Even after the site was cleaned up and construction on the new [[One World Trade Center]] and the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] were well under way, the term was still frequently used to refer to the site, as when opponents of the [[Park51]] project that was to be located two blocks away from the site labeled it the "[[Ground Zero mosque]]." 

In advance of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] urged that the "ground zero" moniker be retired, saying, "...the time has come to call those 16 acres what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11th Memorial and Museum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14827694 |title=Is it time to retire 'Ground zero'? |work=[[BBC]] |author=Geoghegan, Tom |date=2011-09-07 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Sultanov graduated from the faculty of physics and mathematics at the [[Baku State University]] in 1942, and fought on the [[Eastern Front of World War II]].

==Academia==
Having demobilized from the military in 1946, Sultanov began his scientific work in the Baku State University and completed postgraduate studies.

'''Isabella, Princess of Asturias''' (2 October 1470 &amp;ndash; 23 August 1498) was a [[Queen consort]] of Portugal and [[heir presumptive]] of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], as their eldest daughter. Her younger siblings were [[Catherine of Aragon|Catherine, Queen of England]], Queen [[Joanna I of Castile]], [[Maria of Castile and Aragon|Maria, Queen of Portugal]], and [[John, Prince of Asturias]].

==Early life==
Isabella was the eldest child of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile.{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|pp=527, 533}} Born during the reign of her uncle, [[Henry IV of Castile]], the early years of her life were defined by the tension between him and her mother, as her uncle would not forgive her mother for marrying Ferdinand without his permission. Upon the death of Henry IV in 1474, Isabella's mother claimed the throne of Castile, and the young Isabella was swiftly sworn as the heir presumptive to the throne.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=132}}

The early years of the reign of Isabella I was spent embroiled in a war of succession, as Henry IV had not specifically named a successor. A struggle ensued between Isabella I and her niece [[Joanna la Beltraneja|Joanna]], who was known as "la Beltraneja" due to the rumors that she was the illegitimate child of Henry IV's queen [[Joan of Portugal]] and his favourite, [[Beltrán de La Cueva]]. [[Afonso V of Portugal]], who was Henry IV's brother-in-law and young Joanna's uncle, intervened on Joanna's behalf and Ferdinand and Isabella were forced into a war with Portugal.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=144}}

During the war, young Isabella witnessed some of the chaos for herself. While her parents were fighting the Portuguese, the princess was left in [[Segovia]] while the city was placed under the control of Andrés de Cabrera and his wife Beatriz de Bobadilla. The city's residents, unhappy with this new administration, rose up and seized control of the city. The then-seven-year-old princess was trapped in a tower of the Alcázar for some time until her mother returned to Segovia and took control of the situation.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=304}}

The war ended in 1479 with the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]]. Among the terms were the provision that Princess Isabella would marry the grandson of Afonso V, [[Afonso, Prince of Portugal|Afonso]], who was five years younger than the princess.{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|pp=527, 533}} The treaty also provided that Ferdinand and Isabella would pay a large dowry for their daughter and that the princess would reside in Portugal as a guarantee that her parents would abide by the treaty terms. In 1480, Prince Afonso went to live in the town of [[Moura, Portugal|Moura]] with his maternal grandmother [[Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu]], and was joined in the early months of the following year by his future wife, the ten-year-old Isabella.{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|pp=528, 534}} She spent three years in Portugal before returning home.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=305}}

Isabella also spent a considerable part of her youth on campaign with her parents as they conquered the remaining Muslim states in southern Spain. For example, she accompanied her mother in accepting the surrender of the city of [[Baza, Granada|Baza]].{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=304}}

==Marriages==
Her first marriage was to Prince Afonso, the only son and heir of king [[John II of Portugal]] from his marriage with [[Eleanor of Viseu]].{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=526}}  The wedding, by proxy, took place in the spring of 1490 in [[Seville]].{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=266}}{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=534}} On 19 November of that year, Isabella arrived in [[Badajoz]], where she was welcomed by Afonso's uncle Manuel, the future King [[Manuel I of Portugal]], whom she would eventually marry six years after her husband's death. Afonso and Isabella were reunited in [[Elvas]] on 22 November and, on the following day, Isabella met her mother-in-law, Queen Eleanor, in the Convento do Espinheiro in [[Évora]], where the court had gathered to ratify the marriage that had been celebrated earlier in Seville.{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=535}}

Though the marriage had been arranged by the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]],{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|pp=527, 533}} the marriage quickly became a love match. Isabella proved a popular figure with the Portuguese royal family due to her knowledge of their language and customs brought about by the years she spent in Portugal as a child. Isabella's happy life in Portugal came to an abrupt end in July 1491, however, when Afonso was killed in a riding accident.{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=536}}{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=366}} She was heartbroken and later became convinced that he had died because God was angry that Portugal had provided a refuge for the Jews that her parents had expelled from Spain.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|pp=314–315}}

She was eventually sent back to Spain at the request of her parents, and Isabella returned to them devoutly religious. She underwent efforts to starve and scourge herself, something she would do for much of the rest of her life as part of her mourning for Afonso. She also declared that she would never marry again. Her parents seem to have humored her declaration at first, but after the death of John II of Portugal in 1495, he was succeeded by [[Manuel I of Portugal]], who immediately sought Isabella's hand.{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=366}} Ferdinand and Isabella, perhaps trying to respect their daughter's wishes, offered him the hand of one of their younger daughters, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria]], but he refused.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=316}} There remained a stalemate between them until Princess Isabella agreed to marry Manuel on the condition that he expel all Jews from Portugal who would not convert to Christianity. He agreed to her ultimatum{{Sfn|Downey|2014|pp=369–370}} and they married in September 1497.{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=382}}

== Heir to the Crown of Castile and death ==
In the same year as her second marriage, Isabella became [[Princess of Asturias]] and heiress of the [[Crown of Castile]] following the sudden death of her only brother, [[John, Prince of Asturias]], in September 1497, and the stillbirth of his daughter. Immediately, [[Philip I of Castile|Philip]], the husband of Isabella's younger sister [[Joanna of Castile]], claimed the crown, although Isabella, as the eldest daughter was the heiress of the crown. The [[Catholic Monarchs]], to counter the pretensions of their son-in-law Philip, held courts in the city of Toledo in 1498 a few months after the death of their son John and had Isabella and her husband Manuel sworn as the legitimate heirs of the Crowns of Spain.{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=386}} The royal family then went to [[Zaragoza]] to convene the courts of Aragon for the same purpose.{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|pp=386–387}}  Although female succession was permitted in Castile, Ferdinand II's kingdom of Aragon hesitated to accept a woman as their future ruler. If she were to give birth to a son, then the child could inherit everything, something much preferred to female rule.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=331}}

Isabella was pregnant at that time and, while in [[Zaragoza]] with the royal family, she gave birth on 23 August 1498 to her only child, [[Miguel da Paz, Prince of Portugal]]. Perhaps because of her constant fasting and self-denial,{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=331}} or the constant traveling at her advanced stage of pregnancy,{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=387}} she died within an hour of her son's birth. Her son, the new prince, was later sworn heir by the courts of Portugal, Castile, and Aragon, as the heir to these crowns.{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=387}}

Isabella asked to be buried dressed as a nun and to be interred at the Convent of Santa Isabel in Toledo.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=331}} Manuel's chance to become King of Castile ended with Isabella's death, and the primary hope of uniting all of the Iberian kingdoms vanished with Prince Miguel's death shy of his second birthday in 1500.{{Sfn|Fernández Álvarez|2003|p=387}}

When Queen Isabella of Castile died in 1504, she requested that the body of her deceased daughter, Isabella, be moved to rest by her side in [[Granada]], but this was never done.{{Sfn|Downey|2014|p=409}}

Manuel later married Isabella's younger sister, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria of Aragon]], who bore him his son and heir, [[John III of Portugal|John III]]. Portugal and Spain were finally united between 1580 and 1640, after [[Philip II of Spain]], Isabella's great-nephew via her sisters, Maria and Joanna, successfully claimed the throne of Portugal as a son of [[Isabella of Portugal]], the daughter of Maria and Manuel.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

== Biography ==
&lt;span class="cx-segment" data-segmentid="156"&gt;Haddouche was born to [[Algeria]]n parents. His mother was Djouber Azzouz, and his father was Ahmed Haddouche. Ahmed was a soldier in the French army during the [[Algerian war]], and in 1962, like many [[harkis]], Ahmed was evacuated with his family to France. In Beauvais, [[Oise]], he found a job as a specialized worker at the [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] factory, where, after becoming alcoholic and very violent, was dismissed from his job. Jacquy was born on February 19, 1964, in a family where he was the third of twelve children. He was educated at George Sand College, and was considered intelligent and sensitive, but also unstable, aggressive, impulsive, intolerant, manipulative and unable to take frustration.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;ref name="parisien6"&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/l-itineraire-cauchemardesque-de-jacquy-haddouche-24-04-2008-3298458234.php "The nightmare itinerary of Jacquy Haddouche"] Article by David Livois published on April 24, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, the juvenile judge placed him in a guarded education center in [[Méru]], where he escaped regularly to join the family housing. It is there that at sixteen, he lived through a traumatic scene. Unable to support his wife's divorce proceedings, Ahmed Haddouche committed suicide by shooting himself in the head in front of Jacquy.&lt;ref name="parisien4"&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/un-proces-fleuve-pour-jacquy-haddouche-23-04-2008-3298456175.php "A river trial for Jacquy Haddouche"] Article published on April 23, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was splashed by his father's blood and his father's body fell on him. Traumatized, he went left school and sunk into delinquency and became a substance abuser.

Condemned and incarcerated several times, Jacquy Haddouche married in 1988, in [[Liancourt]], at the instigation of his mother, which allowed him to obtain a reduction of his sentence. His ex-wife regretted the eight months that their marriage lasted.

== Early crimes ==
In 1981, he committed a gang rape with a legionnaire older than him. He was sentenced to five years in prison by the cour d'assises for minors.

In 1986, he was sentenced to eight years in prison for a violent robbery.

In 1993, he was sentenced to six months in prison for burglary.

In 1996, he was sentenced to three months, four months and six months in prison for theft, aggravated theft and counterfeiting.

In 1997, he was sentenced to two years in prison for fraud and aggravated theft.

In 1998, he was sentenced to six years in prison for robbery, his victim surviving poisoning with drugs.

== Facts and investigation ==
On November 30, 1992, in the early evening, in Beauvais, Haddouche met in an elevator 45-year-old Gilles Canette, a divorced and depressed French teacher. They talked for a bit, and Canette invited Haddouche in his apartment. Around 19h, two boys, pupils of Gilles, came to talk to him. The teenagers noticed that Haddouche behaved oddly, seemingly inspecting the rooms of the apartment. They left around 20h. Haddouche spent the evening with Gilles, eventually poisoning him with an [[antidepressant]], [[cyamemazine]], and then asphyxiating him. At midnight, the credit card of Gilles Canette was used at a vending machine, which was odd, considering that when Gilles wanted money from his account, he would always withdraw it at the bank counter, and he never used his card to the distributor. Early in the morning of December 1, 1992, Haddouche went to see the two teenagers at their home and threatened them to deny seeing him at Gilles' the night before. On December 1, 1992, Gilles was discovered naked on his bed by his cleaning lady. Police found a fingerprint of Haddouche on a bottle of strawberry syrup, and he was suspected of murder. He admitted to having gone to Canette's house, but not on the date of the murder. On December 13, 1993, Haddouche was taken into custody, but denied the accusations and declared that he was in the [[Paris]] region with his companion: Cloé. Cloé arrived conveniently at the police station and confirmed the alibi. When the police asked her for clarification, she refused to answer questions and left the police station. In his cell in custody, Haddouche made a suicide attempt by hurting his veins with his lighter and was hospitalized. The period of custody being ove and the police not having enough evidence to convict Haddouche, the court abandoned the prosecution against him and closed the case.

At the end of May 1995, at the ''Charlie Brown'' bar on Guy Patin street in Beauvais, Francine C., a pedagogical director in a medical-educational institute, was with a group of friends. Haddouche joined the group and befriended them. At the beginning of June 1995, Haddouche went to Francine on Nicolas Pastour Street, but she refused to let him in. He knocked on the front door so hard that she finally decided to open it and let him in. He told her that he was exhausted because he had just finished a guard at [[Méru]]'s hospital. Compassionate, she offered him some coffee which he asked for. When he finished, she told him to leave, but Haddouche refused, and told him that Cloé, his now former companion, was with Frederick, a former friend. He took her to the room, raped her and left. She threw the sheets and washed with bleach the places where Haddouche was at her place. During the following weeks, Haddouche harassed her on the phone and kept watch in front of her door. She did not dare to complain and sunk into depression.&lt;ref name="obsbeauv4"&gt;[http://www.lobservateurdebeauvais.fr/2008/05/09/proces-haddouche-le-viol-commis-a-beauvais-en-1995/ "Haddouche trial: The rape committed in Beauvais in 1995"] Article published on May 9, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Observateur_de_Beauvais L'Observateur de Beauvais]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2002 in Beauvais, Haddouche reconnected with Isabelle, whom he met in 1991, and they began a brief relationship. One evening, an alcoholic Haddouche struck Isabelle in the face in the presence of her daughter. He called her the next day and asked her to bring him some heart medicine, claiming that he was dying. When Isabelle arrived, he raped her again.&lt;ref name="parisien7"&gt;[http://www.leparisien.fr/oise/jacquy-haddouche-un-homme-seducteur-et-violent-26-04-2008-3298462776.php "Jacquy Haddouche, a seductive man...and violent"] Article by David Livois published on April 26, 2008, in ''[//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Parisien Le Parisien]''&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2002, around 7pm, Haddouche entered the SONACOTRA home on d'Anjou Street in the Argentinian district of Beauvais. Around 8 pm, he forced open the door to the studio of Léo Capon, a 73-year-old retiree. Haddouche attacked and slaughtered Leo Capon, searching the apartment and stealing objects of little value. Nervous, Léo's daughter, Daniele, went to her mother's house. She was surprised that the front door was unlocked. When she entered, everything had been searched and all the objects were upside down. There were many traces of blood on the floor, and garbage bags filled with various objects near the front door. Capon was lying on her back, in the bathroom, her face covered with pieces of cardboard. On the video surveillance strips of the building, a balding man carrying full bags in each hand and a cap hiding his face was visible. Because of the poor quality images, he could not be identified. Male DNA was discovered on various objects at Léo's house, but it was not listed in [[FNAEG]]. Capon was disfigured by the blows she had received, and forensic scientists established that she had died by choking on her own blood.

On July 4, 2002, in [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]], Haddouche entered the apartment of Liliane D, the owner of a bar. He hit and tried to rape her, but was unsuccessful.

On July 15, 2002, at the bar  ''L'endroit'' in [[Saint-Etienne|Saint-Étienne]], Sylvain Rome, a 32-year-old cameraman, sympathized with Haddouche at the counter. Around 16h, they left the bar together, Sylvain later buying drinks at the [[superette]] next to his home. Around 17h, David Sabido, a friend of Sylvain, rang at his apartment, but Sylvain made him understand that he's bothering him and refused to let Sabido in. Haddouche later poisoned Sylvain with [[Bromazepam]] and stabbed him. He cleaned the apartment, stole a checkbook, the mobile phone, Sylvain's identity papers and the keys to the apartment. On July 27, 2002, Sylvain Rome's father discovered him lying on his stomach on his bed.

The investigators established that Sylvain had a high blood alcohol level, was not depressed and did not consume antidepressants. A [[facial composite]] was made thanks to the descriptions of the bartender and Lucien Florent, a customer of the bar, with whom Haddouche discussed a little before meeting Sylvain.

At the end of August 2002, Haddouche seduced Nathalie, a young beneficiary of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|RMI]], to whom he introduced himself as a doctor at the hospital center of Beauvais where hosted. After a week, while they were drinking, Haddouche drugged, without Nathalie's knowledge, her second glass of [[Kir (cocktail)|kir]]. She became uncomfortable and was hospitalized. He stole her bank card and the amount of Nathalie's RMI.

In September 2002, Haddouche tried to make contact with Francine, whom  had decided to file a complaint against him for the 1995 rape.

On September 13, 2002, in the Argentinean district of Beauvais, Liliane Michaud, 82, was returning from the supermarket ''[[Intermarché]]'' with her [[Walker (mobility)|walker]]. Arriving at her pavilion, Haddouche attacked her, savagely beating her and stealing her wallet. When the investigators described the abuser to the supermarket security agents, they positively identified Jacquy Haddouche.

On September 30, 2002, the police filed a convocation against Haddouche, who did not attend.

== Arrest ==
On October 2, 2002, a little after 11pm, in [[Gard]], Haddouche tried to break into the station by breaking a window. A security guard noticed him and alerted police officers on patrol. They later spotted the drunk Haddouche, who resisted their arrest. He claimed to be a [[kinesiotherapist]] and that his name was Saïd Haddouche. By passing his fingerprints to the automated fingerprint file, the police discovered that his first name is Jacquy, not Saïd. By passing his name to the wanted persons file, the police learned that he was wanted for murder in Beauvais.

Later, Liliane Michaud formally recognized Jacquy Haddouche.

On December 3, 2002, Haddouche was indicted for the murder of Léo Capon, but he denied it. Objects stolen from her home were found by the police when they searched his home. Haddouche then accused his roomamte of being the murderer.

In 2003, Cloé confessed to the investigating judge that she lied, because in December 1992, she did not know Haddouche yet. She only met him while she was studying in Beauvais.

The telephone records showed that Haddouche's mobile phone was detected by the [[cell site]] that covered the area where Sylvain Rome's apartment was on the date of the murder. In custody in St. Etienne, Haddouche recognized that it was mid July 2002 came to visit members of his family. In 2003, during the [[police lineup]] behind a [[beam splitter]], Lucien Florent formally identified Haddouche. He finally admitted that he met Sylvain at the bar, but said that he had never been to his house.

Haddouche admitted to having met Francine C. at the bar ''Charlie Brown'', but denied having gone to her home. He declared that the complaint for rape against him was a revenge on the part of the latter, because he did not give her the narcotics which she had ordered him for an amount of 30 000 francs.

'''James Joseph McCann''', {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC}} (March 29, 1886 &amp;ndash; April 11, 1961) was a [[Canadian]] politician, born in [[Perth, Ontario]], son of John A. McCann, a mason and licence-inspector, and Mary Hourigan, who were both of Irish descent.
&lt;ref&gt;For basic biographical details see ''The Canadian Who's Who'', vol. 7 (1955-1957), ''Who's Who in Canada'', 1960-61, and death notices in the Toronto ''Daily Star'', April 11, 1961, p. 2, and the Toronto ''Globe and Mail'', April 12, 1961, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he consistently reported his own birth-date as March 29, 1887, he was in fact born exactly one year earlier, and was originally named as '''James Parnell McCann'''. His birth registration gives this name in full, with the 1886 date,&lt;ref&gt;Lanark County birth registrations, 1886, no. 018110 (Archives of Ontario).&lt;/ref&gt; the entry for his parents' household in the 1901 census gives his name as James P. McCann and likewise supports the 1886 date,&lt;ref&gt;[http://automatedgenealogy.com/census/DisplayPagePanb.jsp?id=69180 1901 Census of Canada, Ontario, district no. 81 (Lanark South), subdistrict H (Town of Perth), division 6, p. 10].&lt;/ref&gt; and the record of his first marriage in 1913 calls him James Parnell McCann.&lt;ref&gt;''Mariages Catholiques de la Region de Perth, Ontario'', comp. Peter Andersen &amp;amp; Hubert Houle (Ottawa, 1986), p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no possible doubt that the politician was the James Parnell McCann born in 1886, as his parents and wives are named in two different biographical dictionaries published during his own lifetime. It is possible he came to be known as James ''Joseph'' McCann following the early death of a younger brother named Joseph, born in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Lanark County birth registrations, 1895, no. 016137 (Archives of Ontario); the precise date of death of this brother has not been found, but he was surely dead by 1911, as the census of that year does not show him in the household of his widowed father.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCann took M.D. and C.M. degrees from Queen's University, Ottawa, in 1909 (graduating with the gold medal) and a post-graduate degree in medicine from the University of Chicago in 1911. Prior to entering political life, he practiced as a physician at Hamilton and at Renfrew, Ontario, serving for more than thirty years as Coroner for Renfrew County. He was first elected to the [[House of Commons of Canada]] representing the riding of [[Renfrew South]] in the [[Canadian federal election, 1935|1935 federal election]].

A [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]], he was re-elected in [[Canadian federal election, 1940|1940]], [[Canadian federal election, 1945|1945]], [[Canadian federal election, 1949|1949]], and [[Canadian federal election, 1953|1953]]. He was defeated in [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957]]. He held the following ministerial positions in the cabinets of [[Mackenzie King]] and [[Louis St. Laurent]]: Minister of National War Services, [[List of Canadian Ministers of National Revenue|Minister of National Revenue]], and Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys.

His death notice in the ''Daily Star'' states, "As finance minister in the immediate post-war years, he was charged with the responsibility of re-settling Canada's economy and was one of the first officials to warn of the danger of too-close economic ties with the U.S." His death notice in the ''Globe and Mail'' states, "As Revenue Minister he watched Government income soar to record peacetime levels and took a personal interest in the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]], which he had helped reorganize in 1941.... During his political career Dr. McCann was an early advocate in the Liberal Party for government health programs, many of which later became realities." McCann was twice married, but had no children.

'''John Whipple Dwinelle''' (September 9, 1816 – January 28, 1881)&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | title=THE LATE MR. DWINELLE | work=[[New York Times]] | date=12 Feb 1881 | pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HLM"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hamilton Literary Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSsTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA365|accessdate=20 June 2013|year=1882|publisher=Courier Press|pages=365–66|chapter=Class of 1834}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American lawyer and politician. He served in a number of political posts in California and played important roles in both the legal history of San Francisco and the establishment of the California public university system.

Dwinelle was born in [[Cazenovia, New York]], the son of Congressman [[Justin Dwinell]] and Louise Whipple, a descendant of [[William Whipple]]. He graduated from [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in 1834.  While studying law, he edited the ''[[New York Daily Gazette]]'', the ''[[Daily Buffalonian]]'', and edited and [[typeset]] the ''[[Rochester Daily Advertiser]]''. Dwinelle was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in October 1837 and began a legal practice in [[Rochester, New York]]. In 1844 he was elected [[city attorney]] of Rochester. The next year he became master of chancery.

In 1849, he sailed to San Francisco, California, and began a legal practice there.  He served in a number of government offices, including two terms on the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors|San Francisco city council]], [[List of mayors of Oakland, California|Mayor]] of [[Oakland, California]], and member of the [[California State Assembly]] from [[Alameda County, California]].&lt;ref name=HLM /&gt;&lt;ref name=HoC /&gt;

Dwinelle represented the city of San Francisco in the so-called "[[pueblo]] case", ''[[Hart v. Burnett]]'', which secured San Francisco's claim to four square leagues of land due to the city's establishment as the pueblo of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] under Mexican rule.&lt;ref name="Bakken2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Louis Stelluto, Jr.|editor=Gordon Morris Bakken|title=Law in the Western United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zjHQWyttp6QC&amp;pg=PA320|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=2000|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-3215-0|pages=317–25|chapter=The Fate of Pueblo Rights in Nineteenth-Century San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwinelle's lengthy brief on these matters of land usage and history were published as ''The Colonial History of San Francisco'' (1863).&lt;ref name="Tuthill1866"&gt;{{cite book|author=Franklin Tuthill|title=The History of California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cR0VAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA107|accessdate=25 June 2013|year=1866|publisher=H. H. Bancroft|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dwinelle was also the lawyer in an important court case regarding [[school segregation]].  In ''[[Ward v. Flood]]'' (1874), he represented a black child who was refused enrollment at a San Francisco school. The [[Supreme Court of California]] ruled that black students could not be refused education under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], but that they could be denied entry into specific schools on the basis of race.  This upheld the legal principle of "[[separate but equal]]" many years before the legal doctrine was adopted by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896).  While this ruling did not desegregate California schools, it did guarantee the right of black students to an education.&lt;ref name="Wollenberg1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Wollenberg|title=All Deliberate Speed: Segregation and Exclusion in California Schools, 1855-1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-nGoJQEdk_UC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=black%20children%20prohibiting&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 June 2013|year=1976|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-03191-3|pages=22–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an Assemblyman, Dwinelle wrote and introduced the 1868 [[Organic Act]] establishing the [[University of California]].&lt;ref name="Douglass2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Aubrey Douglass|title=The California Idea and American Higher Education: 1850 to the 1960 Master Plan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UfpCfg095QC&amp;pg=PA42|accessdate=25 June 2013|date=January 2007|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-5753-9|pages=42–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dwinelle became one of the first [[Regents of the University of California]]. [[Dwinelle Hall]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]], the first campus opened as a result of Dwinelle's bill, is named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/our-department/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510114658/http://spanish-portuguese.berkeley.edu/our-department/ |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While trying to catch a ferry, Dwinelle fell from a pier in [[Port Costa, California]], and drowned.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; His body washed ashore three weeks later.&lt;ref name=FA /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36828">The '''just-world hypothesis''' or '''just-world fallacy''' is the [[cognitive bias]] (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined to bring [[morality|morally]] [[justice|fair]] and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal force that restores moral balance. This belief generally implies the existence of cosmic [[justice]], [[destiny]], [[divine providence]], [[desert (philosophy)|desert]], [[Balance (metaphysics)|stability]], or [[cosmos|order]], and has high potential to result in [[informal fallacy|fallacy]], especially when used to [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalize]] people's misfortune on the grounds that they "deserve" it.

The hypothesis popularly appears in the [[English language]] in various [[figures of speech]] that imply guaranteed negative reprisal, such as: "[[wikt:get what's coming to one|you got what was coming to you]]", "[[wikt:what goes around comes around|what goes around comes around]]", "[[wikt:chickens come home to roost|chickens come home to roost]]", "everything happens for a reason", and "[[wikt:reap what one sows|you reap what you sow]]". This hypothesis has been widely studied by [[social psychology|social psychologists]] since [[Melvin J. Lerner]] conducted seminal work on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="An Overview"&gt;Lerner, M.J. &amp; Montada, L. (1998). An Overview: Advances in Belief in a Just World Theory and Methods, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SeiPBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World]'' (1–7). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Research has continued since then, examining the predictive capacity of the hypothesis in various situations and across cultures, and clarifying and expanding the theoretical understandings of just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade"&gt;Furnham, A. (2003). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886902000727 Belief in a just world: research progress over the past decade]. ''Personality and Individual Differences''; 34: 795–817.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emergence==
Many philosophers and social theorists have observed and considered the phenomenon of belief in a just world, going back to at least as early as the [[Pyrrhonism|Pyrrhonist]] philosopher [[Sextus Empiricus]] writing around 180 CE who argued against this belief.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, "Outlines of Pyrrhonism", Book 1, Chapter 13, Section 32&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner's work made the just-world hypothesis a focus of research in the field of social psychology.

===Melvin Lerner===
Lerner was prompted to study [[justice]] beliefs and the just-world hypothesis in the context of social psychological inquiry into negative social and societal interactions.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface"&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M.J. (1998). Preface, in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. vii–viii). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner saw his work as extending [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiments|work on obedience]]. He sought to answer the questions of how regimes that cause cruelty and suffering maintain popular support, and how people come to accept [[social norms]] and laws that produce misery and suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lerner |first=M. |last2=Simmons |first2=C. H. |year=1966 |title=Observer's Reaction to the 'Innocent Victim': Compassion or Rejection? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=203–210 |doi=10.1037/h0023562 |pmid=5969146 |url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/4_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_203_(Lerner).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lerner's inquiry was influenced by repeatedly witnessing the tendency of observers to [[victim blaming|blame victims]] for their suffering. During his clinical training as a psychologist, he observed treatment of mentally ill persons by the health care practitioners with whom he worked. Although he knew them to be kindhearted, educated people, they often blamed patients for the patients' own suffering.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental"&gt;Lerner (1980). ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''. Plenum: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner also describes his surprise at hearing his students [[wikt:derogate|derogate]] (disparage, belittle) the poor, seemingly oblivious to the [[structural violence|structural forces]] that contribute to poverty.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; In a study on rewards, he observed that when one of two men was chosen at random to receive a reward for a task, that caused him to be more favorably evaluated by observers, even when the observers had been informed that the recipient of the reward was chosen at random.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking"&gt;Lerner, M. J., &amp; Miller, D. T. (1978). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-26009-001 Just world research and the attribution process: Looking back and ahead]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 85(5), 1030–1051&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Existing social psychological theories, including [[cognitive dissonance]], could not fully explain these phenomena.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages"&gt;Maes, J. (1998) [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_10 Eight Stages in the Development of Research on the Construct of BJW?], in Leo Montada &amp; M.J. Lerner (Eds.). ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World'' (pp. 163–185). Plenum Press: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The desire to understand the processes that caused these phenomena led Lerner to conduct his first experiments on what is now called the just-world hypothesis.

==Early evidence==
In 1966, Lerner and his colleagues began a series of experiments that used shock paradigms to investigate observer responses to [[victimization]]. In the first of these experiments conducted at the [[University of Kansas]], 72 female subjects were made to watch a confederate receiving electrical shocks under a variety of conditions. Initially, subjects were upset by observing the apparent suffering. But as the suffering continued and observers remained unable to intervene, the observers began to derogate the victim. Derogation was greater when the observed suffering was greater. But when subjects were told the victim would receive compensation for her suffering, subjects did not derogate the victim.&lt;ref name="LernerSimmonsObserver" /&gt; Lerner and colleagues replicated these findings in subsequent studies, as did other researchers.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

==Theory==
To explain these studies' findings, Lerner theorized that there was a prevalent belief in a just world. A just world is one in which actions and conditions have predictable, appropriate consequences. These actions and conditions are typically individuals' behaviors or attributes. The specific conditions that correspond to certain consequences are socially determined by a society's norms and ideologies. Lerner presents the belief in a just world as functional: it maintains the idea that one can influence the world in a predictable way. Belief in a just world functions as a sort of "contract" with the world regarding the consequences of behavior. This allows people to plan for the future and engage in effective, goal-driven behavior. Lerner summarized his findings and his theoretical work in his 1980 monograph ''The Belief in a Just World: A Fundamental Delusion''.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt;

Lerner hypothesized that the belief in a just world is crucially important for people to maintain for their own well-being. But people are confronted daily with evidence that the world is not just: people suffer without apparent cause. Lerner explained that people use strategies to eliminate threats to their belief in a just world. These strategies can be [[Rationality|rational]] or irrational. Rational strategies include accepting the reality of injustice, trying to prevent injustice or provide restitution, and accepting one's own limitations. Non-rational strategies include [[denial]], [[Social withdrawal|withdrawal]], and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|reinterpretation]] of the event.{{citation needed|date = December 2011}}

There are a few modes of reinterpretation that could make an event fit the belief in a just world. One can reinterpret the outcome, the cause, and/or the character of the victim.  In the case of observing the injustice of the suffering of innocent people, one major way to rearrange the cognition of an event is to interpret the victim of suffering as deserving.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Specifically, observers can blame victims for their suffering on the basis of their behaviors and/or their characteristics.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt; Much psychological research on the belief in a just world has focused on these negative social phenomena of [[victim blaming]] and victim derogation in [[#Additional evidence|different contexts]].&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;

An additional effect of this thinking is that individuals experience less personal [[vulnerability]] because they do not believe they have done anything to deserve or cause negative outcomes.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; This is related to the [[self-serving bias]] observed by social psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;Linden, M. &amp; Maercker, A. (2011) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FCdQlTzL-aUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage Embitterment: Societal, psychological, and clinical perspectives].'' Wien: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many researchers have interpreted just-world beliefs as an example of [[causal attribution]]. In victim blaming, the causes of victimization are attributed to an individual rather than to a situation. Thus, the consequences of belief in a just world may be related to or explained in terms of particular patterns of causal attribution.&lt;ref&gt;Howard, J. (1984). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1985-04021-001 Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 47(3), 494–505.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Veridical judgment===
{{See also|Veridicality}}
Others have suggested alternative explanations for the derogation of victims. One suggestion is that derogation effects are based on accurate judgments of a victim's character. In particular, in relation to Lerner's first studies, some have hypothesized that it would be logical for observers to derogate an individual who would allow himself to be shocked without reason.&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey, B. &amp; Lowe, C. (1975). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1975-26823-001 Devaluation of innocent victims: An attribution analysis within the just world paradigm]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 31, 944–951.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study by Lerner challenged this alternative hypothesis by showing that individuals are only derogated when they actually suffer; individuals who agreed to undergo suffering but did not were viewed positively.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner, M.J. (1970). The desire for justice and reactions to victims. In J. Macaulay &amp; L. Berkowitz (Eds.), ''Altruism and helping behavior'' (pp. 205–229). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guilt reduction===
Another alternative explanation offered for the derogation of victims early in the development of the just-world hypothesis was that observers derogate victims to reduce their own feelings of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. Observers may feel [[Moral responsibility|responsible]], or guilty, for a victim's suffering if they themselves are involved in the situation or experiment. In order to reduce the guilt, they may devalue the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, K. &amp; Jones, E. (1960). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Keith_Davis3/publication/9847296_Changes_in_Interpersonal_Perception_as_a_Means_of_Reducing_Cognitive_Dissonance/links/00b7d519bfb9563e9e000000.pdf Changes in interpersonal perception as a means of reducing cognitive dissonance]. ''Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology'', 61, 402–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glass, D. (1964). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-6494.1964.tb01357.x Changes in liking as a means of reducing cognitive discrepancies between self-esteem and aggression]. ''Journal of Personality'', 1964, 32, 531–549.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cialdini, R. B., Kenrick, D. T., &amp; Hoerig, J. H. (1976). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1976-26028-001 Victim derogation in the Lerner paradigm: Just world or just justification?] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 33(6), 719–724.&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner and colleagues claim that there has not been adequate evidence to support this interpretation. They conducted one study that found derogation of victims occurred even by observers who were not implicated in the process of the experiment and thus had no reason to feel guilty.&lt;ref name="LernerMillerLooking" /&gt;

===Discomfort reduction===

Alternatively, victim derogation and other strategies may only be ways to alleviate discomfort after viewing suffering. This would mean that the primary motivation is not to restore a belief in a just world, but to reduce discomfort caused by [[empathy|empathizing]].  Studies have shown that victim derogation does not suppress subsequent helping activity and that empathizing with the victim plays a large role when assigning blame. According to [[Ervin Staub]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staub|first1=Ervin|title=Positive Social Behavior and Morality: Social and Personal Influences, Volume 1|date=1978|publisher=Academic Press Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-663101-2|pages=169–170|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GiOLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;q=reduce%20discomfort%20suffering%20erwin%20just%20world|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; devaluing the victim should lead to lesser compensation if restoring belief in a just world was the primary motive; instead, there is virtually no difference in compensation amounts whether the compensation precedes or follows devaluation. [[Psychopathy]] has been linked to the lack of just-world maintaining strategies, possibly due to dampened emotional reactions and lack of empathy.&lt;ref name="Hafer2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hafer |first1=Carolyn L. |last2=Bègue |first2=Laurent |last3=Choma |first3=Becky L. |last4=Dempsey |first4=Julie L. |title=Belief in a Just World and Commitment to Long-Term Deserved Outcomes |journal=Social Justice Research |date=2005 |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=429–444 |doi=10.1007/s11211-005-8569-3 |url=http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228091123/http://www.lps.univ-savoie.fr/uploads/PDF/576.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-28 |df= |citeseerx=10.1.1.507.4227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Additional evidence==
After Lerner's first studies, other researchers replicated these findings in other settings in which individuals are victimized. This work, which began in the 1970s and continues today, has investigated how observers react to victims of random calamities like traffic accidents, as well as rape and [[domestic violence]], illnesses, and poverty.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; Generally, researchers have found that observers of the suffering of innocent victims tend to both derogate and blame victims for their suffering. Observers thus maintain their belief in a just world by changing their cognitions about the victims' character.&lt;ref&gt;Reichle, B., Schneider, A., &amp; Montada, L. (1998). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_4 How do observers of victimization preserve their belief in a just world cognitively or actionally?] In L. Montada &amp; M. J. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in a just world'' (pp. 55–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, social psychologists [[Zick Rubin]] and Letitia Anne Peplau developed a measure of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, A. (1973). [https://spssi.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-4560.1973.tb00104.x Belief in a just world and reactions to another's lot: A study of participants in the national draft lottery]. ''Journal of Social Issues'', 29, 73–93.&lt;/ref&gt; This measure and its revised form published in 1975 allowed for the study of individual differences in just-world beliefs.&lt;ref name = "RubinPeplau1975"&gt;Rubin, Z. &amp; Peplau, L.A. (1975). [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720073011/http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Publications_files/Rubin%20%26%20Peplau%201975s.pdf Who believes in a just world?] ''Journal of Social Issues'', 31, 65–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the subsequent research on the just-world hypothesis used these [[psychometrics|measurement scales]].

===Violence===
Researchers have looked at how observers react to victims of [[rape]] and other [[violence]]. In a formative experiment on rape and belief in a just world by Linda Carli and colleagues, researchers gave two groups of subjects a narrative about interactions between a man and a woman. The description of the interaction was the same until the end; one group received a narrative that had a neutral ending and the other group received a narrative that ended with the man raping the woman. Subjects judged the rape ending as inevitable and blamed the woman in the narrative for the rape on the basis of her behavior, but not her characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R., Timko, C., &amp; Carli, L. L. (1985). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christine_Timko/publication/223081344_Cognitive_biases_in_blaming_the_victim/links/59dd3d88aca272b698e141ab/Cognitive-biases-in-blaming-the-victim.pdf Cognitive biases in blaming the victim]. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 21(2), 161–177.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings have been replicated repeatedly, including using a rape ending and a 'happy ending' (a marriage proposal).&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carli, L. L. (1999). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.830.8628&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Cognitive Reconstruction, Hindsight, and Reactions to Victims and Perpetrators]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(8), 966–979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have found a similar phenomenon for judgments of [[domestic violence|battered partners]]. One study found that observers' labels of blame of female victims of relationship violence increase with the intimacy of the relationship. Observers blamed the perpetrator only in the most significant case of violence, in which a male struck an acquaintance.&lt;ref&gt;Summers, G., &amp; Feldman, N. S. (1984). [http://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1984.2.4.339 Blaming the victim versus blaming the perpetrator:An attributional analysis of spouse abuse]. ''Symposium A Quarterly Journal In Modern Foreign Literatures'', 2(4), 339–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bullying===
Researchers have employed the just-world hypothesis to understand [[bullying]]. Given other research on beliefs in a just world, it would be expected that observers would derogate and blame bullying victims, but the opposite has been found: individuals high in just-world belief have stronger anti-bullying [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, C. L., Elder, T., Gater, J., &amp; Johnson, E. (2010). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1348/000709909X479105 The association between adolescents' beliefs in a just world and their attitudes to victims of bullying]. ''The British journal of educational psychology'', 80(Pt 2), 183–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers have found that strong belief in a just world is associated with lower levels of bullying behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2008). School Bullying. ''European Psychologist'', 13(4), 248254.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding is in keeping with Lerner's understanding of belief in a just world as functioning as a "contract" that governs behavior.&lt;ref name="LernerFundamental" /&gt; There is additional evidence that belief in a just world is protective of the well-being of children and adolescents in the school environment,&lt;ref&gt;Correia, I., Kamble, S. V., &amp; Dalbert, C. (2009). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615800902729242 Belief in a just world and well-being of bullies, victims and defenders: a study with Portuguese and Indian students]. Anxiety, stress, and coping, 22(5), 497–508.&lt;/ref&gt; as has been shown for the [[#Positive health effects|general population]].

===Illness===
Other researchers have found that observers judge sick people as responsible for their illnesses. One experiment showed that persons suffering from a variety of illnesses were derogated on a measure of attractiveness more than healthy individuals were. In comparison to healthy people, victim derogation was found for persons presenting with indigestion, pneumonia, and stomach cancer. Moreover, derogation was found to be higher for those suffering from more severe illnesses, except for those presenting with cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Gruman, J. C., &amp; Sloan, R. P. (1983). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15324834basp0401_4 Disease as Justice: Perceptions of the Victims of Physical Illness]. Basic and Applied Social Psychology, 4(1), 39–46.&lt;/ref&gt; Stronger belief in a just world has also been found to correlate with greater derogation of [[AIDS]] victims.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS"&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1992). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/001872679204500303 Sphere-specific just world beliefs and attitudes to AIDS]. Human Relations, 45, 265–280.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===
More recently, researchers have explored how people react to [[poverty]] through the lens of the just-world hypothesis. Strong belief in a just world is associated with blaming the poor, with weak belief in a just world associated with identifying external causes of poverty including world economic systems, [[war]], and [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. J., Wagstaff, G. F., Newton, J. T., &amp; Harrison, K. R. (1990). [http://inesad.edu.bo/developmentroast/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Harper-1990-Poverty-Explanations.pdf Lay causal perceptions of third world poverty and the just world theory]. ''Social Behavior and Personality: an international journal'', 18(2), 235–238. Scientific Journal Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harper, D. J., &amp; Manasse, P. R. (1992). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-29152-001 The Just World and the Third World: British explanations for poverty abroad]. ''The Journal of social psychology'', 6. Heldref Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The self as victim===
{{See also|Psychological response to rape|Self blame}}
Some research on belief in a just world has examined how people react when they themselves are victimized. An early paper by Dr. Ronnie Janoff-Bulman found that rape victims often blame their own behavior, but not their own characteristics, for their [[victimization]].&lt;ref&gt;Janoff-Bulman, R. (1979). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ronnie_Janoff-Bulman/publication/22629118_Characterological_versus_behavioral_self-blame_Inquiries_into_depression_and_rape/links/54244b5b0cf238c6ea6eac09.pdf Characterological versus behavioral self-blame: inquiries into depression and rape]. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 37(10), 1798–809.&lt;/ref&gt; It was hypothesized that this may be because blaming one's own behavior makes an event more [[locus of control|controllable]].

These studies on victims of [[#Violence|violence]], [[#Illness|illness]], and [[#Poverty|poverty]] and others like them have provided consistent support for the link between observers' just-world beliefs and their tendency to blame victims for their suffering.&lt;ref name="An Overview" /&gt; As a result, the existence of the just-world hypothesis as a psychological phenomenon has become widely accepted.

==Theoretical refinement==
Subsequent work on measuring belief in a just world has focused on identifying multiple dimensions of the belief. This work has resulted in the development of new measures of just-world belief and additional research.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt; Hypothesized dimensions of just-world beliefs include belief in an unjust world,&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C., Lipkus, I. M., Sallay, H., &amp; Goch, I. (2001). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900000556 A just and unjust world: Structure and validity of different world beliefs]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 30, 561–577.&lt;/ref&gt; beliefs in [[immanent]] [[justice]] and ultimate justice,&lt;ref&gt;Maes, J. (1998). Immanent justice and ultimate justice: two ways of believing in justice. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.),  ''Responses to victimizations and belief in a just world'' (pp. 9–40). New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; hope for justice, and belief in one's ability to reduce injustice.&lt;ref&gt;Mohiyeddini, C., &amp; Montada, L. (1998). [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4757-6418-5_3 BJW and self-efficacy in coping with observed victimization]. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 43–53). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other work has focused on looking at the different domains in which the belief may function; individuals may have different just-world beliefs for the personal domain, the sociopolitical domain, the social domain, etc.&lt;ref name="FurnhamProcterAIDS" /&gt; An especially fruitful distinction is between the belief in a just world for the self (personal) and the belief in a just world for others (general). These distinct beliefs are differentially associated with [[Just-world hypothesis#Positive mental health effects|positive mental health]].&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal" /&gt;

==Correlates==
Researchers have used measures of [[belief]] in a just world to look at correlates of high and low levels of belief in a just world.

Limited studies have examined ideological correlates of the belief in a just world. These studies have found sociopolitical correlates of just-world beliefs, including [[right-wing authoritarianism]] and the [[protestant work ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, A. J., Burroughs, T., &amp; Nguyen, T. (1999). [https://sites.google.com/site/alambertpsychology/publications/Lambertetal-riskperception.pdf Perceptions of risk and the buffering hypothesis: The role of just world beliefs and right wing authoritarianism]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 25(6), 643–656.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. &amp; Procter, E. (1989). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.1989.tb00880.x Belief in a just world: review and critique of the individual difference literature]. ''British Journal of Social Psychology'', 28, 365–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have also found belief in a just world to be correlated with aspects of [[religiousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Begue, L. (2002). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886900002245 Beliefs in justice and faith in people: just world, religiosity and interpersonal trust]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 32(3), 375–382.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurst, J., Bjorck, J., &amp; Tan, S. (2000). [http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-07654-003 Causal attributions for uncontrollable negative events]. ''Journal of Psychology and Christianity'', 19, 47–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of demographic differences, including [[gender]] and [[Race (classification of humans)|racial]] differences, have not shown systematic differences, but do suggest racial differences, with blacks and African Americans having the lowest levels of belief in a just world.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, L., &amp; Cann, A. (1994). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1994.9923011 Differences in assumptions about a just world: ethnicity and point of view]. ''Journal of Social Psychology'', 134, 765–770.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, M. (2000). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42864385 Status, religion, and the ''belief in a just world'': comparing African Americans, Latinos, and Whites]. ''Social Science Quarterly'', 81, 325–343.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of measures of just-world beliefs has also allowed researchers to assess cross-cultural differences in just-world beliefs. Much research conducted shows that beliefs in a just world are evident cross-culturally. One study tested beliefs in a just world of students in 12 countries. This study found that in countries where the majority of inhabitants are powerless, belief in a just world tends to be weaker than in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1993). [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224545.1993.9712149 Just world beliefs in twelve societies]. ''Journal of Social Psychology'', 133, 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt; This supports the theory of the just-world hypothesis because the powerless have had more personal and societal experiences that provided evidence that the world is not just and predictable.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A. (1992). Relationship knowledge and attitudes towards AIDS. ''Psychological Reports'', 71, 1149–1150.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|reason=I assume you mean to say 'neither just nor predictable.'|date=February 2014}}

Belief in unjust world has been linked to increased self-handicapping, criminality, defensive coping, anger and perceived future risk. It may also serve as ego-protective belief for certain individuals by justifying maladaptive behavior.&lt;ref name="Furnham2003Decade" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lench|first1=Chang|title=Belief in an Unjust World: When Beliefs in a Just World Fail|journal=Journal of Personality Assessment|date=2007|volume=89|issue=2|pages=126–135|doi=10.1080/00223890701468477|pmid=17764390}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dolinski|first1=Dariusz|title=The belief in an unjust world: An egotistic delusion|journal=Social Justice Research|date=1996|volume=9|issue=3|pages=213–221|doi=10.1007/BF02197248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current research==

===Positive mental health effects===
Although much of the initial work on belief in a just world focused on its negative social effects, other research suggests that belief in a just world is good, and even necessary, for [[mental health]].&lt;ref&gt;Dalbert, C. (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sbKCnhCPaSgC&amp;pg=PR3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20justice%20motive%20as%20a%20personal%20resource%3A%20dealing%20with%20challenges%20and%20critical%20life%20events%22 The justice motive as a personal resource: dealing with challenges and critical life events].'' New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Belief in a just world is associated with greater [[life satisfaction]] and well-being and less depressive affect.&lt;ref name="Lipkusetal"&gt;Lipkus, I. M., Dalbert, C., &amp; Siegler, I. C. (1996). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167296227002 The Importance of Distinguishing the Belief in a Just World for Self Versus for Others: Implications for Psychological Well-Being]. ''Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin'', 22(7), 666–677.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, C., Benson, D. E., &amp; Snyder, C. (1990). [http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1389045 Belief in a just world and depression]. ''Sociological Perspective'', 25, 235–252.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers are actively exploring the reasons why the belief in a just world might have this relationship to mental health; it has been suggested that such beliefs could be a personal resource or [[coping (psychology)|coping strategy]] that buffers [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with daily life and with [[psychological trauma|traumatic events]].&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner"&gt;Hafer, C., &amp; Olson, J. (1998). Individual differences in beliefs in a just world and responses to personal misfortune. In L. Montada, &amp; M. Lerner (Eds.), ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world'' (pp. 65–86). New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis suggests that belief in a just world can be understood as a [[positive illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S.E., &amp; Brown, J. (1988). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/16c6/b13d227783a3466d7a0903d9ebb111904502.pdf Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health]. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 103, 193–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies also show that beliefs in a just world are correlated with internal [[locus of control]].&lt;ref name="RubinPeplau1975" /&gt; Strong belief in a just world is associated with greater acceptance of and less dissatisfaction with negative events in one's life.&lt;ref name = "HaferinMontadaLerner" /&gt; This may be one way in which belief in a just world affects mental health. Others have suggested that this relationship holds only for beliefs in a just world for oneself. Beliefs in a just world for others are related instead to the negative social phenomena of victim blaming and victim derogation observed in other studies.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R., &amp; Douglas, K. (2005). [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690500070X Justice for all, or just for me? More evidence of the importance of the self-other distinction in just-world beliefs]. ''Personality and Individual Differences'', 39(3), 637–645.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International research===
More than 40 years after Lerner's seminal work on belief in a just world, researchers continue to study the phenomenon. Work continues primarily in the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia.&lt;ref name="MaesEightStages" /&gt; Researchers in Germany have contributed disproportionately to recent research.&lt;ref name="MontadaLernerPreface" /&gt; Their work resulted in a volume edited by Lerner and German researcher Leo Montada titled ''Responses to Victimizations and Belief in a Just World''.&lt;ref&gt;Montada, L. &amp; Lerner, M. (Eds.) (1998) ''Responses to victimizations and belief in the just world''. New York: Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6690">To '''kick the bucket''' is an [[English language|English]] [[idiom]], considered a [[euphemistic]], informal, or [[slang]] term meaning 'to die'.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Advanced Dictionary of Current English, 4th Ed. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Its origin remains unclear, though there have been several theories.

==Origin theories==
A common theory is that the idiom refers to hanging, either as a method of execution or suicide. However, there is no evidence to support this. Its earliest appearance is in the ''[[Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue]]'' (1785), where it is defined as 'to die'.&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt; In [[John Badcock (writer)|John Badcock]]'s slang dictionary of 1823, the explanation is given that "One Bolsover having hung himself from a beam while standing on a pail, or bucket, kicked this vessel away in order to pry into futurity and it was all UP with him from that moment: ''Finis''".&lt;ref&gt;''Slang: a dictionary of the turf, the ring, the chase, the pit, of bon-ton, and the varieties of life'', London 1823, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MbRMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;ots=nIFfqQEQRC&amp;dq=%22Bolsover%2C%20having%20hung%20himself%22&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Bolsover,%20having%20hung%20himself%22&amp;f=false p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory favoured by the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] relates to the alternative definition of a bucket as a beam or yoke that can be used to hang or carry things on.&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;"Bucket." ''The Oxford English Dictionary''. 2nd ed. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The "bucket" may refer to the beam on which [[Animal slaughter|slaughtered]] [[pigs]] are suspended. The animals may struggle on the bucket, hence the expression.&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt; The word "bucket" still can be used today to refer to such a beam in the [[Norfolk dialect]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Idioms'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that this definition came from the [[French language|French]] word ''[[trébuchet]]'' or ''buque'', meaning balance.&lt;ref name="phrase"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/218800.html The Phrase Finder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OED/&gt; [[William Shakespeare]] used the word in this sense in his play [[Henry IV Part II]] where he says:&lt;ref name="phrase"/&gt;
{{quote|Swifter than he that [[wikt:gibbet#Verb|gibbet]]s on the Brewers Bucket.|William Shakespeare|Henry IV Part II}}

A third theory suggests that the origin of the phrase comes from the Catholic custom of holy-water buckets:&lt;ref&gt;"Relics of Popery", Catholic Truth Society London&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|After death, when a body had been laid out ... the holy-water bucket was brought from the church and put at the feet of the corpse. When friends came to pray... they would sprinkle the body with holy water ... it is easy to see how such a saying as "kicking the bucket " came about. Many other explanations of this saying have been given by persons who are unacquainted with Catholic custom|The Right Reverend Abbot Horne|''Relics of Popery''}} Alternatively, in the moment of death a person stretches his legs (in Spanish ''Estirar la pata'' means 'to die') and so might kick the bucket placed there.

Yet another theory seeks to extend the saying beyond its earliest use in the 16th century with reference to the Latin proverb ''Capra Scyria'', the goat that is said to kick over the pail after being milked (920 in Erasmus' [[Adagia]]). Thus a promising beginning is followed by a bad ending or, as [[Andrea Alciato]] phrased it in the Latin poem accompanying the drawing in his ''Emblemata'' (1524), 'Because you have spoilt your fine beginnings with a shameful end and turned your service into harm, you have done what the she-goat does when she kicks the bucket that holds her milk and with her hoof squanders her own riches'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emblems.arts.gla.ac.uk/french/emblem.php?id=FALc140 Emblem 160]&lt;/ref&gt; Here it is the death of one's reputation that is in question.

==American variations==
At one time the American and [[British West Indies|Caribbean]] expression 'kickeraboo' used to be explained as a deformed version of 'kick the bucket'.&lt;ref&gt;John Camden Hotton, The Slang Dictionary, London 1865, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0k1dv1hVdSoC&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;ots=wQWGNw77K1&amp;dq=%22kickeraboo%22%20Slang%20Dictionary&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kickeraboo%22%20Slang%20Dictionary&amp;f=false pp. 164–65]&lt;/ref&gt; The expression occurs as the title of a mid-19th century American minstrel ballad with the ending 'Massa Death bring one bag and we Kickeraboo'.&lt;ref&gt;Lubrano broadside ballad collection [http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/broadside&amp;CISOPTR=389&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=8 68]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is now thought that it may have derived from a native word in one of the West African creoles. The expression 'kek(e)rebu' is first recorded in 1721 with the meaning 'to die' in the [[Krio language]] of [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Anglophone Creole item ''kekrebu'', American English 30/3, 1985, [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/454900?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101007321433 pp. 281–83]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier still 'Kickativoo' is recorded in [[Ghana]] (then known as the Gold or Slave Coast). In 1680 it referred to the capsizing of a canoe but also had the meaning 'to die'.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Huber, Ghanaian Pidgin English in Its West African Context, John Benjamins Publishing Co. 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=U0NFweXVDOgC&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;ots=q3lOMlwx0M&amp;dq=kickeraboo&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=kickeraboo&amp;f=false p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever [[African American]] usage might have been in the 19th century, by the 20th century they were using the idiom 'kick the bucket'. It occurs in the [[jazz]] classic ''Old Man Mose'', recorded by [[Louis Armstrong]] in the US in 1935, and in the West Indies it figured in the title of the [[reggae]] hit “Long Shot kick de bucket”, recorded by [[The Pioneers (band)|The Pioneers]] in 1969. In the case of the latter, the song refers to the death of a horse.

In [[North America]], a variation of the idiom is 'kick off'.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary, p. 787&lt;/ref&gt; A related phrase is to "hand in one's dinner pail", a bucket that contains a [[Laborer|worker]]'s [[dinner]].&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; Another variation, '[[Wish list|bucket list]]', or a list of things to do before one dies, is derived from "to kick the bucket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bucket%20list | title=Definition of bucket list | publisher=Merriam-Webster | accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biotechnology sector is growing in the New York City area, based upon the region's strength in academic scientific [[research]] and public and commercial financial support. By mid-2014, Accelerator, a biotech [[investment]] firm, had raised more than US$30&amp;nbsp;million from [[investor]]s, including [[Eli Lilly and Company]], [[Pfizer]], and [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], for initial funding to create biotechnology [[startup company|startups]] at the Alexandria Center for Life Science, which encompasses more than {{convert|700,000|sqft|m2}} on [[29th Street (Manhattan)|East 29th Street]] and promotes collaboration among scientists and entrepreneurs at the center and with nearby academic, medical, and research institutions. The [[New York City Economic Development Corporation]]'s Early Stage Life Sciences Funding Initiative and venture capital partners, including [[Celgene]], [[General Electric]] Ventures, and Eli Lilly, committed a minimum of US$100&amp;nbsp;million to help launch 15 to 20 ventures in [[life sciences]] and biotechnology in 2014,&lt;ref name=Alexandria2014&gt;{{cite news | last = Morris | first = Keiko | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://online.wsj.com/articles/wanted-biotech-startups-in-new-york-city-1406603189 | title=Wanted: Biotech Startups in New York City: The Alexandria Center for Life Science Looks to Expand | newspaper = The Wall Street Journal | date = 28 July 2014 | accessdate = 1 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in January 2018, the City of New York itself committed up to US$100&amp;nbsp;million into the venture.&lt;ref name=Alexandria2018&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/articles/96/i10/New-York-City-biotech-scene.html|title=New York City biotech scene gains more traction|author=Ryan Cross|publisher=C&amp;EN Chemical and Engineering News|date=March 5, 2018|accessdate=April 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] announced a US$50 million venture-capital fund to encourage enterprises working in biotechnology and [[Materials science|advanced materials]]; according to Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]], the [[seed money]] would facilitate entrepreneurs in bringing their research into the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-12-12/new-york-state-will-start-50-million-venture-capital-fund.html | title = New York State Will Start $50 Million Venture-Capital Fund | first= Freeman | last = Klopott | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = Bloomberg L.P | date = 12 December 2014 | accessdate = 12 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lucius Aemilius Mamercus''' was a Roman statesman who served as [[roman consul|consul]] three times: in 484, 478 and 473 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], II.38, II.52, II.64&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], ''Roman Antiquities'', IX.37&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Livy-2.42&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 484, as consul, Aemilius led the Roman forces in [[Roman-Aequian_wars#Ongoing_hostilities_from_485_BC|battle]] against the [[Volsci]] and [[Aequi]].  The Romans were successful, and the Roman cavalry slaughtered many in the rout which followed.&lt;ref name=Livy-2.42/&gt;

[[Livy]] says that during his first consulship, Aemilius (together with his colleague [[Caeso Fabius Vibulanus (consul)|Caeso Fabius Vibulanus]]) worked with the senate to oppose increases to the [[Tribune_of_the_Plebs#Powers_of_the_tribunes|powers of the tribunes]].&lt;ref name=Livy-2.42/&gt;

In 478 Aemilius led a Roman army successfully [[Roman–Etruscan_Wars#The_Fabian_war_with_Veii_in_483-476_BC|against the Etruscans]]. &lt;ref&gt;[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita (book)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'', ii. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luise Brunner''' (born 25 August 1908, date of death unknown) was a German concentration camp guard in [[Auschwitz]] II&lt;ref&gt;Der Ort des Terrors: Geschichte der nationalsozialistischen ..., Volume 4
 edited by Wolfgang Benz, Barbara Distel, Angelika Königseder, p. 497&lt;/ref&gt; (1942– late 1944) and the chief [[Female guards in Nazi concentration camps|oberaufseherin]] (chief guard) of [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] from December 1944 to April 1945. 

Brunner was born in [[Aidhausen]] in 1908. She trained at the Ravensbruck concentration camp during June 1942 and in October of that year she was assigned to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she rose through the ranks to become a [[Kommandoführerin]].  At Birkenau, Luise was feared for her brutality: "…A female German teacher – Drechsler – was the Lagerführerin [Stellvertretende Lagerführerin], a German woman named Brunner was the Oberapportführerin and another once called Grese [Grese] was the Rapportführerin.  If they noticed a shawl, a pullover, or stocking they would beat you half-dead…."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.degob.hu/index2.php?showjk=16&lt;/ref&gt;   

During the [[Hamburg Ravensbrück Trials|Seventh Ravensbrück Trial]] (2 July 1948 – 21 July 1948), Brunner was tried on charges of [[mistreatment of inmates]] of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] nationality and participation in the selection of inmates for the [[gas chamber]]. She was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Täterinnen: Frauen im Nationalsozialismus|last=Kompisch|first=Kathrin|page=161|year=2008 |publisher=Böhlau Verlag|isbn=9783412201883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnus''' (1324–1373), called '''Magnus with the Necklace''' ('''{{lang-lat|Magnus Torquatus}}''') or '''Magnus II''', was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, ruling the [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] principalities of [[Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Wolfenbüttel]] (colloquially also called Brunswick) and, temporarily, [[Lüneburg-Celle|Lüneburg]].

==Biography==
Magnus was the son of [[Magnus the Pious, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Magnus the Pious, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Wolfenbüttel)]]. In 1362 Magnus and his brother Louis I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg helped their brother Prince-Archbishop [[Albert of Brunswick and Lunenburg-Wolfenbüttel|Albert II]] of [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen]] to assert himself against the incumbent [[diocesan administrator]] Morris of Oldenburg, who claimed the [[Episcopal see|see]] for himself. Magnus, Louis and the latter's father-in-law [[William II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg|William II, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Celle)]], and their troops beleaguered Morris in the [[Vörde Castle|prince-archiepiscopal castle]] in [[Bremervörde|Vörde]] and forced him to sign his resignation.

After the death of his brother Louis in 1367, Magnus became the designated heir of both ducal principalities, Wolfenbüttel and [[Lüneburg-Celle|Celle]] (colloquially also Lüneburg). When both his father and William II, who ruled over Celle, died in 1369, Magnus gained both ducal principalities. But already in 1370, he lost Celle to the [[Ascanian]] dukes of [[Saxe-Wittenberg]] ([[Albert of Saxe-Wittenberg, Duke of Lüneburg|Albert]] and his uncle [[Wenceslas I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg|Wenceslas, Elector of Saxe-Wittemberg]]), who had been given the principality by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], who had also banned Magnus. Several cities, including [[Lüneburg|Lüneburg (Lunenburg)]], [[Uelzen]], and [[Hanover]] switched allegiance to the Ascanians; Magnus managed to keep the City of [[Brunswick (city)|Braunschweig (Brunswick)]] among his allies only with difficulties. The [[Lüneburg War of Succession]] continued for several years after Magnus died in the Battle of Leveste (a part of today's [[Gehrden]]), near the [[Deister]], on 25 July 1373.

==Family==
Magnus married Catherine, daughter of [[Bernhard III, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg]], who married Magnus' enemy, Albert, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg, after his death. They had the following children:

*[[Catherine Elisabeth of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Catherine Elizabeth]] married [[Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg|Gerhard II/VI]], Duke of Schleswig/Count of Holstein-Rendsburg (ca. 1367 – 4 August 1404)
*[[Frederick I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (1357–1400), married [[Anna of Saxe-Wittenberg]] (died 1440)
*[[Bernard I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (died 1434), married Margaret of Saxony (before 1370 – 1418)
*Otto, Archbishop of [[Bremen]] (ca. 1364–1406)
*[[Henry the Mild, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (died 1416)
*Agnes I (died 1410), married [[Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen|Albert I, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] (1339–1383)
*Helen, married [[Eric I, Count of Hoya]]
*Elizabeth (died 1420), married Maurice IV, Count of Oldenburg (1380–1420)
*[[Agnes of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Agnes II]] (before 1356 – ca. 1416), married first Busso IV, Count of Mansfeld, then [[Bogislaw VI, Duke of Pomerania]], and finally King [[Albert of Sweden]]
*Sophie (1358–by 28 May 1416), married Duke [[Eric IV of Saxe-Lauenburg|Eric IV]] of [[Saxe-Lauenburg]] on 8 April 1373.
*Maud (1370–??), married Otto III, Count of Hoya (died 1428)

'''Masae Kasai''' (河西 昌枝 ''Kasai Masae'', 14 July 1933 &amp;ndash; 3 October 2013) was a [[volleyball]] player from [[Japan]], who was a member of the Japan Women's National Team that won the gold medal at the [[Volleyball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Summer Olympics]].

Masae Kasai was born in [[Minami-Alps, Yamanashi]], and started playing volleyball when the sport was still played with nine players a side in Japan (six are used internationally). She joined the Nichibo fiber spinning company right out of high school, first playing for corporation's Ashikaga (Tochigi) team, later for the one from Kaizuka (Osaka). The latter team dominated the women's sport in the late 1950s and 1960s, and when the Japanese started playing according to international rules, Nichibo Kaizuka's players formed the national team. Kasai and her team mates débuted at the 1960 World Championships, finishing behind the Soviet Union. Two years later, the Japanese won the title, defeating the Soviet squad before a Moscow audience. When volleyball made its Olympic début in Tokyo, they lived up to high expectations by again beating the Soviet Union in the final round-robin match, in straight sets. After the Olympics, team captain Masae Kasai met with the Japanese Prime Minister and complained to him that she had not been able to find a husband because of the difficult training regimen. The Prime Minister set her up with a date and the two later married. She later went on to become a volleyball coach in Japan and China, and sat on the board of the Japanese Volleyball Association. In 2008, she was inducted into the Volleyball Hall of Fame.

Masae Kasai (who changed her last name to Nakamura after she married) died on October 3, 2013, in Tokyo from [[intracranial hemorrhage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXNASDG0302F_T01C13A0CC0000/|title=中村昌枝さんが死去　バレー「東洋の魔女」主将 |publisher=[[Nikkei Shinbun]]|language=Japanese|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''minor sabotage''' (''aka'' '''little sabotage''' or '''small sabotage'''; {{lang-pl|mały sabotaż}}) during [[World War II]] in [[occupation of Poland|Nazi-occupied]] [[Poland]] (1939–45) was any [[Polish Underground State|underground resistance]] operation that involved a disruptive but relatively minor and [[non-violent]] form of defiance, such as the painting of [[graffiti]], the manufacture of fake documents, the disrupting of German [[propaganda]] campaigns, and the like.  Minor-sabotage operations often involved elements of [[humor]].
&lt;ref name=pwn&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://sjp.pwn.pl/haslo.php?id=2518795 "''Mały sabotaż''"], ''Słownik Języka Polskiego'' (Dictionary of the Polish Language), [[Polish Scientific Publishers PWN|PWN]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of minor-sabotage operations was primarily [[psychological warfare|psychological]] — to show Polish civilians that the resistance remained active, and thus bolster civilian morale, and to wear down the German occupier.&lt;ref name=rzecz&gt;{{pl icon}} Tomasz Stańczyk, [http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040529/specjal_a_7.html "''Piasek sypany w oczy'',"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526145431/http://www.rzeczpospolita.pl/specjal_040529/specjal_a_7.html |date=26 May 2008 }} ''Rzeczpospolita, Dodatek Specjalny'', 29.05.04, no. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In September 1939, during the [[German invasion of Poland]], after the [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|fall of Warsaw]], a young Polish student, Elżbieta Zahorska, tore down a German poster. Soon after, she was executed for her act; her death, however, instead of cowing others, inspired an entire new branch of Polish resistance, called minor sabotage.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

Several organizations dedicated to minor sabotage were created in 1939 and 1940, notably PLAN, Wawer and Palmiry.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; Minor sabotage was often carried out by scouting organizations such as ''[[Szare Szeregi]]''.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; On a larger scale, it was coordinated by the [[Directorate of Civil Resistance]] of the [[Polish Underground State]] and, in some cases, by its military arm, the [[Home Army]] (see [[Operation N]]). Thousands were involved in minor sabotage. During two weeks in March and April 1942 when the ''[[kotwica]]'' symbol was introduced, it was painted all around Warsaw by a 400-strong dedicated team.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

[[Aleksander Kamiński]], a teacher and scouting activist, soon became a major figure in organizing such operations. In November 1940 he published an article in the main [[bibuła|Polish underground newspaper]], ''[[Biuletyn Informacyjny]]'', explaining how to carry out such acts.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;

==Operations==
Notable or common minor-sabotage operations included:
* painting pro-Polish and anti-Nazi [[graffiti]].&lt;ref name=polska&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://dziedzictwo.polska.pl/slownik/index,Maly_sabotaz,id,266516.htm Mały sabotaż], polska.pl&lt;/ref&gt; Common symbols included the ''[[kotwica]]'' ("anchor"—the symbol of the [[Polish Underground State|Polish underground]])&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; and the turtle (a symbol of work sabotage and inefficiency, to be implemented by those who worked—often [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|forcibly]]—for the German occupier).&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; Slogans included "''Wawer pomścimy''" ("We will avenge the [[Wawer massacre]]"),&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; "''Pawiak pomścimy''" ("We will avenge the [[Pawiak]] [prison atrocities]"),&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; and "''Oświęcim''" ("[[Auschwitz]]").&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* inefficient, slow work and [[sabotage]], when one was employed by the Germans&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* misdirection, when asked for directions&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* not acknowledging that one speaks German, and thus refusing to communicate with the Germans&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* ignoring German demands or executing them only at the last possible moment&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* harassing German occupiers and collaborators by sending threats&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt; or denouncing them as underground activists to German security forces&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* counteracting German Nazi propaganda operations (for example, by altering German posters—such posters about advances in the [[Soviet Union]] were "amended" to the date 1812)&lt;ref name=pwn/&gt;&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* tearing down and damaging German flags&lt;ref name=polska/&gt; and putting up Polish flags for Polish anniversaries&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* breaking windows in shops that displayed German symbols (for example, those of photographers who displayed photographs of German soldiers, and of shops that displayed signs in [[German language|German]])&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;&lt;ref name=polska/&gt;
* taking over German megaphone systems to broadcast [[Polish patriotic songs]]&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* "Amending" German newspapers with Polish symbols; on occasion, issuing fake editions&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt;
* releasing stink bombs and the like in [[movie theater]]s that screened German [[propaganda film]]s and [[newsreel]]s, and putting up the Polish-language slogan, "''Tylko świnie siedzą w kinie''" ("Only [[swine]] watch the German line")&lt;ref name=polska/&gt;
* placing the German sign, "''[[Nur für Deutsche]]''" ("Only for Germans"), in selected sites such as [[cemetery|cemeteries]]

A particularly notable operation was carried out by [[Maciej Aleksy Dawidowski]] on 11 February 1942. Soon after the Germans had occupied Warsaw in 1939, they had placed on the [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument in Warsaw|Nicolaus Copernicus Monument]] on ''[[Krakowskie Przedmieście]]'' a large plaque proclaiming Copernicus to have been a German astronomer.  Dawidowski removed and concealed the German plaque.&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; In response, the Germans moved Warsaw's statue of [[Jan Kiliński]] to the [[National Museum in Warsaw]].&lt;ref name=rzecz/&gt; Immediately, Dawidowski and his comrades retaliated by placing a large graffito on the Museum ("People of Warsaw—I am here. Jan Kiliński") and adding a new plaque to the Copernicus monument: "For removal of the Kiliński statue, I am extending the winter by two months. Kopernik."&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Einhorn, ''Recollections of the End of an Era: Poland 1919-1945'', Author House, 2005, {{ISBN|1-4208-0354-9}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9WqTG8Oiv7cC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Poland+%22minor+sabotage%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=VgXeSqDwJY7GMrWwiOkD#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Print, pp. 128-29.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though most minor sabotage operations took place in Warsaw, they also were organized in other cities of occupied Poland, such as [[Częstochowa]] (painting anti-German graffiti, destruction of German signs, affixing of Polish posters), [[Kielce]] (defacing of German symbols on official signs, stamping newspapers with the [[Kotwica]], painting of a large symbol of the Polish underground state on the tower of the Cathedral church), and [[Kraków]] (writing "Hitler Kaputt" on the walls, selling fake copies of the local daily "Goniec Krakowski").

{{Nihongo|'''Mothra'''|モスラ|Mosura}} is a [[kaiju]] that first appeared in [[Toho]]'s 1961 film ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]''. Mothra has appeared in several Toho [[tokusatsu]] films, most often as a recurring character in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' franchise]]. She is typically portrayed as a colossal sentient [[caterpillar]] or imago [[moth]], accompanied by two miniature humanoids speaking on her behalf. Unlike other Toho monsters, Mothra is a largely heroic character, having been variously portrayed as a protector of her own island culture,&lt;ref name="mothra1961"&gt;''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'' (1961). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; the Earth,&lt;ref name="GvM"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' (1992). Directed by [[Takao Okawara]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Japan.&lt;ref name="GMK"&gt;''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'' (2001). Directed by [[Shusuke Kaneko]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt; Though identified as a kind of moth, the character's design is more evocative of a [[European Peacock|peacock butterfly]], and has [[caddisfly]]-like [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] rather than a [[proboscis]]. The character is often depicted hatching offspring (in some cases, twins) when approaching death, a nod to the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of numerous [[Indian religions]].&lt;ref name="giorgio61"&gt;Davide Di Giorgio, Andrea Gigante, Gordiano Lupi (2012). ''Godzilla il re dei mostri: Il sauro radioattivo di Honda e Tsuburaya''. Il Foglio Letterario. pp. 61-3. {{ISBN|978-88-7606-351-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothra is one of Toho’s most popular monsters, and second only to Godzilla in its total number of film appearances. Polls taken during the early 1990s indicated that Mothra was particularly popular among women, who were at the time the largest demographic among Japan's movie-going audience, a fact that prompted the filming of 1992's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'', which was the best-attended Toho film since ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.3"/&gt; [[IGN]] listed Mothra as #3 on their "Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters" list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/top-10-japanese-movie-monsters?page=2|title=Top 10 Japanese Movie Monsters|last=Hawker|first=Tom|work=IGN|date=May 15, 2014|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' listed the character as #7 on its "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Robertson, [http://uk.complex.com/pop-culture/2014/05/most-badass-kaiju-monsters-of-all-time/ "The 15 Most Badass Kaiju Monsters of All Time"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' (May 18, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
===Name===
The name "Mothra" is the suffixation of "-ra" to the English word "moth"; since the Japanese language does not have [[dental fricative]]s, it is approximated "Mosura" in Japanese. The “ra” suffix follows the precedent set by “Gojira”, which in turn is derived from kujira (鯨（クジラ), the Japanese word for “whale,” to indicate the character’s enormous size.

During its promotion of ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' for the American market, [[American International Pictures]] entitled the movie ''Godzilla vs. the Thing'', probably to avoid legal action from [[Columbia Pictures]], which had released the original ''Mothra''.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.thing"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Mothra was first conceived in the January 1961 [[serial (publishing)|serial]] ''[[The Luminous Fairies and Mothra]]'' by authors Shinichiro Nakamura, Takehiko Fukunaga and Yoshie Hotta, who had been commissioned by [[Toho]] to write the outline of a future film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2007/07/30/jerry-ito-a-swonderful-life/ "Jerry Ito: A S'Wonderful Life"], ''Sci-Fi Japan'' (July 30, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The character was further developed by [[Shinichi Sekizawa]], whose experiences of starving in the South Pacific islands during [[World War II]] prompted him to envision a movie featuring an island where mysterious events occurred.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=51–4|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her [[Mothra (film)|1961 debut]], Mothra's adult form consisted of a wire-operated mechanical puppet, while the larva was a [[suitmation]] puppet operated by six stuntmen crawling in single file. In ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' three years later, the adult Mothra puppet was modified with radio-controlled legs, while the larvae were portrayed via a combination of motor-driven props and hand puppets.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=108–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larval Mothra featured in ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' remained largely unchanged from its previous appearance, though the color of its eyes was changed from blue to red.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.2"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adult Mothra prop featured in ''Mothra vs. Godzilla'' was reused in ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'', though previous heavy use had dulled its colors, frayed the fur on the head, and damaged the wings.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early Heisei era of ''Godzilla ''films, which ignored the continuity established in pre-1984 movies, several attempts were made to develop a Mothra standalone feature. Akira Murao wrote a screenplay in 1980 entitled ''Mothra vs. Bagan'', which revolved around a shape-shifting dragon called Bagan who sought to destroy humanity for its abuse of the Earth's resources, only to be defeated by Mothra, the god of peace. The screenplay was revised by [[Kazuki Ōmori]] after the release of ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'', though the project was ultimately scrapped by Toho, under the assumption that Mothra was a character born purely out of Japanese culture, and thus would have been difficult to market overseas unlike the more internationally recognized [[Godzilla]].&lt;ref name="kalat2010.2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=179–183|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the success of ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'', Toho sought to continue the series' newfound profitability by reintroducing familiar monsters rather than inventing new ones. Mothra was chosen as Godzilla's next antagonist on account of the character's popularity with women, who constituted the majority of cinemagoers at the time. Special effects head [[Koichi Kawakita]] co-wrote a screenplay entitled ''Godzilla vs. Gigamoth'' in 1991, which would have pitted Mothra against Godzilla and an irradiated Mothra doppelganger called Gigamoth, though this was rejected early on, and replaced with the final plotline seen in the film ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]''. Kawakita's depiction of Mothra's adult form was given the ability to fire [[Directed-energy weapon|energy beams]], which were rendered via optical effects, and the pollen dust emitted from its wings were given a sparkling effect not seen in prior movies. During the character's transformation from larva to adult, it was initially planned to have Mothra's unfolding wings rendered through [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]], though this was scrapped on account of it not looking "sensitive" enough.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan’s Favorite Mon-Star: The Unauthorized Biography of the Big G |last=Ryfle |first=S. |year=1998 |publisher=Toronto: ECW Press |isbn=1550223488 |pages=279–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the movie was a financial success, the Mothra props were criticized by several authors, who noted that the adult Mothra's brighter colors made it look like a "plush toy", and that its wings flapped less gracefully than in previous incarnations, as they were made of heavy cloth. The Mothra puppet's immobile, chicken-like feet, and the lack of undulation in the larva prop's movements were also commented on as being inferior to the effects seen in 1960s Mothra movies.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.4"/&gt; Criticism was also leveled at Mothra's altered origin story, which portrayed her as an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]], thus dampening the character's motivation for protecting Earth.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=184–90|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character's newfound popularity nevertheless prompted Toho to produce ''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;David Milne, [http://www.davmil.org/www.kaijuconversations.com/okawar3.htm "Takao Okawara Interview III"], ''Kaiju Conversations'' (December 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', director [[Shūsuke Kaneko]] had originally planned on using [[Anguirus]] as one of Godzilla's antagonists, but was pressured by Toho chairman [[Isao Matsuoka]] to use the more recognizable and profitable Mothra,&lt;ref name="kaneko"&gt;Ed Godziszewski and Norman England, "Interview with Shusuke Kaneko", Japanese Giants, Issue #9 (June, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; as the previous film in the franchise, ''[[Godzilla x Megaguirus]]'', which featured an original and unfamiliar antagonist, was a box office and critical failure.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=238–42|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2003's ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'', special effects director Eiichi Asada sought to model Mothra directly on her appearance in the original 1961 film, and to keep optical effects to a minimum. As with ''Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah'', the adult Mothra was given mobile legs, though they were made to constantly move, as it was felt that the prop stopped looking realistic once they became immobile. Creature designer Shinichi Wakasa had initially wanted Mothra's wings to have the angular design seen in ''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'', though the prop was ultimately given the wing shape seen in the 1960s movies.&lt;ref&gt;"Godzilla X Mothra X Mechagodzilla: Tokyo SOS production report - The men behind the monsters discuss the latest Godzilla film", ''Uchusen'' #108 (Asahi Sonorama) (October 22, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mothra is usually accompanied by tiny twin female [[Fairy|fairies]], which [[Shinichi Sekizawa]] termed ''Shobijin'', meaning "little beauties". The original draft for ''Mothra'' called for four fairies, though Sekizawa reduced the number to two, as twins were comparatively rare in Japan, thus adding to the characters' mystique. Toho also sought to reinforce its links with [[Columbia Pictures]], by featuring the singing duo [[The Peanuts]], who had been popularized in America by Columbia Records.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.1"/&gt; [[Yūji Koseki]] composed the song ''Mosura no uta'' ("Song of Mothra") for the fairies to sing when summoning Mothra.&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.thing"/&gt; The song was originally sung in [[Malay language|Malay]], but there is also a later version, set to the same tune, sung in Japanese:

{|border="0"
|+'''Mothra's Song'''
|-
! Malay || Translation || Japanese || Translation
|-
| ''Mosura ya Mosura'' || Mothra oh Mothra || ''Mosura ya Mosura'' || Mothra oh Mothra
|-
| ''Dengan kesaktian indukmu'' || With the Power of your Ancestor || ''Tasukete yo te yobeba'' || If we were to call for help
|-
| ''Restuilah doa hamba hamba mu yang rendah bangunlah dan'' || Grant the prayer of your followers, Arise and || ''Toki o koete, umi o koete, nami no yo ni'' || Over time, over sea, like a wave
|-
| ''tunjukanlah'' || Show|| ''Yate kuru'' || You'd come,
|-
| ''kesaktian'' || Your Power || ''Mamorigami!'' || Our guardian angel!
|}
The Peanuts were given an additional song in ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' entitled "Cry for Happiness", composed by Hiroshi Miyagawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=75|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peanuts did not reprise their role in ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'', and were replaced by the singing duo Pair Bambi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=David|title=A Critical History and Filmography of Toho's Godzilla Series|date=2010|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0-7864-47-49-7|pages=96|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'', the fairies are renamed the '''Cosmos''', and are played by Keiko Imamura and Sayaka Osawa. This casting move was criticized by Godzilla historian Steve Ryfle, who lamented the fact that the two actresses were not identical, and that their singing voices were "paper thin."&lt;ref name="ryfle1998.4"/&gt; According to [[Takao Okawara]], the Cosmos scenes were among the hardest scenes he had ever filmed, as the actresses had to synchronize their movements without looking at each other.&lt;ref name="kalat2010.3"/&gt;

In the ''Rebirth of Mothra'' trilogy, Mothra Leo's fairies are called the '''Elias'''. These characters (Moll, Lora, and Belvera) contrast with prior adaptations because they possess separate personalities and rarely act in unison. Megumi Kobayashi was cast as Moll for all three films, Sayaka Yamaguchi as Lora for the first two films, Misato Tate as Lora for the third film, and Aki Hano as Belvera for all three films.

==Character biography==
===Shōwa (1961–1968)===
In ''[[Mothra (film)|Mothra]]'', Mothra hatches from an egg on Infant Island after her priestesses are abducted by a Rosilican capitalist hoping to exploit them as media celebrities. The larval Mothra swims to Tokyo and cocoons herself around the [[Tokyo Tower]]. Upon reaching her adult form, Mothra flies to Rosilica's capital and causes widespread destruction until her priestesses are returned to her.&lt;ref name="mothra1961"/&gt;

In ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'', a Mothra egg appears on the coast of Japan, and is exploited as a tourist attraction. Mothra's priestesses attempt to negotiate the return of the egg to Infant Island, but are rebuffed. [[Godzilla]] attacks Japan, forcing humanity to beseech an embittered Mothra to intervene. Mothra dies fighting Godzilla, but the latter is defeated when two larvae emerge from the egg and encase Godzilla in a cocoon.&lt;ref name="MvG"&gt;''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' (1964). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'', it is revealed that only one of the larvae survived. The remaining larva attempts to convince Godzilla and [[Rodan]] to join forces with her in order to fight [[King Ghidorah]], but the two monsters reject her proposal. Mothra is nearly killed attempting to fight Ghidorah alone, but is saved through the intervention of Godzilla and Rodan.&lt;ref name="GTHM"&gt;''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]'' (1964). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The larva ultimately gains adulthood in ''[[Ebirah, Horror of the Deep]]'', where she saves a group of slaves taken from Infant Island from a [[terrorist]] base on Letchi Island undergoing a self-destruct sequence.&lt;ref name="GvSM"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster]]'' (1966). Directed by [[Jun Fukuda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Another larva appears in ''[[Destroy All Monsters]]'', living alongside other monsters in Monsterland. Along with the other monsters, Mothra is briefly enslaved by the Kilaaks, who force her to attack [[Beijing]] and later join Godzilla in the destruction of Tokyo. The Kilaaks' mind control is ultimately broken, and Mothra joins the other monsters in the final battle against King Ghidorah.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Destroy all Monsters]]'' (1968). Directed by [[Ishirō Honda]]. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heisei (1992–1998)===
====''Godzilla vs. Mothra'' (1992) and ''Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla'' (1994)====
1992's ''[[Godzilla vs. Mothra]]'' portrays Mothra as a guardian of the Earth who presided over an advanced civilization over 12,000 years ago. When the civilization created a device designed to control the Earth's climate, the Earth responded by creating the black Mothra, Battra - which Mothra defeated, but not before the civilization was wiped out. Mothra's egg is later discovered in 1993 on Infant Island by the Marutomo real estate agency, which seeks to exploit it and Mothra's priestesses for profit. The egg hatches during a fight between Godzilla and a resurrected Battra, and the larva later attacks Tokyo in order to save its priestesses. Mothra forms a cocoon around the [[National Diet Building]], attains its adult form, then briefly fights Battra before joining forces with him in order to fight Godzilla. Battra dies in the attempt, and Mothra pledges to fulfill Battra's role in preventing a meteorite from devastating the Earth in 1999.&lt;ref name="GvM"/&gt;

In ''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'', Mothra becomes aware of [[SpaceGodzilla]]'s advance towards Earth, and sends her priestesses to warn Earth of his arrival.&lt;ref name="GvSG"&gt;''[[Godzilla vs. SpaceGodzilla]]'' (1994). Directed by Kensho Yamashita. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Rebirth of Mothra'' trilogy (1996–1998)====
''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' is separate to the Heisei continuity, and portrays Mothra as the last remaining member of a species of giant moths who guard the Elias' civilization. This civilization was destroyed millions of years ago by the dragon Desghidorah, whom Mothra defeated. Mothra lays an egg in modern times, but is too weak to fight Desghidorah once it returns. The egg hatches and the new Mothra, named Mothra Leo, goes to protect his mother, but sadly Mothra is killed by Desghidorah while Leo is still too weak to injure the dragon. Leo manages to kill Desghidorah after maturing.&lt;ref name="RoM"&gt;''[[Rebirth of Mothra]]'' (1996). Directed by Okihiro Yoneda. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Leo returns in ''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'', where he acquires a new and more powerful form in order to fight the pollution monster Dagahra.&lt;ref name="RoMII"&gt;''[[Rebirth of Mothra II]]'' (1997). Directed by Kunio Miyoshi. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final chapter of the trilogy, ''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'', Leo is forced to return to the [[Cretaceous period]] in order to retroactively kill the space dragon [[King Ghidorah]].&lt;ref name="RoMIII"&gt;''[[Rebirth of Mothra III]]'' (1998). Directed by Okihiro Yoneda. [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Millennium (2001–2004)===
In ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', Mothra is portrayed as having been one of the three guardians of Yamato, originating 1,000 years before the events of the film. Initially an antagonist, Mothra was imprisoned in [[Lake Ikeda]], only to be reawakened in 2001 to halt Godzilla's destruction of Tokyo. She is defeated, but transfers her spirit to [[King Ghidorah]].&lt;ref name="GMK"/&gt;

''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' has the Mothra from the original 1961 film send her priestesses to demand that Japan dismantle the anti-Godzilla weapon [[Mechagodzilla]] or face destruction, as she considers the cyborg to be against the natural order, having been created using the bones of the first Godzilla. When the second Godzilla lands, Mothra attempts to fight the monster alongside Mechagodzilla, but is killed in the process. Two larvae hatch on Infant Island, and reach Tokyo in order to fight Godzilla, whom they encase in a cocoon, which is then transported into the ocean by Mechagodzilla.&lt;ref name="GTSOS"&gt;''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (2003). Directed by Masaaki Tezuka. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', which ignores the continuity of the previous film, establishes that Mothra protected the Earth 10,000 years ago from the cyborg [[Gigan]]. In the distant future, Gigan returns, under the control of the Xiliens, and is confronted by Mothra. In the ensuing battle, Mothra catches fire, but manages to kill Gigan by ramming into it and exploding.&lt;ref name="GFW"&gt;''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004). Directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. [[Toho]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===MonsterVerse (2019-)===
In 2014, [[Legendary Pictures]] announced that they have acquired the rights to [[King Ghidorah]], Mothra, and [[Rodan]] from [[Toho]] to use in their [[MonsterVerse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=Adrianne |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/26/5940259/godzilla-2-confirmed-with-director-gareth-edwards |title=Gareth Edwards returns to direct 'Godzilla 2' with Rodan and Mothra |publisher=The Verge |date=July 26, 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[post-credits scene]] at the end of the 2017 film ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', Mothra appears in a series of cave paintings depicting other monsters that are known to exist that are shown in the footage to James Conrad and Mason Weaver, along with Rodan, King Ghidorah, and Godzilla.&lt;ref name="KSI"&gt;''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' (2017). Directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts. [[Legendary Pictures]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A casting call confirmed that [[Rodan]], Mothra, and [[King Ghidorah]] will be featured in ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/232097/three-kaiju-appear-confirmed-godzilla-king-monsters/|title=These Three Kaiju Appear to Be Confirmed for Godzilla: King of the Monsters|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|work=Dread Central|date=May 31, 2017|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viral marketing for the movie shows that Mothra retains her status as a creature deified as an angelic-like Goddess, referred to as the Queen of the Monsters; whether or not Infant Island is involved is yet to be determined. Monarch Sciences, the film's promotional website, identifies the [[Yunnan|Yunnan rainforest]] as Mothra's location and also states in its adult form to be capable of emitting beta-wave [[bioluminescence]] that can be projected through the intricate patterns on its wings and weaponized into destructive and blinding ‘god rays’.&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/godzilla-2-monarch-site-every-secret/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.monarchsciences.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Newhard''' (July 26, 1783 – February 19, 1860) was a member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Pennsylvania]].

==Biography==
Newhard was born in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].  He is credited with opening the [[hardware store]] in Allentown in 1812.  He served as street commissioner of the borough of Allentown in 1812, and [[coroner]] of [[Lehigh County, Pennsylvania]], in 1816 and 1817.  He was elected to the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]] in 1817, 1818, 1819, 1824, 1825, and 1829, the term then being one year.

He was a member of the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] from 1833 to 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cox | first = Harold | title = Senate Members "N" | publisher = Wilkes University | work = [[Wilkes University Election Statistics Project]]| date = | url =http://staffweb.wilkes.edu/harold.cox/legis/Sn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as chairman of the town council in 1824 and again in 1837.

Newhard was elected as a Democrat to the [[26th United States Congress|Twenty-sixth]] and [[27th United States Congress|Twenty-seventh]] Congresses.  He was not a candidate for renomination in [[United States House election, 1842|1842]].  He served as burgess in 1843 and trustee of Allentown Academy in 1822, 1826, and 1843.  He died in Allentown in 1860 and his interment is in the City Cemetery.

'''Petro Nini Luarasi''' (born 22 April 1864 in [[Luaras]], [[Kolonjë]], [[Albania]], then [[Ottoman Empire]], and died on 17 August 1911 in [[Ersekë]], [[Kolonjë]], Albania, then Ottoman Empire) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] [[rilindas]] activist, [[Eastern orthodox|Christian orthodox]] priest, teacher and journalist. His father, Nini Petro Kostallari, had also been active in the [[Albanian National Revival]] as a publicist and teacher.

==Life==
Once that he finished the [[Qestorat]] seminary school under [[Koto Hoxhi]],&lt;ref name="Skendi133134"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=133–134.}}&lt;/ref&gt; he worked as a teacher in the villages of [[Kolonjë District]], where he taught [[Albanian language|Albanian]] in disguise and prepared a number of friends as future teachers of Albanian. In 1887 Luarasi and fellow teacher [[Thanas Sina]] took over the running of the [[Mësonjëtorja|Albanian school in Korçë]] from [[Pandeli Sotiri]] after his departure.&lt;ref name="Skendi135"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=135.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1887-1893 Luarasi opened in [[Ersekë]] and in some villages of the Kolonjë District Albanian language schools. Luarasi's founding and promotion of Albanian schools in the Kolonjë area brought him into conflict with Philaretos, the Greek archbishop of [[Kastoria]].&lt;ref name="Skendi137138"/&gt; In 1892 a circular letter was sent to the Kolonjë Orthodox Albanian population to dissuade ties between them and Luarasi with Philaretos referring to him as a "damned renegade" spreading "[[free masonry]] and [[Protestantism]]", while condemning his work with Albanian schooling and stating that the [[Albanian language]] "did not exist".&lt;ref name="Skendi137138"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|pp=137–138.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, he emigrated to the United States in the 1904 - 1908 period, where he was an active member of the Albanian National Movement and initiator of the patriotic associations ''Motherland Nostalgia'' ({{lang-sq|Malli i Mëmëdheut}})&lt;ref name="Skendi160"&gt;{{harvnb|Skendi|1967|p=160.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Pellasgian'' ({{lang-sq|Pellazgu}}). Luarasi also worked as a director and teacher of the first Albanian School of the Gjerazi sisters in [[Korçë]] and in 1909-1911 he worked as a director of the [[Negovani]] school, which had been founded by [[Papa Kristo Negovani]].

He also contributed to the organizations for the Liberation of Albania from the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Myzyri114and137"&gt;{{cite book|last=Myzyri|first=Hysni|title=The First National Albanian Schools 1887- July 1908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS6OPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22myzyri%22&amp;cd=2|year=1978|publisher=8 Nëntori|pages=114 and 137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bociurkiw397"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bociurkiw|first1=Bohdan R. |last2=Strong|first2=John W. |last3=Laux|first3=Jean K. |title=Religion and atheism in the U.S.S.R. and Eastern Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FK_aAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Petro+Nini+Luarasi&amp;dq=Petro+Nini+Luarasi&amp;cd=2|year=1975 |page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Islami274"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Islami|first1=Selim |last2=Buda |first2=Aleks |last3=Frashëri|first3=Kristo |title=Historia e Shqipërisë, Volume 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KGwKAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Petro+Nini+Luarasi&amp;dq=Petro+Nini+Luarasi&amp;cd=4|year=1967 |pages=274 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Skendi160213"&gt;{{cite book|last=Skendi|first=Stavro|title=The Albanian national awakening|year=1967|location=Princeton|publisher=Princeton University Press|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=8QPWCgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=The+Albanian+National+Awakening&amp;ots=zGjQbVyql8&amp;sig=xsmbL-yAAtc-ny3v0E4vN87JOBY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Philaretos%20Luarasi&amp;f=false|isbn=9781400847761|pages=160, 213.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Red87&gt;{{cite book|last=Redžepagić |first=Jašar |title=The Development of Education and of the School System of the Albanian Nation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SuMOAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=petro+nini+luarasi&amp;dq=petro+nini+luarasi&amp;lr=&amp;cd=16|year=1970  |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petro Nini Luarasi was one of the delegates of the [[Monastir Congress]] that sanctioned the creation of the Albanian alphabet in 1908. For his patriotic deeds, teaching of the Albanian language and social activism he was persecuted both by the [[Young Turks]] and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]]. He died poisoned by them on 17 August 1911.&lt;ref name="Bociurkiw397"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Islami274"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Red87/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fi55"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schwandner-Sievers |first1=Stephanie |last2=Fischer |first2=Bernd Jürgen |title=Albanian identities: myth and history |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RnDeHFOX8yIC&amp;pg=PA55 |year=2002|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-21570-6|pages=55 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He collaborated, published and was editor in chief with the following magazines:

*''Nations's Union'' ({{lang-sq|Bashkimi i kombit}}) (published in [[Monastir, Macedonia|Monastir]] during the 1909-1910 period), where he was editor-in-chief;

{{Nihongo foot|'''''Pokémon: Platinum Version'''''|ポケットモンスタープラチナ|Poketto Monsutā Purachina|"Pocket Monsters: Platinum"|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[role-playing video game]] developed by [[Game Freak]], published by [[The Pokémon Company]] and [[Nintendo]] for the [[Nintendo DS]] [[handheld game console]]. It is an enhanced version of [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']] and is part of the fourth generation of the ''[[Pokémon]]'' [[Pokémon (video game series)|series of video games]]. It was released on September 13, 2008, in Japan; March 22, 2009, in North America; May 14, 2009, in Australia and May 22, 2009, in Europe. The developers made ''Platinum'' with the intent of making it a stronger version of ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', which they described as the "ultimate" Pokémon titles.

In ''Platinum'', players control either a male or female child character and start off with one of three Pokémon — [[Turtwig]], [[Chimchar]], or [[Piplup]] — from [[Professor Rowan]]. The mascot Pokémon is [[Giratina]], who plays a central role in the game's plot. While it only had one form in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', it is given a new alternate form alongside a new area called the Distortion World, which features altered physics from the normal land of [[Pokémon universe#Sinnoh|Sinnoh]], where the game takes place. The gameplay stays true to traditional ''Pokémon'' mechanics. Players explore a large area, which ranges from mountains to bodies of water, grasslands, populated areas, and snowy expanses. Similar to previous titles, players have their Pokémon fight turn-based battles against other Pokémon.

''Pokémon Platinum'' has been met with generally positive reception, holding aggregate scores of 84 and 83.14% at [[Metacritic]] and [[GameRankings]], respectively. It was praised for being the best Pokémon game ever made and also praised for the additions and changes made to ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' by publications such as [[IGN]], ''[[Nintendo Power]]'', and ''[[GamePro]]'', although it has also been criticized for being too similar to them. IGN ranked it as the ninth best Nintendo DS game ever made, as well as nominating it as one of the best DS role-playing games of 2009. It was the fastest-selling game in Japan at the time, selling 7.06 million copies by March 31, 2010.&lt;ref name=mar2010&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2010/100507e.pdf#page=6|title=Financial Results Briefing for Fiscal Year Ended March 2010|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=2010-05-07| format=PDF|accessdate=2010-05-08|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{main article|Pokémon Diamond and Pearl#Gameplay}}
[[File:Pokemon Platinum battle.png|left|thumb|250px|A battle in ''Pokémon Platinum''. Players may have either one-on-one battles or two-on-two.]]
''Pokémon Platinum'' is a [[role-playing game]] with [[adventure game|adventure]] elements. Its basic mechanics are the same as those found in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', featuring two-dimensional gameplay. As with all ''Pokémon'' games for hand-held consoles (excluding generation 6 games, which is the first to have 3d gameplay), gameplay is in [[Grammatical person|third-person]] overhead perspective, and consists of three basic screens: a [[overworld|field map]], in which the player navigates the main character; a battle screen; and the menu, in which the player configures his or her party, items, or gameplay settings. The player begins the game with one Pokémon and can capture more using [[Poké Ball]]s. The player can also use his or her Pokémon to battle other Pokémon. When the player [[random encounter|encounters a wild Pokémon]] or is challenged by a trainer to a battle, the screen switches to a [[turn-based]] battle screen where the Pokémon fight. During battle, the player may [[Types of Pokémon moves|fight]], use an item, switch the active Pokémon, or flee (the last not an option in battles against trainers). All Pokémon have [[hit points]] (HP); when a Pokémon's HP is reduced to zero, it faints and cannot battle unless revived with a Pokémon skill or item such as Revive or Max Revive.

If the player's Pokémon defeats the opposing Pokémon (causes it to faint), it receives [[experience points]]. After accumulating enough experience points, it may [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level up]]; most Pokémon [[Pokémon evolution|evolve]] into a new species of Pokémon when they reach a certain level. Apart from battling, capturing Pokémon is the most important element of ''Pokémon'' gameplay. Although other trainers' Pokémon cannot be captured, the player may use a Poké Ball on a wild Pokémon during battle. A successful capture adds the Pokémon to the player's active party or stores it in the PC if the player already has the maximum of six Pokémon. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon and the strength of the Poké Ball used unless it is a Master Ball which has a 100% capture rate; the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture is. ''Platinum'' features largely the same Pokémon as in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', with some added and some missing. ''Platinum'' features the Pokétch, a wristwatch-like device, introduced in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. It features simple applications such as a calculator, map, counter, and drawing pad. ''Platinum'' also features the Underground mode, a mode where players dig for spheres and Fossils.

===New features===
''Platinum'' adds an area called the "Wi-Fi Plaza", an area that features several Pokémon species-themed mini-games and allows up to 20 players to be present in it. ''Platinum'' also introduces the Vs. Recorder, which allows players to record battles held in the [[Battle Frontier]] or on Wi-Fi. The GTS system, a system that allows players to trade anonymously on the Wi-Fi connection, returns in Platinum; one change to the GTS system allows players to be notified via email when a trade has commenced, though outside Japan, this feature has been reduced to being merely a message on the player's [[Wii]]. A variety of changes have been made to the appearance and availability of Pokémon; [[Giratina]], [[Shaymin]], and [[Rotom]] all have new forms, with Rotom having four new forms. The trios of [[Articuno]], [[Zapdos]], and [[Moltres]], along with the trio of [[Regice]], [[Regirock]], and [[Registeel]], have been added to the game as well. The game also adds the Battle Frontier, a feature first introduced in ''[[Pokémon Emerald]]''. ''Platinum''{{'}}s [[Pokémon Contest]]s play similarly to ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''{{'}}s; they feature three stages, awarding ribbons to Pokémon for having the best end result. Baked goods called Poffins can be made from berries and fed to Pokémon in order to improve certain traits, depending on the kind of Poffin made. In addition to compatibility with ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', ''Platinum'' offers compatibility with the [[Pokémon (video game series)#Third|Game Boy Advance ''Pokémon'' RPGs]]. Players can upload Pokémon from ''Platinum'' to the [[Wii]] games ''[[Pokémon Battle Revolution]]'' and ''[[My Pokémon Ranch]]'', though the latter is only compatible with ''Platinum'' in Japan.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} A significant addition is the Distortion World, which features distorted physics versus those in the standard game.

==Setting and plot==
{{see also|Pokémon Diamond and Pearl}}
[[File:Map of Hokkaido.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The [[Pokémon regions#Sinnoh|Sinnoh region]] is based on the Japanese island of [[Hokkaidō]].&lt;ref name="Countdown2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/774/774578p1.html|title=The Countdown to Diamond and Pearl, Part 2|first=Lucas M.|last=Thomas|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]

''Platinum'' is set in the fictional region of [[Sinnoh]], an island based on the Japanese island [[Hokkaidō]]. Like Hoenn and Alola, Sinnoh is not connected to any other region in the Pokémon universe. It is also characterized by large, snow-covered mountains (Mt. Coronet, part of a mountain range, divides Sinnoh in half). In this game, the starters are Grass-type Turtwig, Fire-type Chimchar, and Water-type Piplup. Unlike other regions, Sinnoh has a "northern" feel to it as it is the only region with permanent snow on the ground, and with routes with snow on the ground and active snowfall. In ''Platinum'', there is snow on the ground in other locations where it was not found in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', and the player characters and the player's rival are dressed for colder weather when compared with the designs from the original games. Sinnoh is also characterized by its waterways; it has three main lakes (Verity, Acuity, and Valor) that form a triangle. Unlike the [[Hoenn]] region, however, which is mostly water routes, only 30 percent of Sinnoh's landscape comprises waterways.&lt;ref name="Countdown2" /&gt; Underneath Sinnoh's surface is the Sinnoh Underground, a large maze of caves and tunnels where players can dig for rare items. ''Pokémon Platinum'', while keeping to the same plot as ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'' for the most part, introduces several new elements to it. Two characters are introduced—the first being Charon, a scientist in Team Galactic, and the other being a detective investigating Galactic under the codename "Looker". [[Giratina]] is also the focus of the plot, whereas [[Dialga]] and [[Palkia]] were the focuses of ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', respectively. However, the player can still obtain both Dialga ''and'' Palkia, whereas in Diamond and Pearl, the player could only catch Giratina and the respective game's mascot.

==Development==
[[File:Distortion World.png|right|thumb|250px|The Distortion World took inspiration from concepts such as [[antimatter]] and the [[mass-energy equivalence]].]]
''Pokémon Platinum'' was first announced on May 15, 2008, as a follow-up to [[Pokémon Diamond and Pearl|''Pokémon Diamond'' and ''Pearl'']].&lt;ref name="ignannounce"&gt;{{cite web|author= John Tanaka |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/874/874213p1.html |title=Pokemon Platinum Announced - Nintendo DS News at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is in the same vein as ''[[Pokémon Yellow]]'', ''[[Pokémon Crystal|Crystal]]'', and ''[[Pokémon Emerald|Emerald]]'', which are sequels to ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''{{'}}s predecessors [[Pokémon Red and Blue|''Red'' and ''Blue'']], [[Pokémon Gold and Silver|''Gold'' and ''Silver'']], and [[Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire|''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']] respectively. When trying to determine what content to change from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', game designer Takeshi Kawachimaru felt that the designers should focus on changing only the most important things so as to make sure that it was not too different from the original games. Game director [[Junichi Masuda]] commented that since they designed the original two games as the "ultimate ''Pokémon'' titles", they had to make ''Platinum'' even stronger than them.&lt;ref name="gsinterview"/&gt;

Giratina's design change was one of the first things revealed about ''Platinum''.&lt;ref name="ignannounce"/&gt; In designing the new form, they paid attention to details; the designer redrew Giratina several times, attempting to make it look different from its form in ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl''. They finalized its design as an "antimatter Pokémon". Masuda explained antimatter as well as [[Mass–energy equivalence|E=MC2]] to the developers. He also explained the "Reversed Mt. Fuji", which is what they call the reflection of [[Mt. Fuji]]. While Kawachimaru didn't understand it at first, he later incorporated them into the game. The Distortion World was based on these ideas, described as the "core concept" of the game. They also added the Wi-Fi Plaza and Battle Frontier modes to improve players' ability to share information with other players. An idea that the developers wanted to include was to allow players to communicate with family and friends more easily; the developers felt that the Battle Frontier realized this idea.&lt;ref name="gsinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/rpg/pokemonplatinum/preview_6205772.html |title=Pokemon Platinum Q&amp;A: Giratina, Anti-Matter, and E=MC2 - DS Previews at GameSpot |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2009-03-22 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers chose to call the game ''Platinum'' because of their observations that "diamond" has a "meaning of love", while pearl has a "meaning of happiness". They explained that they wanted to choose something that seems "beautiful", describing platinum as "different from a diamond, different from a gem, different from a pearl, different from something that nature creates, something [that] shines, something beautiful." They also created the story to be different from ''Diamond'' and ''Pearl'', commenting that they wanted to make [[Giratina]] seem "more fun, more interesting, cooler." They added Giratina's new area to make the story "more appealing".

The '''Predator''' (also known as '''Yautja''' or '''Hish-Qu-Ten''') is a fictional [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial species]] featured in the [[Predator (franchise)|''Predator'' science-fiction franchise]], characterized by its [[trophy hunting]] of other species for sport. First introduced in 1987 as the main [[antagonist]] of the film ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'', the Predator creatures returned in the sequels ''[[Predator 2]]'' (1990), ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'' (2010) and ''[[The Predator (film)|The Predator]]'' (2018) and the [[fictional crossover|crossover]] films  ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' (2004) and ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' (2007).

The Predator has been the subject of numerous novels, video games and comic books, both on their own and as part of the ''[[Alien vs. Predator]]'' crossover imprint. Although a definitive name for the species is not given in the films, the names Predators, Yautja,&lt;ref name="AVP:P"&gt;{{cite book|author=Perry, Steve|author2=Perry, Stephanie|last-author-amp=yes|title=Aliens vs Predator: Prey|date=1994|isbn = 0-553-56555-9|page=259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hish-qu-Ten&lt;ref name="P:FM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shirley|first=John|title=Predator: Forever Midnight|date=2006|isbn=1-59582-034-5|page=250 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been alternatively used in the expanded universe, suggesting that two unique "Predator-species" exist.{{or|date=November 2018}} Created by brothers [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim]] and [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]], the Predators are depicted as large, [[Sapience|sapient]] and [[sentient]] [[humanoid]] creatures who possess advanced technology, such as [[active camouflage]], [[directed-energy weapon]]s, and [[interstellar travel]]. Both the Yautja and the Hish-Qu-Ten compete for a chance to enter the ritual of becoming "Blooded," a rank given to predators that have killed prey that has been deemed worthy.

==Concept and creation==
===Design===
[[File:Old Predator Concepts.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Early Predator design concepts by [[Stan Winston]]]]
The Predator design is credited to special effects artist [[Stan Winston]]. While flying to Japan with ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'' director [[James Cameron]], Winston, who had been hired to design the Predator, was doing concept art on the flight. Cameron saw what he was drawing and said, "I always wanted to see something with [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]]." Winston then included them in his designs.&lt;ref name="Bleeds"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[John McTiernan]], [[Kevin Peter Hall]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Joel Silver]], [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]], [[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim Thomas]], [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]]|title=If It Bleeds We Can Kill It: The Making of 'Predator'|medium=[[Television program]]|publisher=[[AMC (TV network)|AMC]]|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stan Winston's studio created all of the physical effects for ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' and ''[[Predator 2]]'', creating the body suit for actor [[Kevin Peter Hall]] and the mechanical facial effects. The studio was hired after attempts to create a convincing monster (including [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] wearing a much different body suit) had failed. [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] recommended Winston after his experience working on ''[[The Terminator]]''.&lt;ref name="Bleeds"/&gt;

The Predator was originally designed with a long neck, a dog-like head and a single eye. This design was abandoned when it became apparent that the jungle locations would make shooting the complex design too difficult.&lt;ref name="Bleeds"/&gt; Originally, the studio contracted the makeup effects for the alien from [[Richard Edlund]]'s Boss Film Creature Shop. However, problems filming the alien in Mexico led the makeup effects responsibilities to be given to Stan Winston. According to former Boss Films make-up supervisor Steve Johnson, the makeup failed because of an impractical design by McTiernan that included 12-inch leg extensions that gave the Predator a [[digitigrade|backward bent]] [[satyr]]-leg. The design did not work in the jungle locations. After six weeks of shooting in the jungles of Palenque, Mexico, the production had to shut down so that Winston could make a new Predator. This took eight months and then filming resumed for five weeks, ending in February 1987.&lt;ref name="Makeup"&gt;{{cite news|author=Les Paul Robley|title=''Predator'': The Original Makeup|work=Volume 18 #1|publisher=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=December 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film portrayals===
[[Jean-Claude Van Damme]] was originally cast as the Predator; the idea was that the star's abilities in martial arts would make the Predator an agile, [[ninja]]-esque hunter. When compared to Schwarzenegger, [[Carl Weathers]], and [[Jesse Ventura]], actors known for their bodybuilding regimens, it became apparent a more physically imposing man was needed to make the creature appear threatening.&lt;ref name="Bleeds"/&gt; Eventually, Van Damme was removed from the film and replaced by actor and [[mime artistry|mime artist]] [[Kevin Peter Hall]].&lt;ref name="Bleeds"/&gt; Hall, standing at an imposing height of {{convert|7|ft|2|in|m}}, had just finished work as a [[Bigfoot|sasquatch]] in ''[[Harry and the Hendersons]]''.&lt;ref name="Bleeds"/&gt;

Hall played the Predator in the first and second movies. He was trained in the art of mime and used many tribal dance moves in his performance, such as during the fight between Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Predator at the end of the first movie. In ''[[Predator 2]]'', according to a "making of" featurette, [[Danny Glover]] suggested the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] to be the other Predators because Glover himself was a big fan. Hall persuaded some of the Lakers to play background Predators because they couldn't find anyone on short notice.&lt;ref name="P2"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim Thomas]], [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] (writers) and [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]] (director)|title=[[Predator 2]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall died not long after ''Predator 2'' was released in theaters.

In ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'', [[Welsh people|Welsh]] actor [[Ian Whyte (actor)|Ian Whyte]], standing at 7 feet 1 inch and a fan of the ''Predator'' comics and movies, took over as the man in the Predator suits, such as portraying the "Celtic" Predator during its fight with an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien warrior]].&lt;ref name="AvP"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Paul W.S. Anderson]] (writer/director)|title=[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte returned to portray the "Wolf" Predator in ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]''.&lt;ref name="AvP-R"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Shane Salerno]] (writer) [[Brothers Strause|Colin and Greg Strause]] (directors)|title=[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Predators (film)|Predators]]'', actors [[Brian Steele]] and Carey Jones both portrayed a new breed of Predator known as the "Black Super Predators,"&lt;ref name="P3"&gt;{{cite video|people=Michael Finch, Alex Litvak and [[Robert Rodriguez]] (writers) and [[Nimród Antal]] (director)|title=[[Predators (film)|Predators]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] / [[Troublemaker Studios]]|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have been dropping humans on their planet for many years to play a survival game against them.&lt;ref name="P3"/&gt; In a nod to the first film, [[Derek Mears]] played the Predator as the creature appeared in the original, dubbed the "Classic Predator."&lt;ref name=costume&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18830|title=Inside the Black Super "Predators" Costumes Are....|publisher=BD Horror News|date=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special and make-up effects===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
The Predator's blood was made from a combination of the liquid from [[glow stick]]s mixed with [[K-Y Jelly]]. The mixture loses its glow quickly, so new batches had to be quickly made between takes. The technique was used in all five films featuring the Predator.

The camouflage effect was designed by [[R/Greenberg Associates]], under the direction of [[Joel Hynek]]. The idea for the effect came in a dream one of the Thomas brothers (who wrote the film) had, in which there was a chrome man who was inside a reflective sphere. The man blended in, perfectly camouflaged, reflecting from all directions and only visible when in motion. The effect was created by repeating an image in a pattern of ripples in the shape of the Predator's body. It proved very effective and was a new way of presenting an "invisible man." Before there was digital rendering technology all of the camouflage was done optically using photo-chemical means, so that one would never get the same result twice from combining the same pieces of film.

After the original movies, Amalgamated Dynamics took over from Stan Winston Studio in creating the props for the Predators in the ''Alien vs. Predator'' film and a number of effects houses worked on the various other effects.

==Appearances in media==

===Film anthology===

====''Predator''====
{{main article|Predator (film)}}
First appearing in the 1987 film ''Predator'', the eponymous character lands in Earth via [[starship]] to "hunt" armed and dangerous human fighters. Having landed in a Central American jungle, the creature has already killed a handful of US Special Forces soldiers before beginning to hunt an elite paramilitary rescue team sent to rescue what they have been told are presidential [[cabinet ministers]] kidnapped by [[guerrilla]] forces. The Predator dispatches the team members one by one with its array of weaponry until Major "Dutch" ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]) is the last one alive. Dutch eventually confronts the creature, covering himself in mud to hide his heat signature from the Predator's [[Thermography|thermal imaging]], and setting up numerous [[booby trap]]s. Though he manages to disable the Predator's cloaking ability, the Predator manages to capture him, and then, in a display of [[Honor]], discards his mask and electronic weaponry before challenging Dutch to a final duel. Physically outmatched, Dutch eventually sets off one of his traps, which crushes and mortally wounds the creature. After being asked what he is by Dutch, the Predator simply mimics his question and sets off his self-destruct device before laughing maniacally, though Dutch manages to escape the explosion.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Jim Thomas (screenwriter)|Jim Thomas]], [[John Thomas (screenwriter)|John Thomas]] (writers) and [[John McTiernan]] (director)|title=[[Predator (film)|Predator]]|medium=[[DVD]]|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Predator 2''====
{{main article|Predator 2}}
Set in 1997, ten years after the events of the first film, the 1990 sequel follows a new Predator who sets his sights on Los Angeles due to its summer heat and drug wars between Jamaican and Colombian cartels, as well as the [[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D.]] attempting to fight both gangs (Promotional material for the film said this Predator was younger, and chose a densely populated urban area for a more ambitious hunt). After eliminating leaders from both gangs, the Predator begins actively targeting the L.A.P.D. officers attempting to investigate his handiwork, specifically Lieutenant Michael Harrigan ([[Danny Glover]]) and his three partners ([[Rubén Blades]], [[María Conchita Alonso]] and [[Bill Paxton]]). Special agent Peter Keyes ([[Gary Busey]]), purportedly sent by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] to investigate cartels, but actually leading the secretive Outworld Life Forms task force, attempts to capture the Predator alive for government study but he and most of his OWLF team are outsmarted and slaughtered by their quarry. Towards the end of the movie, the Predator is ultimately confronted by Harrigan in his own ship and killed when Harrigan uses one of his own weapons against him. The Predator's clan-mates de-cloak and carry away the dead Predator's body and give Harrigan a [[flintlock]] dating from 1715 as a sign of respect. The film also makes a reference to the ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'' films, as shown in the Predators' trophy room, which has a skull closely resembling that of an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]].&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt;

====''Alien vs. Predator''====
{{main article|Alien vs. Predator (film)}}
In 2004, a Predator ship arrives in Earth's orbit to draw humans to an ancient Predator training ground on [[Bouvet Island|Bouvetøya]], an island about a thousand miles north of [[Antarctica]]. A buried [[pyramid]] which gives off a "heat bloom" attracts humans led by Charles Bishop Weyland ([[Lance Henriksen]]), who unknowingly activates an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]] egg production line. Three Predator novitiates enter the structure, killing all humans in their way with the intention of hunting the newly formed alien warriors. Two Predators die in the ensuing battle, and the third (credited as Scar in the credits) allies himself with the lone surviving human, Alexa Woods ([[Sanaa Lathan]]) to battle the escaped Queen Alien. The Queen is defeated, but not before she fatally wounds the last Predator. The Predator ship hovering above the battleground uncloaks and the crew retrieves the fallen Predator. A Predator elder gives Alexa a spear as a sign of respect, and then departs. Once the Predator ship is in orbit, it is revealed that a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Chestburster|chestburster]] was in the Scar Predator's corpse, though this specimen has Predator mandibles.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt;

====''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem''====

Set immediately after the previous film, the [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Predalien|Predalien]] hybrid on board the Predator scout ship, which just separated from the mothership from the previous film, has grown to full adult size and sets about killing the Predators on board the ship, causing it to crash in [[Gunnison, Colorado]]. The last survivor activates a distress signal with a video of the Predalien, which is received by a [[veteran]] Predator (Wolf), who sets off towards Earth to "clean up" the infestation. When he arrives, the Predator tracks the Aliens into a section of the sewer below town. He removes evidence of their presence as he goes by using a corrosive blue liquid. He uses a laser net to try to contain the creatures, but the Aliens still manage to escape into the town above. The Predator fashions a plasma pistol from his remaining plasma caster, replacing one that was damaged while he hunted Aliens all across town (accidentally cutting the power to the town in the process) during a confrontation with human survivors. Later on, the Predator encounters the same human survivors again in the Alien Hive and loses his plasma pistol, with the last four humans taking it with them as they flee town in the hospital helicopter. The Predator then fights the Predalien singlehandedly, and the two mortally wound one another just as the United States military drops a tactical nuclear bomb on the town, incinerating both combatants as well as the few remaining humans in the city. The salvaged plasma pistol is then taken by [[United States Military]] officers to Ms. Yutani.&lt;ref name="AvP-R"/&gt;

{{main article|Predators (film)}}
In ''Predators'', it is revealed that there are two warring Predator tribes: one group uses quadrupedal hunting beasts and elaborate traps to hunt, and the other hunts traditionally. An international group of soldiers and dangerous criminals from different locations from Earth are dropped onto a forested planet used as a Predator game reserve. After numerous skirmishes resulting in the deaths of two Predators and all but two of the captured humans, the last Predator manages to kill another member of his kind from a rival tribe, but is defeated in combat by the human survivors. The survivors then head off to seek a way back to their home, just in time to witness more people be dropped.

====''The Predator'' (2018)====
{{Main article|The Predator (film)}}
In June 2014, Fox announced a sequel which [[Shane Black]] will direct and co-write with [[Fred Dekker]], and [[John Davis (producer)|John Davis]] will produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/predator-reboot-sequel-shane-black/|title=Exclusive: Shane Black Says His Predator Film Is a Sequel, Not a Reboot|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|work=Collider|date=June 25, 2014|accessdate=June 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing the existence of two Predator species, the film opens with a 'standard' Predator landing on Earth and being captured by a government research division known as 'Operation Stargazer', only for this Predator to escape to find missing parts of its armor that were taken by army sniper Captain Quinn MacKenna, who discovered the Predator's escape pod and was able to mail the items to himself before he was captured. When the armor is discovered by Quinn's autistic son Rory, Rory is able to translate the Predator language, just as MacKenna discovers that the Predator has escaped and is now hunting his son. Joining forces with Doctor Casey Bracket- an evolutionary biologist brought in to study the Predator- and a group of soldiers suffering from various PTSD symptoms that he was being escorted with, MacKenna is able to rescue his son, only to discover that the first Predator is being hunted by a larger alien of its own kind. The subsequent fighting results in the death of the first Predator, most of the Stargazer staff and the other soldiers in MacKenna's makeshift unit, but MacKenna, Rory and Casey are able to kill the giant Predator and retrieve the original alien's ship. Based on analysis of the ship, they determine that the Predators are adapting themselves with human DNA and intend to take Earth once humanity dies out through climate change, and the first Predator was a traitor who came to Earth with a cybernetic suit that would allow humanity to more easily stand up to the Predators.

===Expanded universe===
In the ''[[Alien vs. Predator#Books|Aliens vs. Predator]]'' novel series (based on the [[Dark Horse Comics]]) by [[David Bischoff]], [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve]] and [[Stephani Perry]], the Predators, known in the series as "yautja," are depicted as living in a [[matriarchal]] [[clan]]-based society bearing similarities to a pack mentality whose strongest and most skilled of the group lead. The Predators are portrayed as [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] [[mammals]]. The females are larger and stronger than males,&lt;ref name="sexualdimorphism"&gt;''Aliens vs Predator: Prey'' p. 24; ''"A warrior who would dare such would not be wise, for an insulted and angry Yautja female was not something even a not-too-wise male wanted to create. Assuming the warrior was armed and expert, it might almost be an even match, but Dachande would put his wager on the female. His most recent partner had tossed him across a room during the heat of their mating and that had been an accident..."'' p. 218 ''"Yautja females were bigger than males; it was apparently the reverse for oomans."..."It also explained why this warrior was smarter than most of the yautja he taught. Females of any species were usually smarter than the males."'', Steve &amp; Stephanie Perry&lt;/ref&gt; and sport more prominent mammary glands (like human females). Both genders give off a strong [[musk]] to signify aggression, and females can also emit it when in [[Estrous cycle|estrus]]. This musk can be detected by other Predators and [[Canidae|canids]], though it is imperceptible to humans. Predators in the Perry novels are not [[Monogamy|monogamous]], and it is common for veteran warriors to sire hundreds of offspring (known as sucklings) with multiple mates. It is also revealed that their blood has the capacity of partially neutralizing the acidity of Alien blood. Their [[religion]] is partially explored in the series, showing that they are [[Polytheism|polytheistic]], and that their equivalent of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] is the so-called "Black Warrior," who is seen as an eternal adversary who eventually wins all battles.&lt;ref name="AVP:P"/&gt;

[[File:Predator-feast.jpg|400 px|thumb|Predator veterans at a celebratory feast in ''[[Aliens Versus Predator (comics)|Aliens versus Predator: Chained to Life and Death]]'']]
Though female Predators are occasionally referred to in Steve and Stephani Perry's novel series, one does not make an  appearance until the comic book [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Aliens vs Predator: Deadliest of Species''. The female's design  contradicts the descriptions given in the Perry novel series, as it superficially shows little distinction from males.&lt;ref name="AVP:DS"&gt;{{cite book | last = Barreto | first = Edoardo | last2 = Claremont | first2 = Chris | last3 = Guice | first3 = Jackson | last4 = Beatty | first4 = John | last-author-amp = yes| title = Aliens vs Predator: Deadliest of Species| date = 1996 | isbn = 1-56971-184-4 | page = 320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Darkhorse/TopCow crossover ''MindHunter'', which pits the ''[[Witchblade]]'', ''[[Darkness (comics)|Darkness]]'', ''Aliens'', and ''Predator'' franchises against each other, depicts a female Predator in a manner closer to the Perry description.  It is very tall, has feminine hips, mammary glands, and a very muscular build, with different armor than the males.

In Randy Stradley's [[miniseries]] ''Aliens vs. Predator: War'', it is revealed through the narration of the character Machiko Noguchi that Predators were responsible for the spread of Aliens throughout the galaxy, though the Predators themselves deny this, stating that their large interplanetary distribution is due to simultaneous [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="AVP:W"&gt;{{cite book | author = Stradley, Randy|url= | title = Aliens vs Predator: War| date = 1996 | isbn = 1-56971-158-5 | page = 200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic series ''Predator'' and ''Aliens vs Predator: Three World War'' introduce a clan of Predators referred to as "Killers," who are enemies of mainstream Predators (here referred to as "Hunters") because of their tradition of training Aliens as attack animals rather than hunting them, as well as their desire for killing as opposed to honorable hunting. The character Machiko Noguchi notes in issue #1 of ''Three World War'' that "You have to understand the mindset of the Hunters, and the honor they place on facing a worthy opponent on an equal footing... a kill is the end result, but it's not the point of a hunt.... For the 'Killers,' that wasn't the case. They were all about the killing." They are first seen in the 2009 ''Predator'' series, where a number interfere in an East African civil war, coming into conflict with both humans and their Hunter counterparts. By the time of ''Three World War'' the Killers are assumed to have been wiped out by the Hunters, but some survive and begin attacking human colonies, forcing Noguchi to forge an alliance between humans and the Hunters in order to deal with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Aliens vs. Predator: Three World War'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference|writer=[[John Arcudi]]|penciller=[[Javier Saltares]]|title=[[Predator (comics)|Predator]]|issue=1|date=June 2009|publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In John Shirley's stand alone novel ''Predator: Forever Midnight'', Predators, now referred to as "Hish," are shown to possess a gland located between their neck and collarbone which secretes powerful hormones into their [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]] and which drives them to hyper-aggression. When this gland is over-stimulated, it sends the creatures into a frenzied rage, causing them to attempt killing any living thing in sight, including members of their own species. This "kill rage" can be contagious and spread from one Predator to another, driving them all to attack each other. The Predators as a species barely survived the wars provoked by their kill glands, and they have learned to control the gland's secretions with artificial hormone regulators.&lt;ref name="P:FM" /&gt;

In Ian Edginton and Alex Maleev's graphic novel ''Aliens vs. Predator: Eternal'' and the videogame ''Predator: Concrete Jungle'', Predator flesh and blood, if consumed, is shown to have the capacity of greatly lengthening a human's lifespan.

In the first-person shooting video game ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]'', Predator appears as a hidden killstreak on the multiplayer map "Ruins" from the Devastation map pack. The player can play as Predator for a brief period by completing a Field Order and obtaining a care package. Predator is also a playable guest character via downloadable content in the fighting game ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'', opposite an [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Alien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/20/predator-dlc-character-outed-for-mortal-kombat-x|title=Predator DLC Character Outed for Mortal Kombat X|last=Martin|first=Michael|work=IGN|date=2015-03-19|accessdate=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the tactical shooting video game ''[[Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Wildlands]]'', a live event titled "The Hunt" was released on December 14, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/ghost-recon-wildlands-teases-predator-starring-special-event|title= Ghost Recon Wildlands details Predator Crossover event|last=Donnely|first=Joe|work=PC Gamer|date=2017-12-13|accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this event, players may take part in a bonus campaign mission in the Caimanes district to battle the Predator, with the event lasting until January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/14-12-2017-ghost-recon-wildlands-predator-event-the-hunt-start-date-end-date-mode-details-trailer-everything-we-know|title= Ghost Recon Wildlands Predator Event Start Date, End Date, Mode Details, Trailer- Everything we know|last=Orry|first=Tom|work= US Gamer|date=2017-12-14|accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predators are physically distinguished from humans by their greater height, [[arthropod]]-like [[Mandible (arthropod)|mandibles]] and long, hair-like appendages on their heads that are set into their skulls (popularly perceived as "[[dreadlocks]]"). Their bodies are resilient to damage, capable of recovering from multiple [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot wounds]]&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; and [[radiation]] doses that would prove fatal to humans.&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt; Their wounds do however require medical attention and they incorporate a portable surgical kit in their armor for this purpose. They are also capable of enduring excruciating pain. Predators are much stronger than humans, having been portrayed as being easily capable of outmatching a conditioned adult human male&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; and shattering solid concrete with their bare hands. They are also skilled climbers, and will readily move through trees&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; or across rooftops&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt; in pursuit of prey. Though capable of surviving exposure in Antarctic temperatures for an extended period of time,&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; it is implied that Predators have a preference for hot equatorial climates, and thus making them [[ectotherm]]s.&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Their blood is luminescent phosphor green in color. Their vision operates mainly in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum; they can easily detect heat differentials in their surroundings but are unable to easily distinguish among objects of the same relative temperature.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; A Predator's bio-mask increases its ability to see in a variety of spectra, ranging from the low infrared to the high ultraviolet, and also filters the ambient heat from the area, allowing them to see things with greater clarity and detail.&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt; While they are capable of breathing Earth's atmosphere,&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; the creature in ''Predator 2'' is seen using a breathing mask after losing his helmet (Although it should be noted that this Predator had just been shot multiple times and may have therefore not been operating at his full potential. A second possibility is that it was used to filter out impurities in the air - exhaust and such - which would not be found in more natural environments). Their dietary habits are also mentioned in ''Predator 2'', where it is revealed that the creature regularly visits a slaughterhouse every two days to feed on the stored meat there.&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt;

Throughout their film appearances, Predators have undergone numerous design variations. In ''Predator 2'', the main Predator was designed to look more urban and [[Hip (slang)|hip]] than its predecessor. Design changes included tribal ornamentation on the forehead, which was made steeper and shallower, brighter skin coloration and a greater number of fangs.&lt;ref name="Winston"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jody| last = Duncan | author2 = James Cameron | last-author-amp = yes| title = The Winston Effect: The Art and History of Stan Winston Studio | date = 2007 | isbn = 1-84576-150-2 | page = 336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This Predator was made less reliant on his plasma caster, and more cunning with the use of nets, spears and bladed weaponry. In ''Alien vs. Predator'', the appearance of the Predators was redesigned to make them seem more heroic. Redesigns included a reduction in head and waist size, broader shoulders, a more muscular physique, [[piranha]]-like teeth on the upper jaw, and dryer and less clammy skin to further differentiate them from the Aliens.&lt;ref name="Creature FX"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gillis, Alec | author2 = Woodruff, Tom | last-author-amp = yes| title = AVP: Alien vs Predator: The Creature Effects of ADI| date = 2004| isbn = 1-84576-004-2| page = 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'', the Predator was returned to the sleeker design concept prior to ''Alien vs. Predator''.&lt;ref name="Monstershop"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alec| last = Gillis | author2 = Tom Woodruff Jr | last-author-amp = yes| title = Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&amp;nbsp;— Inside the Monster Shop | date = 2008 | isbn = 1-84576-909-0 | page = 128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the so-called "Black Super Predators" in ''Predators'', the designers used the differences between a [[cassette tape]] and an [[iPod]] as an analogy in differentiating the new Predators from the classic. The Super Predators were designed as leaner and taller than the "classic" Predator design, and they have longer faces, tighter armor, and more swept back dreadlocks.&lt;ref name="ign"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/108/1088049p1.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509090759/http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/108/1088049p1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-05-09 |title=''Meet the Hunters of Predators'', IGN Movies |publisher=Uk.movies.ign.com |date=2010-05-06 |accessdate=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture and history===
{| class="toccolours" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;" cellspacing="5"
| style="text-align: left;" | ''"The Predator society builds sophisticated spaceships, yet they should not look as sleek and hi-tech as a ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Imperial stormtrooper|stormtrooper]]. They are a tribal culture, yet their look should not be as primitive as the [[Orc (Middle-earth)|orcs]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]]''. They are also a warrior culture, so the ornate cannot conflict with the practical."''
|-
| style="text-align: right;" |&amp;nbsp;— [[Alec Gillis]] on Predator designs.&lt;ref name="Creature FX"/&gt;
|}

Predator culture revolves around the hunting and stalking of dangerous lifeforms. After making a kill, Predators typically [[Flaying|skin]] or [[Decapitation|decapitate]] the carcass, converting it into a [[trophy]]. If immobilized or at the brink of death, a hunter will activate the mass-explosive self-destruct-mechanism in his wristband, honorably erasing any trace of its presence to its prey.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; It is often alluded to that the reason Predators hunt is not for sustenance or elimination of threats, but as sportsmanship or [[rite of passage]], as they will normally only attack life forms that have the ability to provide them with a challenge. In ''Predators'', it is revealed that there are at least two different Predator tribes, which are engaged in a long lasting [[blood feud]]. The film also introduced a pack of spined, quadrupedal beasts used as [[flushing dog]]s by the "Super Predators," Creature designer [[Gregory Nicotero]] used [[hyena]]s as a basis for the creature's physique and the spines were added later by Chris Olivia.&lt;ref name="ign"/&gt;

Predators made contact with early human civilizations such as the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians, the [[Khmer Empire]], and [[Aztecs]], as well as a fictitious culture inhabiting what is now [[Bouvetøya]].&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; Upon arriving on Earth, the Predators were worshipped as gods by humans, and they taught many of the civilizations how to build [[pyramids]] (an explanation as to why many of these different ancient societies had distinctly similar cultures and architecture), but in return expected sacrifices of humans for use as hosts for huntable Xenomorphs (Aliens) – the ultimate prey for initiates. The Predators returned to Bouvetøya every century to consummate the bargain, until at one point in the ritual, the Xenomorphs spread out of control, resulting in the Predators detonating a bomb that obliterated the entire civilization.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; Relations between humans and Predators deteriorated from that time on; the Predators then viewed humans as little more than another quarry to hunt.

Predators feature prominently in the folklore of certain cultures; some Latin American people refer to the species as ''"El Diablo que hace trofeos de los hombres"'' (Spanish for "The Demon who makes trophies of men"),&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; and [[Jamaica]]n superstition identifies Predators as demons from the spirit world.&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt; When hunting humans, Predators normally avoid certain individuals such as children and some adults if they are unarmed, though they will spare armed ones if they happen to be [[pregnant]]&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt; or sickly unless they are attacked by them.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; A human who has managed to kill a Predator or a Xenomorph in single combat&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt; or has fought alongside a Predator is usually spared by the deceased hunter's comrades and given a gift (often a rare or exotic weapon) as a sign of respect.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt;

A learner's first successful Alien hunt is completed with the marking of his helmet and forehead with the acidic blood of his kill.&lt;ref name="AvP"/&gt; The hunter generally operates alone. Even when hunters appear in groups, they rarely perform anything that resembles teamwork. Predators use [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)#Queen|Aliens]] as prey, creating artificial gaming reserves by keeping Queens and even Facehuggers in captivity.&lt;ref name="AvP" /&gt; It is shown in a brief scene in ''Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem'' that Predators have had prior contact with a race of creatures resembling the "Space Jockey" in the film ''Alien''. This is confirmed in the film's DVD commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people = Strause, Colin and Greg (Directors)|date = 2008|title = [[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]|format = DVD commentary|publisher = [[20th Century Fox]]|location = [[Beverly Hills, California]]|time = 0:02:45|quote = This is the trophy room. I actually had a lot of fun there. If you look up on the right, there's actually the space jockey...I think that's a cousin of the Jockey that was in Ridley's movie. A second cousin, I think.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, in the film ''Predators'', when the group of main protagonists enters the Predators' camp, there is a brief view of an Alien skull on the ground (as well as the lower jaw of an Alien on the helmet of the Berserker Predator).

===Language===
The script of the Predators is expressed in the films and other media through written patterns of dashes. These written symbols appear on the creatures' gauntlet displays, their helmets, architecture, and many other surfaces. The most common vocalizations of the Predators consists of a series of clicks, roars, snarls, and growls which are consisted of recorded vocalizations of animals such as lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars, cougars, black bears, grizzly bears, alligators, camels, and elephants. Predators will mimic human language on occasion, and have been shown to use their helmets to understand and speak human languages.&lt;ref name="P2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Author [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]] designed a [[constructed language]] set for the [[Aliens vs. Predator (novel series)|''Aliens vs. Predator'' novel series]].&lt;ref name="AVP:P"/&gt;

On 17 November 1985, 2000 residents from Mlungisi township in [[Queenstown, Eastern Cape]], gathered in Nonzwakazi Methodist Church to hear back from the Local Residents Association, who, in early November, had met with the Department of Education and Training, the Queenstown municipality, the Eastern Cape Development Board, and the Queenstown Chamber of Commerce to discuss the end of the consumer boycott. The meeting was short-lived as members of the Queenstown branch of the South African Police stormed into the meeting and opened fire on the residents. In the ensuing conflict between police and residents, 14 people were shot dead and 22 were injured. This incident is known as the 1985 Queenstown Massacre.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre1"&gt;{{cite web| title= Queenstown massacre: November 1985 | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume3/chapter2/subsection18.htm| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawe | first= Ayabonga | title= Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre | publisher=Daily Maverick| url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-19-your-bullets-will-not-stop-us-a-recollection-of-the-1985-queenstown-massacre/#.WgNfDluCzct | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

There had been no major political conflicts in Queenstown and the surrounding areas from the 1960s until the mid-1970s except for the forced removals and the incorporation of areas into the neighbouring [[Ciskei]] and [[Transkei]] homelands.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre1"&gt;{{cite web| title= Queenstown massacre: November 1985 | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume3/chapter2/subsection18.htm| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, the [[South Africa]]n apartheid government led by [[PW Botha]] implemented system reforms aimed at creating divisions, and thus weakening the resistance of the people. One of these was by building a buffer middle class. Buffer middle class areas meant that infrastructural development was introduced in selective black townships. Some residents had better facilities than others, which created resentment between them. Botha's reform saw the creation of local black councils which fell under the national, white-run state administration (the "Bantu Administration Board"), which would continue to control the power and resources available to the township authorities.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawe | first= Ayabonga | title= Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre | publisher=Daily Maverick| url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-19-your-bullets-will-not-stop-us-a-recollection-of-the-1985-queenstown-massacre/#.WgNfDluCzct | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The homes of people who supported and benefited from Botha's reforms, government buildings and beer halls, which were sponsored by the government, were attacked. At the same time organisations such as the newly formed [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]] were applying pressure on the government through civic associations.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre3"&gt;{{cite web| title= Against Botha's Deal | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://www.saha.org.za/udf/bothas_deal.htm| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Events such as the [[Langa Massacre]] in [[Uitenhage]], the consumer boycott in [[Port Elizabeth]], the killing of [[The Cradock Four]] and the shootings in [[Aliwal North]] created an atmosphere of unrest in the [[Eastern Cape]] townships.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre1"&gt;{{cite web| title= Queenstown massacre: November 1985 | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume3/chapter2/subsection18.htm| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mlungisi township, Queenstown, the major grievances of the people were household evictions and the lack of a basic service infrastructure. In an article in the Daily Maverick of 19 November 2015 titled "Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre" Mlungisi community resident Ntombizodwa Martha Kamati: "The main matters were absence of toilets, the sharing of public toilets. This was a major issue which made people to be annoyed. And there was this lodger's permit that people disliked, because you would be arrested [at] five-o-clock in the morning by the police, and then they would move with you in their van up and down, taking people from all over the location until it was at eight when they opened their office."&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawe | first= Ayabonga | title= Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre | publisher=Daily Maverick| url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-19-your-bullets-will-not-stop-us-a-recollection-of-the-1985-queenstown-massacre/#.WgNfDluCzct | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To voice out their grievances, the community of Mlungisi and surrounding areas, such as Ezibeleni and Whittlesea, under the influence of the [[United Democratic Front (South Africa)|United Democratic Front]], organised a consumer boycott, which began in August 1985, wherein they placed pressure on the local business community. As part of the consumer boycott, black communities around Queenstown stopped buying from most white businesses in the area. Only white businesses that were seen as progressive received support.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawe | first= Ayabonga | title= Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre | publisher=Daily Maverick| url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-19-your-bullets-will-not-stop-us-a-recollection-of-the-1985-queenstown-massacre/#.WgNfDluCzct | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tension between the coloured and [[African people|African]] communities followed the enforcement of the consumer boycott and at least one coloured man was necklaced (burnt with a tyre around his neck). This led to the formation of a coloured vigilante group, supported by the local SAP and SADF, which attacked the black people in Mlungisi. Black schools were also out on boycott since the assassination of [[The Cradock Four]] in June.

In September, the brother of a suspected apartheid informer was necklaced in Queenstown's Mlungisi township.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre1"&gt;{{cite web| title= Queenstown massacre: November 1985 | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume3/chapter2/subsection18.htm| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early November 1985, the Local Residents Association, the Department of Education and Training, the Queenstown municipality, the East Cape Development Board, and the Queenstown Chamber of Commerce held a meeting with the aim of ending the boycott.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawe | first= Ayabonga | title= Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre | publisher=Daily Maverick| url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-19-your-bullets-will-not-stop-us-a-recollection-of-the-1985-queenstown-massacre/#.WgNfDluCzct | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Massacre==

2000 people gathered at Nonzwakazi Methodist Church in Mlungisi to get feedback on the negotiations from Local Residence Association on 17 November 1985.

Narrating the events of the day in the article titled "Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre" in "The Daily Maverick" of 19 November 2015, Daniel Lolwana, Chairperson of the Residents Association who was addressing the meeting, said: "I noticed an old man, Lizo Ngcana, being dragged inside, bleeding. And then he fell just where we were standing, it was right in front of the pulpit. Then, as I said there was pandemonium, the hall was filled with teargas and there was shooting all over. You could hear the shots. Now, because I worried about this man, when the casspirs from this side shifted over to the side of the Moravian Church, I ran quickly to the second house there to utilise a telephone." &lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre2"&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawe | first= Ayabonga | title= Your bullets will not stop us: A recollection of the 1985 Queenstown massacre | publisher=Daily Maverick| url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/opinionista/2015-11-19-your-bullets-will-not-stop-us-a-recollection-of-the-1985-queenstown-massacre/#.WgNfDluCzct | accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

14 people lost their lives and 22 were wounded as a result of being shot with live ammunition by the police. On 13 December, all the victims of the massacre were buried at a mass funeral in Mlungisi township.

==Aftermath==
In response to questions in parliament over a year later, the then Minister of Justice, Mr [[Kobie Coetzee]], said that an inquest into nine deaths from that incident had found that nobody was criminally liable. In 1996, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] found the SADF and SAP guilty and accountable for the death of 14 people at Nonzwakazi Methodist Church in Mlungisi township.&lt;ref name="QueenstownMassacre1"&gt;{{cite web| title= Queenstown massacre: November 1985 | publisher= South African History Online| url=http://sabctrc.saha.org.za/reports/volume3/chapter2/subsection18.htm| accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13773">{{Humanism}}
'''Religious humanism''' is an integration of [[humanism|humanist ethical philosophy]] with [[Church (congregation)|congregational]] but non-theistic [[ritual]]s and community activity which center on [[human]] needs, interests, and abilities. Self-described religious humanists differ from [[secular humanism|secular humanists]] mainly in that they regard the humanist [[life stance]] as their religion and organise using a congregational model. Religious humanism is a classic example of a [[nontheistic religion]].

Religious humanists typically organise in the 21st century under the umbrella of [[Ethical Culture]] or Ethical Humanism. It remains largely a United States phenomenon; a British ethical culture movement was briefly highly active in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but by the 1960s had largely abandoned its "religious" trappings, and asserted humanism less as a religious identity and more as a useful label to describe rational and non-religious attitudes to morality and ethics.  Ethical Culture and religious humanism groups first formed in the United States from former [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] ministers who, not believing in god, sought to build a secular religion influenced on the thinking of French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]].

==Origins==
In the late 20th century the Humanist movement that affirms the dignity and worth of all people came into conflict with conservative [[Christian]] groups in the United States. "[[Secular humanism]]" has become the most popular form of organized Humanism.  

===French Revolution===
The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was an atheist religion devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=October 31, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a [[Temple to Reason]] and for a time [[Replicas of the Statue of Liberty|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzbobUhvpf4C&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=temple%20of%20reason%20notre%20dame%20baumer&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=temple%20of%20reason%20notre%20dame%20baumer&amp;f=false|title=The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition|last=Herrick|first=James A.|date=2004-12-02|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=|isbn=9780830832798|location=|pages=75-76|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivism===
In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=June 25, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Auguste Comte was a student and secretary for [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon]], the Father of French Socialism. Auguste Comte coined the term "altruism".

===Humanistic Religious Association===
One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organizations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt; This early group was democratically organized, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.

===Ethical Culture===
The [[Ethical Culture]] movement was founded in 1876. The movement's founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]], a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would strip away the accumulated unscientific dogmas of traditional religions while retaining and elevating the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Adler believed that traditional religions would ultimately prove to be incompatible with a scientific worldview. He felt that the vital aspects of religion should not be allowed to fall by the wayside. Religions provided vital functions in encouraging good works. And religions taught important truths about the world, albeit these truths were expressed through metaphors that were not always suited to modern understandings of the world. For example, monotheistic religions were based on a metaphor of an authoritarian monarchy, whereas democratic relationships were now understood to be the ideal.

Initially, Ethical Culture involved little in the way of ceremony and ritual. Rather, Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Some [[Ethical Society|Ethical Societies]] have subsequently added a degree of [[ritual]] as a means of marking special times or providing a tangible reminder of humanistic ideals.

===United States===
Before the term "humanism" was ever coined or even thought of being integrated into religion it had existed in America in at least an ideological sense for a very long time. Groups like the [[Free Religious Association]] (FRA) which was formed in 1867 and other less radical groups mainly consisting of extreme forms of early American [[Protestants]] such as the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Quakers]] had existed from the very first landings of the [[Europe]]ans in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. In 1915, a Positivist defined the term "humanism" in a magazine for the British Ethical Societies. Another Unitarian Minister [[John H. Dietrich]] read the magazine and adopted the term to describe his own religion.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt; Dietrich is considered by some to be the "Father of Religious Humanism" (Olds 1996) particularly for his sermons while serving the First Unitarian Society of Minneapolis.

In 1929 [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the [[First Humanist Society of New York]] whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s Potter was a well known advocate of women’s rights, access to birth control, "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.

A Humanist Manifesto, also known as [[Humanist Manifesto I]] to distinguish it from later [[Humanist Manifesto]]s, was written in 1933 primarily by [[Raymond Bragg]] and was published with thirty-four signatories. Unlike the later ones, the first manifesto talked of a new "[[religion]]", and referred to humanism as a religious movement meant to transcend and replace previous, deity-based religions. However, it is careful not to outline a [[creed]] or [[dogma]]. The document outlines a fifteen-point belief system, which, in addition to a secular outlook, opposes "acquisitive and profit-motivated society" and outlines a worldwide egalitarian society based on voluntary mutual cooperation. Bragg and eleven signatories were [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] ministers.

The [[Fellowship of Humanity]] was founded in 1935 by Reverend A. D. Faupel as one of a handful of "humanist churches" seeded in the early 20th century as part of the American Religious Humanism movement. It was the only such organization to survive into the 21st century and is the first and oldest affiliate of the [[American Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=May 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Webster's Third New International Unabridged Dictionary defined religious humanism as "A modern American movement composed chiefly of non-theistic humanists and humanist churches and dedicated to achieving the ethical goals of religion without beliefs and rites resting upon superstition."

American Religious Humanist organizations that have survived into the 21st century include the HUUmanists, formerly the Friends of Religious Humanism, and the Humanist Society, formerly the Humanist Society of Friends.

A large percentage of members (as many as half or more) of [[Unitarian Universalist]] congregations have identified themselves as humanists when surveys have been conducted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/sites/live-new.uua.org/files/documents/coa/engagingourtheodiversity.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The UU Humanist Association &lt;ref&gt;http://www.huumanists.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is the main representation of religious humanism within the Unitarian Universalist Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uua.org/aboutus/affiliates/search.php?category=Other%20UU%20Organizations&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Religious humanist associations have not been as successful in the United Kingdom as in the United States. The humanist movement in the UK began as a religious "ethical movement" in the 19th century, with the South Place Religious Society in London being the largest "ethical church". The remaining UK ethical societies merged in the 1890s to become the Union of Ethical Societies, which was founded and presided over by [[Stanton Coit]]. Following Coit's tenure, both organisations consciously moved away from the congregational model, becoming [[Conway Hall|Conway Hall Ethical Society]] and the [[British Humanist Association]] respectively. 

In 2013, the [[Sunday Assembly]] movement was founded in London as a "godless congregation" which was described in some places as "church for atheists", filling the niche vacated by other humanist groups.

===Scandinavia===
In the Scandinavian countries, the popular Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]'s positivist work ''Etik'' influenced the development of humanist societies, which in Sweden and Norway styled themselves as "human-ethical associations", alike the Ethical Humanists in America and formerly in Britain. In modern times, the religious humanist/secular humanist distinction has fallen away; Norway, [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] is the name of Norway's humanist association, but it is fully a part of the broader international humanist community, and uses both "humanettik" and "humanisme" in describing its philosophy. In Sweden, the Human-Ethical Association rebranded as [[Humanisterna]] in 1999, dropping the congregational model as the British had done in the 1960s.

===Belgium===
{{see|organized secularism}}
Belgium is broadly divided between its [[Flemish Community]] ([[Flanders]]) and [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking community]] ([[Wallonia]]). In French Belgium, as in France, the secular movement is more concerned with national political organising and manifests nationally as the ''Centre d’Action Laïque''. In Flemish Belgium, the group ''deMens.nu'' (Humanity Now) brings together local humanist associations who engage in a broader range of activities, including community-based and congregational-style meetings. As with Humanists UK in the UK, ''deMens.nu'' grew from the union of local liberal or freethought associations.

==Discussion of terminology==
People writing about religious humanism are careful to distinguish religious humanism from [[Jewish humanism]] ([[secular Jew]]s who are humanists), [[Christian humanism]] (religious Christians asserting the humanitarian aspects of their religion), and [[secular humanism]] (often simply "humanism", a non-religious approach to life), but confusion inevitably arises.&lt;ref name="Murry_p1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Murry |first=William |title=Reason and Reverence: Religious Humanism for the 21st Century |year=2007 |publisher=Skinner House Books |location=Boston |isbn=1-55896-518-1 | chapter=Why I Am a Religious Humanist | pages=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another such term is [[Humanistic Buddhism]], which refers to an atheistic practice of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] rituals.

Some experts on humanism, including [[Andrew Copson]], argue that there have been deliberate attempts to "muddy the conceptual water... of a complicatedly imprecise philosophical term" by adding the slew of qualifying adjectives to humanism. He points out that the term "Christian humanism" was first used in 1944, and argues that it has largely been used by Christians "as a way of co‐opting the (to them) amenable aspects of humanism for their religion&lt;ref&gt;"What is Humanism?" in [[Andrew Copson|Copson, Andrew]] and [[AC Grayling|Grayling, Anthony]] (eds.), ''The Wiley Blackwell Handbook of Humanism'' (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ryan Rhodes''' (born 20 November 1976) is a British former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1995 to 2012. He held the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] [[light-middleweight]] title twice, from 1996 to 1997 and in 2008, and the [[European Boxing Union|European]] light-middleweight title from 2009 to 2010. Additionally he challenged for the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[middleweight]] title in 1997, and the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] light-middleweight title in 2011.

==Professional career==
Rhodes took up boxing at a young age, training at [[Brendan Ingle]]'s gym in the [[Wincobank]] district of Sheffield. At the age of 20, he defeated another Sheffield boxer Paul "Silky" Jones with a [[Knockout#Technical knockout|technical knock out]] in the eighth round to become the youngest post-war holder of the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] title. He went on to win the belt outright in a record time of 90 days with wins over Peter Waudby and [[Del Bryan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/more_sport/boxing/article7133679.ece "Boxing from spice boy to man of the world"], timesonline.co.uk {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 December 1997, Rhodes stepped up a weight division to middleweight to challenge the Canadian [[Otis Grant]] for the vacant [[WBO]] title but was defeated by a unanimous decision.

On 18 April 2008, Rhodes knocked out [[Gary Woolcombe]] 37 seconds into the 9th round to regain the British light middleweight title, 11 years after he first won it. He defended his title for the first time as the main event on the [[Hayemaker Promotions]] boxing show in Sheffield. His opponent was [[Jamie Coyle]], whom he defeated by a unanimous decision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishboxing.net/news_3826-Bravery-and-brutality-in-Sheffield.html British Boxing.net:Bravery and Brutality in Sheffield] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923194702/http://www.britishboxing.net/news_3826-Bravery-and-brutality-in-Sheffield.html |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then he has defeated [[Vincent Vuma]] of [[South Africa]] to win the WBC International light middleweight title and in doing so obtained a ranking in the top ten in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondsout.com/interviews/index.cfm?ccs=528&amp;cs=38696 "Rhodes On Verge Of Third World Title Shot"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes was due to defend his British light middleweight title against the Londoner [[Anthony Small]] at the [[Echo Arena]] in [[Liverpool]] on 28 March 2008, but withdrew because of an illness during his training camp.

He defeated [[Jamie Moore (boxer)|Jamie Moore]] in the seventh round of their [[European Boxing Union|European]] title fight on 23 October 2009. He defended the title again on 21 May 2010 at home against the Italian [[Luca Messi]], with a technical knock out in the sixth round.

Rhodes lost his WBC light middleweight challenge bout against [[Canelo Álvarez]] with a technical knockout in the twelfth round on 18 June 2011 in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12040_6832090,00.html "Rhodes eyes WBC title"], Sky Sports&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes announced his retirement from professional boxing on 4 September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Dom Howson, [http://www.thestar.co.uk/sport/sheffield-s-proud-ryan-rhodes-regret-as-he-finally-hangs-up-his-gloves-1-4896449 "Sheffield’s proud Ryan Rhodes regret as he finally hangs up his gloves"], ''Sheffield Star'', 5 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4893">[[Image:sarah-bibber.jpg|thumb|right|1692 deposition of Sarah Bibber (Viber) against [[Susannah Martin]]]]

'''Sarah Bibber''' (or '''Vibber or Vibert'''; born c. 1656 – year of death unknown) was involved in the infamous [[Salem witch trials]] in 1692, both as an accuser of witchcraft, as well as being accused of being a witch herself.

Bibber was one of the "afflicted" who testified against the accused in the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. She is mentioned in indictments, gave depositions and testified under oath against 15 people accused of witchcraft. These were [[Mary Bradbury]], [[George Burroughs]], [[Giles Corey]], [[Mary Easty]], [[Sarah Good]], [[Dorcas Hoar]], [[Elizabeth How]], [[George Jacobs, Sr.]], [[Susannah Martin]], [[Rebecca Nurse]], [[Alice Parker (Salem)|Alice Parker]], [[John Proctor (convicted witch)|John Proctor]], [[Ann Pudeator]], [[Job Tookey]] and [[John Willard]]. She also was mentioned in the indictment of Mary Witheridge.&lt;ref name=vib&gt;[http://www.vibertfamily.com/sarahbibber.htm Sarah Bibber profile], VibertFamily.com; accessed June 4, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, including John and Lydia Porter, Joseph Fowler, Thomas and Mary Jacobs, Richard Walker and Sarah Nurse testified against Bibber, claiming that she was involved in witchcraft.&lt;ref name=vib/&gt; In 1692 Bibber's age was given as being about 36 years old. She was married to John Bibber and they had a 4-year-old child. Various court documents list their town of residence as [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] or [[Wenham, Massachusetts|Wenham]]. Her surname is variously given in the documents as Bibber, Biber and Vibber.

Sarah Bibber v. Sarah Good:

{{quote|The Deposition of Sarah Bibber aged about 36 years who testified and said that since I have been afflicted I have often seen the Apparition of Sarah Good but she did not hurt me tell the 2 day of May 1692 though I saw her Apparition most grievously torture Mercy Lewes &amp; Jon. Indian at Salem. on the 11th April 1692: but on the 2: may 1692 the Apparition of Sarah good did most grievously torment me by pressing my breath almost out of my body and also she did immediately afflict my child by pinching of it that I could hardly hold it and my husband seeing of it took hold of the Child but it cried out and twisted so dreadfully by reason of the torture that the Apparition of Sarah good did afflict it with all that it got out of its fathers arms to: also several times since the Apparition of Sarah Good has most grievously tormented me by beating and pinching me and almost Choking me to death and pricking me with pins after a most dreadful manner

Sarah Bibber owned this her testimony to be the truth one the oath she had taken: be fore us the Jurors for Inquest: this: 28dy of June 1692

Sworn. in Court June 29th 1692.

And further Adds. that she very believes upon her Oath that Sarah Good had bewitched her&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-night.net/witches/record.htm Records of the Trial and Execution of Sarah Good, 1692]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bibber was described by those who testified against her as a "loose-tongued creature, addicted to fits," a woman who quarreled often with her husband when she would call him "very bad names," would have "strange fits when she was crossed," a woman of turbulent spirit and "double tongued." She was observed to be "very idle in her calling" and given to gossiping and making mischief among her neighbors.&lt;ref name=vib/&gt;

The testimony of Thomas and Mary Jacobs against Bibber stated that

&lt;/blockquote&gt;… Bibber would be very often speaking against one and another very obscenely and those things that were false and wishing very bad wishes and very often and she wish that when her child fell into the river that she had never pulled ….her child out and Bibber use to wish ill wishes to herself and her children and also to others: the neighborhood where she lived amongst after she buried her first husband has told us that this John Bibber wife could fall into fits as often as she pleased.&lt;ref name=vib/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Septic shock''' is a potentially fatal [[medicine|medical]] condition that occurs when [[sepsis]], which is organ injury or damage in response to [[infection]], leads to dangerously [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] and abnormalities in cellular metabolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2016 | title = The Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 8| pages = 801–810 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.0287 | pmid=26903338 | author = Singer M, Deutschman CS, Seymour CW, Shankar-Hari M, Annane D, Bauer M, Bellomo R, Bernard GR, Chiche JD, Coopersmith CM, Hotchkiss RS, Levy MM, Marshall JC, Martin GS, Opal SM, Rubenfeld GD, van der Poll T, Vincent JL, Angus DC | pmc=4968574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and mechanism --&gt;
The primary infection is most commonly caused by [[bacteria]], but also may be by [[fungi]], [[viruses]] or [[parasites]]. It may be located in any part of the body, but most commonly in the lungs, brain, [[urinary tract]], skin or [[abdominal organs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jui |first= Jonathan |chapter= Ch. 146: Septic Shock |editor-last1= Tintinalli |editor-first1= Judith E. |editor-last2= Stapczynski |editor-first2= J.

&lt;!-- Treatment, epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
Frequently, people with septic shock are cared for in [[intensive care units]]. It most commonly affects children, [[immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] individuals, and the elderly, as their [[immune system]]s cannot deal with infection as effectively as those of healthy adults. The [[mortality rate]] from septic shock is approximately 25–50%.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Kumar |editor1-first= V. |editor2-last= Abbas |editor2-first= A.K. |editor3-last= Fausto |editor3-first= N.  |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last= Mitchell |editor4-first= R.N. |year= 2007 |title= Robbins Basic Pathology |edition= 8th  |publisher= [[Saunders (imprint)|Saunders]], [[Elsevier]] |pages= 102–3 |isbn= 9781416029731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Septic shock is a subclass of [[distributive shock]], a condition in which abnormal distribution of [[blood flow]] in the [[Microvessel|smallest blood vessels]] results in inadequate blood supply to the body [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], resulting in [[ischemia]] and organ dysfunction. Septic shock refers specifically to distributive shock due to [[sepsis]] as a result of infection.

Septic shock may be defined as sepsis-induced [[hypotension|low blood pressure]] that persists despite treatment with [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous fluid]]s.&lt;ref name="SSC Guidelines"/&gt; Low blood pressure reduces tissue [[perfusion]] pressure, causing the [[tissue hypoxia]] that is characteristic of shock. [[Cytokines]] released in a large scale inflammatory response result in massive [[vasodilation]], increased [[capillary permeability]], decreased [[systemic vascular resistance]], and low blood pressure. Finally, in an attempt to offset decreased blood pressure, ventricular dilatation and myocardial dysfunction occur.

Septic shock may be regarded as a stage of [[Systemic inflammatory response syndrome|SIRS]] (Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome), in which sepsis, severe sepsis and [[multiple organ dysfunction syndrome]] (MODS) represent different stages of a pathophysiological process. If an organism cannot cope with an infection, it may lead to a systemic response - sepsis, which may further progress to severe sepsis, septic shock, organ failure, and eventually, result in death.

==Causes==
Septic shock is a result of a systemic response to infection or multiple infectious causes. [[Sepsis]] may be present, but septic shock may occur without it.&lt;ref name="Angusvan der Poll2013"/&gt; The precipitating infections that may lead to septic shock if severe enough include but are not limited to [[appendicitis]], [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[diverticulitis]], [[pyelonephritis]], [[meningitis]], [[pancreatitis]], [[necrotizing fasciitis]], [[MRSA]] and [[mesenteric ischemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|PMID=16847244|journal=Arch Surg|date=July 2006|volume=141|issue=7|pages=701–4|title=Bowel necrosis associated with early jejunal tube feeding: A complication of postoperative enteral nutrition|authors=Melis M1, Fichera A, Ferguson MK.|doi=10.1001/archsurg.141.7.701}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|PMC=3433554|journal=J Korean Surg Soc.|date=September 2012|volume=83|issue=3|pages=171–174|doi=10.4174/jkss.2012.83.3.171|title=Enteral nutrition associated non-occlusive bowel ischemia|authors=Jun-Gyo Gwon, Young-Ju Lee,1 Kyu-Hyouck Kyoung,2 Young-Hwan Kim,1 and Suk-Kyung|pmid=22977764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sepsis is a constellation of symptoms secondary to an infection that manifests as disruptions in heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and white blood cell count. If sepsis worsens to the point of end-organ dysfunction (kidney failure, liver dysfunction, altered mental status, or heart damage), then the condition is called severe sepsis. Once severe sepsis worsens to the point where blood pressure can no longer be maintained with intravenous fluids alone, then the criterion has been met for septic shock.

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of septic shock is not entirely understood, but it is known that a key role in the development of severe sepsis is played by an immune and [[coagulation]] response to an infection. Both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses play a role in septic shock.&lt;ref name="Angusvan der Poll2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angus|first1=Derek C.|last2=van der Poll|first2=Tom|title=Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=369|issue=9|year=2013|pages=840–851|issn=0028-4793|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1208623|pmid=23984731}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Septic shock involves a widespread inflammatory response that produces a hypermetabolic effect.  This is manifested by increased cellular respiration, protein catabolism, and metabolic acidosis with a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.&lt;ref name="SSC Guidelines" /&gt;

Most cases of septic shock are caused by [[gram-positive bacteria]],&lt;ref name="Martin2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Martin |first1= G.S. |title= Sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock: changes in incidence, pathogens and outcomes |journal= [[Expert Review of Anti-infective Therapy]] |volume= 10 |issue= 6 |year= 2012 |pages= 701–6 |pmid= 22734959 |pmc= 3488423 |doi= 10.1586/eri.12.50}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by endotoxin-producing [[gram-negative bacteria]], although fungal infections are an increasingly prevalent cause of septic shock.&lt;ref name="SSC Guidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines Committee including The Pediatric Subgroup |last2= Dellinger |first2= R.P. |last3= Levy |first3= M.M. |last4= Rhodes |first4= A. |last5= Annane|first5= D. |last6= Gerlach |first6= H. |last7= Opal |first7= S.M. |last8= Sevransky |first8= J.E. |last9= Sprung |first9= C.L. |last10= Douglas |first10= I.S. |last11= Jaeschke |first11= R. |last12= Osborn |first12= T.M. |last13= Nunnally |first13= M.E. |last14= Townsend |first14= S.R. |last15= Reinhart |first15= K. |last16= Kleinpell |first16= R.M. |last17= Angus |first17= D.C. |last18= Deutschman |first18= C.S. |last19= Machado|first19= F.R. |last20= Rubenfeld |first20= G.D. |last21= Webb |first21= S. |last22= Beale |first22= R.J. |last23= Vincent |first23= J.-L. |last24= Moreno |first24= R. |displayauthors= 4 |title= Surviving Sepsis Campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2012 |journal= [[Critical Care Medicine]] |volume= 41 |issue= 2 |year= 2013 |pages= 580–637 |pmid= 23353941 |doi= 10.1097/CCM.0b013e31827e83af |url= http://www.sccm.org/Documents/SSC-Guidelines.pdf |via= [[Surviving Sepsis Campaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toxins produced by pathogens cause an immune response; in gram-negative bacteria these are [[endotoxin]]s, which are bacterial membrane [[lipopolysaccharide]]s (LPS).

===Gram-positive===
In gram-positive bacteria, these are [[exotoxins]] or [[enterotoxins]], which may vary depending on the species of bacteria. These are divided into three types. Type I, cell surface-active toxins, disrupt cells without entering, and include [[superantigens]] and [[heat-stable enterotoxins]]. Type II, membrane-damaging toxins, destroy cell membranes in order to enter and include [[hemolysin]]s and [[phospholipase]]s. Type III, intracellular toxins or [[A/B toxins]] interfere with internal cell function and include [[shiga toxin]], [[cholera toxin]], and [[anthrax lethal toxin]].

===Gram-negative===
In gram-negative sepsis, free LPS attaches to a circulating LPS-binding protein, and the complex then binds to the [[CD14]] receptor on [[monocyte]]s, [[macrophage]]s, and [[neutrophil]]s. Engagement of CD14 (even at doses as minute as 10 pg/mL) results in intracellular signaling via an associated "Toll-like receptor" protein 4 ([[TLR-4]]). This signaling results in the activation of nuclear factor kappaB ([[NF-κB]]), which leads to transcription of a number of genes that trigger a proinflammatory response. It was the result of significant activation of mononuclear cells and synthesis of effector cytokines. It also results in profound activation of mononuclear cells and the production of potent effector cytokines such as [[Interleukin 1|IL-1]], [[Interleukin 6|IL-6]], and [[TNF-α]]. TLR-mediated activation helps to trigger the [[innate immune system]] to efficiently eradicate invading microbes, but the cytokines they produce also act on endothelial cells. There, they have a variety of effects, including reduced synthesis of anticoagulation factors such as [[tissue factor pathway inhibitor]] and [[thrombomodulin]]. The effects of the cytokines may be amplified by TLR-4 engagement on endothelial cells.
 
In response to inflammation, a compensatory reaction of production of anti-inflammatory substances such as [[Interleukin 4|IL-4]], IL-10 antagonists, IL-1 receptor, and [[cortisol]] occurs. This is called compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS).&lt;ref name="Adib-ConquyCavaillon2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adib-Conquy|first1=Minou|last2=Cavaillon|first2=Jean-Marc|title=Compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome|journal=Thrombosis and Haemostasis|year=2008|issn=0340-6245|doi=10.1160/TH08-07-0421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both the inflammatory and anti-inflammatory reactions are responsible for the course of sepsis and are described as MARS (Mixed Antagonist Response Syndrome). The aim of these processes is to keep inflammation at an appropriate level. CARS often leads to suppression of the immune system, which leaves patients vulnerable to secondary infection.&lt;ref name="Angusvan der Poll2013"/&gt; It was once thought that SIRS or CARS could predominate in a septic individual, and it was proposed that CARS follows SIRS in a two-wave process. It is now believed that the systemic inflammatory response and the compensatory anti-inflammatory response occur simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Adib-ConquyCavaillon2008"/&gt;

At high levels of LPS, the syndrome of septic shock supervenes; the same cytokine and secondary mediators, now at high levels, result in systemic [[vasodilation]] (hypotension), diminished myocardial contractility, widespread endothelial injury, activation causing systemic leukocyte adhesion and diffuse alveolar capillary damage in the lung, and activation of the coagulation system culminating in [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC).

The hypoperfusion from the combined effects of widespread vasodilation, myocardial pump failure, and DIC causes multiorgan system failure that affects the liver, kidneys, and central nervous system, among other organ systems. Recently, severe damage to liver ultrastructure has been noticed from treatment with cell-free toxins of [[Salmonella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= YashRoy |first= R.C. |date= June 1994 |title= Liver damage by intra-ileal treatment with Salmonella 3,10:r:- extract as studied by light and electron microscopy |journal= Indian Journal of Animal Sciences |volume= 64 |issue= 6 |pages= 597–99 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230820149_Liver_damage_by_intra-ileal_treatment_with_Salmonella_310r-_extract_as_studied_by_light_and_electron_microscopy?ev=prf_pub |via= [[ResearchGate]]}}(animal study).&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the underlying infection (and LPS overload) is rapidly brought under control, the patient usually dies.

The ability of [[TLR4]] to respond to a distinct [[Lipopolysaccharide|LPS]] species are clinically important. [[Pathogenic bacteria]] may employ LPS with low biological activity to evade proper recognition by the [[TLR4]]/[[MD-2 (immunology)|MD-2]] system, dampening the host [[immune response]] and increasing the risk of bacterial dissemination. On the other hand, such LPS would not be able to induce septic shock in susceptible patients, rendering septic complications more manageable. Yet, defining and understanding how even the smallest structural differences between the very similar LPS species may affect the activation of the [[immune response]] may provide the mechanism for the fine tuning of the latter and new insights to immunomodulatory processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korneev|first1=K|last2=Arbatsky|first2=N|last3=Molinaro|first3=A|last4=Palmigiano|first4=A|last5=Shaikhutdinova|first5=R|last6=Shneider|first6=M|last7=Pier|first7=G|last8=Kondakova|first8=A|last9=Sviriaeva|first9=E|last10=Sturiale|first10=L|last11=Garozzo|first11=D|last12=Kruglov|first12=A|last13=Nedospasov|first13=S|last14=Drutskaya|first14=M|last15=Knirel|first15=Y|last16=Kuprash|first16=D|title=Structural Relationship of the Lipid A Acyl Groups to Activation of Murine Toll-Like Receptor 4 by Lipopolysaccharides from Pathogenic Strains of Burkholderia mallei, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.|journal=Frontiers in Immunology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=595|doi=10.3389/fimmu.2015.00595|pmid=26635809|pmc=4655328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==

According to current guidelines, requirements for diagnosis with sepsis are "the presence (probable or documented) of infection together with systemic manifestations of infection".&lt;ref name="SSC Guidelines"/&gt; These manifestations may include:

*[[Tachypnea]] (fast rate of breathing), which is defined as more than 20 breaths per minute, or when testing [[blood gas]], a [[PaCO2|{{Chem|PaCO|2}}]] less than 32 mmHg, which signifies hyperventilation
*[[White blood cell]] count either significantly low (&lt; 4000 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or elevated (&gt; 12000 cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
*[[Tachycardia]] (rapid [[heart rate]]), which in sepsis is defined as a rate greater than 90 beats per minute
*Altered body [[Normal human body temperature|temperature]]: [[Fever]] &gt; {{convert|38.0|C|F}} or hypothermia &lt; {{convert|36.0|C|F}}

Documented evidence of infection, may include positive [[blood culture]], signs of [[pneumonia]] on chest x-ray, or other radiologic or laboratory evidence of infection. Signs of [[Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome|end-organ dysfunction]] are present in septic shock, including [[kidney failure]], liver dysfunction, changes in mental status, or elevated serum [[Lactic acid|lactate]].

Septic shock is diagnosed if there is low blood pressure (BP) that does not respond to treatment. This means that intravenous fluid administration alone is not enough to maintain a patient's BP. Diagnosis of septic shock is made when [[systolic blood pressure]] is less than 90mm Hg, a [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) is less than 70&amp;nbsp;mm Hg, or a systolic BP decreases 40&amp;nbsp;mm Hg or more without other causes for low BP.&lt;ref name="SSC Guidelines"/&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment primarily consists of the following:
# Giving [[intravenous fluids]] &lt;ref name=Review11&gt;{{cite journal |last= Levinson |first= A.T. |last2=Casserly |first2= B.P. |last3= Levy |first3= M.M. |title= Reducing mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock |journal= Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine |date= April 2011 |volume= 32 |issue= 2 |pages= 195–205 |pmid= 21506056 |doi= 10.1055/s-0031-1275532}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Early antibiotic administration &lt;ref name=Review11/&gt;
# [[Early goal directed therapy]] &lt;ref name=Review11/&gt;
# Rapid source identification and control
# Support of major organ dysfunction

===Fluids===
Because lowered blood pressure in septic shock contributes to poor perfusion, [[fluid resuscitation]] is an initial treatment to increase blood volume. Patients demonstrating sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should be initially resuscitated with at least 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloid within the first three hours.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[Volume expander|Crystalloids]] such as [[normal saline]] and [[lactated Ringer's solution]] are recommended as the initial fluid of choice, while the use of colloid solutions such as [[hydroxyethyl starch]] have not shown any advantage or decrease in mortality. When large quantities of fluids are given, administering [[albumin]] has shown some benefit.&lt;ref name="Martin2012"/&gt;

===Antibiotics===
Treatment guidelines call for the administration of [[broad-spectrum antibiotics]] within the first hour following recognition of septic shock. Prompt [[antimicrobial therapy]] is important, as risk of dying increases by approximately 10% for every hour of delay in receiving antibiotics.&lt;ref name="Martin2012"/&gt; Time constraints do not allow the culture, identification, and testing for antibiotic sensitivity of the specific microorganism responsible for the infection. Therefore, combination antimicrobial therapy, which covers a wide range of potential causative organisms, is tied to better outcomes.&lt;ref name="Martin2012"/&gt;  Antibiotics should be continued for 7–10 days in most patients, though treatment duration may be shorter or longer depending on clinical response.&lt;ref name="Adib-ConquyCavaillon2008" /&gt;

===Vasopressors===
Among the choices for [[vasopressors]], [[norepinephrine (drug)|norepinephrine]] is superior to [[dopamine]] in septic shock.&lt;ref name=NorEpi11&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vasu |first1=T. S. |last2=Cavallazzi |first2=R. |last3=Hirani |first3=A. |last4=Kaplan |first4=G. |last5=Leiby |first5=B. |last6=Marik |first6=P.

Low-dose [[vasopressin]] also may be used as an addition to norepinephrine, but is not recommended as a first-line treatment. [[Dopamine]] may cause [[tachycardia|rapid heart rate]] and [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]]s, and is only recommended in combination with norepinephrine in those with [[bradycardia|slow heart rate]] and low risk of arrhythmia. In the initial treatment of low blood pressure in septic shock, the goal of vasopressor treatment is a [[mean arterial pressure]] (MAP) of 65&amp;nbsp;mm Hg.&lt;ref name="Martin2012"/&gt; In 2017, the FDA approved [[angiotensin II]] injection for intravenous infusion to increase blood pressure in adults with septic or other distributive shock.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm590249.htm|title=Press Announcements - FDA approves drug to treat dangerously low blood pressure|last=Commissioner|first=Office of the|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
While there is tentative evidence for [[Beta blocker|β-Blocker]] therapy to help control [[heart rate]], evidence is not significant enough for its routine use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chacko|first1=CJ|last2=Gopal|first2=S|title=Systematic review of use of β-blockers in sepsis.|journal=Journal of anaesthesiology, clinical pharmacology|date=2015|volume=31|issue=4|pages=460–5|pmid=26702201|doi=10.4103/0970-9185.169063|pmc=4676233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanfilippo|first1=F|last2=Santonocito|first2=C|last3=Morelli|first3=A|last4=Foex|first4=P|title=Beta-blocker use in severe sepsis and septic shock: a systematic review.|journal=Current Medical Research and Opinion|date=2015|volume=31|issue=10|pages=1817–25|pmid=26121122|doi=10.1185/03007995.2015.1062357}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is tentative evidence that steroids may be useful in improving outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annane|first1=D|last2=Bellissant|first2=E|last3=Bollaert|first3=PE|last4=Briegel|first4=J|last5=Keh|first5=D|last6=Kupfer|first6=Y|title=Corticosteroids for treating sepsis.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=3 December 2015|volume=12|pages=CD002243|pmid=26633262|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002243.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recombinant DNA|Recombinant]] activated [[protein C]] ([[drotrecogin alpha]]) in a 2011 [[Cochrane review]] was found not to decrease mortality and to increase bleeding, and thus, was not recommended for use.&lt;ref name= "Recombinant Cochrane"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martí-Carvajal|first1=AJ|last2=Solà|first2=I|last3=Gluud|first3=C|last4=Lathyris|first4=D|last5=Cardona|first5=AF|title=Human recombinant protein C for severe sepsis and septic shock in adult and paediatric patients.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 December 2012|volume=12|pages=CD004388|pmid=23235609|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004388.pub6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drotrecogin alfa (Xigris), was withdrawn from the market in October 2011.

==Epidemiology==
Sepsis has a worldwide incidence of more than 20 million cases a year, with mortality due to septic shock reaching up to 50 percent even in industrialized countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.physorg.com/news194879092.html |title= Researchers make blood poisoning breakthrough |date= June 4, 2010 |accessdate= |work= [[Phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control]], septic shock is the thirteenth leading cause of death in the United States and the most frequent cause of deaths in intensive care units. There has been an increase in the rate of septic shock deaths in recent decades, which is attributed to an increase in invasive medical devices and procedures, increases in immunocompromised patients, and an overall increase in elderly patients.

Tertiary care centers (such as [[hospice]] care facilities) have 2-4 times the rate of bacteremia than primary care centers, 75% of which are [[nosocomial infections|hospital-acquired infections]].

The process of infection by bacteria or fungi may result in systemic signs and symptoms that are variously described. Approximately 70% of septic shock cases were once traceable to [[gram-negative bacteria]] that produce [[endotoxins]], however, with the emergence of [[MRSA]] and the increased use of arterial and venous catheters, [[gram-positive bacteria]] are implicated approximately as commonly as [[bacilli]]. In rough order of increasing severity these are, bacteremia or fungemia; sepsis, severe sepsis or sepsis syndrome; septic shock, refractory septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and death.

35% of septic shock cases derive from [[urinary tract infections]], 15% from the respiratory tract, 15% from skin catheters (such as [[IVs]]), and more than 30% of all cases are [[idiopathic]] in origin.

The mortality rate from sepsis is approximately 40% in adults and 25% in children. It is significantly greater when sepsis is left untreated for more than seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last= Huether |editor1-first= S.E. |editor2-last= McCance |editor2-first= K.L. |year= 2008 |title= Understanding Pathophysiology |edition= 4th |isbn= 9780323049900}}{{Page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Serphitidae''' is a [[Family (biology)|family]] of [[fossil]] [[hymenoptera]]n insects.

== Taxonomy ==
This family was described in 1937 by the American entomologist [[Charles Thomas Brues]] to classify a fossil insect caught in an [[amber]] piece from Canada. The species was named ''[[Serphites paradoxus]]''. After that, more genera were described and included in this family, like ''[[Archaeromma]]'' and ''[[Distylopus]]'' by the Japanese entomologist [[Hiroshi Yoshimoto]] in 1975, from fossils also found in Canadian amber, and ''[[Aposerphites]]'', ''[[Microserphites]]'', ''[[Palaeomymar]]'' and new species of ''Serphites'' in 1979 by the Russian entomologist [[Mikhail Vasilievich Kozlov]] and [[Alexandr Rasnitsyn]], from [[Siberian]] amber .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=George O.

The '''Siberian Tiger Introduction Project''' involves [[Species reintroduction|reestablishing]] populations of the [[Siberian tiger]] (''Panthera tigris alatica)'', also known as the Amur tiger, in their former range and also expanding their range by [[Species translocation|introducing]] them as replacements of their genetically similar relative, the extinct [[Caspian tiger]] (''Panthera tigris virgata''), which inhabited [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref name="driscoll"&gt;Driscoll, C.

== History ==
[[File:Harbin Siberian Tigers.jpg|thumb|left|Two [[Siberian tiger]]s at [[Harbin Siberian Tiger Park]], [[Northeast China]]]]

Genetic studies have revealed that Siberian and Caspian tigers are descended from the tiger population that colonized Central Asia about [[10th millennium BC|10,000 years ago]].&lt;ref name="driscoll"/&gt;

Siberian tigers used to be common on either side of the [[Amur River]] in [[Russia]] and [[China]], as well as in northeastern [[Mongolia]] and [[South Korea]]. Caspian tigers lived around the [[Caspian sea]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkmenistan]], and also further away in [[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Turkey]] and [[Kazakhstan]] all the way to the [[Altai Mountains]] in the East. Caspian tigers reportedly became extinct in the 1970s after many years of [[hunting]], [[poaching]] and [[habitat loss]]. Siberian tigers lost most of their ranges in [[Siberia]] and China and became extinct in the wild of [[Korea]] and Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mammalsofsov221992gept|title=Mammals of the Soviet Union.

== Siberian Tiger Project ==
[[File:Amur (siberian) tiger prowling.jpg|thumb|right|A Siberian tiger at [[Minnesota Zoo]]]]

The [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] (WCS) began working in the Russian Far East in 1992 to help conserve rare [[umbrella species]] like Siberian tigers, [[Amur leopard|Amur leopards]] and [[Blakiston's fish owl|Blakiston’s fish owls]], whose survival ultimately requires the [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] of the forest ecosystem as a whole. The WCS founded the Siberian Tiger Project in cooperation with the [[Sikhote-Alin Nature Reserve]] at the same time. The goal of the Siberian Tiger Project is to collect the best possible scientific information on tiger behavior and ecology for use in [[Conservation Plan|conservation plans]]. The project has studied Siberian tigers by [[Animal migration tracking|radio-tracking]] more than 60 individuals since 1992.

The Siberian Tiger Project combines traditional Russian and international approaches to conduct [[field research]] and is the world's longest running [[Telemetry|radio-telemetry]] based tiger research and conservation effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://russia.wcs.org/en-us/Projects/Siberian-Tiger-Project.aspx|title=Siberian Tiger Project|website=russia.wcs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Introduction efforts ==

Introduction projects for Siberian tigers have been proposed for the Middle East, Central Asia and [[North Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Driscoll|first=C.

=== Kazakhstan ===
Siberian tigers are set to be introduced to areas in [[Kazakhstan]] where Caspian tigers once lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Tigers Welcomed Back to Kazakhstan|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/apr2011/2011-04-26-02.html|publisher=Environment News Service|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Tigers Find a Wild New Home|url=http://www.livescience.com/13775-tigers-kazakhstan-amur-tigers-russia.html|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A national park tentatively known as Caspian Tiger National Park for introduced tigers might be opened in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revival of extinct Caspian tigers in Kazakhstan|url=http://en.tengrinews.kz/environment/Revival-of-extinct-Caspian-tigers-in-Kazakhstan-253818/|publisher=tengrinews.kz|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Amu Darya]] river delta was suggested as a potential site. A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area was suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least 5,000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1,930 sq mi) of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such a habitat is not available at this stage and also cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for introduction at this stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265071289_Pre-Feasibility_Study_on_the_Possible_Restoration_of_the_Caspian_Tiger_in_the_Amu_Darya_Delta_by|title=Pre-Feasibility Study on the Possible Restoration of the Caspian Tiger in the Amu Darya Delta by (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southeastern shore of [[Lake Balkhash]] where the [[Ili River]] discharges and forms a large delta was also chosen as a suitable habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Endangered Tigers Find a Wild New Home|url=http://www.livescience.com/13775-tigers-kazakhstan-amur-tigers-russia.html|author=Live Science Staff|publisher=Live Science|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The reintroduction of the Turan tiger can help to develop ecotourism in Kazakhstan|url=http://kazgeography.org/en/node/101|publisher=Kazakhstan National Geographic Society|accessdate=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Igor Chestin, director of the Russian branch of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), hopes to reintroduce tigers in the region within the next few years, though there is a need to enlarge the potential prey base by increasing the existing populations of [[saiga antelope]], [[roe deer]] and [[wild boar]] the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inserting Captive-Bred Tigers Into the Wild: Will it Work?|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/09/19/inserting-captive-bred-tigers-into-the-wild-will-it-work/|publisher=National Geographic|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feasibility Study on the Possible Restoration of the Caspian Tiger in Central Asia|url=http://www.wwf.ru/resources/publ/book/eng/460|author=Hartmut Jungius|publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)|date=2010|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 September, 2017, the government of Kazakhstan announced the outline of its tiger reintroduction program and signed a memorandum with the WWF for assistance. Tigers will be introduced in the extensive [[riparian forest]] along the southeastern shore of Lake Balkhash. On 1 January, 2018, the government will designate a new [[nature reserve]] in the area to restore the degraded habitat and protect it thereafter. The restoration will include the reintroduction of the locally extinct [[Onager|Asiatic wild ass]] and [[Bactrian deer]]. It will also help protect Lake Balkhash. Conservationist hope to engage [[Local community|local communities]] in the program to help tackle [[poaching]] and other illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/bringing-tigers-back-home-to-kazakhstan|title=Bringing tigers back home to Kazakhstan 70 years later|website=World Wildlife Fund|language=en|access-date=2017-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wwf.panda.org/?310630/Wild-tigers-to-return-to-Kazakhstan-70-years-after-going-extinct|title=Wild tigers to return to Kazakhstan 70 years after going extinct|access-date=2017-09-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
Siberian tigers might be introduced to areas in northern Iran where Caspian tigers once lived. In 2010, a pair of Siberian tigers sent by Russia to Iran's [[Tehran Zoological Garden]] (Eram Zoo) in exchange for a pair of [[Persian leopard]]s were set to be introduced to the [[Miankaleh peninsula]] along the southeastern-most shore of the Caspian Sea within the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Cat Swap Raises Questions |url=https://iwpr.net/global-voices/big-cat-swap-raises-questions|publisher=Institute for War and Peace Reporting|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Khosravifard, S.| url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/may/1232.html |title=Russia, Iran exchange tigers for leopards but some experts express doubts |publisher=Payvand News|date=22 May 2010| accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, one of the Siberian tigers at the Eram Zoo died due to a [[feline immunodeficiency virus]] (FIV) infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20110108/world/iran-s-siberian-tiger-dies-reports.344404|title=Iran’s Siberian tiger dies – reports|last=Ltd|first=Allied Newspapers|work=Times of Malta|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Iran requested four more Siberian tigers and invited conservation experts from Russia to support the introduction project for the Caspian Sea coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran seeks to import four more Siberian tigers from Russia|url=http://programmes.putin.kremlin.ru/en/tiger/news/14756|publisher=The Amur Tiger Programme|date=18 March 2011|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran received two pairs of Siberian tigers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://programmes.putin.kremlin.ru/en/tiger/news/18372|title=THE AMUR TIGER PROGRAMME|website=programmes.putin.kremlin.ru|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia Sends Siberian Tigers to Iran to Save Species|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/russia-send-iran-amur-siberian-tigers-population-307524|author=Ewan Palmer|publisher=International Business Times|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===
[[File:Releasing a Siberian tiger in Russia.webm|thumb|A 3-year-old male tiger, which was captured in a prey-depleted area, is released back into the wild]]
The future introduction of Siberian tigers is planned as part of the ambitious [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] project at [[Pleistocene Park]] in the [[Kolyma River|Kolyma river basin]] in northern [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]] (Yakutia), Russia, provided the population of herbivores reaches a size capable of supporting large predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pleistocenepark.ru/en/|title=Pleistocene Park: Restoration of the Mammoth Steppe Ecosystem|website=www.pleistocenepark.ru|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimov|first=Sergey A.|date=2005-05-06|title=Pleistocene Park: Return of the Mammoth's Ecosystem|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/308/5723/796.1|journal=Science|language=en|volume=308|issue=5723|pages=796–798|doi=10.1126/science.1113442|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15879196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Siberian tiger cub orphaned by poachers was rescued at [[Primorsky Krai]] in February 2012. The cub which turned out to be a female was rehabilitated and eventually released back into the wild in May 2013. In 2015, she gave birth to two cubs at [[Bastak Nature Reserve]], becoming the first rehabilitated Siberian tiger to give birth in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/cinderella-tiger-orphan-gives-birth-wild-cubs|title='Cinderella' tiger orphan gives birth to wild cubs|work=MNN - Mother Nature Network|access-date=2017-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Korea ===
[[North Korea]] was urged to join Russia and China in saving the Siberian tiger after the latest census revealed that only 562 individuals live in the wild. According to the director of the Amur branch of the WWF, analysis of satellite imagery of North Korea has shown that the northern part of the country has suitable conditions for releasing Siberian tigers. This is supported by the fact that a tigress with two cubs had once crossed the border between Russia and North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex imbalance as endangered Siberian tigers show signs of recovery|url=http://siberiantimes.com/ecology/casestudy/news/n0522-sex-imbalance-as-endangered-siberian-tigers-show-signs-of-recovery/|author=The Siberian Times reporter|publisher=The Siberian Times|date=16 December 2015|accessdate=18 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syedi Nuruddin''', 11th century famous saint (death: Jumadi al-Ula 11) was [[Fatimid]] [[Ismaili]] [[Mustaali]] Missionary. He was companion of Maulaya [[Abdullah (Ismaili Mustaali Missionary)]] to visit of Imam [[Al-Mustansir Billah]], Cairo, Egypt. He joined the Ismaili faith under Fatimid Dai [[Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi]], and came back to Dongaum, Deccan India to propagate the faith. His earlier name was Rup Nath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ismaili.net/heritage/node/8200,] 12.0 The Fatimid Da'i Al-Mu'ayyad: His Life , by: Dr. Abbas Hamdani, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (U.S.A.): "The spread of the Da'wa in Deccan and its origin in al-Mu'ayyad is mentioned by Khwaj b.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">The term '''Toarcian turnover,''' alternatively the '''Toarcian extinction,''' the '''Pliensbachian-Toarcian extinction,''' or the '''Early Jurassic extinction,''' refers to the wave of extinctions that marked the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] stage and the start of the [[Toarcian]] stage of the [[Early Jurassic]] period, c. 183 million years ago.

The Toarcian turnover was most strongly manifested in aquatic lifeforms, notably in mollusk groups like [[ammonites]].&lt;ref&gt;Wignall, Paul B., and [[Anthony Hallam]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4435">'''Transarmament''' (closely related to [[civilian-based defense]]) is the partial or total replacement of [[armed forces]] with the physical and social infrastructure to support [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] resistance. According to an encyclopedia definition, transarmament is
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the process of changeover from a military-based defense policy to a [[civilian-based defense]] policy. Transarmament always involves the replacement of one means to provide defense with another. It therefore differs from "disarmament," which is the simple reduction or abandonment of military capacity. (p&amp;nbsp;534&lt;ref name=sharp97&gt;[[Gene Sharp]] (1997). "Transarmament" (p. 534) in: Roger S. Powers, William B. Vogele, Christopher Kruegler, Ronald M. McCarthy (1997), ''Protest, power, and change: an encyclopedia of nonviolent action from ACT-UP to women's suffrage''. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|978-0-8153-0913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Civilian defense==
The term "transarmament" appears to have been introduced in 1937 in a pamphlet by [[Kenneth Boulding]].&lt;ref name=sharp97/&gt; It appears not to have been used again until the 1960s.&lt;ref name=sharp97/&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts68&gt;Adam Roberts (ed.) (1968), ''Civilian resistance as a national defense: non-violent action against aggression''. Stackpole Books. (320 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Adam Roberts,
:At least four possible stages &lt;nowiki&gt;[of transarmament]&lt;/nowiki&gt; can be envisaged:
:1. Research and investigation into civilian defence, in order to judge its workability, relate it to a specific country's defence problems, and develop strategic and tactical concepts so that the proposal can be presented in concrete and practical terms.
:2. General public education in non-violent action and civilian defence; concentrated training of key groups and individuals; organizational preparations.
:3. Application of civilian defence in specific areas without complete abandonment of military defence policy.
:4. Public commitment to use civilian defence in resisting all threats formerly dealt with by military methods. Completion of process of transarment. (p.&amp;nbsp;338&lt;ref name=robertschap69&gt;Adam Roberts (1969) "Transarmament to Civilian Defence" (pp. 336-348) in Adam Roberts (ed.), "Civilian Resistance as a National Defence," Baltimore, MD: Penguin/Pelican, 1969. (367 pages)&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Offensive to defensive==
"Transarmament" has later been used—for example, by [[Johan Galtung]]—as a technical term to describe a shift in military strategy. Galtung distinguishes between offensive and defense armaments and suggests transitioning to a defensive system of national defense. His use of the term does not imply nonviolence.&lt;ref name=galtung84&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Rabbit-erosion.jpg|thumb|An [[erosion|erosion gully]] in Australia caused by rabbits. The release of [[rabbits in Australia]] for hunting purposes has had serious unintended ecological consequences.]]
In the [[social sciences]], '''unintended consequences''' (sometimes '''unanticipated consequences''' or '''unforeseen consequences''') are outcomes that are not the ones foreseen and intended by a purposeful action. The term was popularised in the twentieth century by American [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/24/nyregion/robert-k-merton-versatile-sociologist-and-father-of-the-focus-group-dies-at-92.html Robert K. Merton, Versatile Sociologist and Father of the Focus Group, Dies at 92], Michael T. Kaufman, ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Unintended consequences can be grouped into three types:
* ''Unexpected benefit'':  A positive unexpected benefit (also referred to as [[luck]], [[serendipity]] or a [[wikt:windfall|windfall]]).
* ''Unexpected drawback'':  An unexpected detriment occurring in addition to the desired effect of the policy (e.g., while [[irrigation]] schemes provide people with water for agriculture, they can increase [[waterborne diseases]] that have devastating health effects, such as [[schistosomiasis]]).
* ''Perverse result'': A perverse effect contrary to what was originally intended (when an intended solution makes a problem worse). This is sometimes referred to as 'backfire'.

==History==
===John Locke===
The idea of ''unintended consequences'' dates back at least to [[John Locke]] who discussed the unintended consequences of [[interest rate]] [[regulation]] in his letter to Sir John Somers, Member of Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;John Locke, [http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/763#lf0128-04_head_002''The Works of John Locke in Nine Volumes''], (London: Rivington, 1824 12th ed.). Vol. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Adam Smith===
The idea was also discussed by [[Adam Smith]], the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], and [[consequentialism]] (judging by results).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Adam|title=The Theory of Moral Sentiments|page=93|url=http://metalibri.wikidot.com/title:theory-of-moral-sentiments:smith-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Robert K. Merton===
Sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]] popularised this concept in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Renowned Columbia Sociologist and National Medal of Science Winner Robert K. Merton Dies at 92|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/03/02/robertKMerton.html|publisher=Columbia News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asanet.org/footnotes/mar03/indextwo.html Robert K. Merton Remembered] Footnotes, American Sociological Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merton/&gt;

In "The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action" (1936), Merton tried to apply a systematic analysis to the problem of unintended consequences of deliberate acts intended to cause [[social change]]. He emphasized that his term ''purposive action'', "[was exclusively] concerned with 'conduct' as distinct from 'behavior.' That is, with action that involves motives and consequently a choice between various alternatives".&lt;ref name=Merton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=895|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton's usage included deviations from what [[Max Weber]] defined as rational social action: instrumentally rational and value rational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merton also stated that "no blanket statement categorically affirming or denying the practical feasibility of ''all'' social planning is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merton|first=Robert K.|title=The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive Social Action|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=1|issue=6|page=904|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/2111-home/CD/TheoryClass/Readings/MertonSocialAction.pdf|accessdate=2008-05-30|doi=10.2307/2084615|jstor=2084615|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Everyday usage===
More recently, the ''law of unintended consequences'' has come to be used as an adage or idiomatic warning that an intervention in a [[complex system]] tends to create unanticipated and often undesirable outcomes.&lt;ref name="Norton "&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Norton |first=Rob |editor=[[David R. Henderson]] |encyclopedia=[[Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |title=Unintended Consequences |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/UnintendedConsequences.html  |year=2008 |edition= 2nd |publisher=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0865976658 |oclc=237794267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/mislj71&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/flsulr28&amp;div=36&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=28 Florida State University Law Review 2000–2001 Mandatory Minimum Sentences: Exemplifying the Law of Unintended Consequences Comment |publisher=Heinonline.org |date=1993-06-18 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/antil65&amp;div=47&amp;id=&amp;page= |title=HeinOnline |publisher=HeinOnline |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akin to [[Murphy's law]], it is commonly used as a wry or humorous warning against the [[hubris]]tic belief that humans can fully control the world around them.

==Causes==
Possible causes of unintended consequences include the world's inherent [[complexity]] (parts of a system responding to changes in the environment), [[perverse incentive]]s, human [[stupidity]], [[self-deception]], failure to account for human nature, or other [[cognitive bias|cognitive]] or [[emotional bias|emotional]] biases. As a sub-component of complexity (in the scientific sense), the chaotic nature of the universe—and especially its quality of having small, apparently insignificant changes with far-reaching effects (e.g., the [[butterfly effect]])—applies.

[[Robert K. Merton]] listed five possible causes of unanticipated consequences in 1936:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Merton, Robert K|title=On Social Structure and Science|publisher=[[The University of Chicago Press]]|year=1996|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/O/bo3626245.html|accessdate=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ignorance, making it  impossible to anticipate everything, thereby leading to incomplete analysis.
# Errors in analysis of the problem or following habits that worked in the past but may not apply to the current situation.
# Immediate interests overriding long-term interests.
# Basic values which may require or prohibit certain actions even if the long-term result might be unfavourable (these long-term consequences may eventually cause changes in basic values).
# [[Self-defeating prophecy]], or, the fear of some consequence which drives people to find solutions before the problem occurs, thus the non-occurrence of the problem is not anticipated.

In addition to Merton's causes, psychologist Stuart Vyse has noted that [[groupthink]], described by [[Irving Janis]], has been blamed for some decisions that result in unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vyse |first1=Stuart |title=Can Anything Save Us from Unintended Consequences? |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=20-23 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919223200/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/can_anything_save_us_from_unintended_consequences |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sinking of ships in shallow waters during wartime has created many artificial [[coral reefs]], which can be scientifically valuable and have become an attraction for recreational divers. Retired ships have been purposely sunk in recent years, in an effort to replace coral reefs lost to [[global warming]] and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.maryland.gov/dnrnews/pressrelease2008/020708a.html |title=Maryland Artificial Reef Initiative Celebrates 1 Year Anniversary |publisher=Dnr.maryland.gov |date=2008-02-07 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18853363/ |title=Sinking ships will boost tourism, group says&amp;nbsp;– News&amp;nbsp;– msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-05-25 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090921/NATIONAL/709209873/1042/FOREIGN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150509132717/http://www.thenational.ae/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20090921%2FNATIONAL%2F709209873%2F1042%2FFOREIGN |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-05-09 |title=Life after death on the ocean floor&amp;nbsp;– The National Newspaper |publisher=Thenational.ae |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cbs4.com/local/vandenberg.fish.key.2.1250653.html |title=Sea Life Flourishing On Vandenberg Wreck Off Keys |publisher=cbs4.com |date=2009-10-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227174325/http://cbs4.com/local/vandenberg.fish.key.2.1250653.html |archivedate=2009-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/i061227.html |title=CDNN : Diver Wants to Sink Old Navy Ships off California Coast |publisher=Cdnn.info |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medicine]], most [[Medication|drugs]] have unintended consequences ('[[side effect]]s') associated with their use. However, some are beneficial. For instance, [[aspirin]], a [[pain reliever]], is also an [[anticoagulant]] that can help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] and reduce the severity and damage from [[thrombotic stroke]]s.&lt;ref name=BBC15Feb2001&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/1168850.stm |title=BBC 15 February 2001, ''Aspirin heart warning'' |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-02-15 |accessdate=2010-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of beneficial [[side effect]]s also leads to [[off-label use]]—prescription or use of a drug for an unlicensed purpose. Famously, the drug [[Viagra]] was developed to lower blood pressure, with its use for treating [[erectile dysfunction]] being discovered as a side effect in clinical trials.

The objective of microfinance initiatives is to foster micro-entrepreneurs but an unintended consequence can be informal intermediation: That is, some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arp|first=Frithjof|last2=Ardisa|first2=Alvin|last3=Ardisa|first3=Alviani|date=2017|title=Microfinance for poverty alleviation: Do transnational initiatives overlook fundamental questions of competition and intermediation?|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320100413_Microfinance_for_poverty_alleviation_Do_transnational_initiatives_overlook_fundamental_questions_of_competition_and_intermediation|journal=Transnational Corporations|volume=24|issue=3|pages=103–117|publisher=United Nations Conference on Trade and Development|id=UNCTAD/DIAE/IA/2017D4A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Australian state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] made [[bicycle helmet|safety helmets]] mandatory for all bicycle riders. While there was a reduction in the number of head injuries, there was also an unintended reduction in the number of juvenile cyclists—fewer cyclists obviously leads to fewer injuries, assuming [[Ceteris paribus|all else being equal]]. The risk of death and serious injury per cyclist seems to have increased, possibly due to [[risk compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyclehelmets.org/1241.html |title=Evaluating Head Injuries and Helmet Laws in Australia and New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Vulcan, ''et al.'' found that the reduction in juvenile cyclists was because the youths considered wearing a bicycle helmet unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cameron |first1=Maxwell H. |last2=Vulcan |first2=A.

[[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition in the 1920s United States]], originally enacted to suppress the alcohol trade, drove many small-time alcohol suppliers out of business and consolidated the hold of large-scale [[organized crime]] over the illegal alcohol industry. Since alcohol was still popular, criminal organisations producing alcohol were well-funded and hence also increased their other activities. Similarly, the [[War on Drugs]], intended to suppress the [[illegal drug trade]], instead increased the power and profitability of drug cartels who became the primary source of the products.&lt;ref&gt;Juan Forero, "Colombia's Coca Survives U.S. plan to uproot it", The New York Times, August 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Podesta and Douglas Farah, "Drug Policy in Andes Called Failure," ''[[Washington Post]]'', March 27, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="streatfeild"&gt;{{cite web |author=Dominic Streatfeild |title=Source Material for ''Cocaine: An Unauthorized Biography'': Interview between Milton Friedman and Dominic Streatfeild |date=June 2000 |url=http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |publisher=Dominicstratfeild |accessdate=2012-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113201345/http://www.dominicstreatfeild.com/2010/11/08/interview-with-milton-friedman/ |archivedate=2012-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An open letter |url=http://www.prohibitioncosts.org/endorsers.html |publisher=Prohibition Costs |accessdate=2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passenger-side [[airbag]]s in motorcars were intended as a safety feature, but led to an increase in child fatalities in the mid-1990s as small children were being hit by deploying airbags during collisions. The supposed solution to this problem, moving the child seat to the back of the vehicle, led to an increase in the number of children forgotten in unattended vehicles, some of whom died under extreme temperature conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/hot-car-death/ |work=Time |first1=Justin |last1=Worland/Ridgefield |title=Who's To Blame For Hot Car Deaths? |date=2014-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk compensation, or the [[Risk compensation|Peltzman effect]], occurs after implementation of safety measures intended to reduce injury or death (e.g. bike helmets, seatbelts, etc.). People may feel safer than they really are and take additional risks which they would not have taken without the safety measures in place. This may result in no change, or even an increase, in morbidity or mortality, rather than a decrease as intended.

The British government, concerned about the number of venomous cobra snakes in Delhi, [[Cobra effect|offered a bounty for every dead cobra]]. This was a successful strategy as large numbers of snakes were killed for the reward. Eventually, enterprising people began breeding cobras for the income. When the government became aware of this, they scrapped the reward program, causing the cobra breeders to set the now-worthless snakes free. As a result, the wild cobra population further increased. The apparent solution for the problem made the situation even worse, becoming known as the [[Cobra effect]].

[[Theobald Mathew (temperance reformer)|Theobald Mathew]]'s temperance campaign in 19th-century [[Ireland]] resulted in thousands of people vowing never to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] again. This led to the consumption of [[diethyl ether]], a much more dangerous intoxicant  — due to its high flammability — by those seeking to become intoxicated without breaking the letter of their pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-eth1.htm |title=Etheromaniac |publisher=World Wide Words |date=2006-09-09 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://unintendedconsequenc.es/substitutions-temperance-movement-ether/|title=Substitutions - The Temperance Movement and Ether - Unintended Consequences|date=2018-09-16|work=Unintended Consequences|access-date=2018-09-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was thought that adding south-facing [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatories]] to British houses would reduce energy consumption by providing extra insulation and warmth from the sun. However, people tended to use the conservatories as living areas, installing heating and ultimately increasing overall energy consumption.&lt;ref&gt;"Our innate ability to think of new ways to use energy" Professor [[Tadj Oreszczyn]].

A reward for [[ghost net|lost nets]] found along the Normandy coast was offered by the French government between 1980 and 1981. This resulted in people vandalizing nets to collect the reward.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Von Brandt (1984) ''Fish catching methods of the world'' {{ISBN|978-0-685-63409-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1960s, the Canadian federal government gave the Catholic Church in Quebec $2.25 per day per psychiatric patient for their cost of care, but only $0.75 a day per orphan. The perverse result is that the orphan children were diagnosed as mentally ill so the church could receive the larger amount of money. This psychiatric misdiagnosis affected up to 20,000 people, and the children are known as the [[Duplessis Orphans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1WNWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EvIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6929%2C5814760 |title=The Spokesman-Review  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DeceAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WHsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6753%2C1774080 |title=Sarasota Herald-Tribune  |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lT9TAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=A4UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6732%2C2759782 |title=The Prescott Courier |work=google.com |accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental intervention==

Most modern technologies have negative consequences that are both unavoidable and unpredictable. For example, almost all [[environmental problem]]s, from chemical [[pollution]] to [[global warming]], are the unexpected consequences of the application of modern technologies. [[Traffic congestion]], deaths and injuries from car accidents, [[air pollution]], and global warming are unintended consequences of the invention and large scale adoption of the [[automobile]]. [[Hospital infection]]s are the unexpected side-effect of [[antibiotic resistance]], and even [[human overpopulation]] is the side effect of various technological (i.e., [[Agricultural revolution (disambiguation)|agricultural]] and [[industrial revolution|industrial]]) revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|author1=Huesemann, Michael H.|author2=Joyce A.

Because of the complexity of [[ecosystems]], deliberate changes to an ecosystem or other environmental interventions will often have (usually negative) unintended consequences. Sometimes, these effects cause permanent [[irreversible change]]s. Examples include:
* During the [[Four Pests Campaign]] a killing of sparrows was declared. Chinese leaders later realized that sparrows ate a large amount of insects, as well as grains. Rather than being increased, rice yields after the campaign were substantially decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Frank|last= Dikotter|title=Mao's Great Famine|location=New York|publisher=Walker &amp; Co.|year=2010|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Great Plague of London]] a killing of dogs and cats was ordered. If left untouched, they would have made a significant reduction in the rat population that carried the fleas which transmitted the disease.&lt;ref&gt;Moote, Lloyd and Dorothy: ''The Great Plague: the Story of London's most Deadly Year'', Baltimore, 2004. p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The installation of [[smokestack]]s to decrease pollution in local areas, resulting in spread of pollution at a higher altitude, and [[acid rain]] on an international scale.&lt;ref name="Likens, G.

* After about 1900, public demand led the US government to fight [[forest fire]]s in the American West, and set aside land as national forests and parks to protect them from fires. This policy led to fewer fires, but also led to growth conditions such that, when fires did occur, they were much larger and more damaging. Modern research suggests that this policy was misguided, and that a certain level of wildfires is a natural and important part of [[forest ecology]].&lt;ref name="How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires"&gt;{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Christopher|title=How The Smokey Bear Effect Led To Raging Wildfires|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/23/159373691/how-the-smokey-bear-effect-led-to-raging-wildfires|work=npr.org|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vertebrobasilar insufficiency''' ('''VBI''') or '''vertebral-basilar ischemia''', also called '''beauty parlour syndrome''' ('''BPS'''), is a temporary set of [[symptom]]s due to decreased [[blood flow]] ([[ischemia]]) in the [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] circulation of the [[brain]].  The posterior circulation supplies blood to the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], [[cerebellum]], [[pons]], [[midbrain]], [[thalamus]], and [[occipital cortex]] (responsible for vision).  Therefore, the symptoms due to VBI vary according to which portions of the brain experience significantly decreased blood flow (see image of brain [http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/images/446/brainside.gif]).  In the United States, 25% of [[stroke]]s and [[transient ischemic attack]]s occur in the vertebrobasilar distribution.  These must be separated from strokes arising from the [[anterior]] circulation, which involves the [[carotid]] arteries.

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Vertigo (medical)|Vertigo]], the sensation of spinning even while a person is still, is the most recognizable and quite often the sole symptom of decreased blood flow in the vertebrobasilar distribution. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The vertigo due to VBI can be brought on by head turning, which could occlude the contralateral [[vertebral artery]] and result in decreased blood flow to the brain if the contralateral artery is occluded.  When the vertigo is accompanied by double vision ([[diplopia]]), graying of vision, and blurred vision, patients often go to the [[optometrist]] or [[ophthalmologist]].  If the VBI progresses, there may be weakness of the quadriceps and, to the patient, this is felt as a buckling of the knees.  The patient may suddenly become weak at the knee and crumple (often referred to as a  “[[drop attack]]”).  Such a fall can lead to significant head and orthopedic injury, especially in the elderly.

[[Transient ischemic attack]]s due to VBI will, by definition, have symptoms resolved within 24 hours.  More often, however, the symptoms are very brief, lasting a few seconds to half an hour. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== Diagnosis ==
The evaluation for VBI starts with a history and physical exam, with great emphasis on the cardiovascular and neurologic exam.  It also includes a work-up to exclude benign conditions (such as [[labyrinthitis]], [[vestibular neuronitis]], and [[benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]]) that have overlapping signs and symptoms.  However, the exact work-up largely depends on the patient’s age and known risk factors.  For middle-aged patients, a cardiovascular risk factor evaluation is important.  This often includes a cholesterol level, lipid profile (see this [http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=183] to determine what your cholesterol level means), [[Electrocardiogram|ECG]], and [[echocardiogram]].  If a person with VBI is under age 45 and has no evidence for atherosclerosis, a work-up for hypercoagulable states (Lupus anticoagulant, [[anti-cardiolipin antibodies]],  is indicated. Screening for [[protein C deficiency|protein C]], [[Protein S deficiency|protein S]], or [[antithrombin III deficiency]] is sometimes recommended but these are more usually responsible for [[venous thrombosis]] than arterial problems.

Imaging studies are rarely required to diagnose VBI, but sometimes [[computed tomography]] (CT) is performed first.  The CT is extremely sensitive in detecting hemorrhage.  However, [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is superior to the CT in detecting ischemic changes in the vertebrobasilar distribution.  [[Magnetic resonance angiography]] (MRA) also can be used to identify vertebrobasilar stenoses or occlusions, but it can often overestimate the degree of stenosis, or wrongly show stenosis as an occlusion. Intracranial MRA is mostly sufficient to evaluate vertebrobasilar arteries, while extracranial vertebral arteries are better diagnosed using contrast-enhanced MRA, which is less dependent on flow phenomena and more accurate in evaluating stenosis.

CT angiography is also highly accurate in evaluation vertebrobasilar vessels, but ionizing radiation and use of nephrotoxic contrast media make it less suitable both in elderly with renal insufficiency and young adults because of radiation exposure. Moreover, vessel wall calcification and beam-hardening artifacts due to dense bones or metal fillings sometimes cause strong CT-image degradation.

== Treatment ==
Patients should discuss with their physician possible causes for their VBI symptoms.  As discussed above, postural changes, exercise, and dehydration are some of the likely culprits.  Treatment usually involves lifestyle modifications.  For example, if VBI is attributed mainly to postural changes, patients are advised to slowly rise to standing position after sitting for a long period of time.  An appropriate exercise regimen for each patient can also be designed in order to avoid the excessive pooling of blood in the legs.  Dehydrated patients are often advised to increase their water intake, especially in hot, dry climates.  Finally, when applicable, patients are often advised to stop smoking and to control their hypertension, diabetes, and cholesterol level.

In the event that a patient suffers a “drop attack,” and especially for the elderly population, the most important action is to be evaluated for associated head or other injuries.  To prevent drop attacks, patients are advised to “go to the ground” before the knees buckle and shortly after feeling dizzy or experiencing changes in vision.  Patients should not be concerned about the social consequences of suddenly sitting on the floor, whether in the mall or sidewalk, as such actions are important in preventing serious injuries.

Sometimes, to prevent further occlusion of blood vessels, patients are started on an antiplatelet agent (aspirin, clopidogrel, or aspirin/dipyridamole) or sometimes an anticoagulant (warfarin) once hemorrhage has been excluded with imaging.

For treatment of vertebrobasilar stenosis due to atherosclerosis, researchers from Stanford University found that intracranial angioplasty can be performed with an annual stroke rate in the territory of treatment of 3.2% and 4.4% for all strokes, including periprocedural events. Randomized control trials need to be performed.&lt;ref name="pmid16497979"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Marks MP, Wojak JC, Al-Ali F, etal |title=Angioplasty for symptomatic intracranial stenosis: clinical outcome |journal=Stroke |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=1016–20 |year=2006 |pmid=16497979 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000206142.03677.c2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of VBI increases with age and typically occurs in the seventh or eighth decade of life. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Reflecting [[atherosclerosis]], which is the most common cause of VBI, it affects men twice as often as women and patients with [[hypertension]], [[diabetes]], smoking, and dyslipidemias have a higher risk of developing VBI. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

VBI, often provoked by sudden and temporary drops in blood pressure, can cause transient ischemic attacks.  Postural changes (see [[orthostatic hypotension]]), such as getting out of bed too quickly or standing up after sitting for extended periods of time, often provoke these attacks.  Exercise of the legs, or the sudden cessation of leg exercises, may also bring on the symptoms of VBI. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} For the sedentary older subject, going up a flight of stairs or walking the dog may be enough to cause pooling of blood in the legs and a drop in blood pressure in the distal arteries of the head.  Heat and [[dehydration]] may also be contributing causes.

Mechanical forces acting upon the neck at any age can cause VBI by exacerbating arterial insufficiency or outright occluding one or both vertebrobasilar arteries.  Internal forces include those caused by turning the head to an extreme angle to the side, especially with the neck extended.  The patient can create this condition while driving a vehicle in reverse, shooting a bow and arrow, bird watching, or stargazing. {{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} There was a study demonstrating the relationship between VBI and yoga practice,&lt;ref&gt;Hanus SH, Homer TD, Harter DH. Vertebral Artery Occlusion Complicating Yoga Exercises. Arch Neurol. 1977;34(9):574-575. doi:10.1001/archneur.1977.00500210076015&lt;/ref&gt; though this subject is in need of updated research. External forces include those caused by sports or other physical contact.

== History ==
VBI was first reported in the early 1990s when an American [[neurologist]] identified five patients who suffered strokes as a result of prolonged distortion of their necks from sitting at salon wash basins.

In 1997 medical journal The Lancet published a report by two British doctors about a 42-year-old woman who suffered a stroke after having her hair washed.&lt;ref&gt;BBC, Warning over 'hair salon stroke', http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3654987.stm, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The experts said the stroke was due to "dissection of her right internal carotid artery. Her head had been extended backwards for about five minutes while being washed and after the treatment she felt numb and suffered slurred speech."&lt;ref&gt;GMTV, Beauty Parlour Syndrome, http://www.gm.tv/articles/gmtv-today/april-2004/10432-beauty-parlour-syndrome.html, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  It is worth noting that, although this is a classic example of "Beauty Parlour Syndrome", the artery involved was not part of the vertebrobasilar system and the stroke resulted from acute dissection not chronic insufficiency.

The doctors recommended that hairdressers use a cushion and that the neck is not overextended.  As a result, several sink cushions have been developed. Trainee hairdressers are also being taught to make sure that their clients are comfortable. Several recent studies of the causes of strokes have identified how salon washing basins exert stress on the neck, causing the [[carotid]] or [[vertebral]] arteries to tear.{{mcn|date=June 2015}}

Other such triggers, which normally require ten minutes of neck over-extension, include fairground rides, dentists’ chairs, sit-up exercises and yoga. Another cause, known as Golden Gate Bridge Syndrome, is prompted by excessive strain of looking up.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''William Henry Herriman''' (7 February 1829 – 26 July 1918)&lt;ref name=cemet&gt;Name search, [http://www.cemeteryrome.it/infopoint/EnCerca.asp Cimitero Acattolico Di Roma], 11 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituaries, ''[[New York Times]]'', 31 July 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; was an expatriate American [[art collector]] in Rome who, on his death, left important works of art to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[Brooklyn Museum]].

==Herriman family==
William Henry Herriman was the second son (and third child) of the wealthy Brooklyn businessman and President of [[Long Island Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Bankers' Magazine and Statistical Register|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3w4AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA638|volume= 21|page=638|year=1867}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William S. Herriman]] and his wife Maria Belle Stillwell Frecke/Freeke. William H. married Elizabeth Herriman née Wyckoff (23 April 1834 – 5 May 1910).

His sister was Caroline Herriman Polhemus (died 1906), the wife of Henry Ditmas Polhemus. After his death, she founded the [[Polhemus Memorial Clinic]], the first "skyscraper hospital", in honour of her late husband, who had served as the Regent of [[Long Island College Hospital]] (LICH) from 1872 until his death in 1895.&lt;ref name=Eagle&gt;"Death of the Widow of the Late Henry D. Polhemus" in ''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', 1 November 1906. [http://fultonhistory.com/Fulton.html fultonhistory.com] Retrieved 15 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She also founded the Herriman Home in Monsey, Rockland County.&lt;ref name=DSU/&gt;

==Life in Rome==
Herriman and his wife first lived in Brooklyn, New York, but moved to Rome in 1865. Their friend, [[Maitland Armstrong]], said of them: "They exercised a quiet and generous hospitality in their delightful apartment, and were among the best friends the American artists had, for they bought their pictures, befriended them in their need, nursed them in sickness, and lent them money when they were hard up. Mr. Herriman was a wise collector, not only of pictures but of all sorts of rare objects of art."&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Maitland. Margaret Armstrong (Ed.) (1920) [https://archive.org/stream/daybeforeyesterd00armsrich#page/222/mode/2up/ ''Day before Yesterday: Reminiscences of a Varied Life''.] New York: Scribner, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donations==
[[File:Jean-François Millet - Shepherd Tending His Flock - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|''Shepherd Tending His Flock.'' Jean-François Millet, 1860–63. Oil on canvas.]]
Herriman left a large number of works to the Brooklyn Museum on his death, including [[Jean-François Millet]]'s 1860s painting, ''Shepherd Tending His Flock''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/11703/Shepherd_Tending_His_Flock Shepherd Tending His Flock] Brooklyn Museum, 2014.

'''Winner-take-all''' is a computational principle applied in computational [[models of neural network]]s by which [[neuron]]s in a layer compete with each other for activation. In the classical form, only the neuron with the highest activation stays active while all other neurons shut down; however, other variations allow more than one neuron to be active, for example the soft winner take-all, by which a power function is applied to the neurons.

==Neural networks==
In the theory of [[artificial neural network]]s, '''winner-take-all''' networks are a case of [[competitive learning]] in [[recurrent neural network]]s. Output nodes in the network mutually inhibit each other, while simultaneously activating themselves through reflexive connections. After some time, only one node in the output layer will be active, namely the one corresponding to the strongest input. Thus the network uses nonlinear inhibition to pick out the largest of a set of inputs. Winner-take-all is a general computational primitive that can be implemented using different types of neural network models, including both continuous-time and spiking networks (Grossberg, 1973; Oster et al. 2009).

Winner-take-all networks are commonly used in computational models of the brain, particularly for distributed decision-making or [[Winner-take-all in action selection|action selection]] in the [[cortex (anatomy)|cortex]]. Important examples include hierarchical models of vision (Riesenhuber et al. 1999), and models of selective attention and recognition (Carpenter and Grossberg, 1987; Itti et al. 1998). They are also common in artificial neural networks and neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits. It has been formally proven that the winner-take-all operation is computationally powerful compared to other nonlinear operations, such as thresholding (Maass 2000).

In many practical cases, there is not only a single neuron which becomes the only active one but there are exactly ''k'' neurons which become active for a fixed number ''k''. This principle is referred to as '''k-winners-take-all'''.

==Circuit example==
[[Image:Wta 2input.png|thumb|200px|right|A two-input CMOS winner-take-all circuit]]

A simple, but popular [[CMOS]] winner-take-all circuit is shown on the right. This circuit was originally proposed by Lazzaro et al. (1989) using MOS transistors biased to operate in the weak-inversion or subthreshold regime. In the particular case shown there are only two inputs (''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',2&lt;/sub&gt;), but the circuit can be easily extended to multiple inputs in a straightforward way. It operates on continuous-time input signals (currents) in parallel, using only two transistors per input. In addition, the bias current ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''BIAS''&lt;/sub&gt; is set by a single global transistor that is common to all the inputs.

The largest of the input currents sets the common potential ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''C''&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the corresponding output carries almost all the bias current, while the other outputs have currents that are close to zero. Thus, the circuit selects the larger of the two input currents, i.e., if ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',2&lt;/sub&gt;, we get ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''OUT'',1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''BIAS''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''OUT'',2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. Similarly, if ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',1&lt;/sub&gt;, we get ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''OUT'',1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''OUT'',2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''BIAS''&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Wta 2input sim.png|thumb|300px|right|Simulation of the two-input CMOS winner-take-all circuit]]

A [[SPICE]]-based DC simulation of the CMOS winner-take-all circuit in the two-input case is shown on the right. As shown in the top subplot, the input ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',1&lt;/sub&gt; was fixed at 6nA, while ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''IN'',2&lt;/sub&gt; was linearly increased from 0 to 10nA.  The bottom subplot shows the two output currents. As expected, the output corresponding to the larger of the two inputs carries the entire bias current (10nA in this case), forcing the other output current nearly to zero.

==Other uses==
In '''stereo matching''' algorithms, following the taxonomy proposed by Scharstein et al. (IJCV 2002), winner-take-all is a local method for disparity computation. Adopting a winner-take-all strategy, the disparity associated with the minimum or maximum cost value is selected at each pixel.

It is axiomatic that in the electronic commerce market, early dominant players such as [[AOL]] or [[Yahoo!]] get most of the rewards. By 1998, one study{{Clarifyme|date=February 2009}} found the top 5% of all web sites garnered more than 74% of all traffic.

The '''[[winner take all hypothesis]]''' suggests that once a technology or a firm gets ahead, it will do better and better over time, whereas lagging technology and firms will fall further behind.

'''XPRIZE''' is a nonprofit organization that designs and manages [[Inducement prize contest|public competitions]] intended to encourage technological development that could benefit [[human]]ity. Their Board of Trustees include [[James Cameron]], [[Larry Page]], [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Ratan Tata]] among others.

The XPRIZE mission is to bring about "radical breakthroughs for the benefit of humanity" through incentivized competition. It fosters high-profile competitions to motivate individuals, companies and organizations across all disciplines to develop innovative ideas and technologies that help solve the grand challenges that restrict humanity's progress.

The highest-profile XPRIZE to date was the [[Ansari X Prize]] relating to spacecraft development awarded in 2004. This prize was intended to inspire research and development into technology for space exploration.

==Background==
[[File:SpaceShipOne Takeoff photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|SpaceShipOne Takeoff]]
[[Image:Ansari X-Prize Check.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The first, titled the Ansari XPRIZE, was presented on November 6, 2004.]]
The first XPRIZE – the Ansari XPRIZE – was inspired by the [[Orteig Prize]], a $25,000 prize offered in 1919 by French hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris. In 1927, underdog [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the [[Spirit of St. Louis]]. In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.

In 1996, entrepreneur [[Peter Diamandis]] offered a $10-million prize to the first privately financed team that could build and fly a three-passenger vehicle 100 kilometers into space twice within two weeks. The contest, later titled the Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight, motivated 26 teams from seven nations to invest more than $100 million in pursuit of the $10 million purse. On October 4, 2004, the Ansari XPRIZE was won by [[Mojave Aerospace Ventures]], who successfully completed the contest in their spacecraft [[SpaceShipOne]]. The prize was awarded in a ceremony at the [[Saint Louis Science Center]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spaceship team gets its $10 million prize|author=Boyle, Alan|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=November 6, 2004|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6421889/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/spaceship-team-gets-its-million-prize/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the Science Center maintains numerous exhibits about the XPRIZE.

The foundation has also created the [[X Prize Cup|XPRIZE Cup]] rocket challenge competition.

==XPRIZE unifying principles==
XPRIZES are monetary rewards to incentivize three primary goals:

*Attract investment from outside the sector that takes new approaches to difficult problems.
*Create significant results that are real and meaningful. Competitions have measurable goals, and are created to promote adoption of the innovation.
*Cross national and disciplinary boundaries to encourage teams around the world to invest the intellectual and financial capital required to solve difficult challenges.

Other organizations such as the Nobel Prize committee award prizes and financial rewards to individuals or organizations that produce novel advances in science, medicine and technology. One difference between the XPRIZES and other similar organizations is awarding prizes based on the first to achieve objective 'finish line' requirements rather than a selection committee discussing the relative merits of different endeavors. For instance, the [[Archon Genomics XPRIZE]] target was to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days or less, with less than one error per 100,000 DNA base pairs, covering 98% of the genome and costing less than $10,000 per genome (this prize was cancelled because it was outpaced by innovation).

The prize can increase attention to endeavors that otherwise might not receive much publicity. For example, attempts in the recent Lunar Lander competition have been well publicized in the media, increasing visibility of both the foundation and the participants.

With the Ansari XPRIZE, XPRIZE established a model in which offering a prize for achieving a specific goal can stimulate entrepreneurial investment. Since then, new challenges have expanded into a range of other fields. XPRIZE is developing new prizes in Exploration (Space and Oceans), Life Sciences, Energy &amp; Environment, Education and Global Development. Some hope the prizes will help improve lives, create equity of opportunity and stimulate new, important discoveries.

==Prizes and events overseen==

As of January 2018, there are seven completed contests, eight active contests and one contest that has been canceled.

===Past contests===

====1996–2004 Ansari XPRIZE for Suborbital Spaceflight====
{{main|Ansari X Prize}}
[[File:SpaceShipOne test pilot Mike Melvill after the launch in pursuit of the Ansari X Prize on September 29, 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Astronaut [[Mike Melvill]] after his award-winning September 29, 2004 spaceflight]]
The [[Ansari X PRIZE|Ansari XPRIZE]] for Suborbital Spaceflight was the first prize from the foundation. It successfully challenged teams to build private spaceships capable of carrying three people and fly two times within two weeks to open the space frontier. The first part of the Ansari XPRIZE requirements [[SpaceShipOne flight 15P|was fulfilled]] by [[Mike Melvill]] on September 29, 2004 On [[SpaceShipOne]], a spacecraft designed by [[Burt Rutan]] and financed by [[Paul Allen]], co-founder and former CEO of Microsoft. On that ship, Melvill broke the 100-kilometer (62.5&amp;nbsp;mi) mark, internationally recognized as the boundary of [[outer space]], winning the prize. [[Brian Binnie]] [[SpaceShipOne flight 17P|completed the second part]] of the requirements on October 4, 2004. As a result, US$10 million was awarded to the winner, but more than $100 million was invested in new technologies in pursuit of the prize. Today, [[Sir Richard Branson]], [[Jeff Bezos]] and others are creating a personal spaceflight industry.

Awarding this first prize gave XPRIZE as much publicity as the winners themselves. After the 2004 success there was ample media coverage to afford both Scaled Composites and XPRIZE additional support for them to expand and continue to pursue their aims. Following this early success several other XPRIZES were announced that have yet to be awarded despite various attempts to meet the requirements.

The Ansari XPRIZE won the [[Space Foundation]]'s Douglas S. Morrow Public Outreach Award in 2005. The award is given annually to an individual or organization that has made significant contributions to public awareness of space programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |title=Symposium Awards &amp;#124; National Space Symposium |website=Web.archive.org |date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203060101/http://www.nationalspacesymposium.org/symposium-awards |archivedate=February 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007–2018 Google Lunar XPRIZE====
{{main|Google Lunar X Prize}}
The [[Google Lunar X PRIZE|Google Lunar XPRIZE]] was introduced on September 13, 2007. The goal of the prize was similar to that of the Ansari XPRIZE, to inspire a new generation of private investment in space exploration and technology. The challenge called for teams to compete in successfully launching, landing, and operating a rover on the [[lunar surface]]. The prize was going to award $20 million to the first team to land a rover on the moon that successfully roved more than 500 meters and transmitted back high definition images and video. There was a $5 million second prize, as well as $5 million in potential bonus prizes for extra features such as roving long distances (greater than 5,000 meters) capturing images of man-made objects on the moon, or surviving a lunar night.

On January 23, 2018, the prize ended when no team was able to schedule, confirm and pay for a launch attempt. The X Prize Foundation announced that "no team would be able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the 31 March 2018 deadline... and the US$30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE will go unclaimed."&lt;ref name=sn20170123&gt;

====2016-2018 Water Abundance XPRIZE====
On October 20, 2018, the XPRIZE Foundation awarded The Water Abundance XPRIZE, which launched on October 24, 2016 with a purse of $1.75 million provided by the [[Tata Group]] and [[Australian Aid]], to the Skysource/Skywater Alliance based in Venice, California, who received a grand prize of $1.5 million. An additional award of $150,000 went to the second place team, JMCC WING, based in South Point, Hawaii, to acknowledge the team’s ingenuity in developing a unique technological approach. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GRAND PRIZE WINNER IN $1.75M WATER ABUNDANCE XPRIZE ANNOUNCED AT XPRIZE VISIONEERING 2018 Oct 22 2018 |url=https://water.xprize.org/prizes/water-abundance/articles/waxp-grand-prize-winner |website=Creating Water From Thin Air |publisher=XPRIZE |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winning system was based on three Skywater 300 [[atmospheric water generator]]s powered by an [[All Power Labs]] (APL) PP30 [[Biomass]] [[Gasifier]] Genset installed at the APL facility in Berkeley, California. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=XPrize-winning team sources fresh water from the air |url=https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/design-and-architecture/xprize-winning-team-sources-fresh-water-from-the-air |website=KCRW Design and Architecture Podcast Transcript |publisher=KCRW |accessdate=26 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a 24 hour period ending on September 29, 2018, the system succeeded in extracting over 2,000 liters of water from the atmosphere and additional residual moisture from the drying of the woodchips used to fuel the gasifier. Their system, as required by the prize rules, used 100% renewable energy and resulted in a final cost of less than 2 cents per liter. The team, composed of David Hertz, Laura Doss-Hertz, and Richard Groden from Skysource and Jim Mason from APL along with Bear Kaufman, Jay Hasty and the rest of their staff from APL and Skywater, intend to use the award to productize the system to address water scarcity in the developing world. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=XPRIZE | title=With Two New Competitions, XPRIZE Tackles Water Scarcity and Women's Safety | url=https://water.xprize.org/press-release/two-new-competitions-xprize-tackles-water-scarcity-and-womens-safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rogers |first1=John |title=Water out of thin air: California couple's device wins $1.5M |url=https://www.apnews.com/88077278c6b04658952ad7a148219b73 |accessdate=26 October 2018 |publisher=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canceled contests===

====2006–2013 Archon Genomics XPRIZE====
{{main|Archon X Prize}}
The Archon Genomics XPRIZE, the second XPRIZE to be offered by the foundation, was announced October 4, 2006. The goal of the Archon Genomics XPRIZE was to greatly reduce the cost and increase the speed of [[human genome]] sequencing to create a new era of personalized, predictive and preventive medicine, eventually transforming medical care from reactive to proactive. The $10 million prize purse was promised to the first team that can build a device and use it to sequence 100 human genomes within 10 days or less, with an accuracy of no more than one error in every 100,000 bases sequenced, with sequences accurately covering at least 98% of the genome, and at a recurring cost of no more than $1,000 per [[genome]].

If more than one team attempted the competition at the same time, and more than one team fulfilled all the criteria, then teams would have been ranked according to the time of completion. No more than three teams would have been ranked and would have shared the purse in the following manner: $7.5 million to the winner and $2.5 million to the second place team if two teams were successful, or $7 million, $2 million and $1 million if three teams are successful.

Actual competition events were originally scheduled to take place twice a year with all eligible teams given the opportunity to make an attempt, starting at precisely the same time as the other teams. This was changed to a single competition scheduled for September 5, 2013 to October 1, 2013, which was canceled on August 22, 2013. The rationale for the change was articulated by the CEO: "Today, companies can do this for less than $5,000 per genome, in a few days or less – and are moving quickly towards the goals we set for the prize. For this reason, we have decided to cancel an XPRIZE for the first time ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Huffington Post | date=August 22, 2013 | author= Peter Diamandis | title=Outpaced by Innovation: Canceling an XPRIZE | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-diamandis/outpaced-by-innovation-ca_b_3795710.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014 The Global Learning XPRIZE====
The Global Learning XPRIZE, launched in September 2014, is a $15-million prize to create mobile apps to improve reading, writing, and arithmetic in developing nations. Each application will be developed during an 18-month period and the top five teams will receive $1 million each, with each of the winning apps being made available under an open source license. The finalist of the group, that then develops an app producing the highest performance gains, will win an additional $10 million top prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New $15 million Global Learning XPRIZE wants to disrupt education as we know it|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2014/09/22/new-15-million-global-learning-xprize-wants-to-disrupt-education-as-we-know-it/|author=Dominic Basulto|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=September 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014 IBM Watson A.I. XPRIZE ====
