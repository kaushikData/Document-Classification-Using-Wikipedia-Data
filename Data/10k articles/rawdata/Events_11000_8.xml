      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">'''The 2010 Guangxi Wildfire''' occurred in western [[Guangxi]], [[China]] during that year's spring season.

==Background==
On Thursday, March 3, 2010, a [[wildfire]] ignited in the mountainous county of [[Longlin]] in Guangxi, China. [[Drought]] had already begun to impact the area previously, and the dry weather and lack of water contributed to the fire's success.&lt;ref name="Relief Web 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xinhua|last2=Xuequan|first2=Mu|title=More efforts needed to fight drought in SW China, says vice premier|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/china/more-efforts-needed-fight-drought-sw-china-says-vice-premier|website=Reliefweb.int|publisher=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Relief Web 3"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oxfam|title=Oxfam provides water in China's worst drought in decades: 10 Million people short of drinking water|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/china/oxfam-provides-water-chinas-worst-drought-decades-10-million-people-short-drinking|website=Reliefweb.int|publisher=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wildfire burned large volumes of forests and brush until it was finally put out six days and twenty-two hours later.&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xinhua|title=S China forest fire threatens nature reserve|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-03/04/content_9538253.htm|website=chinadaily.com|publisher=China Daily Information Co|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
According to Longlin County's fire control headquarters, a day after its ignition the fire had already burned 1,400 [[Chinese units of measurement|Mu]] (or about 93 [[hectares]] or 229 [[acres]]) of forestland, with a front spanning 5.3 kilometers. The fire was also heading towards the Zhongshan National Nature Reserve, where over two hundred of the endangered black-necked pheasant lived and were at risk of being affected by the traveling flames.&lt;ref name="China Daily" /&gt;

Along with the area's locals, over one hundred firefighters and a [[Mi-26 helicopter]] were employed to suppress the fire.

After the fire was suppressed, the drought continued to worsen in the southern China region, especially in Guangxi.&lt;ref name="Relief Web 4"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Xinhua|title=Severe drought expands in S China region|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/china/severe-drought-expands-s-china-region|website=Reliefweb.int|publisher=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Relief Web 5"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies|title=China: Floods Information bulletin no 1|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/51049192CB2B44828525774C004FE5A6-Full_Report.pdf|website=Reliefweb.int|publisher=United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|accessdate=23 November 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after the fire, torrential rain caused flash floods and landslides in the same area.&lt;ref name="Relief Web 5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, State of the Climate: Global Hazards for June 2010, published online July 2010, retrieved on November 23, 2015 from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/hazards/201006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier''''' (2007) is a memoir written by [[Ishmael Beah]], an author from Sierra Leone. The book is a firsthand account of Beah's time as a [[child soldier]] during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war in Sierra Leone]] (1990s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeleza.com/books/books-african-studies/long-way-gone-memoirs-boy-soldier |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726133228/http://www.zeleza.com/books/books-african-studies/long-way-gone-memoirs-boy-soldier |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beah ran away from his village at the age of 12 after it was attacked by rebels, and he became forever separated from his immediate family. He wandered the war-filled country and was forced to join an army unit who brainwashed him into using guns and drugs. By 13, he had perpetuated and witnessed a great deal of violence. At the age of 16, however, [[UNICEF]] removed him from the unit and put him into a rehabilitation program. There he was able to find his uncle that would adopt him. With the help of some of the staff he was able to return to a civilian life and get off drugs. He was then given an opportunity to teach others about child soldiers. He traveled the United States recounting his story.

==Main character list==
'''Ishmael Beah:''' At the beginning of the book, he is a young boy whose parents are separated and loves performing rap with his elder brother and friends. After armed forced attack his home village, he, his brother, and friends are left orphans and wander around seeking shelter. Ishmael is eventually claimed as a child soldier for the Sierra Leone Armed Forces at age 13. After being rescued by [[UNICEF]] at 16, he is rehabilitated and begins to live with his Uncle Tommy. While there, he is recruited to travel to the United States to speak at a [[United Nations]] event about child soldiers. Returning to [[Freetown, Sierra Leone|Freetown]] after his speaking event, he eventually made his way back to the United States. After a time, he was able to forgive himself and love once again.

'''Junior Beah:'''  Ishmael's older brother by one year. He is eventually separated from Ishmael during the attack on the village of Kamator, where they were seeking refuge in. 

'''Alhaji:''' One of Ishmael’s closest friends. Alhaji was part of the group of boys from Mattru Jong that Ishmael met in the wilderness. Alhaji and Ishmael formed a close bond during their years as soldiers and were part of the same squad. Alhaji was nicknamed "[[John Rambo| Little Rambo]]" for his combat skills that were heavily influenced by the film. Alhaji and Ishmael were eventually taken by UNICEF and put into a rehabilitation shelter in Freetown. He apparently moved from foster home to foster home following the events of the book.

'''Kanei, Musa, Saidu, Jumah, and Moriba:''' Ishmael’s friends from his home village whom he meets in the wilderness after being separated from his initial group. Saidu is the first of the group to die; he dies suddenly two nights after he and the other boys eat a crow that fell from the sky. Kanei is the oldest of the group by three years, although Alhaji is confused as being older because he is taller. He becomes a junior sergeant and later is chosen to stay behind because he is older while Alhaji and Ishmael are sent to rehabilitation. It is unknown what happens to him. Musa is the group's storyteller. He is killed in the first battle that Ishmael and his squad fight in. Jumah and Moriba also become part of the army. Jumah is assigned to another squad in a different village and is last seen preparing for another village raid. Moriba is killed in a fight sometime during Ishmael's time as a soldier. 

'''Talloi, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou:''' Ishmael's initial traveling companions. Talloi is Junior's friend and follows them to Mattru Jong for the contest. The three meet up with old friends, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou there. They escape the attack of Mattru Jong by RUF forces, but are later split apart by another attack in a different village. Ishmael found Kaloko hiding as well, but Beah subsequently left him once he grew tired of hiding, and Kaloko was unwilling to follow him. It is unknown what happened to the four boys.

'''Uncle Tommy:''' Ishmael’s Uncle. Uncle Tommy is a carpenter with three kids and a wife, all of whom welcome Ishmael as their new brother. They all love Ishmael irrevocably, and unconditionally. Uncle Tommy and his wife are the only ones who know about Ishmael's past. However, they forgive him and take him in as their own son right away. Ishmael truly feels like he belongs when he is with them. Uncle Tommy later dies of sickness.

'''Esther:''' A nurse at the shelter whom Ishmael develops a friendship with. Ishmael tells parts of his war stories and dreams to Esther and soon comes to fully trust her. Esther gives Ishmael a [[Walkman]] with a [[Run–D.M.C.]] [[Cassette tape|cassette]] and later buys him a [[Bob Marley]] cassette. Esther does regular check-ups on Ishmael's mental health during his period of rehabilitation at Benin Home. Ishmael admits that he loves her, but never sees her again after he leaves Freetown.

'''Mambu:''' Another child soldier with the Sierra Leone Armed Forces. Mambu and Ishmael meet at the shelter for the first time. They become close friends. He later goes back to the front lines after his family rejects taking him in.

'''Mohamed:''' Ishmael’s best friend from his home village, whom Ishmael is reunited with at the UNICEF rehabilitation center where Ishmael has already been for several months. Mohamed was meant to go with Ishmael to the talent show in the beginning of the story but had to stay behind to help his father work.

==Plot summary==

===Before the RUF attack===
The book starts with Ishmael Beah, his older brother Junior, and their friend Talloi traveling from their village of Mogbwemo to Mattru Jong in order to perform in a talent show. Ishmael, Junior, and their friend dance and sing [[rap music]]. Thinking they would return the following day, they tell no one of their leaving.

===RUF attacks and flight===
During their stay in Mattru Jong with Gibrilla, Khalilou, and Kaloko, the RUF attacks. The three are able to flee the village without the rebels following them. They decide to head back home. On the way, it turns out that their village was also captured by the RUF. According to an old man who was sitting outside the village, most of the people had fled to a village on the Sierra Leone coast.

Ishmael, Junior, and their friend decide to travel there in order to locate their families. On their way, they encounter multiple other villages. They are accepted into another village on the grounds that they help with the farming. After months, the village is attacked. Caught by surprise, Ishmael, Junior, and their friend split up and run into the swamps.

It is unknown what happens to his friends afterwards. Ishmael roams around the wilderness by himself for a while, until he meets up with another group of traveling boys whom he recognizes from his home village. The boys then travel together to another village on the coast. Many refugees fled to this village because the [[Sierra Leone Armed Forces]] occupied it. In search of safety, the group of boys and Ishmael go to that village, but soon leave.

Ishmael then learns from a woman from his hometown that Junior, his younger brother Ibrahim, and his parents are safe in another village with many others from Mattru Jong. Just before they reach the village, the boys meet a man named Gasemu whom Ishmael knew from Mattru Jong. Gasemu tells them that Ishmael's family are indeed safe in the village, and ask the boys to help him carry bananas back to that village. However, moments before they reach the town, it is attacked by the RUF.

Although their bodies are not found among the dead or in the burning house where they lived, Ishmael assumes that his family is dead. Devastated, and believing that Gasemu is to blame for his not being able to see his family on time, Ishmael attacks Gasemu but is stopped by the other boys. They are then chased into the forest by remaining RUF soldiers, and Gasemu dies from being shot, leaving Ishmael more saddened.

===Recruitment and life as a child soldier===
The boys then settle into another village protected by the army. After many uneventful days, the lieutenant in charge of the troops in the village announced that the RUF was beginning to assault the village. The lieutenant said that in order for the people to survive, they must contribute to the war effort by enlisting in the army; escape was not an option. By doing this, the lieutenant secures many [[child soldiers]], the weapon of choice for both the RUF and the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.

Ishmael becomes a junior lieutenant for his skill in executing [[prisoners of war]] and is put in charge of a small group of other child soldiers. As a child soldier Ishmael is exposed to extreme violence and drug usage. The drugs he used are described in the book as "[[brown-brown|brown brown]]", "white pills", cocaine, and [[marijuana]].

===Rescue and rehabilitation===
In January 1996, during one of the roll calls, a group of men wearing [[UNICEF]] shirts round up several boys and takes them to a shelter in Sierra Leone's capital, [[Freetown, Sierra Leone|Freetown]], where they and several other child soldiers are to be rehabilitated. However, the children cause much trouble for the volunteer staffers at the facility, with Ishmael experiencing symptoms of [[drug withdrawal]] as well as troubling memories of his time as a child soldier.

Despite the violence caused by the children, one of the staffers, Nurse Esther, becomes interested in Ishmael, learning about his childhood love of [[Hip hop music|rap music]] and purchasing him a rap [[Compact cassette|cassette]] and [[Walkman]], when she takes Ishmael and his friend Alhaji to the city. It is through this connection and his numerous counseling experiences with Esther that Ishmael eventually turns away from his violent self and starts to heal from his mental wounds.

===Adoption===
Eventually, Ishmael becomes adopted by his Uncle Tommy in the city and settles down with him and his family on the outskirts of Freetown. It is during this time that Ishmael is chosen to speak to the [[United Nations]] (UN) in [[New York City]] about his experiences as a child soldier and the other problems plaguing his country.

While at the UN meeting, Ishmael met several other children who were also experiencing problems in their countries. There were 57 children present at the meeting, and each told his or her story to the UN. Ishmael also meets Laura Simms, his chaperone, who is a [[Storytelling|storyteller]] and his future foster mother.

===Return to Sierra Leone and flight abroad===
In 1996, when Ishmael returns to Sierra Leone, Freetown is invaded by a combination of the RUF and the Sierra Leonean government army, causing many civilian deaths, including the death of Uncle Tommy from malady. Believing that he can no longer stay in Freetown for fear of either becoming a soldier again or of being killed by his former army friends if he refused, Ishmael decides to get in contact with Laura Simms.  He then escapes Sierra Leone and crosses the border into [[Guinea]], where he eventually makes his way to the [[United States]] and his new life abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beah, Ishmael|title= A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier|publisher= New York: Sarah Crichton Books|year= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
''A Long Way Gone'' was nominated for a [[Quill Awards|Quill Award]] in the Best Debut Author category for 2007.  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 3, and praising it as "painfully sharp", and its ability to take "readers behind the dead eyes of the child-soldier in a way no other writer has."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1691772,00.html|title=Top 10 Nonfiction Books - Top 10 Everything of 2007 - TIME|date=9 December 2007|work=TIME.com|first=Lev|last=Grossman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was also included in Amazon's 100 books to read in a lifetime list.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon, 100 books to read in a lifetime, https://www.amazon.com/100books&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Accuracy dispute{{anchor|Credibility}}==
In 2009,  ''[[The Australian]]'' reported that aspects of Beah's account of his life story did not match other evidence. The report claimed that Beah's village was destroyed in 1995 rather than 1993, and that given the more compressed time frame, he could not have been a soldier for more than a couple of months, rather than the years that he describes in his book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23075054-32682,00.html |title=Twist in the tale of a child soldier |website= TheAustralian.news.com |access-date=2008-06-28 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080302044216/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23075054-32682,00.html |archive-date=2008-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would also have been aged 15 when he became a soldier, rather than 13. Questions were also raised about Beah's description of a battle between child soldiers at a UNICEF camp, in which 6 people were said to have been killed. Witnesses interviewed by ''The Australian'' said that such an event in a UNICEF camp would have drawn significant attention in Sierra Leone, but no independent verification of such a battle could be obtained. Investigations by other publications also failed to discover other evidence of such a battle, and UNICEF, while supportive of Beah in general, also said that it had not been able to verify this aspect of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Clancy, [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/unicef-cannot-confirm-beahs-camp-brawl-claim-6661434 "UNICEF Cannot Confirm Beah's Camp Brawl Claim"], ''Village Voice,'', March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Australian's'' claims were subsequently denied in a statement issued by Beah, in which he called into question the reliability of the sources quoted. The statement also cited the fact that during the early stages of its research, the newspaper had investigated the possibility that Beah's father was still alive, a possibility that was based on mistaken identity by an Australian mining engineer. The ''Australian's'' published articles stated that they had established that the man in question was not Beah's father.

Beah's adoptive mother also reaffirmed her belief in the validity of the dates, quoting two Sierra Leonean sources who corroborated the chronology of events given in his book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Ishmael+Beah+Defends+Himself+and+His+Memoirs+Against+Accusations+of...-a01611440644 Beah defends books against charges of lies – 1/23/2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the publisher amended this statement after ''The Australian'' objected that it seriously misrepresented the newspaper's report. The source cited by the publisher, Leslie Mboka, National Chairman of the Campaign for Just Mining, was in fact quoted by ''The Australian.'' The newspaper quoted him as saying that Beah "was a young child who had been through terrible things so he could easily have got things mixed up." Mboka, when subsequently contacted by the publisher, reported to them that he had vigorously supported Beah's chronology when interviewed by ''The Australian,'' and had challenged the paper for bias. However, Mboka had not met Beah until after the disputed events had taken place, and so was unable to provide firsthand verification of his account.&lt;ref name=voice&gt;Graham Rayman, [http://www.villagevoice.com/news/boy-soldier-of-fortune-6392932 "Boy Soldier of Fortune"], ''Village Voice'', March 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The other correction involved the newspaper's publication, not of Beah's foster-mother's ''address'' but of her publicly listed website address; hate mail had indeed been received, but via the Internet.  While the publisher made note of these, it stood by the accuracy of the book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebookstandard.com/bookstandard/news/publisher/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003701527 The Book Standard is closed&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute over Beah's credibility arose at a time when the exposure of some "fictional" memoirs, such as [[Margaret Seltzer]]'s account of growing up in a Los Angeles crime gang&lt;ref&gt;Motoko Rich, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/books/04fake.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin "Gang Memoir, Turning Page, Is Pure Fiction"], ''The New York Times'', March 4, 2008.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Frey]]'s account of drug addiction, had led to debate over the nature of the genre. The controversy was followed up in international publications including the British ''[[Sunday Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article3294474.ece Bryan Appleyard's full account of his interview with Ishmael Beah], Times Online.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Sherman, [http://www.slate.com/id/2185928/ "The feud over Ishmael Beah's child-soldier memoir, A Long Way Gone"], Slate Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref name=voice /&gt;

Beah had claimed to have a "photographic memory", which enabled him to have perfect recall of the events he described, leaving him "less room to maneuver" than if he had allowed room for human error.&lt;ref name=voice /&gt; However, some of his defenders as well as his critics allowed for the possibility that his account was not entirely accurate, stating that the main point was that he had drawn attention to an issue that was of vital importance. Possible explanations for any inaccuracies include the trauma of war as experienced by a young child, the drug use described in his account, and the possibility that Beah was tacitly encouraged by outsiders to compile stories from multiple sources into a singular autobiographical account.

[[Neil Boothby]], an academic who has undertaken extensive research into children and war, said that while all of the atrocities described by Beah have occurred at various points, it would be highly unusual for one child to have experienced them all. Boothby criticized the mentality that provided attention only to those with the most horrific stories to tell, thus encouraging exaggeration. "I've seen it over and over. Whether by psychologists or journalists, they are encouraged to tell the sensational stories...The system is set up to reward sensational stories. We all need to look at why does something have to be so horrific before we open our eyes and ears and hearts?"&lt;ref name=voice /&gt;

The '''B96 Pepsi SummerBash''' is an annual concert&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Tribune Staff. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-06-11/entertainment/ct-ott-0611-b96-summerbash-burbs-20100611_1_toyota-park-pop-tailgate "B96 summer music festival of pop"], ''Chicago Tribune'', June 11, 2010, accessed February 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; typically held on a Saturday in June, in the [[Chicago]] area. First held in 1992 and presented by Chicago radio station [[WBBM-FM|B96]], the concert has been title-sponsored by [[Pepsi]] in recent years. In 2016, the event was held at [[Allstate Arena]] in the [[suburb]] of [[Rosemont, Illinois|Rosemont]]. Previously, the event was held at [[Toyota Park (Bridgeview)|Toyota Park]] in [[Bridgeview, Illinois|Bridgeview]] from 2006 to 2015. In 2006, the SummerBash was the first non-[[Association football|soccer]] event held at the stadium.&lt;ref&gt;Ziehm, Len. [http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/CSTB/lib00224,112CA296F803D418.html "Fire stoked for 'grand opening': Team promises raucous atmosphere for 2nd home game"], ''The Chicago Sun-Times'', June 25, 2006, accessed February 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other venues that have played host to the event include the [[First Midwest Bank Amphitheater]] in [[Tinley Park, Illinois|Tinley Park]], [[Route 66 Raceway|Joliet Raceway]], and [[Maywood Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[[WBBM-FM#Summer Bash concerts]]&lt;/ref&gt; all in the suburban Chicago area. Noted for featuring several marquee performers in a day-long series of sets, the event is considered to be one of the premier annual radio station concerts in the U.S. by many in the radio industry, along with events such as the [[KIIS-FM Jingle Ball|102.7 KIIS-FM's Jingle Ball]], [[Wango Tango]], [[WHTZ|Z100's]] Jingle Ball, and rock station [[KPNT|105.7 The Point - St. Louis']] Point Fest. The success of the annual SummerBash concerts allowed the station to also begin a holiday variation of the event called the B96 Jingle Bash.

The selection process for the [[1976 Winter Olympics]] consisted of four bids, and saw [[Denver]], United States, selected ahead of [[Sion, Switzerland|Sion]], Switzerland; [[Tampere]], Finland; and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada. The selection was made at the 70th IOC Session in [[Amsterdam]] on 12 May 1970.&lt;ref name=votes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesbids.com/english/archives/past.shtml |title=Past Olympic host city election results |publisher=[[GamesBids]] |accessdate=17 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5xFvf0ufx?url=http://www.gamesbids.com/eng/past.html |archivedate=17 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1972 referendum, voters in [[Colorado]] rejected funding for the games, and for the only time a city awarded the Games rejected them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |title=Colorado only state ever to turn down Olympics |date=12 October 1999 |last=Sanko |first=John |work=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |accessdate=16 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601181029/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |archivedate=1 June 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and the IOC then offered the games to [[Whistler, British Columbia]], Canada, but they too declined owing to a [[British Columbia general election, 1972|change of government]] following elections.  Whistler would go on to be associated with neighbouring [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]]'s successful bid for the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 games.]] [[Salt Lake City]] offered to host the games, but the IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined and selected [[Innsbruck]] to host the [[1976 Winter Olympics]], which had hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics]] games twelve years earlier, on 5 February 1973. Salt Lake City would later host the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4236">'''Carlo Emanuele Buscaglia''' (22 September 1915 &amp;ndash; 24 August 1944) was an Italian aviator, and one of the most famous Italian pilots of [[World War II]].

Buscaglia was born in [[Novara]], [[Piedmont]], in 1915 and entered the Italian  ''[[Accademia Aeronautica]]'' (Air Force Academy) in October 1934. In 1937 he was made ''Sottotenente'' (2nd Lieutenant).

On July 1, 1937 Buscaglia was assigned to the 50th Squadron (32nd Bomber Wing), then equipped with the obsolete [[Savoia-Marchetti S.M.81]], but later replaced with the more efficient [[Savoia-Marchetti SM.79|SM.79]]. In 1939 he was promoted to full Lieutenant. The following February he was transferred to the 252nd Squadron (46th Bomber Wing), and with this unit he took part in his first military mission, on June 21, 1940.

On 25 July he volunteered to join the ''Reparto Speciale Aerosiluranti'' ("Special Torpedo-Bomber Detachment") of the [[Regia Aeronautica]], later renamed the 240th Torpedo-Bomber Squadron, based in [[Libya]]. On the night of 17 September 1940, Buscaglia obtained his first success with a torpedo-armed SM.79, heavily damaging the cruiser [[HMS Kent (68)|HMS ''Kent'']]. In early December he also successfully attacked the cruiser [[HMS Glasgow (C21)|HMS ''Glasgow'']].

In January 1941 Buscaglia's unit was transferred to [[Catania]], from where he took part in the action with some German [[Ju 87]]s in which the carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} was badly damaged. Promoted to [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]], Buscaglia was made commander of a new torpedo unit, the 281st Squadron, based at the [[Grottaglie]] airport in [[Apulia]]. From there he took part in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]].

By 1942 Buscaglia had already obtained the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]] five times, and the German [[Iron Cross]] second class. In April he was selected to command the new 132nd Torpedo Group, subsequently sinking several ships in the Mediterranean. On 12 August of that year, together with the German ace [[Hans-Joachim Marseille]], he was received in [[Rome]] by [[Benito Mussolini]], who promoted him to [[Major]].

On 12 November 1942, during an action against the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of North Africa]], Buscaglia's aircraft was shot down by a British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]]. He was declared "killed in action" and a [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] awarded posthumously. However, although wounded and badly burned, Buscaglia had survived, having been captured by Allied troops and transferred to a prisoner-of-war camp in the [[United States]] at [[Fort Meade]].

After the [[armistice with Italy|armistice]] of 8 September 1943, Buscaglia was asked to fight alongside the Allies, as a member of the newly formed [[Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force|Aeronautica Cobelligerante del Sud]]. In the meantime, in the northern part of Italy still occupied by Germany, a wing of the [[Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana]] (the Air Force of the puppet [[Italian Social Republic]]), the ''1° Gruppo Aerosiluranti'', was named after him.

On 15 July 1944 Buscaglia assumed command of the 28th Bomber Wing, equipped with [[Martin Baltimore]]s and based on Campo Vesuvio airport, near [[Naples]]. On 23 August, while attempting to fly one of the new aircraft without an instructor, Buscaglia crashed on take-off. He died the following day in a hospital in Naples.

The 3rd Wing of the current ''[[Aeronautica Militare]] Italiana'', based at [[Villafranca di Verona]], was named after him.

'''Clio Cup China Series''' is a [[One-design|one-make series]] held in China that featured [[Renault Clio]] since 2009. Originally begun by Renault Sport in Europe, managed and organized by Formula Racing Development (FRD) in China, the Clio Cup China Series is a one-make racing series featuring the Clio supermini car.

Over the years, many experienced drivers from the region joined the race and even Hong Kong superstar [[Aaron Kwok]] once joined the series and won the Championship in 2009.

2013, there will be 10 rounds of Clio Cup China Series around China: there will be 4 races as one of the supporting race of 2013 [[China Touring Car Championship|CTCC]]. To popularise the Clio Race culture is a long term mission of FRD, Clio Cup China Series provides a superb platform to share racing passion and culture for car owners and fans. Now, the Clio Cup China Series becomes an influential racing sport in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frdsports.com/en/ClioCup Background]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race Format==
Over the race weekend, there is 1 30-minute official practice session and 2 Qualifying sessions of 30 minutes each. 2 races with no less than 40 kilometers will be held with equal points for both races.
The race grid would be determined by its respective qualifying session. Which means Qualifying 1 will determine Race 1's grid and Qualifying 2 will determine Race 2's grid.

'''Polio''' (Infantile paralysis or [[poliomyelitis]]) epidemics were a concern during the summer months for children globally, with records of polio from the Egyptians and Greeks to the 1950s epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oshinsky|first1=David M.|title=Polio : an American story|date=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-515294-4|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the summer of 1921, this epidemic became notorious when [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], the Democratic contender for the vice presidency, was struck down by polio at the age of 39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhodes|first1=John|title=The end of plagues : the global battle against infectious disease|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York City|isbn=978-1-137-27852-4|page=103|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two U.S. virologists, [[Jonas Salk]] of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Albert B. Sabin]] of the [[University of Cincinnati]] emerged as the most prominent among dozens of American researchers on the quest for a [[polio vaccine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanson|first1=William|title=Birth of a Cold War Vaccine|journal=Scientific American|date=20 March 2012|volume=306|issue=4|page=66|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0412-66|url=http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v306/n4/pdf/scientificamerican0412-66.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conis|first1=Elena|title=Political Ills|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2|pages=34–37|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/political-ills|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salk's vaccine==
By the 1950, Jonas Salk had tested both live, attenuated polio vaccines and formaldehyde killed polio vaccines in monkeys and by 1952, began testing on humans.&lt;ref name="Rhode"&gt;Rhodes 2013, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;  The killed vaccine was found to be effective, with proper filtration of the biological culture.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;Rhodes 2013, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;  A problem with this vaccine was the perception that to be adequately protected; a child had to get three Salk shots, properly spaced, and a recommended booster shot once a year, which was expensive.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky 2005, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be noted however, that Jonas Salk, himself, has stated in interviews that this perception is not at all true.  This vaccine was the first polio vaccine to receive approval of the U.S. government, and was used until 1961 in America, when the Sabin vaccine was recommended to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 2013, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swanson 2012, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sabin's vaccine==
Albert Sabin, a virologist who publicly disagreed with Salk and his killed vaccine, worked on creating a vaccine with live, attenuated vaccines.&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt;  Despite Cold War tensions, in January, 1956 [[Mikhail Chumakov]], the director of Moscow's Polio Research Institute, his wife and colleague Marina Voroshilova, and Anatoli Smorodentsev, traveled to the U.S. in order to study the Salk vaccine and visited the laboratory of Albert Sabin.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson 2012, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;  With the clearance of the FBI, Sabin flew to Leningrad in June, 1956.&lt;ref name="Rhode" /&gt;  As a result of a cooperation of Sabin and Chumakov in Leningrad, Sabin was able to test his attenuated vaccine when funding in America was declined.&lt;ref name="Rhode" /&gt;  While Sabin was working behind the Iron Curtain, the Sabin-Chumakov vaccine was determined to be safe and effective.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes 2013, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cold war tensions==
Cold War tensions caused Western scientists to refuse the reports from the Russians about the effectiveness of the Sabin vaccine.&lt;ref name="Swanson"&gt;Swanson 2012, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  However, mass vaccinations of Sabin's vaccine spread throughout Eastern Europe from 1960–1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vargha|first1=Dora|title=Between East and West: Polio Vaccination across the Iron Curtain in Cold War Hungary|journal=Bulletin of the History of Medicine|date=2014|volume=88|issue=2|pages=319–43|doi=10.1353/bhm.2014.0040|pmid=24976164|url=http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/13639/7/13639.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as some Soviet virologists did not trust the Western Salk vaccine, Americans had similar reservations about the Sabin vaccine from the Soviet side.&lt;ref&gt;Vargha 2014, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;  However other Soviet virologists argued that the Salk vaccine could be considered safe, since the Americans tested it on their own people.&lt;ref name="Vargha"&gt;Vargha 2014, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;  They considered that the Sabin vaccine must be potentially dangerous because the Americans did not wish to test it on their own society.&lt;ref name="Vargha" /&gt;

==Federal licensing==
The documented achievement of the Sabin-Chumakov collaboration eventually trumped the ideological differences of the Cold War.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt;  Their oral live-virus vaccine became federally licensed in 1962, and used for over three decades to help eliminate polio globally, replacing the Salk vaccine.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt;  Using these vaccines, the threat of polio remains only a serious threat in parts of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.&lt;ref name="Swanson" /&gt;

The '''Damascus offensive (2013)''' refers to a series of rebel operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/syria-update-southern-battlefronts | title=SYRIA UPDATE: THE SOUTHERN BATTLEFRONTS | publisher=ISW | date=5 April 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409104816/http://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/syria-update-southern-battlefronts | archivedate=9 April 2013 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that began in early February 2013 in and around the city of [[Damascus]].

On 6 February, rebel forces launched an offensive, named "Battle of Armageddon", on the edge of Central Damascus, with rebels entering the Jobar District of Damascus after overrunning a [[Syrian Army]] roadblock. Parts of the Damascus ring road which acts as a barrier between Central Damascus and [[Ghouta]] were also seized by rebel fighters. Rebels have also launched attacks on [[Adra, Syria|Adra]], north east of Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/06/us-syria-crisis-damscus-idUSBRE9150BD20130206 |title=Syrian rebels fight close to heart of Damascus |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/middleeast/syrian-war-closes-in-on-the-heart-of-damascus.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print | title=Damascus on Edge as War Seeps into Syrian Capital | work=New York Times | date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February, a rebel claimed that opposition forces had captured another military checkpoint in the Jobar district. However, [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]] stated that while fighting for the highway continued, government troops regained control of the area after bombing rebel positions the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ginsburg |first=Mitch |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/syrian-army-rebels-battle-for-key-damascus-highway/ |title=Syrian army, rebels battle for key Damascus highway |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 February, rebels began moving truckloads of anti aircraft weapons into Jobar in an effort to consolidate advances made in the Eastern Damascus district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/19/us-syria-crisis-idUSBRE91I0GK20130219 |title=Syria Scud-type missile said to kill 20 in Aleppo |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February, a [[SCUD missile]], fired by government forces, hit the command center of the [[islamist]] militia [[Liwa Al-Islam]] near [[Douma, Syria|Douma]], which had been spearheading the attack against the roundabout and the Jobar district. Sheikh Zahran Alloush, the commander and founder of the brigade, had been wounded in the strike. The area was devastated and other rebel fighters were also killed or wounded.&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/us-syria-crisis-rebel-idUSBRE91J0D420130220 |title=Missile blast wounds Syrian rebel commander: activists |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February, rebels launched 3 car bombings on security targets in the [[Barzeh, Syria|Barzeh]] neighbourhood in Damascus. Also fired several mortar rounds at the Syrian army's general staff headquarters in [[Umayyad Square]], as well as other streets and squares known to house government and security offices, according to residents and activists. [[SOHR]] claimed that 22 people, mostly soldiers, were killed in these other attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dagher |first=Sam |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323549204578317544181127314 |title=Attacks in Damascus Target Symbols of Assad Regime - WSJ.com |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2013-02-21 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February, SOHR claimed that rebels had fired several mortar shells which exploded in the military Judiciary and literature department of the [[University of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-forces-clash-with-rebels-around-aleppo-as-civil-strife-continues/2013/02/27/ee4a49fa-80dc-11e2-a671-0307392de8de_story_1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-08-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130227182233/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/syrian-forces-clash-with-rebels-around-aleppo-as-civil-strife-continues/2013/02/27/ee4a49fa-80dc-11e2-a671-0307392de8de_story_1.html |archivedate=27 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March, heavy fighting was reported in [[Darayya]] between rebels and the Syrian Army. The [[Local Coordination Committees of Syria]] claimed that rebels targeted a military column attempting to storm Darayya, and also defended several attempts by the government to storm Jobar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21641113 |title=BBC News - Syria: Fierce clashes in provincial capital Raqqa |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-02 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lccsyria.org/11032 |title=Syria Today 2-3-2013 &amp;#124; Local coordination committees of Syria |publisher=Lccsyria.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211133011/http://www.lccsyria.org/11032 |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March, rebels reportedly fired several rockets at security forces headquarters in Damascus, though it is unknown if there were any casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21647196 |title=BBC News - Rebels 'seize most of Syria police academy' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-03 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March, 30 military deserters were killed in an Army ambush near Damascus while they were heading towards the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/12/us-syria-crisis-ambush-idUSBRE92B0NT20130312 |title=Syrian forces kill 30 deserters in ambush: opposition |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March, rebels operating within Damascus launched mortar bombs at the [[Damascus Presidential Palace]], though its unclear if there were any casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/18/us-syria-crisis-rebels-idUSBRE92H0V820130318 |title=Syria rebels say fire mortars at president's palace |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March, an explosion in the Iman Mosque in [[Al-Mazraa]] district killed as much as 41 people, including [[Sunni]] cleric, Sheikh [[Mohammed al-Buti]]. Al-Buti was one of the most prominent supporters of the Syrian government from the Sunni branch of Islam in Syria. Syrian State TV claimed the explosion was a suicide bombing, though some residents claim it was caused by a mortar bomb that struck a nearby political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Muir |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21887877 |title=BBC News - Syria mosque blast: Pro-Assad cleric among dozens dead |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.aljazeera.com/liveblog/topic/syria-153 |title=Syria Live Blog - Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 March, rebels launched one of their heaviest bombardments of Central Damascus since the revolt began, with mortars reportedly hitting Umayyad Square, where Baath Party headquarters, Air Force Intelligence and state television are also located. The attack was launched when rebel forces advanced into the [[Kafr Souseh]] district of Damascus, and the Syrian Army retaliated with artillery launched from Mount Qasioun.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

'''Dirty Kuffar''' (''[[Kuffar]]'' is [[Arabic]] for "nonbelievers") is a [[controversial]] 2004 [[Jihad]] style [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] [[Hip hop music|rap]] video produced by [[Muslim]] British rappers Sheikh Terra and the Soul Salah Crew, or, as the video says: featuring the Soul Salah Crew. 

The music video begins with a [[CNN]] [[video clip]] showing US troops shooting an Iraqi individual and then rejoicing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5365.htm Information Clear Articleing House]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5369.htm Information Clearing House Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0310/26/cp.00.html CNN Full Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt; the clip is then followed by the logo, "Digihad", playing on the terms [[Digital data|Digital]] and [[Jihad]]. The Beat of Dirty Kuffar is also the same of the popular Lumidee song "Never Leave You-Uh Oh."

The soldier being interviewed at the beginning of the video&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?highlight=dirty+kuffar YouTube - Broadcast Yourself&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is allegedly called Riddle and was interviewed by [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5365.htm Take No Prisoners&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article5369.htm CNN Presents: Fit To Kill&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0310/26/cp.00.html | work=CNN | accessdate=1 May 2010 | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Digihad' logo has been [[parody|spoof]]ingly taken from the [[racist]] and [[White supremacist]] British [[Combat 18]] website logo,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skrewdriver.net/ Blood and Honour Combat 18&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skrewdriver.net/c18bonf.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; only that the [[Swastika]] has been removed.

==Significance==
Unlike any other controversial rap song or form of music, "Dirty Kuffar", as an independent song, has hit the mainstream media headlines from the day it was released in 2004 to present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6086042.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=The growth of 'online Jihadism' |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=1 May 2010 |first=Frank |last=Gardner}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1143499,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Islamic rappers' message of terror |first=Antony |last=Barnett |date=8 February 2004 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/02/13/ntrial13.xml |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |title=July 21 trial jury watch beheading videos |date=13 February 2007 |accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040209202124/http://www.pulse24.com/News/Top_Story/20040209-006/page.asp Toronto's 24 News channel, Pluse24]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1461 Al-Jazeera] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704013212/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1461 |date=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_10-2-2004_pg9_3 Pakistans Daily Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195343/http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_10-2-2004_pg9_3 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' on 17 August 2007 have said that: "Since its release, 'Dirty Kuffar' has been downloaded onto millions of computers and remixed by many like-minded web jihadists. You can find it on video-sharing sites such as YouTube."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070817.wyarmouth18/BNStory/National/home ''The Globe and Mail'', 'Terror goes digital. With Canadian help']&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Australia, newspapers, television reports, [[Google hit]] results for terms such as "jihad rap" return hundreds of references and has been a hot topic on both Music and Right-Wing internet forums.

This may be because of the significance of the impact of Islamic and Western cultures and beliefs being such a popular topic or the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in Western countries.

As of 24 June 2007, over 3 years since the videos release, Google return over  27,500 hits for the search 'Dirty Kuffar' and over 818,000 for 'Jihad Rap'. A Google search for 'Digihad' returns 14,700 hits.

The Arabic news station [[Al-Jazeera]] reported on the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1461 Al Jazeera English - Archive - 9/11 Rap Wows British Muslims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704013212/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1461 |date=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steven Emerson]], an investigator of jihadist activities of the Investigative Project, via jihadwatch.org comments on the video:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The video you are about to watch is a rap video designed to inspire people to take up jihad against the West. Posted on a radical Islamic website based out of the United Kingdom, the video is undeniably entertaining, as professionally produced as any video you might see on MTV. Consider the irony: radical fundamentalism, sworn to destroy Western culture and beliefs, uses that culture to market its hate. Paralleling the same deception, the Islamic organization that produced and marketed this video claims to be an Islamic "human rights" group but in reality is a group sworn to support the killing of Jews, Christians and moderate Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/000793.php Jihad Watch: Jihad rap from Britain&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702154557/http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/000793.php |date=July 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Screen shots from the video depict the singers wearing [[Palestinian costume|Palestinian]] [[keffiyeh]]s around his head, atop a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].

The song is a rap/dancehall song that is underpinned by the much-used [[Diwali Riddim]]. The video has recently been posted on the British website run by the Islamic extremist [[Mohammad al-Massari]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; the UK-based [[Saudi Arabia]]n dissident who has lived in Britain since 1994. Al-Massari claims that the video has been selling in large quantities at mosques to the younger generation and is in heavy demand overseas. In 2004 al-Massari told the Guardian newspaper that he did not know a single young Muslim who has not either seen or got the video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/08/arts.politics Islamic rappers' message of terror]&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Massari also stated that "It is selling everywhere. Everyone I meet at the mosque is asking for it." Al-Massari's Committee for the Defence of Legitimate Rights in Saudi Arabia—a group which came to Britain in 1994 to publicise injustices in the desert kingdom—also distributes the four-minute video on its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1461 Al-Massari] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704013212/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=1461 |date=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapper fronting the video calls himself Sheikh Terra and the Soul Salah Crew—a take on the rap group [[So Solid Crew]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} ''[[Salat]]'' is Arabic for "prayer". On the video [[Nazis]], [[Ku Klux Klan]], [[Tony Blair]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[George W. Bush]], [[Vladimir Putin]], [[Ariel Sharon]] and [[Nick Griffin]] are main Dirty Kuffars. The video attacks Muslim political leaders like former [[Egyptian President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] and former [[Pakistani President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] as traitors to Islam. The video also featured [[Hamza Yusuf]] with the caption stating that he was one of the ''"Scholars for Dollars"''.

The ''Daily Times'' of Pakistan stated that "Al Qaeda's newest weapon against the West is a violent English-language rap tune".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_10-2-2004_pg9_3 ''Daily Times'' - Leading News Resource of Pakistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930195343/http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_10-2-2004_pg9_3 |date=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British National Party]] has stated that "More than a tiny minority of young British Muslims turned the 'Dirty Kuffar' rap video into a cult." &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061026224954/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news_detail.php?newsId=392 BNP News], 13 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040215035528/http://www.bnp.org.uk/news/2004_feb/news_feb10.htm BNP News], 12 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 2004, former Jihadist [[Daveed Gartenstein-Ross]], reviewed the song for ''[[Frontpage Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://daveedgr.com/publications/internet-journals/jihadi-rap/ |title=Jihadi Rap |date=November 10, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105222239/http://daveedgr.com/publications/internet-journals/jihadi-rap/ |archive-date=2009-01-05 |publisher=daveedgr.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2005==
On the 2 August 2005 the well-known Bronx artist [[DJ Damien]] released an Internet-based tribute single in conjunction with Morcoq, entitled "Dirty Kuffar (Acoustic Tribute)." The lyrics follow the theme of the original, but in this version main Dirty Kuffars include [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Lap Fung Chan]]. 

In 2005 'Dirty Kuffar' featured extensively in a programme called '' 'Media Jihad: As Sahab Foundation' '', A CBC programme based on a documenaty originally produced in Japan by [[NHK Television]] and was updated by the Discovery Times Channel.

==2006==
On 6 December [[Channel 4]]'s [[Dispatches (TV series)|''Dispatches'']] programme aired 'Jihad TV',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/news/dispatches/war_on_terror/jihad_tv Channel 4 - News - Dispatches - Jihad TV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a documentary investigating the fact that "Internet footage of beheadings has become a vital weapon in al-Qaeda's jihad against the West. Dispatches investigates this powerful propaganda machine and its impact on young Arabs and Muslims in the UK." In this show the Dirty Kuffar video was extensively reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6652279024382177865 Jihad_TV.avi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329120810/http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=6652279024382177865 |date=March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 November the [[BBC]] reported into "Online Jihadism" and exclusively featured the 'Dirty Kuffar' rap video.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49usXnC99HU YouTube - " Online Jihadism "&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 documentary, ''[[Obsession: Radical Islam's War Against the West]]'', features 'Dirty Kuffar' and discusses online Jihad.

==2007==
In 2007 ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper reported that the 21 July bombers appeared in court and it was witnessed that they had watched the video.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In January 2007 the 'Dirty Kuffar' video was featured in the CNN ''Behind the Scenes'' series documentary 'The War Within' about radical Islam in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/01/17/warwithin.amanpour/index.html | work=CNN | title=Amanpour: Radical, moderate Muslims battle for young English minds - CNN.com | accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video also featured in the [[Fox News]] documentaries on radical Islam, ''[[Radical Islam: Terror In Its Own Words]]'', and ''[[Obsession: The Threat of Radical Islam]]''.

In May 2007 Digihad remixed Dirty Kuffar, version 2.1 and released it through the video sharing website [[YouTube]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKgkF7HkzNI YouTube - Dirty Kuffar - DIGIHAD (REMIX 2.1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and, in March 2007 another video, '[[Dirty Takfiri]], with [[Azzam the American]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoMG0X9rWSE YouTube - Broadcast Yourself&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, although not promoting 'Dirty Kuffar', '[[Dirty Takfiri]]' was an anti-Jihad video spoofing Dirty Kuffar."''

In July, online news websites are featuring stories on Islamic extremism and Jihad on the internet, mentioning 'Dirty Kuffar',&lt;ref&gt;[http://government.zdnet.com/?p=3286 E-jihadists take advantage of net technology good and bad | ZDNet Government | ZDNet.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technewsworld.com/story/58176.html Technology News: Internet: Web of Terror, Part 1: Extremists Take to the Net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and on 18 August ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' ran a  story entitled 'Terror goes digital.

==2008==
In May 2008 ''Investor's Business Daily'' reported in the article 'Google's TerrorTube'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=296263006694832 Google's TerrorTube] {{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} - Investor's Business Daily, 5 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that: ''"Among the videos remaining on YouTube is a slick piece of pro-terrorist propaganda called 'Dirty Kuffar'"''

==History==
Early planning work for Exhibit Columbus began in late 2014, and the project was officially launched on 5 May 2016 in Columbus as a program of Heritage Fund—The Community Foundation of Bartholomew County. It receives funding from a number of local and regional individuals, foundations, and corporations.

===100 Variations===
An exhibition was created in the fall of 2014 as a pilot project that featured designer [[Jonathan Nesci]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khemsurov|first1=Monica|title=Jonathan Nesci in Conversation With Matt Olson of RO/LU - Sight Unseen|url=http://www.sightunseen.com/2014/10/jonathan-nesci-in-conversation-with-matt-olson-of-rolu/|accessdate=21 October 2016|work=Sight Unseen|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created 100 unique tables for an installation in front of [[First Christian Church (Columbus, Indiana)|First Christian Church]].  This exhibition, "100 Variations," was produced by Indianapolis-based curator, Christopher West with support from the Haddad Foundation, the Columbus Area Visitors Center, and the Columbus Museum of Art and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chocolate, Baroque &amp; Design - October 2, 2014|url=http://www.wfyi.org/programs/the-art-of-the-matter/radio/chocolate-baroque-and-design-october-2-2014|accessdate=30 July 2016|work=WFYI Public Media|issue=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the tables was made by Noblitt Fabricating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=Jonathan Nesci Making his Mark in Columbus|url=http://www.patternindy.com/2014/10/07/jonathan-nesci-making-his-mark-in-columbus/|website=Pattern|accessdate=20 October 2016|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Columbus, Indiana under the leadership of Curt Aton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=Curt Aton|journal=Pattern|date=Fall 2015|issue=8|page=62|url=http://www.patternindy.com/previous-issues/|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic identity===
The Chicago-based graphic design firm, Thirst, was hired in 2016 to create the Exhibit Columbus identity with the goal of creating a system that was aligned with [[Paul Rand]]'s designs in Columbus, along with [[Alexander Girard]]'s work at the [[Miller House and Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibit Columbus - Work - Thirst|url=http://3st.com/work/exhibit-columbus#1|website=Thirst|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This identity was immediately recognized with an award from the Society of Typographic Artists, and has gone on to considerable critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibit Columbus - STA100|url=http://100.sta-chicago.org/portfolio-item/exhibit-columbus/|website=STA100|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity was primarily created by [[Rick Valicenti]], a 2006 [[List of AIGA medalists|AIGA medalist]] and a 2009 [[National Design Awards|National Design Award]] winner.

===The J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize===
The Miller Prize was created to honor [[J. Irwin Miller]] and his wife Xenia S. Miller, two of the twentieth century’s greatest patrons of architecture, design, and art, and a "family whose visionary commitment to community remains unparalleled." The Miller Prize is the center piece of Exhibit Columbus. In 2016 ten designers were paired at one of the five sites in a competition to see which team would be selected by a jury for the opportunity to build an installation in conversation with the past while exploring the future of design and fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exhibit Columbus to feature new J.

===Events===
After hosting its inaugural symposium, "Foundations and Futures," in fall 2016 and inaugural exhibition in the fall of 2017, the 2018 symposium, "Design, Community, and Progressive Preservation" took place in September 2018 and the second exhibition will open in August 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exhibit Columbus Announces National Symposium Details|url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/exhibit-columbus-announces-national-symposium-details-142494/|accessdate=2 March 2018|work=News - Indiana Public Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2019 exhibition==

The '''First Look Film Festival''' is a [[film festival]] held in [[Denver, Colorado]] which screens [[Short subject|short films]] from college students. It was started in 2001 by Wade Gardner and Joshua Weinberg, two film students at the [[University of Colorado Denver]]. The festival grew from only screening local Colorado films into an international festival which has screened films from over 20 countries. In 2008 the festival was merged with the Starz Denver Film Festival which is held in October.

As of 2008 the First Look Student Film Festival is the First Look Student Film Section of the Starz Denver Film Festival.

As of 2018 the festival web site is no longer existant and the festival may no longer be held.

[[File:Virgen Caridad Cartagena.JPG|thumb|220px|The ''Virgin of Charity'', a Marian title of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] celebrated in [[Cartagena, Spain]] during the Friday of Sorrows. ]]
The '''Friday of Sorrows''' is a solemn pious remembrance of the sorrowful [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] on the Friday before [[Palm Sunday]] held in the fifth week of [[Lent]] (formerly called "Passion Week"). In [[Divine Worship: The Missal]] it is called ''Saint Mary in Passiontide'' and sometimes it is traditionally known as ''Our Lady in Passiontide''.

In certain [[Catholic countries]], especially in [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]], [[Italy]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], [[Spain]], [[Malta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitmalta.com/en/holy-week-and-easter|title=Easter in Malta - Holy Week - Lady of Sorrows, Good Friday, Easter Sunday|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicaragua]] and [[the Philippines]], it is seen as the beginning of the [[Holy Week]] celebrations and termed as ''Viernes de Dolores'' (Friday of Sorrows).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quanaxhuato.com/fiestas-y-tradiciones/viernes-de-dolores/|title=Viernes de Dolores|author=Grupo LEXED|work=Quanaxhuato.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes place exactly one week before [[Good Friday]], and concentrates on the emotional pain that the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of [[Jesus Christ]] caused to his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is venerated under the title [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].

In certain Spanish-speaking countries, the day is also referred to as '''Council Friday''', because of the choice of {{Bibleverse||John|11:47-54|ESV}} as the Gospel passage read in the [[Tridentine Mass]] on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the concilliar meeting of the [[Sanhedrin]] priests to discuss what to do with Jesus.

Like all Fridays in Lent, this Friday is a day of abstinence from meat, unless the national [[episcopal conference]] has indicated alternative forms of penance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.com.py/nacionales/hoy-es-viernes-de-dolores-552350.html|title=Hoy es Viernes de Dolores|author=ABC Color|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar commemoration in sympathy with the Virgin Mary under the title of [[María de la Soledad|Our Lady of Solitude]] is held on [[Holy Saturday|Black Saturday]].  

==History==
[[Image:porta vaga.jpg|thumb|In the Philippines, a famed colonial image of [[Nuestra Señora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga]] is another manifestation of the Sorrowful Virgin celebrated by devout Filipino Catholics.]]
In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the practice of religious veneration towards the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] was designated on any given Friday, which was initiated by the Friday before Holy Week as well as [[Good Friday]] itself, after Palm Sunday.
 
In 1727, [[Pope Benedict XIII]] extended a feast commemorating the sorrowful Virgin Mary to the whole of the [[Latin Church]], assigning to its celebration the Friday in Passion Week, one week before Good Friday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14151b.htm Frederick Holweck, "Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1912)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, the feast still held the rank of major double (slightly lower than the rank of the 15 September feast) in the General Roman Calendar. [[Pope John XXIII]]'s 1960 [[Code of Rubrics]] reduced it to the level of a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]].

in 1969 the celebration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] as a duplicate of the feast on 15 September.&lt;ref&gt;''Calendarium Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the two celebrations had been called a feast of "The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary" (Latin: ''Septem Dolorum Beatae Mariae Virginis'') and included recitation of the [[Stabat Mater]] as a [[Sequence (musical form)#The Latin sequence in literature and liturgy|sequence]]. Since then, the 15 September feast that combines and continues both is known as the Feast of "Our Lady of Sorrows" (Latin: ''Beatae Mariae Virginis Perdolentis''), and recitation of the Stabat Mater is optional.

Observance of the calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted Traditional Roman Rite, and even where the calendar as revised in 1969 is in use, some countries, such as [[Malta]], have kept it in their national calendars. In every country, the 2002 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] provides an alternative [[collect]] for this Friday:&lt;ref&gt;Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O God, who in this season
give your Church the grace
to imitate devoutly the Blessed Virgin Mary
in contemplating the Passion of Christ,
grant, we pray, through her intercession,
that we may cling more firmly each day
to your Only Begotten Son
and come at last to the fullness of his grace.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the last edition of the Tridentine Mass, published under [[John XXIII]] in 1962, the Collect was as follows:
O God, in whose Passion, according to the prophesy &lt;br /&gt;
of Simeon, the sword of sorrow didst pierce the most &lt;br /&gt;
sweet soul of the glorious Mary, Virgin and Mother; mercifully &lt;br /&gt;
grant that we who call to mind with veneration her anguish &lt;br /&gt;
and suffering, by the glorious merits and prayers of all the &lt;br /&gt;
Saints who faithfully stood beneath the cross interceding for &lt;br /&gt;
us, may obtain the blessed fruit of Thy Passion, Thou Who &lt;br /&gt;
livest and reigneth with God the Father, in the unity of the &lt;br /&gt;
Holy Ghost, ever one God, unto ages of ages. Amen. 

In 2015 [[Divine Worship: The Missal]] restored the observance on the Friday in Passion Week, and provided propers including the [[Introit]] ''Stabant iuxta crucem'' (Jn 19:25; Ps 56:1), and a modified form of the 1962 [[Collect]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
O LORD in whose Passion, according to the prophecy of 
Simeon, the sword of sorrow did pierce the most loving 
soul of thy glorious Virgin Mother Mary: mercifully grant that 
we, who devoutly call to mind the suffering whereby she was 
pierced, may, by the glorious merits and prayers of all the Saints 
who have stood beneath the Cross, obtain with gladness the 
benefits of thy Passion; who livest and reignest with the Father, 
in the unity of the Holy Spirit, ever one God, world without end. 
Amen. 
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
the [[Gradual]] ''Dolorosa et lacrimabilis'', the [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] ''Stabat sancta Maria'' (Cf. Lam 1:12), the [[Sequence]] ''Stabat Mater dolorosa'', the [[Offertory]] ''Recordare, Virgo Mater'' (Cf. Jer 18:20), the [[Communion rite|Communion]] ''Felices sensus beatae Mariae'' and the other requisite proper prayers.

Celebration of Friday of Sorrows in [[Malta]], [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Panama]], [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]] and the [[Philippines]], includes processions, public [[penance]], mournful singing and the [[mortification of the flesh]].
 
In Mexico and Nicaragua, the faithful make small shrines of the ''Virgen de Dolor'' and decorate them with [[Christmas lights]] and perform street plays.

In Guatemala, the people make oversized [[flowerbed]]s on the road where the religious float will pass while being incensed by the crowd. 

In the Philippines, candle-lit religious floats carry a statue of Our Lady of Sorrows in procession through the streets. This is followed by the recitation of the life of Christ using the pious Filipino book [[Pasiong Mahal]]; a localised version of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of Christ. In some regions, penitents whip themselves in the streets.

In Malta, beginning on this day, penitents place multiple chains on their feet and walk barefoot on the public streets hiding their identity via a conical hat.

In Spain, the Catholic faithful shout ejaculatory praises to the float of the Sorrowful Virgin passing by; often accompanied an exclamatory response ''Viva!''. The floats are also preceded by a military parade and a musical band.

In Italy, the practice is called ''La Festa dell'Addolorata'' and uses famous Baroque images made in the area of [[Naples]].

Commonly held rituals are religious parades or processions, accompanied by the local singing of [[Stabat Mater]] and candle-light [[vigil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcdesevilla.es/fotos-religion/20130322/semana-santa-viernes-dolores-117217.html|title=Semana Santa: Un Viernes de Dolores pleno en Sevilla|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/robby_dela_vega/7028441555/|title=Viernes de Dolores|work=Flickr - Photo Sharing!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Edward Dahl''' (June 29, 1909 – February 14, 1956) Was a mercenary [[Americans|American]] pilot who fought in the [[Spanish Republican Air Force]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. He was a member of the "American Patrol" of the [[Andres Garcia La Calle]] group. He was nicknamed "Whitey" due to his very blond hair.

==Biography==
Born in [[Champaign, Illinois]], Dahl graduated from flying school at Kelly Field on 28 February 1933 and joined the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] as a Second Lieutenant. His commission ended in 1936 due to gambling and subsequent court convictions. He then became a commercial pilot, but again gambling forced him to escape to [[Mexico]].

Dahl piloted charter and cargo flights carrying material for the [[Second Spanish Republic]], as Mexico was one of the very few distant countries to support the Spanish government. He was told about the good salary paid for mercenary pilots and so he joined Spain under the name of '''Hernando Diaz Evans''', Evans being his mother's maiden name. He reported nine kills in this unit, though only five were ever confirmed.

During the reorganization of the Fighter Squadrons in May 1937, Dahl was posted to a squadron with a large variety of nationalities. [[Frank Glasgow Tinker]] said that this made it very hard for a pilot to coordinate his place in the group during fighting. It seems that this was the case on June 13 of that year, where he was surprised by enemy planes and was shot down and taken prisoner.

Initially sentenced to death, there were some diplomatic movements to free Dahl. His alleged first wife [[Edith Rogers (singer)|Edith Rogers]], a known singer of impressive beauty, was said to have visited [[Francisco Franco]] herself to plead for his life.  This story later became the basis of the 1940 movie [[Arise, My Love]]. He remained in prison until 1940 and then returned to the United States.  After he and Edith Rogers separated, he accepted another job, this time with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) and served during [[World War II]].  He trained RCAF pilots for combat in Europe at an airfield near [[Belleville, Ontario]].  It was here that he met his second wife Eleanor Bone, the daughter of the mayor of Belleville. After the war, he was accused of stealing decommissioned equipment from the RCAF.

Around 1951, Dahl joined the airline [[Swissair]] and lived in [[Switzerland]].  In 1953 he was caught smuggling gold with his mistress and was expelled from the country, an event that compelled his second wife to leave him. Back in Canada, he became a cargo pilot flying [[DC-3]]s when on 14 February 1956 he was killed during a crash in bad weather.

Harold Edward Dahl was survived by his three children by his second wife Eleanor:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24476">'''Inert gas asphyxiation''' is a form of [[asphyxiation]] which results from breathing a physiologically [[inert gas]] in the absence of [[oxygen]], or a [[hypoxia (medical)|low amount of oxygen]],&lt;ref&gt;European Industrial Gases Association (2009), ''[http://www.linde-gas.com/internet.global.lindegas.global/en/images/Hazards%20of%20inert%20gases%20and%20oxygen%20depletion17_13909.pdf Hazards of Inert Gases and Oxygen Depletion], IGC Doc 44/09/E&lt;/ref&gt; rather than [[atmospheric air]] (which is largely composed of [[nitrogen]] and oxygen). Examples of physiologically inert gases, which have caused accidental or deliberate death by this mechanism, are [[argon]], [[helium]], [[nitrogen]] and [[methane]]. The term "physiologically inert" is used to indicate a gas which has no toxic or anesthetic properties and does not act upon the heart or hemoglobin. Instead, the gas acts as a simple diluent to reduce oxygen concentration in inspired gas and blood to dangerously low levels, thereby eventually depriving all cells in the body of oxygen.&lt;ref name="Wilkenfield"/&gt;

According to the [[U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board]], in humans, "breathing an oxygen deficient atmosphere can have serious and immediate effects, including unconsciousness after only one or two breaths. The exposed person has no warning and cannot sense that the oxygen level is too low." In the US, at least 80 people died due to accidental nitrogen asphyxiation between 1992 and 2002.&lt;ref name="CSB.gov Safety Bulletin"/&gt; Hazards with inert gases and the risks of asphyxiation are well established.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141129043944/http://www.asiaiga.org/docs/AIGA%20008_11_Hazards%20of%20inert%20gases%20and%20oxygen%20depletion.pdf "HAZARDS OF INERT GASES AND OXYGEN DEPLETION"]. Singapore: Asia Industrial Gases Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

An occasional cause of accidental death in humans, inert gas asphyxia with gases including helium, nitrogen, methane and argon has been used as a suicide method. Inert gas asphyxia has been advocated by proponents of [[euthanasia]], using a gas-retaining plastic hood device colloquially referred to as a [[suicide bag]].

Nitrogen asphyxiation has been suggested by a number of lawmakers and other advocates as a more humane way to carry out [[capital punishment]]. In April 2015, the Oklahoma Governor [[Mary Fallin]] signed a bill authorizing nitrogen asphyxiation as an alternative execution method in cases where the state's preferred method of lethal injection was not available as an option.&lt;ref name="newsok.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-gov.-mary-fallin-signs-bill-allowing-nitrogen-asphyxiation-as-alternative-execution-method/article/5411181|title=Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signs bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as alternative execution method|work=NewsOK.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/17/oklahoma-nitrogen-execution-method-death-penalty|title=Oklahoma governor signs 'foolproof' nitrogen gas execution method|date=18 April 2015|author=Associated Press|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter and Corrections Director Joe M. Allbaugh announced a switch to nitrogen gas as the primary method of execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/03/14/oklahoma-says-it-will-begin-using-nitrogen-for-all-executions-in-an-unprecedented-move/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.f342a31e16e9|title=Oklahoma says it will begin using nitrogen for all executions in an unprecedented move|date=March 18, 2018|author=Mark Berman|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
When humans breathe in an [[asphyxiant gas]], such as pure [[nitrogen]], [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[sulfur hexafluoride]], [[methane]], or any other physiologically inert gas(es), they exhale carbon dioxide without re-supplying oxygen. Physiologically inert gases (those that have no toxic effect, but merely dilute oxygen) are generally free of odor and taste. As such, the human subject detects little abnormal sensation as the oxygen level falls. This leads to [[asphyxia]]tion (death from lack of oxygen) without the painful and traumatic feeling of suffocation (the [[Hypercapnia|hypercapnic alarm response]], which in humans arises mostly from carbon dioxide levels rising), or the side effects of poisoning. In [[scuba diving]] [[rebreather]] accidents, there is often little sensation, however, a slow decrease in oxygen breathing gas content has effects which are quite variable.&lt;ref name = "Hamilton"/&gt; By contrast, suddenly breathing pure inert gas causes oxygen levels in the blood to fall precipitously, and may lead to unconsciousness in only a few breaths, with no symptoms at all.&lt;ref name="CSB.gov Safety Bulletin"/&gt;

Some animal species are better equipped than humans to detect hypoxia, and these species are more uncomfortable in low-oxygen environments that result from inert gas exposure.&lt;ref name="Joanna-thesis"/&gt;

== Physiology ==

A typical human [[breath]]es between 12 and 20 times per minute at a rate primarily influenced by [[carbon dioxide]] concentration, and thus [[pH]], in the [[blood]]. With each breath, a volume of about 0.6 litres is exchanged from an active [[lung volumes|lung volume]] (tidal volume + functional residual capacity) of about 3 litres. Normal [[air|Earth atmosphere]] is about 78% [[nitrogen]], 21% [[oxygen]], and 1% [[argon]], carbon dioxide, and other gases. After just two or three breaths of nitrogen, the oxygen concentration in the lungs would be low enough for some oxygen already in the bloodstream to exchange back to the lungs and be eliminated by exhalation.

[[Unconsciousness]] in cases of accidental asphyxia can occur within 1 minute. Loss of consciousness results from critical [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], when arterial oxygen saturation is less than 60%.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; "At oxygen concentrations [in air] of 4 to 6%, there is loss of consciousness in 40 seconds and death within a few minutes".&lt;ref name="DiMaio"/&gt; At an altitude over {{convert|43000|ft|abbr=on}}, where the ambient oxygen concentration is equivalent to 3.6% at sea level, an average individual can perform flying duties efficiently for only 9 to 12 seconds without oxygen supplementation.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; The US Air Force trains air crews to recognize their individual subjective signs of approaching hypoxia. Some individuals experience headache, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, euphoria and some become unconscious without warning.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;

Loss of consciousness may be accompanied by convulsions&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; and is followed by [[cyanosis]] and [[cardiac arrest]]. About 7 minutes of oxygen deprivation causes death of the [[brainstem]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

== Animal slaughter ==

=== Relation to controlled atmosphere killing ===
''Controlled atmosphere killing'' (''CAK'') or ''controlled atmosphere stunning'' (''CAS'') is a method for slaughtering animals such as [[chicken]]s or [[Cane toads in Australia|cane toads]] by placing the animals in a container in which the atmosphere lacks oxygen and consists of an [[asphyxiant gas]] (one or more of [[argon]], [[nitrogen]] or [[carbon dioxide]]), causing the animals to lose [[consciousness]]. Argon and nitrogen are important components of a gassing process which seem to cause no [[pain]], and for this reason many consider some types of controlled atmosphere killing more humane than other methods of killing.&lt;ref name="Auto40-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="awfc"/&gt; However, "stunning" is often done using [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andy Coghlan |title=A more humane way of slaughtering chickens might get EU approval |journal=New Scientist |date=Feb 3, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2159895-a-more-humane-way-of-slaughtering-chickens-might-get-eu-approval}}&lt;/ref&gt; If carbon dioxide is used, controlled atmosphere killing is not the same as inert gas asphyxia, because carbon dioxide at high concentrations (above 5%) is not biologically inert, but rather is toxic and also produces initial distress in a number of animal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Archie Campbell |title=Humane execution and the fear of the tumbril |journal=New Scientist |date=Mar 10, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/letter/mg23731680-900-humane-execution-and-the-fear-of-the-tumbril-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of toxic carbon dioxide to hypoxic atmospheres used in slaughter without animal distress is a complex and highly species-specific matter, which also depends on  concentration of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409003755/http://kb.rspca.org.au/What-is-CO2-stunning_118.html|title=When is carbon dioxide stunning used in abattoirs?|publisher=RSPCA|accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jong E.C. |author2=Barnett J.L. |author3=Hemsworth P.H. | year = 2000 | title = The aversiveness of carbon dioxide stunning in pigs and a comparison of the CO2 stunner crate vs. the V-restrainer | url = | journal = Applied Animal Behaviour Science | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 67–76 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-1591(99)00103-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raj, A.B.M. and Gregory, N.G., (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Euthanasia of animals ==
Diving animals such as [[mink]] and burrowing animals, such as [[rodent]]s and [[rat]]s, are sensitive to low-oxygen atmospheres and (unlike humans) will avoid them, making purely hypoxic techniques possibly inhumane{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} for them. For this reason, the use of inert gas (hypoxic) atmospheres (without CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for [[Animal euthanasia|euthanasia]], is also species-specific.&lt;ref name="Joanna-thesis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = | year = | title = Welfare implications of the gas stunning of pigs 1. Determination of aversion to the initial inhalation of carbon dioxide or argon | url = | journal = Animal Welfare | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 273–280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidental deaths and injury ==

Accidental nitrogen asphyxiation is a possible hazard where large quantities of nitrogen are used. It causes several deaths per year in the United States,&lt;ref name="CSB"/&gt; which is asserted to be more than from any other industrial gas. In one accident in 1981, shortly before the launch of the [[STS-1|first Space Shuttle mission]], five technicians lost consciousness and two of them died after they entered the Orbiter aft compartment.  Nitrogen had been used to flush oxygen from the compartment as a precaution against fire. They were not wearing air packs because of a last minute change in safety procedures.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;

During a pool party in Mexico in 2013, eight party-goers were rendered unconscious and one 21-year-old male was put into a coma after liquid nitrogen was poured into the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/health/liquid-nitrogen-jagermeister-mexican-pool-party-sickens-guests-article-1.1376739 | work=NY Daily Times| title=Liquid nitrogen at Jägermeister Mexican pool party sickens guests: one man in a coma, eight others ill|accessdate=2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.chembark.com/2013/06/18/awful-idea-liquid-nitrogen-at-a-pool-party/|title=Awful Idea: Liquid Nitrogen at a Pool Party – ChemBark|work=chembark.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasional deaths are reported from recreational inhalation of helium, but these are very rare from direct inhalation from small balloons. The inhalation from larger helium balloons has been reportedly fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198108,00.html | work=Fox News | title=2 College Students Found Dead Inside Helium Balloon in Florida | date=2006-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A fatal fall from a tree occurred after the inhalation of helium from a toy balloon, which caused the person to become either unconscious or light headed.&lt;ref&gt;Lung ruptures and fatal [[gas embolism]]s have occurred from inhalation from a pressure tank and although this was reported as a helium inhalation death, it differs greatly from the process of inert gas asphyxiation. See [http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/02/23/teen-dies-after-inhaling-helium-at-party/#ixzz1nKMdnsYu gas embolism helium death]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a technician at a health spa was asphyxiated while conducting unsupervised [[cryotherapy]] using nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ktnv.com/news/osha-investigating-henderson-cryochamber-death|title=Coroner rules cryochamber death due to lack of oxygen|last=Saeidi|first=Mahsa|date=2015-11-11|newspaper=KTNV|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161018211047/http://www.ktnv.com/news/osha-investigating-henderson-cryochamber-death | archivedate = 2016-10-18 | deadurl = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Death of Woman in Tank at a Nevada Cryotherapy Center Raises Questions About Safety|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/us/death-of-woman-in-tank-at-a-nevada-cryotherapy-center-raises-questions-about-safety.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2015-10-26|access-date = 2016-01-26|issn = 0362-4331|first = Kimberley|last = Mcgee|first2 = Julie|last2 = Turkewitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suicide ==
{{main article|Suicide bag}}
Use of inert gas for suicide was first proposed by a Canadian, Dr Bruce Dunn.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn B, ''Nitrogen and other Inert Gases.'' In: Smith K, Docker C, Hofsess J, Dunn B, "Beyond Final Exit." Published by the Right to Die Society of Canada 1995, pp.65-71. The book was distributed internationally by Canadian, American, and British organizations. See also [[Exit (Right-to-Die Organisation)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn commented that, "...the acquisition of a compressed gas cylinder, an appropriate pressure reducing regulator, and suitable administration equipment... [was] "not inaccessible to a determined individual, but relatively difficult for a member of the public to acquire casually or quickly."&lt;ref&gt;"Dunn B, ''Beyond Final Exit,'' p.70. Dunn's work and other chapters from ''Beyond Final Exit'' was also publicised on the Canadian website (now offline) called DeathNET. Côte R, ''In Search of Gentle Death'', Corinthian Books 2012, page 314.&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn collaborated with other researchers, notably the Canadian campaigner, John Hofsess, who in 1997 formed the group "NuTech" with Derek Humphry and Philip Nitschke.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Euthanasia device]]&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, NuTech had streamlined Dunn's work by using readily-available party balloon cylinders of helium.&lt;ref&gt;Humphry, Derek (2014). [http://www.finalexit.org "Obtaining drugs via the internet and using helium hood kits"]. finalexit.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method of suicide based on self-administration of helium in a bag, a colloquial name being the "exit bag" or [[suicide bag]], has been referenced by some medical euthanasia advocacy groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Suicidal asphyxiation with helium: report of three cases.|vauthors=Grassberger M, Krauskopf A | pmid=17571238 | doi=10.1007/s00508-007-0785-4|volume=119|year=2007|journal=Wien.

This suggested to one set of reviewers that the popularity of the technique was increasing, as also did the increase in helium suicides in Sweden during the latter half of the same decade.&lt;ref name = "Austin"/&gt;

== Capital punishment ==

Execution by nitrogen asphyxiation was discussed briefly in print as a theoretical method of [[capital punishment]] in a ''[[National Review]]'' article, "Killing with kindness&amp;nbsp;– capital punishment by nitrogen asphyxiation".&lt;ref name="Creque"/&gt; The idea was then proposed by Lawrence J. Gist II, an attorney at law, under the title, International Humanitarian Hypoxia Project.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122222859/http://www.gistprobono.org/ihhp/index.html International Humanitarian Hypoxia Project]. gistprobono.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a televised documentary in 2007, the British political commentator and former [[Member of the UK Parliament|MP]] [[Michael Portillo]] examined execution techniques in use around the world and found them unsatisfactory; his conclusion was that nitrogen asphyxiation would be the best method.&lt;ref name="videosift"/&gt;

In April 2015, Governor [[Mary Fallin]] of [[Oklahoma]] signed a bill allowing nitrogen asphyxiation as an alternative execution method.&lt;ref name="newsok.com"/&gt;  Three years later, in March 2018, Oklahoma announced that, due to the difficulty in procuring lethal injection drugs, nitrogen gas would be its primary method of carrying out executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/62037-oklahoma-executions-nitrogen.html|title=Oklahoma Turns to Nitrogen Gas for Executions}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Alabama became the third state (along with Oklahoma and Mississippi), to authorize the use of nitrogen asphyxiation as a method of execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/9d8ea52c7fa242b7b98a060709380698|title=Alabama 3rd state to allow execution by nitrogen gas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[...] Simple asphyxiants are gases that are physiologically inert.  They do not suppress cardiac output or alter the function of the hemoglobin.

The Karlovy Vary Festival is one of the oldest in the [[world]] and has become [[Central and Eastern Europe|Central and Eastern Europe’s]] leading film event.&lt;ref name="Festival2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Richard Gere to Receive Crystal Globe at Karlovy Vary Film Festival|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/richard-gere-to-receive-crystal-globe-at-karlovy-vary-film-festival-1201524955/|publisher=Variety Media|date=22 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410214636/http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/richard-gere-to-receive-crystal-globe-at-karlovy-vary-film-festival-1201524955/|archivedate=10 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Atmosfery-2015.jpg|thumb|The opening of the 50th festival in front of the Hotel Thermal]]
The pre-war dream of many enthusiastic filmmakers materialized in 1946 when a non-competition festival of films from seven countries took place in [[Mariánské Lázně]] and [[Karlovy Vary]]. Above all it was intended to screen the results of the recently nationalized [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] [[film industry]]. After the first two years the festival moved permanently to Karlovy Vary.

The Karlovy Vary IFF first held an international film competition in 1948. Since 1951, an international jury has evaluated the films. The Karlovy Vary competition quickly found a place among other developing festivals and by 1956 [[FIAPF]] had already classified Karlovy Vary as a category A festival. Given the creation of the Moscow Film Festival and the political decision to organize only one "A" festival for all [[Communist state|socialist countries]], Karlovy Vary was forced to alternate year by year with [[Moscow International Film Festival|Moscow IFF]] between 1959 and 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/article.php?id=271&amp;festivals|title=Kinema : : A Journal for Film and Audiovisual Media|author=|date=|website=www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304232254/http://www.kinema.uwaterloo.ca/article.php?id=271&amp;festivals|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and political changes that took place after the [[Velvet Revolution]] in November 1989 pushed concerns about organizing the Karlovy Vary IFF to the background. The program for 1990 was saved by the release of a collection of Czechoslovak films which had been locked up for years in a storage vault. And the appearance of a number of international guests such as [[Miloš Forman]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Annette Bening]] and [[Robert De Niro]] helped as well. Future festivals were in doubt. Financial problems and a lack of interest on the part of the government, organizers and viewers almost ended the festival's long tradition in 1992.

In 1994 the 29th Karlovy Vary IFF inaugurated an entirely new tradition. After nearly forty years of alternating with the [[Moscow International Film Festival|Moscow IFF]], the festival began once again to take place every year. The Karlovy Vary Film Festival Foundation was set up in 1993 co-created by the Ministry of Culture, The City of Karlovy Vary, and the [[Grand Hotel Pupp]]. Actor [[Jiří Bartoška]] was invited to be the festival's president, and Eva Zaoralová became program director in 1995. Since 1998 the organization of the festival has been carried out by Film Servis Festival Karlovy Vary, a [[joint stock company]].

==Program==
[[File:Herec-herec-richard-gere-na-slavnostnim-zahajeni-50mff-kv.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Gere]] with the [[Crystal Globe]] at the 50th Karlovy Vary IFF (2015)]]
The core of the program is the [[feature film]] competition; in accordance with [[FIAPF]] regulations only those films which have not been shown in competition at any other international festivals can be included. The documentary competition is an important festival event. The extensive informative program features both distribution pre-premiers and films awarded at [[List of film festivals|other festivals]]. But it also includes discoveries of artistic creations by independent directors, productions coming out of little known film industries, retrospectives, and an overview of [[Cinema of the Czech Republic|Czech film]] output during the past year. For the tenth straight year the festival will present Variety Critics' Choice: new and interesting films of mainly European production selected by critics working at this prestigious magazine.

Seminars focusing primarily on [[European cinema|European film]] are another important part of the festival.

Thousands of visitors and the great variety of films testify to the effectiveness of the program team with program director Eva Zaoralová at its head. Due to their valiant efforts many films will be purchased at the festival for wider distribution or, thanks to receiving a festival award, will attract the attention of major producers, distributors, and the media.

The festival program has the following sections:
* ''Official Selection - Competition'' &amp;ndash; films never before shown in competition at any other international festival.
* ''East of the West - Competition'' &amp;ndash; films from the former socialist bloc.
* ''Documentary Films - Competition'' &amp;ndash; a competition divided into two parts: [[Documentary film|documentaries]] less than and longer than 30 minutes.
* ''Horizons'' and ''Another View'' &amp;ndash; a selection of the most remarkable contemporary films.
* ''Imagina'' - films with an unconventional approach to narration and style, distinctive and radical visions of film language.
* ''Out of the Past'' - classic, cult, rare and unfairly overlooked films, screened in their original and restored versions.
* ''Future Frames: Ten New Filmmakers To Follow'' - ten directors, an upcoming generation of young European filmmakers, present their student films. The project is organized in cooperation with European Film Promotion.
* ''Midnight Screenings'' - a selection of the latest horror and action films, works that look at their genres in new, often humorous, ways.
* ''Czech Films'' &amp;ndash; a representative selection of current Czech films.
* ''Tributes, special focuses and retrospectives''

==Awards==
Since 1948, the Grand Prize has been the [[Crystal Globe]] &amp;ndash; although its form has often changed. As of the 35th Karlovy Vary IFF 2000 the Crystal Globe has taken on a new look: now the figure of a woman stands raising a crystal ball (artistic concept developed by Tono Stano, Aleš Najbrt, Michal Caban, and Šimon Caban).

The Feature Film Competition is divided into the following main awards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kviff.com/en/about-the-festival/awards|title=KVIFF - Awards|author=|date=|website=www.kviff.com|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014083554/http://www.kviff.com/en/about-the-festival/awards|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lam Sơn uprising''' (Khởi nghĩa Lam Sơn) was the uprising led by [[Lê Lợi]] in Vietnam of 1418-1427 against [[Ming occupation of Vietnam|Ming rule]].&lt;ref&gt;Asia: Local Studies / Global Themes - Volume 3 Hue-Tam Ho Tai - 2001 - Page 91 "... an anti-Ming resistance — the Lam Son uprising, begun in 1418 — and the two men became the movement's key exponents. As emperor (1428-33), Le Loi would retain Nguyen Trai as his chief official; thereafter, their relationship was made ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lonely Planet Vietnam 10 -Nick Ray, Yu-Mei Balasingamchow, Iain Stewart - 2009 Page 30 "In 1418 wealthy philanthropist Le Loi sparked the Lam Son Uprising by refusing to serve as an official for the Chinese Ming dynasty. By 1428, local rebellions had erupted in several regions and Le Loi travelled the countryside to rally ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. K. Chang - From Movable Type Printing to the World Wide Web 2007 Page 128 "However, in 1418, another leader, Lê Lợi, staged an uprising, which led in 1428 to the establishment of the Lê dynasty, from which time Vietnam broke free of China and became independent".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ngọc Đĩnh Vũ ''Hào kiệt Lam Sơn: trường thiên tiểu thuyết lịch sử'' Volume 1 - 2003 "The Lam Sơn uprising, 1418-1428, is one of the greatest historical events in Vietnamese history, when a small country tried to gain independence from the firm grab of a bigger neighbor".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurel Kendall ''Vietnam: Journeys of Body, Mind, and Spirit'' 2003- Page 27 "Le Loi led a successful ten,year (1418,1428) uprising against the Chinese. According to legend, Le Loi returned the sword that gave him victory to Hoan Kiem Lake (now the center of Hanoi), where it was retrieved by a giant turtle".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam}}

This was a troubled time in Vietnam's history as the [[Hồ dynasty]] in 1400 finally displaced the [[Trần dynasty]] and set about reforming the kingdom. Hồ rule was short lived as members of the Trần dynasty petitioned for intervention from the Yongle Emperor of the Chinese Ming Empire to the north. He responded by sending a powerful army south into Vietnam and vanquished the Hồ. Under the pretext of failing to find a living Trần heir, the Ming government chose to re-establish sovereignty over Vietnam, as was the case in the days of the [[Tang dynasty]], some 500 years prior.

The Ming government began a harsh rule of both colonization and sinicization. Valuable artifacts such as gems, jade, gold, pieces of art as well as craftsmen were transported to China. Vietnamese literature books like gazettes, maps, and registers were instructed to be burned, saved for one copy. Lê Lợi himself said that he chose the path of revolt against China's brutal government when he personally witnessed the destruction of a Vietnamese village by Ming forces.

While they enjoyed some support from some collaborating Vietnamese, at least in the capital of Thăng Long, but their efforts to assert control in the surrounding countryside were met with stiff resistance. The [[Later Trần dynasty|Later Trần rebellions]] by [[Trần Ngỗi]] and [[Trần Quý Khoáng]] was raging from 1407 to 1413. However they all ended in failure.

==Revolt== 
Lê Lợi began his campaign against the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] on the day after [[Tết]] (New Year) February 1418. He was supported by several prominent families from his native [[Thanh Hóa province|Thanh Hóa]], most famously were the [[Trịnh Lords|Trịnh]] and the [[Nguyễn Lords|Nguyễn]] families. Initially, Lê Lợi campaigned on the basis of restoring the [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] to power. A relative of the [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] emperor was chosen as the figurehead of the revolt but within a few years, the [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] pretender was removed and the unquestioned leader of the revolt was Lê Lợi himself, under the name "Pacifying King" (Binh Dinh Vuong).&lt;ref&gt;''Le Loi''. The Encycloaedia Brittanica. Micropedia, Volume VI, 15th Edition. {{ISBN|0-85229-339-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt enjoyed patchy initial success. While Lê Lợi was able to operate in [[Thanh Hóa province|Thanh Hóa]], he was, for 2–3 years, unable to muster the military forces required to defeat the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army in open battle. As a result, he waged a type of [[guerrilla war]] against the large and well organized [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] army.

One famous story from this time is about the heroism of one of Lê Lợi's commanders, [[Lê Lai]]. One time during the revolt, Lê Lợi's forces had been surrounded by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]       forces on the top of a mountain. [[Lê Lai]] devised a plan that would allow Lê Lợi and the main bulk of the force to escape. He pretended to be Lê Lợi to divert the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]  army's attention by dressing himself in Lê Lợi's attire and lead a [[kamikaze]]-like charge down to attack the enemy. During the battle, Lê Lợi was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060621134756/http://www.journeyfromthefall.com/showpages.asp?pid=1116 Le Loi – The Man and the Legend of the Golden Turtle God] journeyfromthefall.com (copy at the [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides fighting [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] forces, Lê Lợi and his army also had to fight against ethnic minorities' forces whom the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] government bribed known collectively as Ai Lao ([[Laos]]) . Although there were many difficulties, Lê Lợi's army was able to suppress Ai Lao multiple times. However, because his force was not strong enough at the time, he had to lurk in the forests or mountains of Thanh Hoa province. Often due to lack of food supplies, Lê Lợi had to order the killing of army horses and elephants for use as food.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} In one particularly dangerous situation in 1422, Lê Lợi made peace with the Ming army. But in 1423 when his forces were built up better, Lê Lợi broke the peace agreement when the Ming army captured and killed his envoy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

By 1427, the revolt had spread throughout Vietnam and the original Ming army of occupation had been ground down and destroyed. The new Ming ruler, the [[Xuande Emperor]], wished to end the war with Vietnam, but his advisors urged one more effort to subdue the rebellious province. The result was a massive army (some 100,000 strong&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;{{cite book|author=Trần Trọng Kim|authorlink=Trần Trọng Kim|year=2005|title=Việt Nam sử lược|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City General Publishing House|place=[[Ho Chi Minh City]]|language=Vietnamese|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;) being sent into Vietnam.

The final campaign did not start well for the Ming forces. Lê Lợi's forces met the Ming army in battle but quickly staged a mock retreat. The Ming general, Liu Sheng (''Liễu Thăng'' in Vietnamese), urging his troops forward, was cut off from the main part of his army, captured and executed by the Vietnamese. Then, by sending false reports of dissent within the ranks of Lê Lợi's own generals, the Ming army was lured into Hanoi where it was surrounded and destroyed in a series of battles. A Vietnamese historian, [[Trần Trọng Kim]], told that the Ming army lost over 90,000 men (60,000 killed in battle and 30,000 captured).&lt;ref name="Kim2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Trần Trọng Kim|authorlink=Trần Trọng Kim|year=2005|title=Việt Nam sử lược|publisher=Ho Chi Minh City General Publishing House|place=[[Ho Chi Minh City]]|language=Vietnamese|pages=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decisive battle was the [[Battle of Tốt Động – Chúc Động]] in 1426, after which the [[Ming Dynasty]] eventually had to concede defeat by 1428. Rather than putting to death the captured Ming soldiers and administrators, he provided ships and supplies to send them back to China. Le Loi then ascended the Vietnamese throne, taking the reign name Le Thai To and establishing the [[Le dynasty]], a lineage that would last until the end of [[18th century]].&lt;ref name="Tsai1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shih-shan Henry Tsai|title=The Eunuchs in the Ming Dynasty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ka6jNJcX_ygC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1996|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-2687-6|pages=15–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend of Hoàn Kiếm Lake== 
According to the legend, in early 1428, Emperor [[Lê Lợi]] was boating on the [[Hoàn Kiếm lake]] when a Golden Turtle God ([[Kim Qui]]) surfaced and asked for his magic sword, [[Heaven's Will]]. Lợi concluded that [[Kim Qui]] had come to reclaim the sword that its master, a local God, the Dragon King (''Long Vương'') had given Lợi some time earlier, during his revolt against [[Ming Dynasty|Ming China]]. Later, Emperor Lợi gave the sword back to the turtle after he finished fighting off the Chinese. Emperor Lợi renamed the lake "Hoan Kiem", meaning Lake of the Returning Sword, to commemorate this event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7566">{{main article|Rakhat Aliyev}}

'''The Nurbank bank''', founded in Atyrau regional governor's office was taken over by [[Rakhat Aliyev]] in January 2007. Shortly after, two Nurbank managers, Zholdas Timraliyev and Aybar Khasenov, were kidnapped, tortured and eventually killed by Aliyev. In May 2007, the criminal proceedings against Aliyev in Almaty began and [[Kazakhstan]] sentenced him for forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.kz/?lang=eng&amp;int_id=expert_opinions&amp;news_id=464 |title=Rakhat Aliyev may be sentenced to life imprisonment in Austria - newspaper |website=Interfax.kz |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the Nurbank bank opened for business and became the seventh largest bank in [[Kazakhstan]]. "According to its Website, it is owned by the largest oil, food, publishing and foreign trade firms operating in Kazakhstan, and also currently lends to oil, food, foreign trade, and publishing &amp; information firms."&lt;ref name=widens&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2007/05/24/kazakhstan-nurbank-scandal-widens/ |title=Kazakhstan: Nurbank scandal widens |publisher=Foreign Policy Blogs |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Rakhat Aliyev became the main owner and acquired about 75% of all Nurbank’s assets. His father owned 6.71% and his 22-year-old son Nurali Aliyev was a sitting board member.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

==First kidnapping==
Around January 18, 2007, Zholdas Timraliyev (vice president) and Abilmazhen Gilimov (chairmen of Nurbank) entered into a car and were threatened by Rakhat Aliyev, according to Abilmazhen Gilimov.  Rakhat was looking to acquire possession of a prized financial building in Kazakhstan's commercial capital, Almaty by ensuring ownership passed to him. They escaped after 24 hours. During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife and tell of his abduction. Timraliyev's wife (Armangul Kapasheva/Armangul Qapasheva) reported him missing. They escaped after being held for 24 hours.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt; They both left their positions at Nurbank on January 19.&lt;ref name=widens/&gt;

According to newspapers, the building Aliyev wanted them to sell, sold on January 22 for a very low price,  four days after the alleged first kidnapping.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pannier |first=Bruce |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1074875.html |title=Kazakhstan: Nazarbaev's Son-In-Law Sent To Austria Amid More Accusations |website=Rferl.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second kidnapping==
On January 31, Timraliyev disappeared again after receiving summons to speak with the tax police. Him and  chairman of the board, Aibar Khasenov were reported missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voiceofrussia.com/news/2014_06_06/Kazakh-presidents-former-son-in-law-arrested-in-Vienna-7204/ |title=Kazakh president's former son-in-law arrested in Vienna|publisher=The Voice of Russia |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a days of violent acts, both of the bodies were tucked into a metal drum, assailed with chalk and buried on a waste dump.&lt;ref name=tagdyr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.tagdyr.net/the-nurbank-murder-case |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519112016/http://en.tagdyr.net/the-nurbank-murder-case/ |archivedate=May 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his kidnapping, Timraliyev was able to phone his wife (Armangul Kapasheva) and tell of his abduction. She reported them missing and her strong public appearance about the disappearance of her husband and mounting pressure against Alivey, the Kazakh authorities finally initiated criminal proceedings on May 10, 2007.&lt;ref name=tagdyr/&gt; The wives of the two missing Nurbank managers establish the TAGDYR association in order to find their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/asianet/130411/rakhat-aliyev-malta-lives-fear-he-will-be-kidnapped |title=Rakhat Aliyev in Malta lives in fear that he will be kidnapped |publisher=Global Post |date=2013-04-11 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
:''See Also [[Tagdyr]]''
As a result, Aliyev brought forth a lawsuit against the two wives, for “insulting his honor and dignity.”&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

Timraliyev’s wife was interviewed and several news outlets including,Svoboda Slova," "Tasjargan," "Vremya," and zonakz.net published her comments and now faced legal suit from Aliyev.&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;

==Criminal prosecution==
Aliyev was quickly appointed the new Kazak ambassador to Austria on February 9, 2007 as a polite way to get him out of the country. While in Austria, Aliyev announced his candidacy for the upcoming Kazakhstan elections and criticized the sitting Kazak President, [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. A full domestic Kazak investigation began in May 2007 into Aliyev’s activities. His diplomatic passport was cancelled, as was his diplomatic immunity. Kazakhstan filed its first extradition request at this time. The domestic Kazak investigation concluded January 2008 and Kazak courts sentenced Aliyev to 20 years of imprisonment ''in absentia''.  His crimes were kidnapping, treason and plotting a coup d'état against his father-in-law  Nursultan Nazarbayev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://roberts-report.blogspot.com/2007_02_01_archive.html |title=The Roberts Report on Central Asia and Kazakhstan: February 2007 |website=Roberts-report.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their second request for extradition in 2011 was also rejected, as Austria feared Kazak political persecution of Aliyev. They did however open their own investigation into Aliyev's dealings.

January 2013, Ailyev claimed Kazakhstan was politically persecuting him because he rejected the political system. Viennese supreme court excluded political underpinnings as a reason for persecution, which helped to greatly legitimize legal action brought against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Пишет: Steven Откуда: Simon |url=http://www.caucasustimes.com/article.asp?id=21159 |title=Caucasus Times |publisher=Caucasus Times |date=2013-07-21 |accessdate=2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other crimes==
[[Rakhat Aliyev]] (Shoraz) is also suspected of the murder of opposition leader and former Kazak ambassador to Russia Mr Sarsenbayev in early 2006, a complex embezzlement scheme stretching from Germany to Malta and Navis, torturing two Kazak bodyguards in 2001, and the death of his girlfriend [[Anastasiya Novikova]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2014-06-06/51200/Former_Kazakh_diplomat_Rakhat_Aliyev_arrested_in_Vienna_ |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610020907/http://austriantimes.at/news/General_News/2014-06-06/51200/Former_Kazakh_diplomat_Rakhat_Aliyev_arrested_in_Vienna_ |archivedate=June 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Warof1812-Origins}}

The [[War of 1812]], a war between the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and Britain's Indian allies, lasted from 1812 to 1815.  The U.S. declared war and historians have long debated the multiple factors behind that decision.&lt;ref&gt;Jasper M. Trautsch, "The Causes of the War of 1812: 200 Years of Debate," ''Journal of Military History'' (Jan 2013) 77#1 pp 273-293.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were several  causes for the [[United States declaration of war upon the United Kingdom|U.S. declaration of war]]: First, a series of trade restrictions introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war (the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law);&lt;ref name="Caffery, pp.56-58"&gt;Caffery, pp.56–58&lt;/ref&gt; second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of seamen on U.S. vessels into the [[Royal Navy]] (the British claimed they were British deserters); third, the British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the expansion of the American frontier to the Northwest; fourth, a possible desire on the part of the United States to annex Canada.&lt;ref name="Caffery, pp.101-104"&gt;Caffery, pp.101–104&lt;/ref&gt; An implicit but powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honor in the face of what they considered to be British insults (such as [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair|the ''Chesapeake'' affair]]).&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"&gt;Norman K. Risjord, "1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's Honor." ''William And Mary Quarterly'' 1961 18(2): 196–210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American expansion into the Northwest (Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois and Wisconsin) was impeded by Indian raids. Some historians maintain that an American goal in the war was annex some or all of Canada, a view that many Canadians still share, while others argue that inducing the fear of such a seizure had merely been a U.S. tactic designed to obtain a bargaining chip.&lt;ref name="Bowler, pp. 11-32"&gt;Bowler, pp. 11–32&lt;/ref&gt;  Some members of the British Parliament at the time&lt;ref name="Canning"&gt;[[George Canning]],  [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1813/feb/18/address-respecting-the-war-with-america#S1V0024P0_18130218_HOC_15  Address respecting the war with America], ''[[Hansard]]'' (House of Commons), 18 February 1813&lt;/ref&gt; and dissident American politicians such as [[John Randolph of Roanoke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fregosi|first=Paul|title=Dreams of Empire|publisher=Hutchinson|year=1989|isbn=0-09-173926-8|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that land hunger rather than maritime disputes was the main motivation for the American declaration. However, some historians, both Canadian and American, retain the view that desire to annex all or part of Canada was an American goal.&lt;ref&gt;J.C.A Stagg (1983), Mr Madison's War, pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British made some concessions before the war on neutral trade, they insisted on the right to reclaim their deserting sailors.  The British also had the long-standing goal of creating a large "neutral" Indian state that would cover much of Ohio, Indiana and Michigan. They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but lost battles that would have validated their claims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Dwight L. Smith, "A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea" ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 1989 61(2–4): 46–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis M. Carroll,  [https://books.google.com/books?id=1AjlS20Q5J8C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=barrier+intitle:Good+intitle:and+intitle:Wise+intitle:Measure+intitle:The+intitle:Search+intitle:for+intitle:the+intitle:Canadian-American+inauthor:Francis+inauthor:M+inauthor:Carroll&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2009&amp;as_maxm_is=12&amp;as_maxy_is=2009&amp;num=30&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES  ''A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783–1842''], 2001, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The war was fought in four theatres: ''on the oceans,'' where the warships and privateers of both sides preyed on each other's merchant shipping; ''along the Atlantic coast'' of the U.S., which was blockaded with increasing severity by the British, who also mounted large-scale raids in the later stages of the war; ''on the long frontier,'' running along the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]], which separated the U.S. from [[Upper Canada|Upper]] and [[Lower Canada]] ([[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]); and finally ''along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico''. During the course of the war, both the Americans and British launched invasions of each other's territory, all of which were unsuccessful or gained only temporary success. At the end of the war, the British held parts of [[Battle of Hampden|Maine]] and some outposts in the sparsely populated West while the Americans held Canadian territory near Detroit, but these occupied territories were restored at the end of the war.

In the United States, battles such as [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]] and the earlier successful [[Battle of Baltimore|defence of Baltimore]] (which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, [[The Star-Spangled Banner]]) produced a sense of euphoria over a "second war of independence" against Britain. It ushered in an "[[Era of Good Feelings]]", in which the partisan animosity that had once verged on treason practically vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity. Britain, which had regarded the war as a sideshow to the [[Napoleonic Wars]] raging in Europe, was less affected by the fighting; its government and people subsequently welcomed an era of peaceful relations with the United States.

==British goals==
The British were engaged in a  life-and-death war with [[Napoleon]] and could not allow the Americans to help the enemy, regardless of their lawful neutral rights to do so. As Horsman explains, "If possible, England wished to avoid war with America, but not to the extent of allowing her to hinder the British war effort against France. Moreover...a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy." &lt;ref&gt;Horsman (1962) p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeating Napoleon===
The British had two goals: All parties were committed to the defeat of France, and this required sailors (hence the need for impressment), and it required all-out commercial war against France (hence the restrictions imposed on American merchant ships). On the question of trade with America the British parties split. As Horsman argues, "Some restrictions on neutral commerce were essential for England in this period. That this restriction took such an extreme form after 1807 stemmed not only from the effort to defeat Napoleon, but also from the undoubted jealousy of America's commercial prosperity that existed in England. America was unfortunate in that for most of the period from 1803 to 1812 political power in England was held by a group that was pledged not only to the defeat of France, but also to a rigid maintenance of Britain's commercial supremacy."&lt;ref name="Horsman 1962 p. 265"&gt;Horsman (1962) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; That group was weakened by Whigs friendly to the U.S. in mid-1812 and the policies were reversed, but too late for the U.S. had already declared war. By 1815 Britain was no longer controlled by politicians dedicated to commercial supremacy, so that cause had vanished.

The British were hindered by weak diplomats in Washington (such as [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|David Erskine]]) who misrepresented British policy and by communications that were so slow the Americans did not learn of the reversal of policy until they had declared war.

When Americans proposed a truce based on British ending impressment, Britain refused, because it needed those sailors. Horsman explains, "Impressment, which was the main point of contention between England and America from 1803 to 1807, was made necessary primarily because of England's great shortage of seamen for the war against Napoleon. In a similar manner the restrictions on American commerce imposed by England's Orders in Council, which were the supreme cause of complaint between 1807 and 1812, were one part of a vast commercial struggle being waged between England and France." &lt;ref name="Horsman 1962 p. 265"/&gt;

===Creating an Indian barrier state between U.S. and Canada===
The British also had the long-standing goal of creating an [[Indian barrier state]], a large "neutral" Indian state that would cover most of the [[Old Northwest]] and be a barrier between the western parts of the United States and Canada. It would be independent of the United States and under the tutelage of the British, who would use it to block American expansion and to build up their control of the fur trade.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight L. Smith"A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea." ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly'' 61#2-4 (1989): 46-63.&lt;/ref&gt;  They made the demand as late as 1814 at the peace conference, but dropped the demand. Their position had been weakened by the collapse of [[Tecumseh's Confederacy]] after the [[Battle of the Thames]], but the British also simply no longer considered the goal worth conflict with the United States. Much of the proposed buffer state remained largely under British and Indian control throughout the war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis M. Carroll|title=A Good and Wise Measure: The Search for the Canadian-American Boundary, 1783-1842|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AjlS20Q5J8C&amp;pg=PA24|year=2001|publisher=U. of Toronto Press|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==American goals==
There were several immediate stated causes for the U.S. declaration of war. First, a series of trade restrictions called the Orders in Council (1807) introduced by Britain to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], a country with which Britain was at war; the U.S. contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.&lt;ref name="Caffery, pp.56-58"/&gt; Second, the [[impressment]] (forced recruitment) of U.S. citizens into the [[Royal Navy]]. Third, the alleged British military support for [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] who were offering armed resistance to the United States.&lt;ref name="Caffery, pp.101-104"/&gt;  An unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the need to uphold national honor in the face of British insults (such as the ''Chesapeake'' affair.)&lt;ref name="in JSTOR"/&gt; There also may have been an American desire to annex Canada.

===British support for Indian raids===
Indians based in the [[Northwest Territory]], comprising the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had organized in opposition to American settlement, and were being supplied with weapons by British traders in Canada.  Britain was not trying to provoke a war, and at one point cut its allocations of gunpowder to the tribes, but it was trying to build up its fur trade and friendly relations with potential military allies.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake: The War of 1812 and the Brokering of an Uneasy Peace'' (2006) pp 62–62&lt;/ref&gt; Although Britain had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, it had the long-term goal of creating a "neutral" or buffer Indian state in the area that would block further American growth.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight L. Smith, "A North American Neutral Indian Zone: Persistence of a British Idea", ''Northwest Ohio Quarterly''  (1989) 61 (2–4): 46–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Indian nations generally followed [[Tenskwatawa]] (the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]), who since 1805 had preached his vision of purifying his society by expelling the "Children of the Evil Spirit" (the American settlers).&lt;ref&gt;Timothy D. Willig. ''Restoring the Chain of Friendship: British Policy and the Indians of the Great Lakes, 1783–1815'' (2008) p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pratt says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is ample proof that the British authorities did all in their power to hold or win the allegiance of the Indians of the Northwest with the expectation of using them as allies in the event of war. Indian allegiance could be held only by gifts, and to an Indian no gift was as acceptable as a lethal weapon. Guns and ammunition, tomahawks and scalping knives were dealt out with some liberality by British agents.&lt;ref&gt;Julius W. Pratt, ''A history of United States foreign-policy'' (1955) p 126&lt;/ref&gt;
Raiding grew more common in 1810 and 1811; Westerners in Congress found the raids intolerable and wanted them permanently ended.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, eds. ''Encyclopedia of the War of 1812'' (1997) pp. 253, 504&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuehlke, ''For Honour's Sake,'' p 62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===American expansionism===
Historians have considered the idea that American expansionism was one cause of the war. The American expansion into the Northwest—Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin—was being blocked by Indians and that was a major cause animating the Westerners.  American historian Walter Nugent in his history of  American expansionism argues that expansion into the Midwest "was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one area but it was an objective."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Nugent, ''Habits of Empire: A History of American Expansionism'' (2009) ch 3, quoted on page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Annexation====
More controversy is the question whether an American war goal was to permanently acquire Canadian lands (especially western Ontario), or whether it was planned to seize the area temporarily as a bargaining chip. The American desire for Canadian land has been a staple in Canadian public opinion since the 1830s, and was much discussed among historians before 1940, but has become less popular since then. The idea was first developed by Marxist historian [[Louis M. Hacker]] and refined by diplomatic specialist Julius Pratt.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker (1924); Pratt (1925). Goodman (1941) refuted the idea and even Pratt gave it up. Pratt (1955)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1925, Pratt argued that Western Americans were incited to war by the prospect of seizing Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Julius W. Pratt,  "Western Aims in the War of 1812." ''The Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1925): 36-50. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1891784 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pratt's argument supported the belief of many Canadians, especially in Ontario, where fear of American expansionism was a major political element. To this day the notion still survives among Canadians.&lt;ref&gt;W. Arthur Bowler, "Propaganda in Upper Canada in the War of 1812," ''American Review of Canadian Studies'' (1988) 28:11–32; C.P. Stacey, "The War of 1812 in Canadian History" in Morris Zaslow and Wesley B. Turner, eds. ''The Defended Border: Upper Canada and the War of 1812'' (Toronto, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:United States 1812-05-1812-06.png|left|thumb]]

In 2010 American historian [[Alan Taylor (historian)|Alan Taylor]] examined the political dimension of the annexation issue as Congress debated whether to declare war in 1811-12. The [[Federalist party]] was strongly opposed to war and to annexation, as were the northeastern states. The majority in Congress was held by the Jeffersonian Republican party, which split on the issue. One faction wanted to permanently expel Britain and annex Canada.  [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], representing Virginia, commented, "Agrarian greed not maritime right urges this war. We have heard but one word - like the whipporwill's one monotonous tone: Canada! Canada! Canada!"{{sfn|Fregosi|1989|p=328}}The other faction,  based in the South, said that acquiring new territory in the north would give the northern states too much power, and opposed the incorporation into Canada of a Catholic population which it viewed as "unfit by faith, language and illiteracy for republican citizenship."  The Senate held a series of debates, and twice voted on proposals to explicitly endorse annexation, neither of which passed, although the second one only failed because of a proviso stating that Canada could be returned to British rule after being annexed. War was declared with no mention of annexation although widespread support existed among the War Hawks for it. Some Southerners supported expansionism; Tennessee Senator [[Felix Grundy]] considered it essential to acquire Canada to ''preserve'' domestic political balance, arguing that annexing Canada would maintain the free state-slave state balance, which might otherwise be thrown off by the acquisition of Florida and the settlement of the southern areas of the new [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Roderick Heller|title=Democracy's Lawyer: Felix Grundy of the Old Southwest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u8mM8D9RVu4C&amp;pg=PA98|year=2010|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even [[James Monroe]] and [[Henry Clay]], key officials in the government, expected to gain at least Upper Canada from a successful war. American commanders like General William Hull and Alexander Smythe issued proclamations to Canadians and their troops assuring them that annexations would in fact occur during the war. Smythe wrote to his troops that when they entered Canada "You enter a country that is to become one with the United States. You will arrive among a people who are to become your fellow-citizens."  &lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels, &amp; Indian Allies'' (2010) pp 137-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seizing Canada as a bargaining chip====
Today historians generally agree that an invasion and temporary seizure of Canada was the Central American military strategy once the war began.  Given British control of the oceans, there was no other way to actively fight against British interests. President Madison believed that food supplies from Canada were essential to the British overseas empire in the West Indies, and that an American seizure would be an excellent bargaining chip at the peace conference. During the war, some Americans speculated that they might as well keep all of Canada. Thomas Jefferson, for example, although now out of power, argued that expulsion of British interests from nearby Canada would remove a long-term threat to American republicanism. New Zealand historian J.G.A. Stagg argues that Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their highly valuable West Indies sugar colonies. Furthermore, possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip. Stagg suggests frontiersmen demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land (they had plenty), but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking settlement of the west.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; As Horsman concludes, "The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea. The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war, not a reason for starting it."&lt;ref&gt;Horsman (1962) p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Hickey flatly states, "The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war." &lt;ref&gt;Hickey (1990) p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown (1964) concludes, "The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation not to annex Canada."&lt;ref&gt;Brown p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Burt, a Canadian scholar, but also a professor at an American university, agrees completely, noting that Foster, the British minister to Washington, also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal.&lt;ref&gt;Burt (1940) pp 305–10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Foster also rejected the possibility of a declaration of war, despite having dinner with several of the more prominent War Hawks, so his judgement in these matters can be questioned.

However,  historian J. C. A. Stagg states that, "... had the War 1812 been a successful military venture, the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy."{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Other authors concur, one stating, "Expansion was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one. But it was an objective",{{sfn|Nugent|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zDQlAp4T4wC&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;vq=The%20American%20yearning&amp;pg=PA75#v=snippet&amp;q=Expansion%20was%20not%20the%20only%20American%20objective&amp;f=false 73]}} and that "The American yearning to absorb Canada was long-standing...In 1812 it became part of a grand strategy."{{sfn|Nugent|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_zDQlAp4T4wC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;vq=War%20of%201812&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20American%20yearning%22&amp;f=false 75]}} Another suggests that "Americans harboured '[[manifest destiny]]' ideas of Canadian annexation throughout the nineteenth century."{{sfn|Carlisle|Golson|2007|p=44}} A third states that "[t]he [American] belief that the United States would one day annex Canada had a continuous existence from the early days of the War of Independence to the War of 1812 [and] was a factor of primary importance in bringing on the war."{{sfn|Pratt|1925|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}} }} Another says that "acquiring Canada would satisfy America's expansionist desires" .&lt;ref&gt;David Heidler,Jeanne T. Heidler, The War of 1812, pg4 {{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} &lt;!--needs a date--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Spencer Tucker tells us that "War Hawks were eager to wage war with the British, not only to end Indian depredations in the Midwest but also to seize Canada and perhaps Spanish Florida."{{sfn|Tucker|2011|p=236}}

===Inhabitants of Ontario===
The majority of the inhabitants of [[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) were Americans, some of them exiled ([[United Empire Loyalist]]s) and most of them recent immigrants. The Loyalists were extremely hostile to union with the U.S., while the other settlers seem to have been uninterested and remained neutral during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army, and some Americans believed that the many in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American invading army as liberators.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Landon, ''Western Ontario and the American Frontier'' (1941) pp 12–22&lt;/ref&gt; The combination implied an easy conquest. Once the war began retired president [[Thomas Jefferson]] warned that the British presence posed a grave threat, pointing to "The infamous intrigues of Great Britain to destroy our government....and with the Indians to Tomahawk our women and children, prove that the cession of Canada, their fulcrum for these Machiavellian levers, must be a ''sine qua non'' at a treaty of peace. Jefferson predicted in late 1812, "the acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Laxer|title=Tecumseh and Brock: The War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fQb5JI-G9bwC&amp;pg=PA129|year=2012|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maass argued in 2015 that the expansionist theme is a myth that goes against the "relative consensus among experts that the primary U.S. objective was the repeal of British maritime restrictions. He argues that consensus among scholars is that The United States went to war "because six years of economic sanctions had failed to bring Britain to the negotiating table, and threatening the Royal Navy's Canadian supply base was their last hope." However, he also notes that many historians continue to publish in support of expansionism as a cause, and that even those opposed to the idea continue to include caveats regarding "possible expansionism underlying US motives". Maass agrees that theoretically expansionism might have tempted Americans, but finds that "leaders feared the domestic political consequences of doing so. Notably, what limited expansionism there was focused on sparsely populated western lands rather than the more populous eastern settlements [of Canada]." &lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Maass, "Difficult to Relinquish Territory Which Had Been Conquered": Expansionism and the War of 1812," ''Diplomatic History'' (Jan 2015) 39#1 pp 70-97 doi: 10.1093/dh/dht132 [http://dh.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/01/06/dh.dht132.short Abstract Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Violations of American rights==
The long wars between Britain and France (1793–1815) led to repeated complaints by the U.S. that both powers violated America's right as a neutral to trade with both sides. Furthermore, Americans complained loudly that British agents in Canada were supplying munitions to hostile [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes living in [[Territorial evolution of the United States|United States territory]].

Starting in the mid-1790s the [[Royal Navy]], short of manpower, began boarding American merchant ships in order to seize American and British sailors from American vessels. Although this policy of [[impressment]] was supposed to reclaim only British subjects, the law of Britain and most countries defined nationality by birth whereas the United States allowed individuals who had been resident in America for some time to adopt American citizenship. There were, therefore, large numbers of individuals who were British by British law but American by American law. The confusion was compounded by the refusal of Jefferson and Madison to issue any official citizenship documents: their position was that all persons serving on American ships were to be regarded as US citizens and that no further evidence was required. This stance was motivated by the advice of [[Albert Gallatin]], who had calculated that half of American deep-sea merchant seamen - 9,000 men - were British subjects. Allowing the Royal Navy to reclaim these men would destroy both the US economy and the vital customs revenue of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p565&lt;/ref&gt; Any sort of accommodation would jeopardize these men, and so concords such as the proposed [[Monroe-Pinkney Treaty]] (1806) between the U.S. and Britain were rejected by Jefferson.

To fill the need for some sort of identification, US consuls provided unofficial papers. However, these relied on unverifiable declarations by the individual concerned for evidence of citizenship, and the large fees paid for the documents made them a lucrative sideline. In turn, British officers- short of personnel and convinced, not entirely unreasonably, that the US flag covered a large number of British deserters- tended to treat such papers with scorn. Between 1806 and 1812 about 6,000 seamen were impressed and taken against their will into the Royal Navy&lt;ref&gt;Hickey (1989) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; of which 3,800 were subsequently released.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, Command of the Ocean, p566&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honor==
Historian Norman Risjord has emphasized the central importance of honour as a cause the war.&lt;ref&gt;Norman K. Risjord, "1812: Conservatives, War Hawks and the Nation's Honor." ''William and Mary Quarterly: A Magazine of Early American History'' (1961): 196-210. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject  the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Ivie, "The metaphor of force in prowar discourse: The case of 1812." ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 68#3 (1982) pp: 240-253.&lt;/ref&gt; This quest for honor was a major cause of the war in the sense that most Americans who were not involved in mercantile interests or threatened by Indian attack strongly endorsed the preservation of national honor.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford Perkins, ''The causes of the War of 1812: National honor or national interest?'' (1962).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair|The humiliating attack]] by the HMS Leopard against the USS Chesapeake in June 1807 was a decisive event.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker and Frank T. Reuter, ''Injured Honor: The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, June 22, 1807'' (Naval Institute Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Americans called for war, but Jefferson held back, insisting that economic warfare would prove more successful.  Jefferson initiated economic warfare, especially in the form of embargoing or refusing to sell products to Britain.  It proved a failure, that did not deter the British but it seriously damaged American industry had alienated the mercantile cities of the Northeast that were so seriously hurt.  Historians have demonstrated the motive power of honor in shaping public opinion in a number of states, including Massachusetts,&lt;ref&gt;William Barlow and David O. Powell. "Congressman Ezekiel Bacon of Massachusetts and the Coming of the War of 1812." ''Historical Journal of Massachusetts'' 6#2 (1978): 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Barlow, "Ohio's Congressmen and the War of 1812." Ohio History 72 (1963): 175-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;Victor Sapio, ''Pennsylvania and the War of 1812'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kaufman, "War Sentiment in Western Pennsylvania: 1812." ''Pennsylvania History'' (1964): 436-448.&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee,&lt;ref&gt;William A. Walker, "Martial Sons: Tennessee Enthusiasm for the War of 1812." ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' 20.1 (1961): 20+&lt;/ref&gt; and Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;Edwin M. Gaines, "The Chesapeake Affair: Virginians Mobilize to Defend National Honor." ''The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'' (1956): 131-142.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the territory of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;William Barlow, "The Coming of the War of 1812 in Michigan Territory." Michigan History 53 (1969): 91-107.&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 3, 1812, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, chaired by [[fire-eater]] [[John C. Calhoun]] called for a declaration of war in ringing phrases, denouncing Britain's "lust for power," "unbounded tyranny," and "mad ambition." James Roark says, "These were fighting words in a war that was in large measure about insult and honor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James L. Roark|author2=Patricia Cline Cohen|title=Understanding the American Promise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZMlH-LpGRTYC&amp;pg=PA259|year=2011|page=259|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calhoun reaped much of the credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James H. Ellis|title=A Ruinous and Unhappy War: New England and the War of 1812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-1rPwtSISAcC&amp;pg=PA75|year=2009|publisher=Algora Publishing|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of honour, the conclusion of the war, especially the spectacular defeat of the main British invasion army at New Orleans, did restore the American sense of honor. Historian Lance Banning says: 
:National honour, the reputation of republican government, and the continuing supremacy of the Republican party had seemed to be at stake.... National honour had [now] been satisfied....Americans celebrated the end of the struggle with a brilliant burst of national pride.  They felt that they had fought a second war for independence, and had won. If little had been gained, nothing had been lost in a contest the greatest imperial power on the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lance Banning|title=The Jeffersonian Persuasion: Evolution of a Party Ideology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YL-HcJj1MO0C&amp;pg=PA295|year=1980|publisher=Cornell UP|page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear whether the British acknowledged American honor, because when peace was signed, impressment remained legal. Nevertheless, the practice ended because the Napoleonic wars had ended and the Royal Navy no longer required as many men.

==American economic motivations==
The failure of Jefferson's embargo and Madison's economic coercion, according to Horsman, "made war or absolute submission to England the only alternatives, and the latter presented more terrors to the recent colonists. The war hawks came from the West and the South, regions that had supported economic warfare and were suffering the most from British restrictions at sea. The merchants of New England earned large profits from the wartime carrying trade, in spite of the numerous captures by both France and England, but the western and southern farmers, who looked longingly at the export market, were suffering a depression that made them demand war".&lt;ref&gt;Horsman (1962) p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents leading up to the war==
This dispute came to the forefront with the [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair]] of 1807, when the British warship HMS ''Leopard'' fired on and boarded the American warship USS ''Chesapeake'', killing three and carrying off four deserters from the [[Royal Navy]]. (Only one was a British citizen and he was subsequently hanged; the other three were American citizens and were later returned, though the last two not until 1812.) The American public was outraged by the incident, and many called for war in order to assert American sovereignty and national honor.

The Chesapeake-Leopard Affair followed closely on the similar [[HMS Leander (1780)#The Leander Affair|''Leander'' Affair]], which had resulted in President Jefferson banning certain British warships and their captains from American ports and waters. Whether in response to this incident or the Chesapeake-Leopard Affair, President Jefferson banned all foreign armed vessels from American waters, except those bearing dispatches. In December 1808, an American officer expelled the schooner [[HMS Pitt (1805)|HMS ''Sandwich'']] from Savannah, Georgia, after she had entered with dispatches for the British Consul there.

Meanwhile, Napoleon's [[Continental System]] (beginning 1806) and the British [[Orders in Council (1807)]] established embargoes that made international trade precarious. From 1807 to 1812, about 900 American ships were seized as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Hickey (1989) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. responded with the [[Embargo Act of 1807]], which prohibited American ships from sailing to any foreign ports and closed American ports to British ships. Jefferson's embargo was especially unpopular in [[New England]], where merchants preferred the indignities of impressment to the halting of overseas commerce. This discontent contributed to the calling of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814.

The Embargo Act had no effect on Great Britain and France and was replaced by the [[Non-Intercourse Act|Non-Intercourse Act of 1809]], which lifted all embargoes on American shipping except for those bound for British or French ports. As this proved to be unenforceable, the Non-Intercourse Act was replaced in 1810 by [[Macon's Bill Number 2]]. This lifted all embargoes but offered that if either France or Great Britain were to cease their interference with American shipping, the United States would reinstate an embargo on the other nation. Napoleon, seeing an opportunity to make trouble for Great Britain, promised to leave American ships alone, and the United States reinstated the embargo with Great Britain and moved closer to declaring war.&lt;ref&gt;Napoleon had no intention of honoring promise: Hickey, p. 22; Horsman, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exacerbating the situation, [[Sauk people|Sauk]] Indians who controlled trade on the Upper Mississippi were displeased with the U.S. Government after the 1804 treaty between [[Quashquame]] and [[William Henry Harrison]]. This treaty ceded Sauk territory in Illinois and Missouri to the U.S.; the Sauk felt this treaty was unjust, that Quashquame was unauthorized to sign away land, and that he was unaware of what he was signing. The establishment of [[Fort Madison]] in 1808 on the Mississippi further aggravated the Sauk, and led many, including [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]], to side with the British before the war broke out. Sauk and allied Indians, including the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago), were very effective fighters for the British on the Mississippi, helping to defeat Fort Madison and Fort McKay in [[Prairie du Chien]].

Oxford historian Paul Langford looks at the decisions by the British government in 1812: 
:The British ambassador in Washington [Erskine] brought affairs almost to an accommodation, and was ultimately disappointed not by American intransigence but by one of the outstanding diplomatic blunders made by a Foreign Secretary. It was [[George Canning|Canning]] who, in his most irresponsible manner and apparently out of sheer dislike of everything American, recalled the ambassador [[David Erskine, 2nd Baron Erskine|Erskine]] and wrecked the negotiations, a piece of most gratuitous folly. As a result, the possibility of a new embarrassment for Napoleon turned into the certainty of a much more serious one for his enemy. Though the British cabinet eventually made the necessary concessions on the score of the [[Orders in Council (1807)|Orders-in-Council]], in response to the pressures of industrial lobbying at home, its action came too late…. The loss of the North American markets could have been a decisive blow. As it was by the time the United States declared war, the [[Continental System]] [of Napoleon] was beginning to crack, and the danger correspondingly diminishing.  Even so, the war, inconclusive though it proved in a military sense, was an irksome and expensive embarrassment which British statesman could have done much more to avert.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Langford, ''Modern British Foreign Policy: The Eighteenth Century: 1688-1815'' (1976) p 228&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration of war==
In the [[United States House of Representatives]], a group of young [[Democratic-Republican Party (United States)|Democratic-Republicans]] known as the "[[War Hawk]]s" came to the forefront in 1811, led by [[Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]] and [[John C. Calhoun]] of [[South Carolina]]. The War Hawks advocated going to war against Great Britain for all of the reasons listed above, though concentrating on the grievances more than the territorial expansion.

On the first of June 1812, President [[James Madison]] gave a speech to the [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. After Madison's speech, the House of Representatives quickly voted (79 to 49) to declare war, and the Senate by 19 to 13. The conflict formally began on  18 June 1812 when Madison signed the measure into law. This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to declare war in American history. None of the 39 [[Federalist Party (United States)|Federalist]]s in Congress voted in favor of the war; critics of war subsequently referred to it as "Mr. Madison's War."

When a pizza party does not include any custom-made pizzas, and the particular preferences of the guests are unknown, it is common to include at least one plain cheese-only or vegetable-only pizza for people who are averse to meats or other available toppings.&lt;ref&gt;Hulin, Belinda.

The '''R40 Live Tour''' was the final tour by Canadian rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] that commemorated the 40th anniversary of drummer [[Neil Peart]] joining the band in July 1974. The title hearkens back to Rush's 2004 [[R30: 30th Anniversary Tour]] that celebrated the 30 year anniversary of the band. The tour began on May 8 in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], and concluded in [[Inglewood, California]], on August 1. The shows performed on June 17 and 19, 2015, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto were filmed and released as the concert film ''[[R40 Live]]'' on November 20, 2015. Portions of the shows in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], on July 9, and [[Buffalo, New York]], on June 10 were included as bonus tracks on the album.

'''''Respekt''''' is a Czech weekly [[newsmagazine]] published in Prague, the [[Czech Republic]], reporting on domestic and foreign [[politics|political]] and [[economy|economic]] issues, as well as on [[science]] and [[culture]].

==History and profile==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
[[Image:respekt cover 1990-01.gif|thumb|upright|''Respekt'''s first cover (March 14, 1990)]]

''Respekt'' was founded very soon after [[Velvet Revolution|the fall of Communist party from power]] in 1989&lt;ref name=smid&gt;{{cite web|author=Milan Smid|title=Czech Republic|url=http://www2.mirovni-institut.si/media_ownership/pdf/czech%20republic.pdf|publisher=Mirovni Institut|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by a group of [[samizdat]] journalists as one of the very first independent magazines. It is the successor of ''Informační servis'' (''Information service''), an opposition samizdat paper.&lt;ref name=smid/&gt; ''Respekt'' is published weekly and has its headquarters in Prague.&lt;ref name=vlas&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vlastimil Nečas|journal=Central European Journal of Communication|title=Constitutional debate in the Czech Republic|url=http://ptks.pl/cejc/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CEJC_Vol2_No2_Necas.pdf|date=Fall 2009|volume=2|issue=2|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The press in the Czech Republic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3654061.stm|accessdate=17 February 2015|work=BBC|date=29 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[New York Times]]'' describes ''Respekt'' as "influential."&lt;ref name="BilefskyInfluential"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bilefsky|first1=Dan|title=Czech Man Is Charged With Attempted Terrorism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/world/europe/czech-man-attempted-terrorism.html?ref=world|accessdate=3 August 2016|publisher=New York Times|date=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several people involved with ''Respekt'' became influential in top level politics of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the Czech Republic; among them the first editor-in-chief [[Jan Ruml]] who served as the Minister of Interior between 1992 and 1997, Martin Fendrych (official at the Ministry of Interior) and {{ill|Vladimír Mlynář|cs}} (several ministerial position).

Editors describe ''Respekt'' as "a [[Liberalism|liberal]] magazine which stands up for [[freedom of thought]] and the need of continuous questioning of its outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/pg/tydenikrespekt/about/?ref=page_internal&lt;/ref&gt; The weekly concentrates on [[investigative journalism]] (often using information gleaned from police sources) and in-depth articles, and has been expanding to cover ecological activism and alternative culture movements in recent years. 

In 2005 ''Respekt'' published details about business connection between Prime Minister [[Stanislav Gross]]' wife and a brothel owner, starting a scandal leading to downfall of Gross several months later; in 2008 it published an article alleging that [[Milan Kundera]], when a student, denounced to the police a Czech spy for the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fokus.respekt.cz/Udani-Milana-Kundery-2737.html Udání Milana Kundery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/tema/index_view.php?id=340173&amp;id_seznam=14555 Milan Kundera demands apology from Respekt for defaming him]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Magazine circulation|circulation]] of the weekly peaked at over 100,000 copies in the middle of the 1990s. At this time the (loss generating) weekly was bought by [[Karel Schwarzenberg]]´s ''R-Presse''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/europe/4068647.stm|title=The press in the Czech Republic|work=BBC news|date=10 December 2005|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The circulation has been dropping steadily over the time causing Respekt's losses to increase to 7 million [[Czech koruna|Czk]] in 2003. In 2006 [[Zdeněk Bakala]] obtained majority in ''Respekt'' and planned to eliminate the loss by making the journal more mainstream. The proposed changes led to fear among both readers and the editors that the unique flavour of the weekly will be destroyed; in September 2006 all editors threatened to leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/redaktori-respektu-dali-vypoved-kvuli-novym-sefum-f84-/domaci.asp?c=A060922_083157_domaci_sfo|title=Editors of Respekt gave notice|language=Czech|work=[[MF Dnes]]|accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a week the owners submitted to the pressure, recalled the manager responsible to implement the changes and brought in a new editor-in-chief, [[Martin Milan Šimečka|Martin M. Šimečka]], former [[editor-in-chief]] of the Slovak daily ''[[SME (newspaper)|SME]]''. Modification of the visual style and the format was delayed until September 2007.

The circulation in 2006 was around 25,000 copies and the weekly was read by approximately 80,000 people each week. In 2007 the circulation was around 16-17,000 copies. According to a February 2008 survey, it is read by 94,000 people and remains one of the most cited journals and newspapers in the Czech Republic.

===Legal actions===
Since ''Respekt'' regularly reports on its investigations into bribery scandals, criminal activity or government mishandling, legal action is periodically taken against Respekt, often by top level politicians. Most of these cases that have gone to court have been won by the weekly. 

The most visible case was the Czech government's 2001 attempt to sue ''Respekt'' for libel. [[Miloš Zeman]], the instigator of the case, saw it as a way to "''put the journal to its end''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/11107/limit|title=Cabinet filing charges against 'RESPEKT' weekly|work=[[Czech Radio]]|accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case fizzled away only embarrassing the government.

==Visual style==
''Respekt'' used its own distinguished visual style that stayed almost unchanged since 1990. With [[Paper size|A3 format]] (24 or 32 pages) and [[Black-and-white|black &amp; white]] print it resembled more a daily newspaper than a magazine (most of the magazines in the Czech Republic are smaller and printed on glossy paper with heavy use of color and photos). 

Front cover drawings by illustrator [[Pavel Reisenauer]] very soon became a symbol of the weekly. After several years the front page drawings switched from black and white to color. Reisenauer also contributed with drawings on the back cover and for the articles. All photos were black and white, their number was intentionally kept down. Advertisements were added at the end of 1991 in limited form, compared to other Czech journals.

The changes planned by the new owner in 2006 (glossy paper, use of color, coverage of day-to-day events or consumer advice) were cancelled at the time (see history above). In September 2007 the format has been changed, color replaced the black &amp; white photos and the advertisement section was expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/media/casopis-respekt-bude-barevny-a-drazsi_20827.html|title=Respekt will use colors, price goes up|language=Czech|work=Journal Týden|accessdate=7 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respekt.cz/externality-diskuze.php?fIDEXT=825&amp;fACT=ALL|title=Editor Marek Švehla about the changes|language=Czech|accessdate=7 September 2007|quote=Švehla describes the changes and explains that the loss making journal needs to implement them.

===Web presence===
During the early 2000s all old issues of ''Respekt'' have been converted into electronic form and made available online for [[subscriber]]s in [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] form. An attempt to establish a commercial news-bulletin sent by email failed. In 2006 Respekt was among the first Czech newspapers to provide blogging space for the public on their website.

{{criminal law}}
'''Robbery''' is the [[crime]] of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force, or by putting the victim in fear. According to [[common law]], robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property, by means of force or fear; that is, it is a [[larceny]] or [[theft]] accomplished by an [[assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/000439.php |title=Carter, Floyd J. vs U.S. |date=June 12, 2000 |accessdate=2008-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903163713/http://docket.medill.northwestern.edu/archives/000439.php |archivedate=September 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Precise definitions of the offence may vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of [[theft]] (such as [[burglary]], [[shoplifting]], or [[car theft]]) by its inherently violent nature (a [[violent crime]]); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as [[misdemeanors]], robbery is always a [[felony]] in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are [[triable either way]], whereas robbery is [[triable only on indictment]]. The word "rob" came via [[French language|French]] from [[Late Latin]] words (e.g., ''deraubare'') of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin, from [[Common Germanic]] ''raub'' -- "theft".

Among the types of robbery are '''armed robbery''' involving use of a [[weapon]]  and '''aggravated robbery''' when someone brings with them a deadly weapon or something that appears to be a deadly weapon. '''Highway robbery''' or '''mugging''' takes place outside or in a [[public place]] such as a sidewalk, street, or parking lot. [[Carjacking]] is the act of stealing a car from a victim by force.  [[Extortion]] is the threat to do something illegal, or the offer to not do something illegal, in the event that goods are not given, primarily using words instead of actions.
Criminal slang for robbery includes "blagging" (armed robbery, usually of a bank) or "stick-up" (derived from the verbal command to robbery targets to raise their hands in the air), and "[[steaming (crime)|steaming]]" (organized robbery on underground train systems).

== Canada ==

In Canada, the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] makes robbery an [[indictable offence]], subject to a maximum penalty of [[Life imprisonment in Canada|life imprisonment]].  If the accused uses a restricted or prohibited firearm to  commit robbery, there is a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the first offence, and seven years for subsequent offences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Criminal Code (Canada)|''Criminal Code'']], [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-177.html#docCont RSC 1985, c C-46, ss 343, 344.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Republic of Ireland ==
Robbery is a statutory offence in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. It is created by section 14(1) of the [[Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001]], which provides:

{{Blockquote|A person is guilty of robbery if he or she steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2001/en/act/pub/0050/sec0014.html#sec14 Digitised copy] of section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001. From the Office of the Attorney General.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== United Kingdom ==

=== England and Wales ===
Robbery is a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;The extent of section 8 of the [[Theft Act 1968]] is provided by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/36 section 36(3)] of that Act.&lt;/ref&gt; It is created by section 8(1) of the [[Theft Act 1968]] which reads:
{{quote|A person is guilty of robbery if he steals, and immediately before or at the time of doing so, and in order to do so, he uses force on any person or puts or seeks to put any person in fear of being then and there subjected to force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/section/8 Digitised copy] of section 8 of the Theft Act 1968, from Legislation.gov.uk.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Aggravated theft'''

Robbery is the only offence of aggravated theft.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward 1978. page 79"&gt;Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Sweet and Maxwell. Fifth Edition. 1986. Paragraph 3-01 at page 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aggravated robbery'''

There are no offences of aggravated robbery.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward 1978. page 79" /&gt;

==== Steals ====
This requires evidence to show a [[theft]] as set out in section 1(1) of the Theft Act 1968. In ''R v Robinson''&lt;ref&gt;R v Robinson [1977] Crim LR 173, CA&lt;/ref&gt; the defendant threatened the victim with a knife in order to recover money which he was actually owed. His conviction for robbery was quashed on the basis that Robinson had an honest, although unreasonable, belief (under Section 2(1)(a) of the Act) in his legal right to the money. See also R v Skivington [1968] 1 QB 166, [1967] 2 WLR 655, 131 JP 265, 111 SJ 72, [1967] 1 All ER 483, 51 [[Criminal Appeal Reports|Cr App R]] 167, CA.

In ''R v Hale'' (1978)&lt;ref&gt;R v Hale (1978) 68 Cr App R 415, [1979] Crim LR 596, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]]&lt;/ref&gt; the application of force and the stealing took place in different locations, and it was not possible to establish the timing; it was held that the appropriation necessary to prove theft was a continuing act, and the jury could correctly convict of robbery; this approach was followed in ''R v Lockley'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Crim LR 656&lt;/ref&gt; when the force was applied to a shopkeeper after property had been taken. It was argued that the theft should be regarded as complete by this time, and ''R v Gomez'' (1993),&lt;ref&gt;[1993] AC 442, House of Lords&lt;/ref&gt; should apply; the court disagreed, preferring to follow ''R v Hale''.

==== Actual or threatened force against a person ====
The threat or use of force must take place immediately before or at the time of the [[theft]]. Force used after the theft is complete will not turn the theft into a robbery.

The words "or immediately after" that appeared in section 23(1)(b) of the [[Larceny Act 1916]] were deliberately omitted from section 8(1).&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Law Revision Committee]]. Eighth Report. Theft and Related Offences. 1966. Cmnd 2977. Paragraph 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book "Archbold" said that the facts in R v Harman,&lt;ref&gt;R v Harman (1620) 1 [[Historia Placitorum Coronæ|Hale]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KoDAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA534 534], (1620) 2 Rolle 154, (1620) 81 [[English Reports|ER]] [http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/EngR/1676/218.pdf 721]&lt;/ref&gt; which did not amount to robbery in 1620, would not amount to robbery now.&lt;ref&gt;[[Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice]], 1999, para. 21-99 at p. 1772&lt;/ref&gt;

It was held in ''R v Dawson and James'' (1978)&lt;ref&gt;R v Dawson and James (1978) 68 Cr App R 170, CA&lt;/ref&gt; that "force" is an ordinary English word and its meaning should be left to the jury. This approach was confirmed in  ''R v Clouden'' (1985)&lt;ref&gt;R v Clouden, unreported (C.A. No. 3897, 4 February 1985). For details see Griew, Edward. The Theft Acts 1968 and 1978. Fifth Edition. Sweet and Maxwell. 1986. Paragraphs 3-04 and 3-05 at page 80.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Corcoran v Anderton'' (1980),&lt;ref&gt;Corcoran v Anderton (1980) 71 Cr App R 104, [1980] Crim LR 385, [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|DC]]&lt;/ref&gt; both handbag-snatching cases. Stealing may involve a young child who is not aware that taking other persons' property is not in order.

==== Threat ====
The victim must be placed in apprehension or fear that force would be used immediately before or at the time of the taking of the property. A threat is not immediate if the wrongdoer threatens to use force of violence some future time.

Robbery occurs if an aggressor forcibly snatched a [[mobile phone]] or if they used a knife to make an implied threat of violence to the holder and then took the phone. The person being threatened does not need to be the owner of the property. It is not necessary that the victim was actually frightened, but the defendant must have put or sought to put the victim or some other person in fear of immediate force.&lt;ref&gt;R v Khan  LTL (9 April 2001) and Archbold 2006 21-101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The force or threat may be directed against a third party, for example a customer in a jeweller's shop.&lt;ref&gt;''Smith v Desmond'' [1965] HL&lt;/ref&gt; Theft accompanied by a threat to damage property will not constitute robbery, but it may disclose an offence of [[blackmail]].

Dishonestly dealing with property stolen during a robbery will constitute an offence of [[Handling Stolen Goods|handling]].

==== Mode of trial ====
Robbery is an [[indictable-only offence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;This is the effect of section 8(2) of the [[Theft Act 1968]] and paragraph 28(a) of Schedule 1 to the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sentence ====
[[File:Courtois.jpg|right|thumb|[[Banditry|Marauders]] attacking a group of travellers, by [[Jacques Courtois]]]]
Under current sentencing guidelines, the punishment for robbery is affected by a variety of aggravating and mitigating factors. Particularly important is how much harm was caused to the victim and how much [[culpability]] the offender had (e.g. carrying a weapon or leading a group effort implies high culpability). Robbery is divided into three categories which are, in increasing order of seriousness: street or less sophisticated commercial; dwelling; and professionally-planned commercial.&lt;ref name="sce&amp;w"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sentencingcouncil.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Robbery-offences-definitive-guideline-web.pdf |format=PDF |title=Sentencing Council |publisher=Sentencing Council - Robbery: Defintive guidelines |accessdate=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robbery generally results in a custodial sentence. Only a low-harm, low-culpability robbery with other mitigating factors would result in an alternative punishment, in the form of a high level [[Community service#Court ordered service|community order]].&lt;ref name="sce&amp;w"/&gt; The maximum legal punishment is [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|imprisonment for life]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Theft Act 1968]], section 8(2)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also subject to the mandatory sentencing regime under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003#Dangerous offenders|Criminal Justice Act 2003]]. Current sentencing guidelines advise that the sentence should be no longer than 20 years, for a high-harm, high-culpability robbery with other aggravating factors.

The "starting point" sentences are:
*Low-harm, low-culpability street robbery: 1 year
*Medium-harm, medium-culpability street robbery: 4 years
*Medium-harm, medium-culpability professionally-planned robbery: 5 years
*High-harm, high-culpability street robbery: 8 years
*High-harm, high-culpability professionally-planned robbery: 16 years&lt;ref name="sce&amp;w"/&gt;
An offender may also serve a longer sentence if they are convicted of other offences alongside the robbery, such as [[assault]] and [[grievous bodily harm]].

==== History ====
[[File:Robbery Under Arms The Eveleigh Payroll Heist, 1914 (6151815914) (6).jpg|thumb|"The Eveleigh Payroll Heist", 1914 was committed in the middle of the day in a busy area and has been reported to be the first robbery in [[Australia]] where a [[getaway car]] was used.]]

===== Common law =====
Robbery was an offence under the [[common law]] of England. Matthew Hale provided the following definition:

{{Blockquote|Robbery is the [[felonious]] and violent taking of any money or goods from the person of another, putting him in fear, be the value thereof above or under one shilling.&lt;ref&gt;1 Hale 532&lt;/ref&gt;}}

See the statutes 23 Hen 8 c 1 and 5 &amp; 6 Edw 6 c 9 as to [[benefit of clergy]]. And also 25 Hen 8 c 3 and 1 Edw 6 c 12. And also 29 Eliz c 15 and 3 &amp; 4 W &amp; M c 9.

The [[common law offence]] of robbery was abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before 1 January 1969&lt;ref&gt;The [[Theft Act 1968]], section 35(1)&lt;/ref&gt; by section 32(1)(a) of the [[Theft Act 1968]].

===== Statute =====
See sections 40 to 43 of the [[Larceny Act 1861]].

Section 23 of the [[Larceny Act 1916]] read:

{{Blockquote|23.-(1) Every person who -
:(a) being armed with any offensive weapon or instrument, or being together with one other person or more, robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person;
:(b) robs any person and, at the time of or immediately before or immediately after such robbery, uses any personal violence to any person;

shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for life, and, in addition, if a male, to be once privately whipped.

(2) Every person who robs any person shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding fourteen years.

(3) Every person who assaults any person with intent to rob shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof liable to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years.}}

This section provided maximum penalties for a number of offences of robbery and aggravated robbery.&lt;ref name="Griew, Edward 1978. page 79" /&gt;

The following cases relate to the use of force:
* R v Lapier (1784) 1 Leach 320
* R v Moore (1784) 1 Leach 335
* R v Davies (1803) 2 East PC 709
* R v Mason (1820) R &amp; R 419
* R v Gnosil (1824) 1 C &amp; P 304
* R v Walls and Hughes (1845) 2 C &amp; K 214

==== Assault with intent to rob ====
If a robbery is foiled before it can be completed, an alternative offence (with the same penalty, given by section 8(2) of the 1968 Act) is assault; any act which [[intention]]ally or [[Recklessness (law)|recklessly]] causes another to fear the immediate and unlawful use of force, with an intent to rob, will suffice.

The following cases are relevant:
* ''R v Trusty and Howard'' (1783) 1 East PC 418
* ''R v Sharwin'' (1785) 1 East PC 421

=====Mode of trial and sentence=====

Assault with intent to rob is an [[indictable-only offence]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; It is punishable with [[Life imprisonment in England and Wales|imprisonment for life]] or for any shorter term.&lt;ref&gt;The Theft Act 1968, section 8(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Assault with intent to rob is also subject to the mandatory sentencing regime under the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003#Dangerous offenders|Criminal Justice Act 2003]].

=== Northern Ireland ===
Robbery is a statutory offence in [[Northern Ireland]]. It is created by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1969/16/section/8 section 8] of the [[Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969]].

== United States ==
In the United States, robbery is generally treated as an aggravated form of common law larceny. Specific elements and definitions differ from state to state. The common elements of robbery are:
# a trespassory
# taking and
# carrying away
# of the personal property
# of another
# with the intent to steal
# from the person or presence of the victim
# by force or threat of force.&lt;ref&gt;Lafave, Criminal Law 3rd ed. (West 2000) Sec. 8.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six elements are the same as common law larceny. It is the last two elements that aggravate the crime to common law robbery.

'''from the person or presence of the victim''' – robbery requires that the property be taken directly from the person of the victim or from their presence. This is different from larceny which simply requires that property be taken from the victim's possession, actual or constructive. Property is "on the victim's person" if the victim is actually holding the property, or the property is contained within clothing the victim is wearing or is attached to a victim's body such as a watch or earrings.&lt;ref name="Lafave 2000"&gt;Lafave, Criminal Law 3rd ed. (West 2000) Sec 8.11&lt;/ref&gt; Property is in a person's presence when it is within the area of their immediate control. The property has to be close enough to the victim's person that the victim could have prevented its taking if he/she had not been placed in fear or intimidation.&lt;ref name="Lafave 2000" /&gt;

'''by force or threat of force''' – the use of force or threat of force is the defining element of robbery. For there to be robbery there must be "force or fear" in perpetrating the theft.&lt;ref&gt;Lafave, Criminal Law 3rd ed. (West 2000) Sec 8.11;Boyce &amp; Perkins, Criminal Law, 3rd ed. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Questions concerning the degree of force necessary for robbery have been the subject of much litigation. Merely snatching the property from the victim's person is not sufficient force unless the victim resists or one of the items is attached or carried in such a way that a significant amount of force must be used to free the item from the victim's person.{{citation-needed|date=July 2018}}

For robbery the victim must be placed in "fear" of immediate harm by threat or intimidation. The threat need not be directed at the victim personally. Threats to third parties are sufficient. The threat must be one of present rather than future personal harm. Fear does not mean "fright",&lt;ref name="Lafave 2000" /&gt; it means apprehension – an awareness of the danger of immediate bodily harm.

=== California ===
The maximum sentence for robbery in California is 9 years, according to Penal Code section 213(a)(1)(A).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=211-215 |title=CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE  SECTION 211-215 |accessdate=2012-09-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023223508/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=211-215 |archive-date=2012-10-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat or use of force does not have to take place immediately before or at the time of the theft.&lt;ref&gt;People v. Gomez (2008) 43 Cal.4th 249, 254.&lt;/ref&gt; Force used after the theft will turn the theft into a robbery unless the theft is complete. The theft is considered completed when the perpetrator reaches a place of temporary safety with the property.&lt;ref&gt;People v. Flynn (2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 766, 772, 91 Cal.Rptr.2d 902.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Robbery statistics ==

=== Robberies, by country ===

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] notes "that when using the figures, any cross-national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, or the different methods of offence counting and recording". Also not every single crime is reported, meaning two things; (1) robbery rates are going to appear lower than they actually are and; (2) the percentage of crime that is not reported is going to be higher in some countries then others, for example – in one country 86% of the robberies were reported, whereas in another country only 67% of the robberies were reported. The last thing to note is that crime will vary by certain neighborhoods or areas in each country, so, just because a nationwide rate is a specified rate, does not mean that everywhere in that country retains the same amount of danger or safety.

== In popular culture ==
Robberies have been depicted, sometimes graphically, in various forms of media, and several robbers have become [[pop icon]]s, such as [[Bonnie and Clyde]] and [[John Dillinger]]. Examples of media works focused on robberies include:

=== In film ===
* ''[[The Killing (film)|The Killing]]'' (1956), by [[Stanley Kubrick]], depicts a graphic robbery.
* ''[[Wake Up and Die]]'' (1966) is an Italian crime drama film directed by [[Carlo Lizzani]], based on the real life of [[Luciano Lutring]] ("''il solista del mitra''", translation: "the submachine soloist"), who kept his weapon in a violin case.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|last=Piero Colaprico|title=Milano, è morto Luciano Lutring: lo chiamavano 'il solista del mitra'|url=http://milano.repubblica.it/cronaca/2013/05/13/news/milano_morto_luciano_lutring_lo_chiamavano_il_solista_del_mitra_-58674865/?ref=HREC1-5|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=[[La Repubblica]]|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Take the Money and Run]]'' (1969), by [[Woody Allen]], depicts an unconventional view of a robbery.
* ''Le Gitan'' (1975), directed by [[José Giovanni]], is loosely based on Luciano Lutring's autobiography. Lutring is played by [[Alain Delon]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;
* ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992), by [[Quentin Tarantino]], shows the aftermath of a robbery, with an abundance of lurid details.

=== In literature ===
* [[Luciano Lutring]] (30 December 1937 – 13 May 2013), known as "the submachine gun soloist" because he kept the weapon in a violin case, used that moniker as the title of his memoir ''[[Il solista del mitra]]''. He  was an Italian criminal, author, and painter who, when committing robberies, worked alone (which is rather rare for a robber).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://milano.corriere.it/milano/notizie/cronaca/13_maggio_13/morto-luciano-lutring-solista-mitra-poeta-pittore-2121108754360.shtml|title=Morto Luciano Lutring, l'ex bandito divenuto scrittore e artista|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|language=it-IT|access-date=2016-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ruchika Girhotra Case''' involves the molestation of 14-year-old Ruchika Girhotra in 1990 by the [[Inspector General of Police]] ''Mr. Shambu (S.P.S. Rathore)'' in [[Haryana]], India. After she made a complaint, the victim, her family, and her friends were systematically harassed by the police leading to her eventual suicide. On 22 December 2009, after 19 years, 40 adjournments, and more than 400 hearings, the court finally pronounced Rathore guilty under Section 354 [[Indian Penal Code|IPC]] (molestation) and sentenced him to six months imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1,000. The CBI had opposed Rathore's plea and had sought an enhancement of his sentence from six months to the maximum of two years after his conviction. Rejecting his appeal against his conviction by a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) special court, Chandigarh District Court on 25 May sentenced the disgraced former police official to one and a half years of rigorous imprisonment, enhancing his earlier six-month sentence and immediately taken into custody and taken to the Burail prison.&lt;ref name="ht-power"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-23/india/28076879_1_rathore-ruchika-girhotra-haryana-lawn-tennis-association Ruchika Girhotra Case: Molestation of Minor, Abuse of Power].

On 11 November 2010, the Supreme Court granted bail to S P S Rathore on the condition that he remain in Chandigarh.
Recently Supreme Court of India upheld Rathore's conviction in molestation case but restricted the punishment to six months jail already served by him considering his age.

==Background==
Ruchika Girhotra was a student in Class X A (Batch of 1991) at [[Sacred Heart School, Chandigarh|Sacred Heart School for Girls]] in Chandigarh. Her father, S.C Girhotra, was a manager with UCO Bank. Her mother died when she was ten years old.&lt;ref name="ti-batch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toi-nanny"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-27/chandigarh/28109554_1_ruchika-inquest-report-veena Cops made Ruchika's nanny pose as mum?]. ''The Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; She had one brother, Ashu.

Ruchika, along with her friend Aradhna Prakash, were enrolled as trainees at the [[Haryana Lawn Tennis Association]] (HLTA).&lt;ref name="ht-pics"/&gt;

Aradhna's parents Anand and Madhu Prakash attended over 400 hearings, after Ruchika's father and brother had to leave Panchkula due to harassment. Supreme Court lawyers Pankaj Bhardwaj and Meet Malhotra fought the case for free since 1996.&lt;ref name="ht-pics"&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/images/HTPopups/221209/23_12_09_the_case.htm The Ruchika Girhotra Case]. ''Hindustan Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatoday-twists"/&gt;

Born in 1941 and a 1966-Batch [[Indian Police Service]] officer of the Haryana Cadre, Rathore was on deputation to Bhakhra Beas Management Board as Director, Vigilance and Security, when he molested Ruchika. He was the founding president of the Haryana Lawn Tennis Association, and Rathore used the garage of his house at 469 Sector 6, Panchkula, as its office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/uncategorized/rathore-abandoned-by-his-buddies_100296003.html Rathore ‘abandoned’ by his buddies, Thaindian News]. Thaindian.com.&lt;/ref&gt; The house used to have a clay tennis court behind it, built by encroaching on government land. A few young girls played in this court.&lt;ref name="ht-pics"/&gt; Action by local authorities later led to the tennis court being reduced to a badminton court.&lt;ref name="sindh-molestor"&gt;[http://www.sindhtoday.net/news/1/86603.htm Molestor, Murderer, Rapist: Sector 6 has seen them all, Sindh Today]. Sindhtoday.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rathore's wife Abha is an advocate. She defended his case from the beginning.&lt;ref name="ht-pics"/&gt; She practices law in Panchkula and Chandigarh. Ajay Jain is another counsel for Rathore.&lt;ref name="ie-hype"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/hype-cant-be-sustained-on-facts-rathore-lawyer/560418/ Hype can’t be sustained on facts: Rathore lawyer, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (29 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rathore's daughter, Priyanjali, was Ruchika's classmate. She is now a practising lawyer.&lt;ref name="ti-batch"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2009/20091225/main6.htm How her world came apart bit by bit..., '&amp;#39;The Tribune'&amp;#39;, Chandigarh]. ''The Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt; His son, Rahul, used to practice law at the Punjab and Haryana High Courts. He used to be an advocate with [[Cox &amp; Kings]] in Mumbai.&lt;ref name="rahul"&gt;[http://www.moogle.in/Panchkula-Rahul_Rathore_in_Panchkula_C3A0P1Al0ST_Net1.html Rahul Rathore]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sub-Inspector Prem Dutt and Assistant Sub-Inspectors Sewa Singh and Jai Narayan of the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Staff Office in [[Mansa Devi]] tortured Ashu under the directions of Rathore.&lt;ref name="ie-cuffs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ie-threat"/&gt;

Sewa Singh is currently the Assistant Station House Officer of [[Pinjore]] police station. He has not reported for work since the sentencing of Rathore created national headlines.&lt;ref name="toi-cop2"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-05/chandigarh/28141303_1_panchkula-sessions-court-ruchika-case-s-c-girhotra Another accused cop seeks relief].

==Molestation==

Ruchika was a promising tennis player. On 11 August 1990, Rathore visited Ruchika's house and met her father S. C. Girhotra. As head of the Haryana Lawn Tennis Association, Rathore promised to get special training for Ruchika. He requested that Ruchika meet him the following day in connection with this.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-body"/&gt;

On 12 August (Sunday), Ruchika, along with her friend Aradhana (Aradhana Prakash), went to play at the lawn tennis court and met Rathore in his office (in the garage of his house). On seeing both of them, Rathore asked Aradhana to call the tennis coach (Mr. Thomas) to his room. Aradhana left, and Rathore was alone with Ruchika. He immediately grabbed her hand and waist and pressed his body against hers. Ruchika tried to push him away, but he continued molesting her.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-body"/&gt;

But Aradhana returned and witnessed what was going on. On seeing her, Rathore released Ruchika and fell back in his chair. He then asked Aradhana to go out of his room and personally bring the coach with her. When she refused, Rathore rebuked Aradhana loudly, asking her to bring the coach. He insisted that Ruchika stayed in his room, but she managed to run out.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-body"/&gt;

Ruchika told Aradhana everything that happened. Both girls did not tell anybody at first. The next day, they did not go to play tennis. The following day, 14 August, they changed the time of practice to avoid Rathore, and played till 6:30 pm. However, as they were leaving, the ball picker, Patloo, told them Rathore had called them to his office. It was at this point that the girls decided to tell their parents about the incident.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-body"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/76206/India/Ruchika's+affidavit:+Rathore+pressed+his+body+against+mine.html Ruchika's affidavit: Rathore pressed his body against mine, India Today]. Indiatoday.intoday.in (23 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tribune-uproar"&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20100110/spectrum/main1.htm Beyond the uproar, Sunday Tribune]. ''The Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, Panchkula residents, mostly parents of tennis players, gathered at the residence of Anand Prakash, father of Ruchika's friend Aradhana, and decided that some strong action must be taken by way of bringing up the matter with higher authorities.

They could not contact either the Chief Minister Hukum Singh or Home Minister Sampat Singh, but met Home Secretary J K Duggal, who, on 17 August 1990, discussed the matter with the Home Minister and asked DGP Ram Rakshpal Singh to investigate.&lt;ref name="toi-closet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ht-tricks"&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/haryana/Rathore-tried-all-tricks/Article1-489903.aspx Rathore tried all tricks]. ''Hindustan Times''. (23 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rathore allegedly paid some residents of Rajiv Colony (a slum) in Panchkula and also garnered the support of people from his community in Naraingarh, Ambala district. They staged dharnas outside the office and home of R R Singh.&lt;ref name="z-cbi"&gt;[http://www.zeenews.com/news589958.html CBI to re-probe Rathore's role in Ruchika case, ZeeNews]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1990, the inquiry report submitted by R R Singh to Home Secretary J K Duggal indicted Rathore.&lt;ref name="toi-closet"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-25/chandigarh/28111743_1_s-p-s-rathore-ruchika-molestation-case Skeletons falling out of Haryana govt closet]. ''The Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; It recommended that an FIR be filed immediately against Rathore. Duggal forwarded the report to the Home Minister [[Sampat Singh]], who failed to forward it to the Chief Minister for necessary action.&lt;ref name="toi-rogues"&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ruchika-molestation-case-the-rogues-gallery/107755-3.html?from=tn Ruchika Molestation Case: The Rogues Gallery, IBN Live]. Ibnlive.in.com (26 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The Home Secretary who replace Duggal never followed up on the report.&lt;ref name="toi-rogues"/&gt;

The report also revealed that an ex-[[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]], [[Jagjeet Singh Tikka]] organised a large group of men to shout slogans in front of Ruchika's house and harass her family.&lt;ref name="toi-rogues"/&gt; Rathore enjoyed the patronage of both the [[Hukam Singh (Haryana politician)|Hukam Singh]] and the [[Om Prakash Chautala]] governments.&lt;ref name="gaea-security"&gt;[http://breakingnews.gaeatimes.com/2009/12/24/we-need-security-says-ruchika-girhotras-family-336/ We Need Security Says Ruchika Girhotras Family, Gaea Times].

Instead of filing an FIR as recommended by the report, the government preferred departmental action, and, on 28 May 1991, issued a chargesheet against Rathore. However, the government's legal remembrancer, R. K. Nehru, suggested in 1992 that state government was not competent to issue the chargesheet, insisting that an FIR be registered. Then, the C M [[Bhajan Lal]]'s office referred the case to the chief secretary for advice. Eventually, no action was taken.&lt;ref name="toi-closet"/&gt;

Rathore was enjoying support from all the Chief Ministers and was using his influence and loop holes in the system to escape possible conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/77657/India/Baffling+twists+&amp;+turns+helped+Rathore.html Baffling twists &amp; turns helped Rathore : Latest Headlines, News – India Today].

''The Times of India'' (3 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harassment==

On 20 September 1990, two weeks after the inquiry indicted Rathore, Ruchika was expelled from her school, [[Sacred Heart School, Chandigarh|Sacred Heart School for Girls, in Sector 26, Chandigarh]]. Ruchika had studied there from Class I.

The school actively plotted against Ruchika. The official reason for her expulsion was non-payment of fees. The school had actually refused to accept her fees. No notice was given to Ruchika for non-payment of fees, as is the school's normal procedure. The school's brochure states that non-payment of fees can only lead to being disallowed to take exams. It is not grounds for expulsion.&lt;ref name="toi-norms"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-25/chandigarh/28063748_1_ruchika-expulsion-chandigarh-home-secretary-alma-mater Ruchika Expulsion Was Against School Norms]. ''The Times of India'' (25 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ie-school2cm"&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/From-school-to-CM-all-ganged-up-all-try-to-dodge-now/558626/ From School To CM All Ganged Up All Try to Dodge Now, Express India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226085112/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/From-school-to-CM-all-ganged-up-all-try-to-dodge-now/558626/ |date=26 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A magisterial inquiry has found that there were 135 similar cases of non-payment of fees at Sacred Hearts, but Ruchika was the only student ever expelled on these grounds. Of the 17 cases of late fees in 1990, at least 8 students paid their fees later than Ruchika did, but no action was taken against them. Ironically, the defaulters included Rathore’s daughter Priyanjali.&lt;ref name="ie-principal"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sacred-heart-principal-to-be-quizzed-today/561792/ Sacred Heart principal to be quizzed today, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (31 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zee-expulsion"&gt;[http://www.zeenews.com/news593617.html Ruchika's expulsion from school wrong: Rpt, Zee News]&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal of the school, Sister Sebastina, who used to occupy the office then, accepted to the magisterial inquiry that she personally issued instructions for the removal of Ruchika's name from school register.&lt;ref name="zee-expulsion"/&gt;

Ruchika's expulsion from school was later used by Rathore's lawyers to question her character.

It has been alleged that Ruchika was expelled to avoid embarrassing Rathore's daughter Priyanjali, who was her classmate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/news/videos/video_player.php?id=1188881 Ruchika embarrassed Rathore daughter Priyanjali? , NDTV]. Ndtv.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school tried to stall the magisterial inquiry into Ruchika's dismissal. Sister Sebastina only appeared before the inquiry after five days.&lt;ref name="zee-expulsion"/&gt; The Chandigarh authorities threatened the school with legal action if they continued to stall the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/ruchikas-school-not-aiding-probe-authorities/108060-3.html?from=tn Ruchika's school not aiding probe: authorities, IBN Live]. Ibnlive.in.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

After her expulsion, Ruchika confined herself indoors. Whenever she went out she was followed and abused by Rathore's henchmen.&lt;ref name="tele-torture"/&gt; Rathore deployed policemen in plainclothes in front of Ruchika's house to keep an eye on the family.&lt;ref name="ie-threat"/&gt;

False cases of theft, murder and civil defamation were filed against Ruchika's father and her 10-year-old brother Ashu. Five theft cases against Ashu were registered by Sub-Inspector Prem Dutt.
The cases were filed when KP Singh was the Superintendent of Police, Ambala. Singh has been named in an [[First Information Report|FIR]] filed by Ashu.&lt;ref name="ibn-victim"&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/i-am-rathores-victim-ruchikas-brother/108039-3.html I am Rathore's victim: Ruchika's brother, IBN Live]. Ibnlive.in.com (31 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Singh later provided Rathore's advocates a statement absolving Rathore.&lt;ref name="toi-loopholes"&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Ruchika-case-Rathore-finds-loopholes-to-counter-charges/articleshow/5406173.cms Ruchika case: Rathore finds loopholes to counter charges]. ''The Times of India'' (3 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Singh is now the Inspector General of Police (Training) in Haryana and works at the Chandigarh Head Office.&lt;ref name="toi-rogues"/&gt;

Cases were filed against Anand Parkash, his wife Madhu, and their minor daughter Aradhana.

Anand Parkash worked as Chief Engineer in the [[Haryana State Agriculture Marketing Board]] and had a spotless record until this incident. Rathore then instigated more than 20 complaints against him. He was suspended from his job for some time and demoted to Superintendent Engineer. He was eventually given premature retirement. He did, however, challenge the government orders and was given relief by the court and cleared of all the complaints.&lt;ref name="dna-hell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zee-denied"&gt;[http://www.zeenews.com/blog/12/blog280.html Ruchika: Justice delayed &amp; denied, Zee News]&lt;/ref&gt;

Aradhana, who is the sole witness in the molestation case, had ten civil cases filed against her by Rathore. She received abusive and threatening calls for months until she got married and left for Australia.&lt;ref name="dna-hell"/&gt;
Pankaj Bhardwaj, the lawyer who took up Ruchika's case, was slapped with two court cases by Rathore -a defamation case and a case for compensation.&lt;ref name="dna-hell"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report_rathore-made-life-hell-for-ruchika-s-family-pals_1327926 Rathore made life hell for Ruchika's family, pals, DNA India]. ''Daily News and Analysis''.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Rathore was heading the vigilance team in the Haryana State Electricity Board (HSEB), he sent special teams from Bhiwani to raid houses of several of his complainants.&lt;ref name="dna-hell"/&gt; Rathore also filed two cases against each of the journalists who had reported on the matter – one criminal and another civil – demanding compensation of Rs. 10&amp;nbsp;million each.&lt;ref name="dna-hell"/&gt;

On 23 September 1993, Ruchika's then 13-year-old brother, Ashu, was picked up in the market place near his house by police in plain clothes. They drove him in a jeep to the Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Staff Office in [[Mansa Devi]]. There, he was tortured by Sub-Inspector Prem Dutt and Assistant Sub-Inspectors Jai Narayan.&lt;ref name="ie-cuffs"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/brothers-handcuffed-parade-after-false-cases-pushed-ruchika-to-the-edge/558952/2 Brothers Handcuffed Parade After False Cases Pushed Ruchika to the Edge, Indian Express].

''The Indian Express''. (30 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

His hands were tied on his back and he was made to bend. His feet were tied with a weight. He was kept in this uncomfortable position for an extended period of time.&lt;ref name="tele-torture"&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1091225/jsp/nation/story_11907656.jsp I was tortured: Ruchika's brother. Court papers bare agony, Telegraph India]. ''The Telegraph'' (Calcutta).com (25 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

After some time, Rathore also arrived there. Ashu was then tortured further. A roller, referred to by the police as "Mussal', was rolled on his legs and thighs after four constables boarded the roller.&lt;ref name="tnow-torture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intoday-cia"/&gt;

While still in illegal confinement, Ashu was taken to his house and beaten mercilessly in front of Ruchika by Rathore. Rathore then threatened her, saying that if she did not take back the complaint, her father, and then she herself, would face the same fate.&lt;ref name="pioneer-mom"&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/224629/I%E2%80%99ll-keep-the-fight-going-says-mother-of-Ruchika%E2%80%99s-friend.html I’ll keep the fight going, says mother of Ruchika's friend, Daily Pioneer]{{dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ie-harass"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Behind-the-silence-of-Ruchika-s-family--a-tale-of-harassment-lurks/557641 Behind the silence of Ruchika’s family, a tale of harassment lurks, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (29 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Ashu was paraded in handcuffs in his neighbourhood.&lt;ref name="di-torture"/&gt;

Ashu was picked up again on 11 November 1993. He was tortured again and was unable to walk due to the beatings. He was not given food or water for days at a stretch and was beaten mercilessly. He was repeatedly told to convince his sister to withdraw her complaint.&lt;ref name="di-torture"&gt;[http://www.dailyindia.com/show/351365.php Ruchika molestation case: 'I was terrorised, beaten mercilessly', says Ruchika's brother, Daily India]. Dailyindia.com (29 December 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; He was allegedly forced to sign on blank papers, which were used by the police to show his "confessions" that he stole 11 cars.&lt;ref name="tnow-torture"/&gt; He would not be released until after his sister's suicide.&lt;ref name="tnow-torture"/&gt;

No charges were ever framed in any of these cases filed against Ashu.&lt;ref name="toi-rogues"/&gt;

The Panchkula Chief Judicial Magistrate exonerated Ashu in 1997, saying he had "no hesitation to pinpoint that nothing is on record to prima facie indict the accused" and that the disclosure statement made by the main accused, Gajinder Singh, was "just wastepaper".&lt;ref name="toi-waste"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/charges-against-her-brother-just-wastepaper-court-had-ruled/559600/1 "Charges against her brother just ‘wastepaper,’ court had ruled"]. ''The Indian Express''. (27 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Gajinder Singh, a resident of Bihar, had been arrested by the Panchkula Police for a car theft and police claimed he had named Ashu as his accomplice. Singh later absconded and was named a proclaimed offender.&lt;ref name="toi-waste"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toi-legal"/&gt; He was arrested by a team of Haryana Police assisted by their Pune counterparts on 9 January 2010 from the Baner Road area, where he was running a dhaba.&lt;ref name="toi-gajinder"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-01-10/india/28115983_1_ruchika-s-p-s-rathore-subhash-chander-girhotra Accused in fake car theft case against Ruchika's brother arrested]. ''The Times of India'' (10 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Girhotra's one-kanal bungalow in Sector 6 Panchkula was forcibly sold to a lawyer working for Rathore.&lt;ref name="pioneer-mom"/&gt; Ruchika's father was suspended from his job as bank manager, on charges of alleged corruption, after coercion from Rathore.&lt;ref name="dna-hell"/&gt; They moved to the outskirts of Simla, and had to take up earth filling to make a living.&lt;ref name="ie-house"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Ruchika-s-family-sold-house--went-to-Shimla/559388 Ruchika’s family sold house, went to Shimla, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (29 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide==

On 28 December 1993, days after Ashu was paraded in handcuffs in his locality,&lt;ref name="ie-cuffs"/&gt; Ruchika consumed poison. She died the next day. Rathore threw a party that night to celebrate.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-party"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/76680/India/How+the+CBI+botched+up+Ruchika+case.html How the CBI botched up Ruchika case, India Today]. Indiatoday.intoday.in (27 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rathore refused to release Ruchika's body to her father Subash unless he signed blank sheets of paper. The blank papers were later used by the police to establish that the family had accepted Ruchika's forged autopsy report.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-blank"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/76821/India/Ruchika's+dad+alleges+he+was+forced+to+sign+blank+papers+by+Rathore's+men.html Ruchika's dad alleges he was forced to sign blank papers by Rathore's men, India Today]. Indiatoday.intoday.in (28 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Rathore also threatened to kill Ashu, who was still in illegal police custody.&lt;ref name="ie-threat"/&gt;
At this time, Ashu was allegedly unconscious in CIA lock-up. He had been stripped naked and beaten the previous night by drunk policemen. He was brought back to his house, still unconscious, after Ruchika's last rites were over.&lt;ref name="tnow-torture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intoday-cia"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/76488/India/CBI+ignored+torture+charges+made+by+Ruchika's+brother.html CBI Ignored Torture Charges Made by Ruchika's Brother, India Today]. Indiatoday.intoday.in (25 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the inquest and the postmortem report, the name Ruchika was replaced with her nickname Ruby, and her father's name was changed to Subhash Chander Khatri.&lt;ref name="toi-inquest"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-26/chandigarh/28079466_1_ashu-s-p-s-rathore-ruchika Ruchika Changed to Ruby in Inquest Report]. ''The Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; This was to ensure that anyone reading the report would not know it pertains to Ruchika.&lt;ref name="toi-chidambaram"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Chidambaram-summons-family-lawyer-to-Delhi/559640 Chidambaram summons family lawyer to Delhi]. ''The Indian Express''. (29 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The government closed the case filed against Rathore less than a week after her death.&lt;ref name="ie-govt"&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/what-rathore-said-and-the-government-backed/557642/ What Rathore Said-and-the Government Backed, Express India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227191526/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/what-rathore-said-and-the-government-backed/557642/ |date=27 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unable to bear the harassment, her family moved out of Chandigarh.&lt;ref name="ibn-women"/&gt;

Just a few months later, Rathore was promoted to additional DGP in November 1994, when [[Bhajan Lal]] was the chief minister.&lt;ref name="ht-patron"/&gt;

==Case Dropped==

In November 1994, Rathore was promoted. No action was taken on the inquiry report. Anand Parkash started trying to get copy of the report. After 3 years, he finally obtained it in 1997, and in November, moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court. On 21 August 1998, the High Court directed the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] to conduct an inquiry.

In Oct 1999, the INLD government led by [[Om Prakash Chautala]] made Rathore the police chief (DGP) of the state.&lt;ref name="ht-patron"/&gt; His name was even recommended for a President’s Police Medal For Distinguished Service by the same government in November 1999.&lt;ref name="ie-medal"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/yet-to-think-of/559072/ Centre looks at way to strip Rathore of his Police Medal, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (25 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Birbal Das Dhalia, who as then Home Secretary, defended the decision, saying there was no chargesheet.&lt;ref name="ie-homesecy"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Home-Secy-who-sought-medal--for-Rathore-is-in-Chautala-s-party/559400 Home Secy who sought medal for Rathore is in Chautala’s party, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (26 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanta Kumar, who was then vice-president of the BJP, in 2000, wrote a letter to Om Prakash Chautala, urging him to take strict action against Rathore in the case.

However, instead of acting on the letter, Chautala complained to then Prime Minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] about it. Shanta Kumar was the Minister for Consumer Affairs in the [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] government at the time. Chautala's [[Indian National Lok Dal]] was an alliance partner.&lt;ref name="midday-wrote"&gt;Sharma, Surender. (5 January 2010) [http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/jan/050110-shanta-kumar-letter-vajpayee-ruchika-case.htm 'I wrote to Chautala, he complained to Vajpayee', Mid Day]. Mid-day.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ashu Case==

Ashu's case had reached before the HC following suo motu cognizance taken of a media report highlighting his plight,&lt;ref name="indiatoday-party"/&gt; by justice Mehtab Singh Gill on 12 December 2000. The then chief justice had referred the matter before a division bench comprising justice N K Sodhi and justice N K Sood.&lt;ref name="toi-inquest"/&gt;

While deposing before the division bench, Ashu stated that he had undergone inhuman treatment at the instance of Rathore and the Panchkula police. This was his first statement since the family was forced to leave Panchkula. At the time of making the statement, the family was living in Sector-2, [[New Shimla]].&lt;ref name="toi-inquest"/&gt;

On 13 December 2000, the division bench voiced support for compensation to Ashu for the harassment caused to him at the hands of Panchkula police.&lt;ref name="toi-legal"/&gt;

Rathore filed an affidavit in 2001 denying the allegations.&lt;ref name="tele-torture"/&gt;

The HC then referred the inquiry to sessions judge Patiala. On 3 September 2002, Ashu detailed the torture he was put through to a Patiala Sessions Court.&lt;ref name="tele-torture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="toi-inquest"/&gt;

But Rathore approached the Supreme Court and got the high court order quashed on technical grounds.&lt;ref name="intoday-cia"/&gt;

==CBI Inquiry==

On 21 August 1998, the Punjab and Haryana High Court directed the CBI to conduct an inquiry.

The High Court had ordered completion of investigation of the case and filing of chargesheet expeditiously, "preferably within six months".&lt;ref name="ie-7"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/CBI-took-7-years-to-examine-16-witnesses/559977/ CBI took 7 years to examine 16 witnesses, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (29 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; However, more than a year passed before the CBI filed a chargesheet.&lt;ref name="ie-7"/&gt;

On 16 November 2000, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Rathore.

Despite the CBI chargesheet, the Chautala government allowed Rathore to continue as police chief.&lt;ref name="ht-patron"/&gt;

The case was put to hearing in the CBI special court in Ambala from 17 November. The hearings in Ambala would continue till May 2006.&lt;ref name="ht-patron"/&gt;

The chargesheet was filed only under Section 354 (molestation). Abetment to suicide was inexplicably not included.&lt;ref name="ie-7"/&gt;

On 8 October 2001, counsel for Anand Parkash moved an application demanding the addition of abetment to suicide (306 of IPC) against Rathore. Rathore argued that Prakash had no standing to move the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20011021/haryana.htm#1 The Tribune, Chandigarh, India – Haryana]. ''The Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a scathing judgment on 23 October 2001, Special CBI Judge Jagdev Singh Dhanjal demanded that the offence be added. In his 21-page judgement, the CBI Judge underlined witness statements, including those of Ruchika’s father, Anand Parkash, friend Aradhana and others in adding Section 306 (abetment) of IPC against Rathore.&lt;ref name="ie-hc"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Family-lawyer-will-move-HC-to-re-open-case/559071 Family lawyer will move HC to re-open case, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (25 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatoday-blunt"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/76837/India/Ruchika+case:+Did+CBI+blunt+probe+to+favour+Rathore.html Ruchika case: Did CBI blunt probe to favour Rathore?, India Today]. Indiatoday.intoday.in (28 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Dhanjal was forced to take premature retirement two years later.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-twists"&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/77657/India/Baffling+twists+&amp;+turns+helped+Rathore.html Baffling twists &amp; turns helped Rathore, India Today]. Indiatoday.intoday.in (4 January 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in February 2002, Justice K. C. Kathuria of the Punjab and Haryana High Court dismissed the CBI court's decision to register an FIR against Rathore for abetment to suicide, claiming the lack of a complaint regarding harassment.&lt;ref name="toi-legal"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-25/chandigarh/28083228_1_sps-rathore-girhotras-ashu Legal see-saw in lengthy trial]. ''The Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Kathuria was a neighbour of the Girhotras, with whom he was engaged in a property dispute.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-twists"/&gt;

In another glaring conflict of interest, he was also a close relative of O. P. Kathuria who is an associate of Rathore, had served as secretary of the Haryana Lawn Tennis Association which was floated by Rathore.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-twists"/&gt;

Justice Kathuria is now the President of the Haryana State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission.

Incredibly, after filing the chargesheet in 2000, the CBI took 7 years to record evidence from 16 prosecution witnesses. On the other hand, the defence counsel took nine months to complete examination of 13 out of the total 17 witnesses.&lt;ref name="ie-7"/&gt;

Rathore tried to use his influence with the CBI. R M Singh, who was CBI Joint Director in 1998 and retired in 2001, said Rathore was tracking the case. Once the file arrived at Singh's desk, he started getting frequent visits to his office from Rathore. Rathore visited multiple times in 1998, trying to influence the CBI to clear him on all charges. Rathore had learnt that Singh was constructing a house in Gurgaon, and offered to provide building materials and other assistance. Singh also found out that Rathore had also approached the Investigating Officer for the case, Rajesh Ranjan, CBI's Deputy Superintendent of Police. When he failed to influence the officers, Rathore had the case transferred. Rathore enjoyed access to all levels of the CBI since he was DGP.&lt;ref name="indiatoday-party"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ie-influence"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/rathore-tried-to-influence-me-for-favourable-report-excbi-officer/560543/ Rathore tried to influence me for favourable report: Ex-CBI officer, Indian Express]. ''The Indian Express''. (28 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruchika's was one of the few cases heard in three subordinate courts of three different states: Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh – apart from one in high court and the Supreme Court as well. Around 15 applications were accepted in Punjab and Haryana High Court on behalf of Rathore, a strategy meant to delay the case.&lt;ref name="toi-flipflop"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-24/india/28099251_1_rathore-haryana-lawn-tennis-association-ruchika DGP's flip-flops led to his conviction]. ''The Times of India''.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, on 23 January 2006, Rathore moved an application demanding transfer of trial from Ambala CBI Special Magistrate Ritu Garg to any other court. The application was moved when evidence of only two prosecution witnesses was remaining. The grounds claimed was that Rathore knew Ritu's father and that Rathore's son Rahul was friendly with Ritu.&lt;ref name="toi-frivolous"&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/with-frivolous-pleas-rathore-delayed-verdict-in-case-cbi-never-objected/559623/2 With frivolous pleas, Rathore delayed verdict in case, CBI never objected]. ''The Indian Express''. (27 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, the CBI didn’t object. In his reply filed in February 2006, S S Lakra, the then Additional Superintendent of Police, New Delhi, said he did not object to the transfer, allegedly so the case would "conclude expeditiously". The case was then transferred to Patiala.&lt;ref name="toi-frivolous"/&gt; Again when the case was at the last stage, Rathore accused the then Special CBI Judge of Patiala, Rakesh Kumar Gupta, of overawing the defence witnesses and scolding Rathore. This time also the CBI did not object to transferring the case to Chandigarh.&lt;ref name="toi-frivolous"/&gt;

Rathore also used other technical grounds like demanding that the trial be videographed to cause more delays. Ironically, he later claimed that the long delays were grounds for a reduced sentence.&lt;ref name="ndtv-charges"&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/news/india/cbi_says_teen_molestor_delayed_case.php Charges against Rathore not serious enough?, NDTV]. Ndtv.com (22 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 November 2009, the case was transferred from the Ambala court to CBI Chandigarh. In December, the court closed all final arguments, gave its verdict and on 21 December, special judge J.S. Sidhu&lt;ref name="asiantribune-topcop"&gt;[http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2009/12/26/top-cop-gets-away-murder "Top Cop Gets Away With Murder"]. Asian Tribune.&lt;/ref&gt; pronounced a six-month jail sentence and a fine of Rs 1000 to Rathore. The sentence was suspended until 20 January 2010.&lt;ref name="1india-timeline"&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/2009/12/21/ruchika-molestation-6-months-in-jail-for-ex-dgp.html "Ruchika molestation: Ex-DGP gets 6 months in jail"], One India, (21 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/court-defers-decision-on-rathores-bail-plea/107959-3.html?from=tn Court defers decision on Rathore's bail plea], IBN Live.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was granted bail minutes after the sentencing, after furnishing a bail bond of Rs. 10,000. Rathore's wife Abha has said they will be appealing the sentence on 4 January 2010.&lt;ref name="tnow-torture"&gt;[http://www.timesnow.tv/Rathore-tortured-me-Ruchikas-brother/articleshow/4334974.cms Rathore tortured me: Ruchika's brother, Times Now]. Timesnow.tv (24 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

The case was brought up for debate in Parliament. "After 19 years, the criminal has been found guilty but all he got as punishment was 6 months in prison. Within 10 minutes of conviction, he was out on bail. Is it not a shame for all of us?" asked CPI (M) leader [[Brinda Karat]].&lt;ref name="myNewsParliment"&gt;[http://www.mynews.in/News/Ruchika_case_MP_seeks_stern_action,_See_Ruchika_Case_Timeline_N33429.html# Parliament rocked over Ruchika case, MPs demand strict action]. Mynews.in.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Haryana C.M [[Om Prakash Chautala]], when asked about the case, dismissed it as a "frivolous issue". It was during his rule that Rathore was promoted to [[Director General of Police|DGP]] for Haryana. After the public outcry over the case, Chautala backtracked and accused the courts and the ruling Congress Government in Haryana of "letting Rathore off with a light punishment."&lt;ref name="toi-cm"&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-12-23/india/28094034_1_rathore-om-prakash-chautala-haryana-chief-minister Chautala U-turn: 'Frivolous', then 'not harsh enough']. ''The Times of India'' (23 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Ruchika's father has blamed Chautala for actively supporting Rathore as he harassed his family.&lt;ref name="ht-chautala"&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/Former-Haryana-CM-saved-molester-DGP-says-Ruchika-s-dad/H1-Article1-490295.aspx Former Haryana CM aided molester DGP, says Ruchika’s dad]. ''Hindustan Times''. (25 December 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Aradhna Parkash has started a signature drive to reopen the case.&lt;ref name="gulf-drive"&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=334351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=40&amp;parent_id=22 Signature drive launched in Ruchika molestation case, Gulf Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314010728/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=334351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=40&amp;parent_id=22 |date=14 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the power of the law seems to be limited to grabbing hold of the DGP SPS Rathore, who will be stripped off his police medal. The decision to take back Rathore's police medal, given to the police officer for meritorious service in August 1985, was taken by a committee.

==Attack on Shambhu Pratap Singh Rathore==

On 8 February 2010, a man, identified as Utsav Sharma, a resident of [[Varanasi]], Uttar Pradesh, attacked Rathore with a pocket knife as Rathore walked out of the court. Rathore was rushed to a nearby hospital and the attacker was taken into custody. Television grabs show Sharma stepping up and stabbing Rathore in the face 2 times while missing a third stab before being over powered by the police. Television grabs also show a constable holding the weapon of attack with her bare hands with disregard for the sanctity of its use as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-08/chandigarh/28134164_1_dgp-sps-rathore-ruchika-case-utsav-sharma Ruchika case: Rathore attacked outside Chandigarh court].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7012">The '''Stokes affair''' ({{lang-fr|L'Affair Stokes}}) or the '''Stokes-Lothaire incident''' was a [[diplomatic incident]] between the [[Congo Free State]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British government]] in 1895. The affair emerged when [[Charles Stokes (trader)|Charles Stokes]], an Irish trader and former [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionary]], was arrested for illegal trading in the Congo and hanged without trial on 15 January 1895. The Belgian officer responsible for the execution, [[Hubert Lothaire|Captain Lothaire]], was convinced that Stokes had been selling guns to [[Congo Arab war|Muslim rebels]] in the Eastern Congo in exchange for [[ivory]]. Lothaire was accused by the British public of having failed to provide Stokes with [[due process of law]]. He was charged with murder in Belgium but was acquitted to public outcry in the [[British Empire]].

The Stokes affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State, also accused of [[Atrocities in the Congo Free State|systematic humanitarian abuses]] by a British report published in May 1895. The campaign would eventually result in the formation of the [[Congo Reform Association]] and the annexation of the Free State by [[Belgium]] as the [[Belgian Congo]] in 1908.

==Charles Stokes trial==
{{Main|Congo Arab war}}
Through intercepted letters, Captain [[Hubert Lothaire|Hubert-Joseph Lothaire]], the commander of the Congo Free State forces in the [[Ituri Province|Ituri]]-campaign, learned that [[Charles Stokes (trader)|Charles Stokes]] was on his way from [[German East Africa]] to sell weapons to the Zanzibari slavers in the eastern Congo region. In December 1894, Lothaire sent Lieutenant Josué Henry with 70 men ahead to capture Stokes. Henry arrested Stokes in his tent, taking advantage of the absence of a large part of his caravan, that was out in the jungle gathering firewood and searching for food. Stokes was taken to Captain Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a [[Drumhead court-martial]]. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Congo Free State's Afro-Arab enemies (Said Abedi, Kilonga Longa and Kibonge). On 14 January 1895 he was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree).

The procedure is said to have had many irregularities, including the use of false statements. There was no penal code, no clerk, the verdict wasn't read out loud to the convicted, and Stokes did not have a right of appeal, which as a British citizen he was entitled to.

==Initial reactions==
To Lothaire, Charles Stokes was no more than a criminal whose hanging was fully justified. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], the British Prime Minister at the time, commented that if Stokes was in league with [[Arab slave trade|Arab slave-trading]], then ‘he deserved hanging’. [[John Kirk (explorer)|Sir John Kirk]], for years the British Consul in [[Zanzibar]], remarked that “he was no loss to us, although he was an honest man.” The news of stokes’ execution was received with indifference by the British Foreign Office. When the German ambassador asked [[Thomas Sanderson, 1st Baron Sanderson|Sir Thomas H. Sanderson]], the [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]], whether the British government planned to take any steps regarding the execution of this “well-known character”, Sanderson wrote: “I do not quite understand why the Germans are pressing us.”

==The Stokes Affair==
In August 1895, the attention of the British press was drawn to this case by Lionel Decle, a journalist for the [[Pall Mall Gazette]]. The press began to report on these events in great detail, The [[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]] emphasized 'bloodthirsty precipitation' , [[The Times]] a 'painful and disgraceful death', The [[Liverpool Daily Post]] 'horrified amazement through the British race',  [[The Daily Telegraph]] 'death like a dog', adding 'Have we all been wrong in believing that the most audacious foreigner -not to speak of any savage chief- would think once, twice and even trice, before he laid hands on a subject of [[Queen Victoria]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Louis, W. (1965). "The Stokes Affair and the Origins of the Anti-Congo Campaign, 1895-1896". Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire. 43: 572–584.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured the Congo Free State to put Lothaire on trial, which they eventually did, a first trial was held in the city of [[Boma, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Boma]]. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree to impose [[martial law]] or [[Capital punishment|death sentences]] on European citizens. Stokes's body was returned to his family.

Lothaire was acquitted twice, first in April 1896 by a tribunal in Boma. In August 1896, the appeal was confirmed in Brussels by the Supreme Court of Congo, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire.

The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the [[Congo Reform Association]] and the [[Belgian Congo|annexation of the Congo Free State]] by the Belgian state in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Louis, W. (1965). "The Stokes Affair and the Origins of the Anti-Congo Campaign, 1895-1896". Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire. 43: 572–584.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29973">'''Subterranean fiction''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[adventure fiction]] or [[science fiction]] which focuses on underground settings, sometimes at the [[Inner core|center of the Earth]] or otherwise deep below the surface. The genre is based on and has in turn influenced the [[Hollow Earth]] theory.
The earliest works in the genre were [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]-era philosophical or allegorical works, in which the underground setting was often largely incidental. In the late 19th century, however, more [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] or [[scientific romance|proto-science-fictional]] motifs gained prevalence. Common themes have included a depiction of the underground world as more primitive than the surface, either culturally, technologically or biologically, or in some combination thereof. The former cases usually see the setting used as a venue for [[Sword and sorcery|sword-and-sorcery]] fiction, while the latter often features creatures extinct on the surface, such as [[dinosaur]]s, [[hominid]]s or [[cryptids]]. A less frequent theme has the underground world much more technologically advanced than the surface one, typically either as the [[Refugium (population biology)|refugium]] of a lost civilization, or (more rarely) as a base for [[space aliens]].

==Literature==
[[File:Map_of_the_Interior_World.png|thumb|Map of the Interior World, from ''The Goddess of Atvatabar'' (1892)]]
* In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' poem ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Hell]] is a vast underground cavern and the narrator travels through the center of the Earth and out the other side.
* In the sociologist [[Gabriel Tarde]]'s only literary work, ''Underground Man'' (original French title ''Fragments d'Histoire Future''), Humanity escapes a second apocalyptic ice age by delving under the earth and reforming society with Art as its central value.
* In [[Ludvig Holberg]]'s 1741 novel ''Nicolai Klimii iter subterraneum'' (''[[Niels Klim's Underground Travels]]''), Nicolai Klim falls through a cave while spelunking and spends several years living on both a smaller globe within and the inside of the outer shell.
* [[Giacomo Casanova]]'s 1788 ''Icosaméron'' is a 5-volume, 1,800-page story of a brother and sister who fall into the Earth and discover the subterranean utopia of the Mégamicres, a race of multicolored, hermaphroditic dwarfs.
* An early science-fiction work called ''[[Symzonia: A Voyage of Discovery]]'' by a "Captain Adam Seaborn" appeared in print in 1820. In the story, Captain Seaborn leads a group of travelers into the concave inner surface of the Earth. There, they discover an inner continent, which they name Symzonia after [[John Cleves Symmes, Jr.]] The story obviously reflected the ideas of Symmes, and some have claimed Symmes as the real author. Other researchers say it deliberately satirized Symmes's ideas, and think they have identified the author as an early American author named [[Nathaniel Ames]] (see Lang, Hans-Joachim and Benjamin Lease. "The Authorship of ''Symzonia'': The Case for Nathanial Ames" ''New England Quarterly'', June 1975, page 241–252).
* [[Faddei Bulgarin]]'s short satirical tale "Improbable Tall-Tale, or Journey to the Center of the Earth" (1825) describes three underworld countries: Ignorantia (populated by spiders), Beastland (populated by apes), and Lightonia (populated by humans, with a capital called Utopia).
* [[Edgar Allan Poe]] used the idea in his 1838 novel ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket]]''. He also touches on it in his short stories "[[MS. Found in a Bottle]]" and "[[The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall]]."
* Although it is often suggested that [[Jules Verne]] used the idea of a partially hollow Earth in his 1864 novel, ''[[A Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', his characters actually descend only 87 miles&lt;ref&gt;Jules Verne, ''Journey to the Centre of the Earth'', (Oxford, 1992) William Butcher translation.&lt;/ref&gt; beneath the surface where they find an underground sea occupying a cavern roughly the size of Europe. There is no indication in the novel that Verne intended to suggest that the Earth was in any way hollow, partially or otherwise.
* [[Lewis Carroll]]'s 1865 novel ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' was originally titled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground''.
* [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s 1871 novel ''[[Vril|The Coming Race]]'' was an account of the [[Vril-ya]], an angelic subterranean master race.
* [[Louis Jacolliot]]'s novel ''God's Sons'' (1873) is credited as the origin of the word A(s)gartha
* Mary Lane's ''[[Mizora]]'' (1880–81) combines the hollow-Earth theme with [[feminism]].
* [[James De Mille]]'s novel ''[[A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder]]'', published in 1888 but written prior to the author's death in 1880, depicts a subterranean land with inverted values.&lt;ref name="standish"&gt;{{Citation

* ''[[Pantaletta: A Romance of Sheheland]]'' by [[Mrs. J. Wood]] (1882)
* [[George Sand]] used the idea in her 1884 novel ''Laura, Voyage dans le Cristal'', in which giant crystals could be found in the interior of the Earth.
* ''[[Interior World: A Romance Illustrating a New Hypothesis of Terrestrial Organization]]'' by [[Washington L. Tower]] (1885)
* [[Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre]]'s "Mission de l'Inde en Europe" was published in 1886 as a "true" story about Agartha. He withdrew it from the print and it was released again by [[Gérard Encausse]] in 1910.
* [[William R. Bradshaw]]'s science fiction novel ''The Goddess of Atvatabar'' (1892) is a utopian fantasy set within the hollow Earth.
* [[Will N. Harben]]'s ''Land of the Changing Sun'' (1894) is a utopian fantasy set within a 100 mile wide cavern found below the Atlantic Ocean 200 years prior and settled.  The settlers found the atmosphere very rejuvenating, and also build an artificial changing sun to light their world.  Two balloonists, an American and an Englishman, discover this world.
* The protofeminist utopia ''[[Etidorhpa]]'' (1895) by [[John Uri Lloyd]] is also set within a hollow Earth.
* [[Charles Willing Beale]]'s 1899 novel, ''The Secret of the Earth'' tells of the adventure of 2 brothers who build an anti-gravity airship and travel to the hollow earth.  There they find several lost races, and learn that mankind originated in the hollow earth, but the unruly types were exiled from the hollow earth.  They then exit via the South Pole opening and crash on an island in the South Pacific, from which they send off a log of their adventures which forms the novel.
* The concept was mentioned in [[Wardon Allan Curtis]]'s 1899 [[short story]] "[[The Monster of Lake LaMetrie]]."
*In ''[[NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages]]'' a visit in a sailing ship is made to Altruria, a society inside the earth. This feminist utopian science fiction novel was published in 1900 in Topeka Kansas. Jack Adams listed as the author, was a pseudonym for A. O. Grigsby and Mary P. Lowe, both newspaper publishers.
* An underground [[Nome Kingdom]] is featured in several of the [[Oz books]] by [[L. Frank Baum]], notably the ''[[Ozma of Oz]]'' (1907), ''[[Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz]]'' (1908) and ''[[Tik-Tok of Oz]]'' (1914).
* [[Willis George Emerson]]'s science-fiction novel ''[[The Smoky God]]'' (1908) recounts the adventures of one Olaf Jansen who traveled into the interior and found an advanced civilization.
* [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] wrote adventure stories (beginning with ''[[At the Earth's Core (novel)|At the Earth's Core]]'' in 1914) set in the inner world of [[Pellucidar]], including at one point a visit from his character [[Tarzan]]. Burroughs's Pellucidar has oceans on the outer surface corresponding to continents on the inner surface and vice versa. Pellucidar is lit by a miniature [[sun]] suspended at the center of the hollow sphere, so it is perpetually overhead wherever one is in Pellucidar. The sole exception is the region directly under a tiny geostationary [[moon]] of the internal sun; that region as a result is under a perpetual [[eclipse]] and is known as the Land of Awful Shadow. This moon has its own plant life and (presumably) animal life and hence either has its own atmosphere or shares that of Pellucidar.
* The Russian geologist [[Vladimir Obruchev]] uses the concept of the hollow Earth in his 1915 scientific novel ''[[Plutonia (novel)|Plutonia]]'' to take the reader through various geological epochs.
* A deliberately tunneled-out Earth occurs in [[Charles R. Tanner]] 1930's SF [[short story]] "[[Tumithak of the Corridors]]".
* ''[[Morgo the Mighty]]'' by [[Sean O'Larkin]] was serialized in ''[[The Popular Magazine]]'' in 1930. It featured the adventures of a Tarzan-like character in a network of giant caverns beneath the [[Himalayas]]. The caves are ruled by a cowled magician and populated by primitive men, giant intelligent bats, giant warring ants and giant killer chickens.
* ''[[Tam, Son of the Tiger]]'' by [[Otis Adelbert Kline]] from 1931 features the adventures of Tam (another [[Tarzan]]-like character) in a subterranean world beneath [[Asia]].
* The novel ''[[In Caverns Below]]'' (1935) by [[Stanton A. Coblentz]] posits an extensive populated network of caverns underlying the [[Basin and Range province]] in the North American southwest.
*In the [[Middle-earth]] books by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] the kingdom of [[Angband]] and its predecessor [[Utumno]] are deep underground, under mountains called Ered Engrin; they are home to Orcs, monsters and Morgoth, the Dark Lord. Also, the Dwarves and even elves live underground – the underground realms of [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]] and Erebor and cities like [[Nargothrond]] and [[Menegroth]] play a major role in the stories.
* [[Richard Sharpe Shaver]]'s ''The Shaver Mystery'' stories are about ancient civilizations still living in caverns beneath the Earth surface

Lewis]]'s 1953 novel ''[[The Silver Chair]]'' (part of [[The Chronicles of Narnia]]) takes place partly in [[Underland (Narnia)|Underland]], a subterranean kingdom plotting to conquer [[Narnia (country)|Narnia]]. At one point, the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]] attempts to brainwash the protagonists into believing that the world above ground does not exist.
* ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'' (1956) by [[Lobsang Rampa|Tuesday Lobsang Rampa]] mentions contact with advanced beings living in the center of the Earth.
* ''[[The End of the Tunnel]]'' (aka ''The Cave of Cornelius'') (1959), by [[Paul Capon]]. Four boys in England get trapped in a cave by a landslide, and by following the cave, they encounter a forgotten civilization.
* ''[[Dark Universe (novel)|Dark Universe]]'' (1961) by [[Daniel F. Galouye]]. A post-apocalyptic science fiction novel where two clans live deep underground and are descendants from humans who escaped an old war.
* ''[[City of the First Time]]'' (1975) by [[Geoffrey John Barrett|G.J. Barrett]]. British survivors of an atomic holocaust venture downward into the earth through a series of caves and encounter two other races, survivals of previous extinctions.
* A Hollow Earth featured in the children's [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] novel ''The Underground Kingdom'' (1983).
* The history of the Hollow Earth theory is explored in [[Umberto Eco]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Foucault's Pendulum]]'', alongside a wide range of other pseudo-scientific and conspiracy theories.
* [[Rudy Rucker]]'s novel ''[[The Hollow Earth]]'' (1990) features [[Edgar Allan Poe in popular culture|Edgar Allan Poe]] and his ideas. Rucker claims in an afterword to have transcribed the novel from a manuscript in the [[University of Virginia]] library; the call number given is that of a copy of ''[[Symzonia: A Voyage of Discovery|Symzonia]]''.
* ''[[Dark Elf Trilogy|The Dark Elf Trilogy]]'' (1990–1991) by [[R. A. Salvatore]] was the first of the [[Forgotten Realms]] books to describe the underground world of the Dark Elves called the [[Underdark]]. This greatly helped popularize underground settings in fantasy RPGs.
* The novel ''[[Indiana Jones and the Hollow Earth]]'' by [[Max McCoy]] (1997) expands on the legend of an advanced civilization in the Earth's interior.

'''''The Phoney Civilization''''' ({{lang-bg|Криворазбраната цивилизация}} / ''Krivorazbranata tsivilizatsiya'') is a [[Satire|satirical]] TV musical released in 1974 by the [[Bulgarian National Television]], directed by [[Hacho Boyadzhiev]], starring [[Georgi Partsalev]], [[Georgi Kaloyanchev]], [[Ruzha Delcheva]], [[Nikola Anastasov]], [[Lora Keranova]] and Zorka Dimitrova. The work is a musical adaptation based on the [[The Phoney Civilization|1871 classical play]] by the Bulgarian playwright [[Dobri Voynikov]]. The music is composed by [[Decho Taralezhkov]].

The production is in the scope of the programme called Television theatre, a popular programme which has been realized by the Bulgarian television during the 1970s and the 1980s. In a folklore manner, the musical ridicules the "fashionable" trends of behaviour and imitation of the foreign models. The accurately chosen cast, featuring some of the leading Bulgarian comic actors, the vivid scenography as well as the memorable music turn the work into a classic example of the Bulgarian [[performing arts]] from those years.&lt;ref name="BNT"&gt;[http://50.bnt.bg/article-127 BNT-1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
*[[Georgi Partsalev]] as Hadzhi Kosta, the head of the family.
*[[Ruzha Delcheva]] as Zlata, the Hadzhi Kosta's wife. 
*Zorka Dimitrova as Anka, the Hadzhi Kosta and Zlata's daughter.
*[[Georgi Kaloyanchev]] as Margaridi, Anka's suitor, snob, imitator of foreign models.
*[[Nikola Anastasov]] as Dimitraki, the Anka's brother.
*[[Lora Keranova]] as Grandma Stoyna, a matchmaker.
*[[Mariana Alamancheva]] as Mariyka, Anka's friend.
*[[Iliya Dobrev]] as Mityu, the shy young man in love with Anka.
*[[Vasil Popov]] as Georgi, Mityu's friend.
*[[Hindo Kasimov]] as Pencho, Mityu's friend.
*[[Kosta Karageorgiev]] as Raycho, a weak-minded domestic servant.

The '''Three Choirs Festival''' is a music festival held annually at the end of July, rotating among the cathedrals of the [[Three Counties]] ([[Hereford Cathedral|Hereford]], [[Gloucester Cathedral|Gloucester]] and [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester]]) and originally featuring their three choirs, which remain central to the week-long programme. The large-scale choral repertoire is now performed by the Festival Chorus, but the festival also features other major ensembles and international soloists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.herefordwebpages.co.uk/3choirs0.shtml Hereford web pages: History]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 festival took place in Worcester from 6 to 13 August. The 2012 festival in Hereford took place earlier than usual, from 21 to 28 July, to avoid clashing with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hereford 2012|url=http://3choirs.org/2012-hereford/hereford-2012.html|publisher=Three Choirs Festival|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is now established in the last week of July. The 300th anniversary of the original Three Choirs Festival was celebrated during the 2015 festival, which took place from 25 July to 1 August in Hereford (the landmark 300th meeting of the Three Choirs does not fall until 2027 due to there being no Three Choirs Festivals for the duration of both WW1 and WW2).

The festival is closely identified with the musical careers of British composers [[Edward Elgar]] and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. The organists of the three cathedrals (who act as artistic director and festival conductor when it is their cathedral's turn to host the festival) are [[Geraint Bowen (musician)|Geraint Bowen]] (Hereford), [[Adrian Partington]] (Gloucester) and [[Peter Nardone]] (Worcester).

==History==
The festival, originally held over two days in September (but also held in September in 1933 and 1947, since C. S. Lewis's brother Warren is known to have attended), is one of the world's oldest classical choral music festivals.&lt;ref name="3choirs"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990418010114/http://www.3choirs.org/ Three Choirs web site] Retrieved 15 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity for it in 1719 addressed "Members of the yearly Musical Assembly in these parts". Its music obviously tended towards the ecclesiastical. In early gatherings, [[Henry Purcell|Purcell's]] setting of the ''Te Deum'' and ''Jubilate'' was a regular part of the repertoire until 1784, and Handel dominated 18th-century programmes with oratorios such as ''[[Alexander's Feast (Handel)|Alexander's Feast]]'', ''[[Samson (Handel)|Samson]]'', ''[[Judas Maccabaeus (Handel)|Judas Maccabaeus]]'' and ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Messiah]]''. [[The Wodehouse|Sir Samuel Hellier]], guardian of the [[Hellier Stradivarius]], was a "prominent figure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npor.org.uk/Reporter/oct04.pdf The British Institute of Organ Studies {{ISSN|0309-8052}}. BIOS Reporter Volume 28, number 4, page 15. October 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220070409/http://www.npor.org.uk/Reporter/oct04.pdf |date=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haydn's ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' was heard first in the festival of 1800. From 1840, [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]]'s ''[[Elijah (oratorio)|Elijah]]'' was performed every year until 1930.

The 19th century saw the introduction of [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and the festival's fortunes were enhanced by the arrival of the railways. However, these also brought crowds, a phenomenon not always pleasing to the church authorities, although full seats uplifted the finances. In the 1870s, the festival was reduced to the three cathedral choirs, ending for a while the era of the visiting celebrity singer as a faction in the church sought to stress the "appropriate" nature of activities allowed in cathedrals. However, the civil authorities took issue with the ecclesiastical and the festival revived. Works by [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]] were not heard until the 1870s, soon to be followed by local composer Elgar, who began to be featured around the turn of the century and whose works dominated the festival for much of the 20th century as its emphasis shifted toward British musicians. [[Herbert Sumsion]], organist at Gloucester between 1928 and 1967, particularly helped to promote the works of native composers, including premiering works of [[Herbert Howells|Howells]], [[Gerald Finzi|Finzi]], and others.  [[Hubert Parry|Parry]]'s compositions were also performed regularly. His ''De Profundis'' was one of the earliest works to be commissioned especially for the festival and performed in 1891.

[[Frederick Delius|Delius]] in 1901 was another composer who introduced or conducted new works, with his ''Dance Rhapsody No. 1''. Another was [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], whose ''[[Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis]]'' was premiered there in 1910, followed by the ''[[Five Mystical Songs]]'' in 1911 and the ''[[Fantasia on Christmas Carols]]'' in 1912, after which he co-featured with Elgar as a central prop to the musical repertoire. Sumsion fostered a relationship with Hungarian composer [[Zoltán Kodály]] and programmed Kodály's works at six Gloucester festivals.  Other names include [[Gustav Holst]], [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[Herbert Howells]], [[Gerald Finzi]], [[William Walton]], [[Arthur Bliss]] and [[Benjamin Britten]] and recently, [[Lennox Berkeley]], [[John McCabe (composer)|John McCabe]], [[William Mathias]], [[Paul Patterson (composer)|Paul Patterson]] and [[James MacMillan]].

A timeline of some of the more significant events in the festival's history from 1709 until the present day has been compiled by Anthony Boden: [http://www.3choirs.org/about-us/history/18th-century/ Three Choirs Festival timeline]

In 1995, a Festival Society was established to provide a means for enthusiasts to actively participate in support for the Three Choirs Festival.&lt;ref name="3choirs"/&gt; The festival is funded by ticket sales, donations and sponsorships.

In 2010, the Three Choirs Festival Youth Choir was formed. Made up of singers aged 16–25, it has performed at every festival since then, under a variety of conductors. In 2012 in Hereford the Three Choirs Festival Youth Choir premiered ''Centuries of Meditation'', a setting by Dobrinka Tabakova of words by Thomas Traherne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Three Choirs Festival Youth Choir|url=http://3choirs.org/2012-hereford/artists/tcf-youth-choir.html|publisher=Three Choirs Festival|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] began a rolling three-year formal residency at the festival in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Philharmonia Orchestra &amp; the Three Choirs Festival|url=http://3choirs.org/2012-hereford/philharmonia-orchestra-three-choirs-festival.html|publisher=Three Choirs Festival|accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Toxic Twin Towers Ball''' was a rock concert staged at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[England]] on 26 June 1999. It was headlined by [[Aerosmith]] and also featured live sets from [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Stereophonics]], [[The Black Crowes]] and [[3 Colours Red]]. It was called The Toxic Twin Towers Ball because, at the time, Wembley Stadium was famous for its Twin Towers; also two members of the band Aerosmith were called the [[Toxic Twins]] due to their use of recreational drugs ([[Steven Tyler]] and [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]]).

The '''Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire''' in [[New York City]] on March 25, 1911 was the deadliest [[List of industrial disasters|industrial disaster]] in the history of the city, and one of the deadliest in US history.&lt;ref name="osha"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.osha.gov/oas/trianglefactoryfire.html |title= The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire |accessdate= June 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fire caused the deaths of 146 [[garment worker]]s &amp;ndash; 123 women and 23 men&lt;ref name="APWU"&gt;[http://www.apwu.org/labor-history-articles/sweatshop-tragedy-ignites-fight-workplace-safety "Sweatshop Tragedy Ignites Fight for Workplace Safety"] on the [[American Postal Workers Union]] website&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; who died from the fire, smoke inhalation, or falling or jumping to their deaths.

The factory was located on the eighth, ninth and tenth floors of the [[Asch Building]], at 23–29 Washington Place in the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of Manhattan. The 1901 building still stands today and is known as the Brown Building. It is part of and owned by [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nyc.gov/doitt/nycitymap/?z=8&amp;p=985536,205260&amp;c=GISBasic&amp;s=a:23,WASHINGTON+PLACE,MANHATTAN "23 Washington Place, Manhattan"] New York City Geographic Information System map&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the owners had locked the doors to the stairwells and exits &amp;ndash; a then-common practice to prevent workers from taking unauthorized breaks and to reduce theft&lt;ref name="Liff" /&gt; &amp;ndash; many of the workers who could not escape from the burning building jumped from the high windows. The fire led to legislation requiring improved factory [[Occupational safety and health|safety standards]] and helped spur the growth of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU), which fought for better working conditions for [[sweatshop]] workers.

The building has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] and a [[List of New York City Landmarks|New York City landmark]].&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Gale Harris|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/brown.pdf|title=Brown Building (formerly Asch Building) Designation Report|publisher=[[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]|date=March 25, 2003|access-date=February 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807052010/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/brown.pdf|archive-date=August 7, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the ownership of Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, the factory produced women's blouses, known as "[[shirtwaist]]s". The factory normally employed about 500 workers, mostly young [[immigrant]] women, who worked nine hours a day on weekdays plus seven hours on Saturdays,&lt;ref name="Drehle 105"&gt;von Drehle, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; earning for their 52 hours of work between $7 and $12 a week,&lt;ref name="Liff" /&gt; the equivalent of $171 to $293 a week in 2016 currency, or $3.20 to $5.50 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=12.00&amp;year1=1913&amp;year2=2016 CPI Inflation Calculator] [[United States Bureau of Labor Statistics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately 4:40 pm on Saturday, March 25, 1911, as the workday was ending, a fire flared up in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the eighth floor.&lt;ref name="Drehle 118"/&gt; The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45 pm by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the eighth floor.&lt;ref&gt;Stein, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon.&lt;ref name="von Drehle, p. 163" /&gt; The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings by the time of the fire.&lt;ref&gt;Stein p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps which were left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that table. The scraps piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable.&lt;ref name="Drehle 118"&gt;von Drehle, p.118&lt;/ref&gt; Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection.&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, p.119&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New York Times]]'' article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the [[sewing machine]]s. A series of articles in ''[[Collier's]]'' noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory [[insurance fraud|in order to collect insurance]]. ''[[The Insurance Monitor]]'', a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was "fairly saturated with [[moral hazard]]." Although Blanck and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.&lt;ref name="von Drehle, p. 163"&gt;von Drehle, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

A bookkeeper on the eighth floor was able to warn employees on the tenth floor via telephone, but there was no audible alarm and no way to contact staff on the ninth floor.&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, p.131&lt;/ref&gt; According to survivor Yetta Lubitz, the first warning of the fire on the ninth floor arrived at the same time as the fire itself.&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, pp.141–2&lt;/ref&gt; Although the floor had a number of exits, including two freight elevators, a [[fire escape]], and stairways down to Greene Street and Washington Place, flames prevented workers from descending the Greene Street stairway, and the door to the Washington Place stairway was locked to prevent theft by the workers; the locked doors allowed managers to check the women's purses.&lt;ref&gt;Lange, Brenda. ''The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire'', Infobase Publishing, 2008, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The foreman who held the stairway door key had already escaped by another route.&lt;ref&gt;PBS: [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/introduction/triangle-intro/ "Introduction: Triangle Fire"], accessed March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of employees escaped the fire by going up the Greene Street stairway to the roof. Other survivors were able to jam themselves into the elevators while they continued to operate.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Angus (ed.) (1987) ''Crimes of Horror''  Reed Editions. p. 23 {{ISBN|1-85051-170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within three minutes, the Greene Street stairway became unusable in both directions.&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, pp. 143–4&lt;/ref&gt; Terrified employees crowded onto the single exterior fire escape, which city officials had allowed Asch to erect instead of the required third staircase.&lt;ref name="Drehle 118"/&gt; It was a flimsy and poorly anchored iron structure which may have been broken before the fire. It soon twisted and collapsed from the heat and overload, spilling about 20 victims nearly {{convert|100|ft|m}} to their deaths on the concrete pavement below. Elevator operators Joseph Zito&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; and Gaspar Mortillalo saved many lives by traveling three times up to the ninth floor for passengers, but Mortillalo was eventually forced to give up when the rails of his elevator buckled under the heat. Some victims pried the elevator doors open and jumped into the empty shaft, trying to slide down the cables or to land on top of the car. The weight and impacts of these bodies warped the elevator car and made it impossible for Zito to make another attempt. William Gunn Shepard, a reporter at the tragedy, would say that "I learned a new sound that day, a sound more horrible than description can picture &amp;ndash; the thud of a speeding living body on a stone sidewalk".&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Even once firefighters arrived, their ladders were only long enough to reach as high as the sixth to seventh floors.&lt;ref name="osha" /&gt;

A large crowd of bystanders gathered on the street, witnessing 62 people jumping or falling to their deaths from the burning building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shepherd|first=William G. |date=March 27, 1911 |title=Eyewitness at the Triangle|accessdate=September 2, 2007|url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/trianglefire/texts/stein_ootss/ootss_wgs.html?location=Fire!}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Waldman]], later a New York Socialist state assemblyman, described the scene years later:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Labor Lawyer |first= Louis |last= Waldman |location= New York |publisher= E. P. Dutton |year= 1944 |asin= B0000D5IYA |pages= 32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One Saturday afternoon in March of that year—March 25, to be precise—I was sitting at one of the reading tables in the old Astor Library. … It was a raw, unpleasant day and the comfortable reading room seemed a delightful place to spend the remaining few hours until the library closed. I was deeply engrossed in my book when I became aware of fire engines racing past the building. By this time I was sufficiently Americanized to be fascinated by the sound of fire engines. Along with several others in the library, I ran out to see what was happening, and followed crowds of people to the scene of the fire.

A few blocks away, the Asch Building at the corner of Washington Place and Greene Street was ablaze. When we arrived at the scene, the police had thrown up a cordon around the area and the firemen were helplessly fighting the blaze. The eighth, ninth, and tenth stories of the building were now an enormous roaring cornice of flames.

Word had spread through the East Side, by some magic of terror, that the plant of the Triangle Waist Company was on fire and that several hundred workers were trapped. Horrified and helpless, the crowds—I among them—looked up at the burning building, saw girl after girl appear at the reddened windows, pause for a terrified moment, and then leap to the pavement below, to land as mangled, bloody pulp. This went on for what seemed a ghastly eternity. Occasionally a girl who had hesitated too long was licked by pursuing flames and, screaming with clothing and hair ablaze, plunged like a living torch to the street. Life nets held by the firemen were torn by the impact of the falling bodies.

The emotions of the crowd were indescribable. Women were hysterical, scores fainted; men wept as, in paroxysms of frenzy, they hurled themselves against the police lines.}}

The remainder waited until smoke and fire overcame them. The fire department arrived quickly but was unable to stop the flames, as there were no ladders available that could reach beyond the sixth floor. The fallen bodies and falling victims also made it difficult for the fire department to approach the building.

==Consequences and legacy==
The company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, who survived the fire by fleeing to the building's roof when the fire began, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree [[manslaughter]] in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Stein p.158&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Steuer]], counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire,&lt;ref&gt;von Drehle, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.

In 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in his factory during working hours. He was fined $20.&lt;ref name="Hoenig"&gt;Hoenig, John M.

[[Rose Schneiderman]], a prominent [[Socialist Party of America|socialist]] and union activist, gave a speech at the memorial meeting held in the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]] on April 2, 1911, to an audience largely made up of the members of the Women's Trade Union League. She used the fire as an argument for factory workers to organize:

We have tried you good people of the public and we have found you wanting&amp;hellip;  We have tried you citizens; we are trying you now, and you have a couple of dollars for the sorrowing mothers, brothers and sisters by way of a charity gift. But every time the workers come out in the only way they know to protest against conditions which are unbearable, the strong hand of the law is allowed to press down heavily upon us.

Public officials have only words of warning to us—warning that we must be intensely peaceable, and they have the workhouse just back of all their warnings. The strong hand of the law beats us back, when we rise, into the conditions that make life unbearable.

I can't talk fellowship to you who are gathered here. Too much blood has been spilled. I know from my experience it is up to the working people to save themselves.

In New York City, a Committee on Public Safety was formed, headed by eyewitness [[Frances Perkins]]&lt;ref&gt;Downey, Kirsten.The Woman Behind the New Deal. Nan A. Talese, 2009 pp.33-36&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; who 22 years later would be appointed [[United States Secretary of Labor]] &amp;ndash; to identify specific problems and lobby for new legislation, such as the bill to grant workers shorter hours in a work week, known as the "54-hour Bill". The committee's representatives in Albany obtained the backing of [[Tammany Hall]]'s [[Al Smith]], the Majority Leader of the Assembly, and [[Robert F. Wagner]], the Majority Leader of the Senate, and this collaboration of machine politicians and reformers – also known as "do-gooders" or "goo-goos" – got results, especially since Tammany's chief, [[Charles F. Murphy]], realized the advantage to be had from being on the side of the angels.&lt;ref name="Liff" /&gt;

The New York State Legislature then created the Factory Investigating Commission to "investigate factory conditions in this and other cities and to report remedial measures of legislation to prevent hazard or loss of life among employees through fire, unsanitary conditions, and occupational diseases."&lt;ref&gt;Staff (October 11, 1911) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00F1EF63A5517738DDDA80994D8415B818DF1D3&amp; "Seek Way to Lessen Factory Dangers"], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was chaired by Wagner and co-chaired by Al Smith. They held a series of widely publicized investigations around the state, interviewing 222 witnesses and taking 3,500 pages of testimony. They hired field agents to do on-site inspections of factories. They started with the issue of fire safety and moved on to broader issues of the risks of injury in the factory environment. Their findings led to thirty-eight new laws regulating labor in New York state, and gave them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class. In the process, they changed Tammany's reputation from mere corruption to progressive endeavors to help the workers.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert Ferdinand Wagner" in ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slayton, Robert A.

As a result of the fire, the [[American Society of Safety Engineers]] was founded in New York City on October 14, 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asse.org/about/history.php |title=A Brief History of the American Society of Safety Engineers: A Century of Safety |author=American Society of Safety Engineers |year=2001 |accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last living survivor of the fire was Rose Freedman, née Rosenfeld, who died in [[Beverly Hills, California]], on February 15, 2001 at the age of 107. She was two days away from her 18th birthday at the time of the fire, which she survived by following the company's executives and being rescued from the roof of the building.

===Centennial===
[[File:Triangle Shirtwaist Fire Centennial Memorial crop.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Hilda Solis]], the American [[Secretary of Labor]], seen on the overhead screen, speaking at the Centennial Memorial; the Brown (Asch) Building is on the far right.]]
[[Image:Triangle33.JPG|thumb|350px|The commemoration drew thousands of people, many holding aloft "146 Shirtwaist-Kites" conceived by artist [[Annie Lanzillotto]] and designed and fabricated by members of The '''Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition''', with the names of the victims on sashes, as they listened to speakers.]]

From July 2009 through the weeks leading up to the 100th anniversary, the Coalition served as a clearinghouse to organize some 200 activities as varied as [[academic conferences]], films, theater performances, art shows, concerts, readings, awareness campaigns, [[walking tours]], and parades that were held in and around New York City, and in cities across the nation, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, Boston and Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The ceremony, which was held in front of the [[Asch Building|building where the fire took place]], was preceded by a march through [[Greenwich Village]] by thousands of people, some carrying shirtwaists – women's blouses – on poles, with sashes commemorating the names of those who died in the fire. Speakers included the [[United States Secretary of Labor]], [[Hilda L. Solis]], U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]], New York City Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]], the actor [[Danny Glover]], and Suzanne Pred Bass, the grandniece of Rosie Weiner, a young woman killed in the blaze. Most of the speakers that day called for the strengthening of workers’ rights and organized labor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Fouhy, Beth.

At 4:45 PM EST, the moment the first fire alarm was sounded in 1911, hundreds of bells rang out in cities and towns across the nation. For this commemorative act, the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition organized hundreds of churches, schools, fire houses, and private individuals in the New York City region and across the nation. The Coalition maintains on its website a national map denoting each of the bells that rang that afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rememberthetrianglefire.org/bells/ "Bells"] on the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Permanent memorial===
The Coalition has launched an effort to create a permanent [[public art]] [[memorial]] for the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire at the site of the 1911 fire in lower Manhattan. In 2012, the Coalition announced a national design competition for the memorial, and formed a design search committee, with representatives from [[Workers United]], [[New York University]], the [[New York City Fire Department]], the [[Martin P. Catherwood Library#Kheel Center|Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation &amp; Archives]], [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]], [[Manhattan Community Board 2]], family members of the victims, historians, and community members.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Lillian.

Plans for the memorial include steel panels that wrap around the building, as well as upper and lower panels that will list the names of the victims and tell the story of the fire. A reflective steel beam will extend from the corner of the building to the eighth floor, the place of origin for the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/13522-memorial-to-honor-triangle-shirtwaist-fire-victims|title=Memorial to honor Triangle Shirtwaist fire victims|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Coalition established that the goal of the permanent memorial would be:
* To honor the memory of those who died from the fire;
* To affirm the dignity of all workers;
* To value women’s work;
* To remember the movement for worker safety and social justice stirred by this tragedy;
* To inspire future generations of activists

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3730">The '''Uprising of Konstantin and Fruzhin''' ({{lang-bg|Въстание на Константин и Фружин}}, ''Vastanie na Konstantin i Fruzhin'') was the earliest [[Bulgaria]]n uprising against [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. It was organized in the early 15th century by two Bulgarian nobles and was supported by a Christian coalition, but failed to liberate Bulgaria.

[[Fruzhin]], the son of Tsar [[Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria|Ivan Shishman]], and his cousin [[Constantine II of Bulgaria|Konstantin]], the heir of [[Ivan Sratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Sratsimir]], who had emigrated to [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] and [[Despotate of Serbia|Serbia]] as the Ottomans subjugated the Balkans, organized an uprising in northern Bulgaria aided by [[Wallachia]]n ruler [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea the Elder]], Serbian despot [[Stefan Lazarević]] and Hungarian monarch [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].

[[File:Prince fruzhin of bulgaria.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Prince Fruzhin of Bulgaria]] 
The Ottoman defeat by [[Timur]] in the [[Battle of Ankara]] of 1402 provided good conditions for an uprising, and the Christian forces crossed the [[Danube]] from the north into the Bulgarian lands: Mircea I, accompanied by Konstantin, invaded [[Dobruja]], while Fruzhin together with the Serbian-supported Hungarian army entered the northwestern Bulgarian lands (around [[Vidin]]). These initially successful invasions were followed by an uprising of the Bulgarian population in some areas.

The scale, time and duration of the uprising is not certain. According to some sources, it broke out in 1404, but was quickly crushed by one of [[Bayezid I]]'s sons, [[Süleyman Çelebi|Süleyman]], with Wallachia nevertheless retaining Dobruja and Stefan Lazarević extending his realm's territory, whereas Konstantin and Fruzhin's efforts were futile. Others claim that the uprising began in 1408, and Konstantin and Fruzhin managed to regain their domains from the late [[Bulgarian Empire]] south of the Danube at least until 1413, when [[Musa Çelebi]], another son of Bayezid, is documented to have "ruined the Bulgarians". According to a third group of historians, who base their theory on the note of [[Doukas]] that Bulgarian delegates attended the [[Bursa]] negotiations between [[Mehmed I]] and [[Manuel II Palaiologos]] in 1413, the uprising was crushed as late as 1418 alongside several other unrelated rebellions.

After the end of the uprising, its leaders Konstantin and Fruzhin once again settled abroad, Konstantin in Serbia and Fruzhin in Hungary. Konstantin died in 1422 in Serbia, while Fruzhin continued to work actively in Hungary to restore the Bulgarian Empire. He took part in [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]]'s attack on [[Silistra]] in 1425 and was granted the domain of [[Lipova, Arad|Lippa]] in [[Temes County|Temes]] by Sigismund because of this. Fruzhin was sent by the Hungarian king to help the [[Albania]]n rebels under [[Gjergj Arianit Komneni]] in 1435. He also participated in [[Władysław III of Poland]]'s campaign that culminated in the [[Battle of Varna]] in 1444, and died around 1460.

"'''Wieners Out'''" is the fourth episode in the [[South Park (season 20)|twentieth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. The 271st episode of the series overall, it first aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on October 12, 2016.

The episode lampooned modern social protest movements and campaigns (like [[Free the Nipple (campaign)|Free the Nipple]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sniderson|first1=Dan|title=Comic-Con 2016: South Park creators talk Pokemon, killing Kenny again|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/07/23/comic-con-south-park-panel-pokemon-kill-kenny/|accessdate=21 May 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Black Lives Matter]]) and commented on [[Anonymous post|Internet anonymity]],  while also progressing the plot and themes of the season's previous episodes.

==Plot==
A Danish narrator explains the Danish history of dealing with [[troll]]s and that now they are on a quest to take out the newest variety, the [[Internet troll]]. [[Gerald and Sheila Broflovski|Gerald Broflovski]] feels the pressure of being found out for his trolling as Skankhunt42, and he tries as much as he can to cover it up. Meanwhile, [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] feels guilt over the rift between the boys and the girls. When he tries to bring them together, it only strains their relationships further, and [[Butters Stotch|Butters]] takes on a leadership role after the elementary school girls convince his long-distance girlfriend Charlotte to dump him online. He takes down his pants, exposing his [[penis]], in protest of feeling neutered, at a girls' volleyball game. Most of the boys immediately follow suit, disgusting the girls even more. Gerald struggles with his trolling withdrawal, eventually meeting with a fellow troll known as Dildo Schwaggins under a bridge, who warns Gerald of an upcoming attack from the [[Danes]]. Gerald eventually succumbs to the pressure and Sheila catches him in the bathroom while trolling on an iPad that Sheila bought for him. Still reluctant to reveal his inner troll self, Gerald lies to Sheila, saying that he was watching "[[urolagnia|piss porn]]", and he agrees to be urinated on to cover up his secret. He even attends an addiction meeting, but it turns out to be for [[Member Berries|member berry]] addicts instead.

When talking with [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Heidi Turner|Heidi Turner]], who are now boyfriend and girlfriend, Kyle realizes that he will not be able to stop Butters, who is now leading protest marches without pants, from worsening the rift on his own, so he attempts to get Cartman on his side. Cartman refuses since he feels that he is happier with Heidi, away from the divisiveness of groups and social media. Schwaggins shows Gerald a video by the [[BBC News]] that explains a Danish website known as Troll Trace designed to track down the real-life identity of Internet trolls is coming online. The founder of the site threatens to expose trolls everywhere, although he is aware that his methods will have the greater effect of stripping anonymity from anyone posting on the Internet. Schwaggins and Gerald retreat to a group of other trolls. Kyle meets up with the boys and girls at the school cafeteria, where he announces that he now agrees to Butters' protest. As he pulls out his penis in front of them, most of the girls leave in disgust, and the boys cheer and carry him out on their shoulders.

==Reception==
Jesse Schedeen from [[IGN]] rated the episode a 8.4 out of 10, and commented that he loved the "more focused episode this week as the series continues to lampoon social media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=South Park: "Wieners Out" Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/13/south-park-wieners-out-review|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=October 13, 2016|date=October 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Lambert with 411 Mania gave it a 7.5 out of 10, summarizing his review with the comment "There's no denying the brilliance of South Park when they are focused on a story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lambert|first1=Jeremy|title=South Park 20.4 Review – "Wieners Out"|url=http://411mania.com/movies/south-park-20-4-review-wieners-out/|website=411 Mania|accessdate=October 13, 2016|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Caffrey from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' rated the episode an A- and found the scene with Sheila urinating on Gerald while Ike and Kyle watch from the doorway "the kind of nasty sight gag that's become a staple of the ''South Park'' universe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caffrey|first1=Dan|title="Wieners Out" • South Park • TV Review After a week off, South Park returns with a memorable gross-out gag|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/south-park-keeps-its-endgame-flux-and-its-sight-ga-244136|website=[[The A.V.

{{World Rally Championship}}
The [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] '''World Rally Championship-2''' or '''WRC-2''' (formerly known as '''Super 2000 World Rally Championship''' or '''S-WRC'''), is a companion rally series to the [[World Rally Championship]], and is driven on the same stages. WRC-2 is limited to production-based cars homologated under the [[Super 2000]], [[Group N|N4]], [[Group R|R5]] rules. The series began in 2010 and split the [[Production World Rally Championship]] (P-WRC), which was previously open to both Super 2000 and Group N4 cars, into two separate competitions, both of which received their own FIA titles. There was also a '''World Rally Championship Cup for Teams''' within the S-WRC but this was discontiniued after 2010. From 2013, WRC-2 replaced S-WRC.&lt;ref&gt;http://openpaddock.net/2012/09/28/rally-exciting-changes-in-wrc-for-2013/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nesterallyfinland.fi/in-english/news-archive/exciting-changes-for-2013-wrc/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Calendar ==
From 2010 to 2012(as S-WRC), there are 10 qualifying rallies for the new series, and at the time of registration entrants must nominate seven rallies, including two outside Europe, in which to score points. The S-WRC is in addition to the WRC Cup for S2000 Teams, which was announced earlier in the year. The S-WRC Teams cup was scrapped from 2011 onwards.

From 2013 there is no fixed calendar. The teams can participate in any round of the season with the requirement that teams must contest at least seven events, with their best six results from the first seven events they enter being counted towards their final points tally.
