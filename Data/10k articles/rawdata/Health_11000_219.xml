'''Stewart Alexander "Alex" Lowe''' (24 December 1958 – 5 October 1999) was an American [[mountaineer]]. He has been described as inspiring ''"...a whole generation of climbers and [[Exploration|explorers]] with his uncontainable enthusiasm, legendary [[training]] routines, and significant ascents of [[Rock climbing|rock climbs]], [[Ice Climber|ice climbs]], and mountains all over the world..."''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adventureblog.nationalgeographic.com/2016/05/02/conrad-anker-remembers-his-legendary-friend-alex-lowe/ "Climber Remembers the Legendary Alex Lowe"], (quote from Conrad Anker), story by Andrew Bisharat, May 2, 2016, nationalgeographic.com.&lt;/ref&gt; He died in an [[avalanche]] in [[Tibet]]. The [http://alexlowe.org/ Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation] honors his legacy. 

==Biography==
Lowe was widely admired by his peers for excelling in every aspect of mountaineering, from rock- and ice-climbing to ski descents. [[Dave Hahn]] once remarked, "There's Alex Lowe up here, and then there's the rest of us down here. The guy's just really that much better than everybody else." and [[Conrad Anker]] said, "We're all at this one level, and then there's Alex." Lowe himself said "The best climber in the world is the one having the most fun!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/12200044100/Alex-Lowe-1958-1999 americanalpineclub.org, pdf version of AAJ 2000, p. 441] (the motto of ''In memoriam: Alex Lowe 1958-1999'', pp. 441-443, by Gordon Wiltsie).&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowe improved his upper body strength as a result of an exercise regimen that included 400 chin-ups and hundreds of dips.  In an article for ''[http://www.activelifestylesmag.com/ Active Lifestyle]'', Gordon Wiltsie, a photographer who climbed with Lowe in [[Antarctica]] and Canada's [[Baffin Island]], said, "he'd hog the pull-up bar to knock out 400 pull-ups in sets of 40 and 45. He disliked downtime and knew where to do pull-ups in many airports. Even on expeditions, when rest is hard to come by and much appreciated, Lowe was an oddball. He'd cop pull-ups on a ship's rigging en route to Antarctica, or do dips in a snow pit he dug at base camp." In that article, Wiltsie said, "At [[Baffin Island]], after hauling supplies to a high point on a climb, we went back to camp beat and tired, but Alex proceeded to do pull-up after pull-up. He even brought an exercise device on climbs." He was known jokingly as "Lungs With Legs" for his incredible strength and stamina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/bodies-of-elite-climber-alex-lowe-cameraman-david-bridges-found-himalayan-avalanche/|title=Bodies of elite climber, cameraman buried in 1999 found|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescue on Denali===
In June 1995, Lowe helped the [[National Park Service]] rescue several Spanish climbers on {{convert|20320|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]]. On 9 June, the group had been trapped for four days at {{convert|19200|ft|m}}. Before a rescue team could assemble, one of the climbers fell {{convert|4200|ft|m}} to his death from the mountain's Upper West Rib. The surviving climbers were all suffering from hypothermia.  Lowe and two fellow climbers were  lifted by military helicopter to a plateau above the Spaniards, scaled down a 400-vertical foot, 50-degree slope of ice and rock, to reach them and determined that one needed immediate evacuation.  Amid snowy conditions, he at first dragged, then carried him on his back up the steep slope at high altitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkVzs3eD9SM|title=The Life and Death of Mr. Invincible|first=|last=Richard Mackenzie|date=9 March 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 May 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/471341.stm|title=BBC News - World - Cyber reports of mountain tragedy|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death on Shishapangma==
[[File:Shishapangma 2012-6-7.jpg|thumb|400px|Shishapangma]]
[[File:Shisha Pangma 2006.jpg|thumb|400px|Shishapangma]]
In September 1999, Lowe, [[Conrad Anker]] and [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36184777 David Bridges] (a two-time US national [[paragliding]] champion) traveled to the {{convert|26291|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] giant [[Shishapangma]], the fourteenth highest peak in the world, as part of the 1999 American [[Shishapangma]] Ski Expedition. 

Plans called for Lowe and Anker to be part of the team that would ski down, to become the first Americans to ski down from the summit of an 8,000-meter peak; while Bridges was part of a three-man film team that was to shoot an NBC [[Documentary film|documentary]] of the expedition for The North Face. Lowe commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It's been a passionate goal of mine to ski off an 8,000 meter peak. I guess there's a lot of people sort of looking to do this and try to ski off Everest. But for me, it's got to be an aesthetic and quality run. And Shishapangma has the best ski line of any of the 8,000 meter peaks. It's just an absolutely straight shot right down the Southwest Face. That's going to be a good one." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mountainzone.com/climbing/99/interviews/lowe/|title=Tales from Alex Lowe|website=www.mountainzone.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 5 October, they split into two teams as they searched for a route up the mountain. Lowe's group (Lowe, Anker and Bridges) were crossing a flat glacier when a large [[serac]] broke loose {{convert|6000|ft|m}} above and tumbled downhill. The {{convert|500|ft|m|sing=on}}-wide avalanche swept over the three men. Anker was thrown {{convert|100|ft|m}} by the windblast, and suffered a lacerated head, two broken ribs, and dislocated shoulder, but emerged from the snow, and led a 20 hours rescue attempt in the large debris field measuring up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} deep. Neither body was found at the time, but almost seventeen (17) years later on 27 April 2016, climbers [[Ueli Steck]] and [http://blogs.dw.com/adventuresports/2014/05/03/david-goettler-interview-everest/ David Göttler], came across the remains of the two climbers emerging from the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heller|first1=Seth|title=Alex Lowe's and David Bridges' Remains Found on Shishapangma|url=https://rockandice.com/climbing-news/alex-lowes-and-david-bridges-remains-found-on-shishapangma/|website=Rock and Ice|publisher=Rock and Ice|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial fund===
Lowe was survived by his wife Jennifer and three sons, Max, Sam, and Isaac. The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation was established in his honor to provide direction and financial support to humanitarian programs in mountain regions around the world. Their work includes the Khumbu Climbing Center for indigenous people of [[Nepal]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.outsideonline.com/1850376/believers "The Believers"], Conrad Anker, December 2005, ''Outside Magazine''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Lowe-Anker published a memoir, ''Forget Me Not'' in 2008, that recounts her life shared with Lowe, his death and the life she continued with Anker. ''Forget Me Not'' won the National Outdoor Book award for literature in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noba-web.org/books08.htm "2008: Outdoor Literature Category"], noba-web.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing achievements and recognition==
In 1995, Lowe received the [[American Alpine Club]]'s [[Miriam O'Brien Underhill|Underhill Award]] for outstanding mountaineering achievement, the highest honor in U.S. mountaineering. He climbed for nearly 10 years with [[The North Face]] professional climbing team, which included in the later years mountaineer [[Jon Krakauer]], author of the bestseller ''[[Into Thin Air]]''.  After Lowe's death, ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside Magazine]]'' posthumously declared him "the world's best climber," adding, "No matter how jaw-dropping his routes, Lowe's real genius grew out of the way he combined physical accomplishments with an indomitable spirit."

===Alex Lowe Peak===
Formerly known by its elevation as Peak 10,031, [https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Alex-Lowe-Peak Alex Lowe Peak], south of [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]], [[Montana]] in the [[Gallatin National Forest]] was officially named after him in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everestnews.com/stories2005/lowe09202005.htm everestnews.com] ''"Alex Lowe Peak": A Mountain Honoring a Mountaineer'' [with photograph, localization and the climbing history of the peak] (retrieved March 27, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexlowe.org/peak.shtml alexlowe.org/peak.shtml] ''"Alex Lowe Peak": A Mountain Honoring a Mountaineer''. Retrieved March 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In spring of 1997, Lowe had climbed the northern [[couloir]] with friend Hans Saari; and the two had made the first ski-descent from the summit, down what they named "Hellmouth Couloir."

Funders are not responsible for any of the materials produced by the Alliance for Heart Failure, which are created independently by the Alliance’s secretariat.

== All Party Parliamentary Group on Heart Disease Inquiry into heart failure ==

In 2016, the [[All Party Parliamentary Group]] on Heart Disease, chaired by [[Stuart Andrew|Stuart Andrew MP]], held an inquiry into living with [[heart failure]].  Written and oral evidence was provided by patients, healthcare professionals, and commissioners. The Inquiry’s report, [http://www.cardiomyopathy.org/downloads/appg-on-heart-disease-focus-on-heart-failure-report.pdf Focus on Heart Failure], was published in September 2016 and made [https://allianceforheartfailure.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Living-with-Heart-Failure-10-recommendations.pdf ten recommendations] for improving heart failure services.

Nine members of the Alliance for Heart Failure were co-opted onto an advisory panel for the inquiry.  The panel had ten members in total.

== National Heart Failure Audit ==

The [https://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/audits/heartfailure/documents/annualreports/annual-report-2015-6-v8.pdf National Heart Failure Audit] (April 2015-March 2016), published on August 10, 2017, reported that mortality among patients admitted to hospital had fallen to 8.9% compared to 9.6% reported in the [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/audits/heartfailure/documents/annualreports/hfannual13-14-updated.pdf previous audit]. It also reported that the number of patients seen by specialist heart failure nurses remained high at 80%, and that 90% of patients were recorded as having an up to date echocardiogram. The report also recorded an increase in prescriptions for disease modifying medications.

The Alliance for Heart Failure welcomed the findings but called for more to be done to address the vast regional variation in patient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=National audit shows improved heart failure survival|journal=The British Journal of Cardiology|date=August 2017|issue=August 2017|url=https://bjcardio.co.uk/2017/08/general-news/|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna''' is the [[pseudonym]] given to the six-year-old [[feral child]] Alice Marie Harris, who was discovered in the year 1938. Anna was raised in [[Solitude|isolation]] in Pennsylvania because she was an [[illegitimate child]]. Anna was kept strapped down in the attic of her home and was [[malnourished]] and unable to speak or move. She died from hemorrhagic [[jaundice]] at the age of ten before she was able to make a full recovery. Anna is often compared to the feral children cases of [[Feral child#Raised in confinement|Isabelle]] and [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]].

==  Family ==
Anna was born March 6, 1932, In [[Perryopolis, Pennsylvania]] about seventeen miles outside of [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania|Uniontown]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=K.|date=1940|title=Extreme Socual Isolation of Child|jstor=2770265|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=|pages=554–565}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/15412651/|title=The Evening Standard from Uniontown, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1938 · Page 3|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-12-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=CHILD OF 5 FOUND PRISONER IN CHAIR|last=|first=|date=February 6, 1938|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the second [[illegitimate child]] of her mother, Martha Harris, who was 27 at the time of Anna's discovery. She lived with Anna's grandfather, David Harris, a widowed farmer who strongly disapproved of her mother's indiscretions. After Anna was found, Martha married a man by the name of George I Eisenhauer. Martha died in Philadelphia in 1959. David Harris, died at the age of 72 in 1948. He was the son of the late Jacob and Catherine Cochran Harris. His children included Martha, Catherine Elwell (daughters) and Jacob and Harold (sons).

== Early life ==
Anna was born in a nurse's private home and was brought to the family farm, but shortly after was sent to live at her mother's friend's house. A local minister considered adopting Anna, but decided against it when he discovered she had [[vaginitis]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; At the age of three weeks, Anna was sent to live in a children's home. There, she was said to be "terribly galled and otherwise in very bad shape".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=K.|date=1947|title=Final Note on a Case of Extreme Isolation|jstor=2770825|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=|pages=432–447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight weeks in the home, Anna's mother was called to come collect her. In her place, she sent a man and his wife to see Anna in hopes of adopting her, but the agency refused to give permission because they disapproved of the couple. Later, the mother came herself and gave Anna to the couple. A short time after, a social worker found Anna at this home and attempted to convince her mother and grandfather to take her back. At this time, Anna was over four months old. She was taken to another children's home where a medical examination revealed she had vaginitis, [[umbilical hernia]], and a [[skin rash]]. Anna was sent to a private [[foster home]] after three weeks in the children's home.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Due to the fact that the mother and the grandfather could not pay for the child's care, she was sent back to live on the family farm at the age of five and a half months. In an attempt to avoid her father's anger, Martha kept her in an attic-like room on the second floor. Her mother was busy working on the farm during the day and occasionally went out at night. Anna was given only enough care to keep her alive and received no instruction or positive attention. She was fed virtually nothing else except for cow's milk and was strapped down to a chair or a cot for the majority of her early life. An article in the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' stated that Anna had been kept in the attic room, which was without windows or ventilation, for two years, and then kept for three years more in the storage room in the second floor. However, a later report in the ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' by Kingsley Davis considers it “doubtful that the child's hands at the time of discovery were tied. It is more likely that she was confined to her crib in the first period of life and at all times kept locked in her room to keep her from falling down the steep stairs leading immediately from the door and to keep the grandfather from seeing her. It is doubtful if the child was ever kept in the attic, as the report also stated”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When interviewed by officers, David Harris was quoted saying: "I made her keep it up there, care for it and feed it as a sort of punishment. I forgave her first sin, but not the second".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The article does not explain what the first sin was, though it is possible that it was the first illegitimate child she had. The same ''New York Times'' article quotes Martha: "My father wouldn't let me bring it downstairs. He said he didn't want to see it around. I had to run up and down, up and down, to feed and take care of it. I had to feed it all the time. It was awfully hard".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The name of the father was withheld, but Martha said the girl's father was a well-to-do farmer.

== Rescue ==
Anna was discovered around February 6, 1938 by E. M. Smith of the Western Pennsylvania Humane Society about seventeen miles from Uniontown, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The humane officer found the child after a report had been filed from the Woman's Club of Star Junction. Other reports had also been spread that a child was kept in the house, yet she was never seen by visitors. When Anna was found, the Humane officer reported that: "The child was dressed in a dirty shirt and napkin. Her hands, arms and legs were just bones, with skin drawn over them, so frail she couldn't use them. She never grew normally, and the chair on which she lay, half reclining and half sitting was so small the child had to double her legs partly under her".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The chair that she was found in was tilted backwards to lean on a coal bucket with her arms tied above her head, leaving her unable to talk or move. Charges of [[negligence]] to a minor were brought up against Harris and Martha. The grandfather was freed after Judge J. Russell Carr dismissed the case for lack of evidence.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Dr John Kerr of Connellsville testified at the trial. He declared: "it was about the most deplorable condition I have ever seen in all those years".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He testified she had a severe lack of muscle, abnormal bones, and that she couldn't see or hear. He believed that, had she been properly nourished, she would have been a "normal" child. Martha, her mother, claimed that she tried feeding her child meat and other solid foods but that they made her gag. She denied the statements that the child had been kept imprisoned in an attic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Recovery ==
When Anna was first rescued, Drs. J. F. Kerr and D. F. Newell assessed that she was [[undernourished]], that the bones in her legs were softened and twisted out of normal shape and that she was suffering from [[rickets]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was also believed to be [[deaf]] as she didn't respond to others. It was later discovered as she recovered that the deafness was organic rather than functional. She additionally could not walk, talk, and showed little signs of intelligence. Once she was determined a ward of the county and placed in the Fayette County Home, Anna began improving rapidly. She had gained seven pounds by the end of the summer in 1938 but continued to struggle with simple speech and walking. She was enrolled in the Margaret Duer Judge school for "sub-normal" children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; By the age of 9, she began developing signs of speech and was approaching social norms. She could respond to simple commands, feed herself, and remember some people, but she still could not speak, and had the approximate intelligence of a 1 year old child. 

A report filed in November 6, 1939 describes her state as follows: "Anna walks about aimlessly, makes periodic rhythmic motions of her hands, and, at intervals, makes guttural and sucking noises. She regards her hands as if she had seen them for the first time. It was impossible to hold her attention for more than a few seconds at a time-not because of distraction due to external stimuli but because of her inability to concentrate. She ignored the task in hand to gaze vacantly about the room. Speech is entirely lacking. Numerous unsuccessful attempts have been made with her in the hope of developing initial sounds. I do not believe that this failure is due to negativism or deafness but that she is not sufficiently developed to accept speech at this time .... The prognosis is not favorable". Her teachers described her as having a pleasant disposition, but unfortunately, Anna died soon after.

== Death ==
After a life of just over ten years, Anna died on August 6, 1942.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her death was caused by hemorrhagic [[jaundice]], a form of jaundice in which injury and anemia are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/165749.php|title=Jaundice: Causes, symptoms, and treatments|work=Medical News Today|access-date=2017-11-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/hemorrhagic+jaundice|title=hemorrhagic jaundice|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no cited evidence that her condition was linked to her isolation. The Fayette County commissioners paid for the funeral and burial of Anna in Delaware Cemetery, near the Judge School in Milford where she had last lived.

== Comparisons to other cases ==
Anna's case is commonly compared to the study of another [[feral child]], Isabelle, because of their similar upbringings. Anna and Isabelle were both raised in [[Solitude|isolation]] for a similar amount of time, but Isabelle was able to recover much faster and achieve greater mental development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Isabelle was born one month after Anna and was discovered nine months after Anna. Similarly to Anna, Isabelle was forced into isolation because she was an illegitimate child. During her six and a half years of isolation, Isabelle lived with her deaf and mute mother. She had no concept of relationships, no verbal skills, and was malnourished. Following Isabelle's discovery, she was hospitalized and her apathetic behavior was closely monitored. She was then transferred to a ward with children where she became socialized and learned to imitate the other children. She also began language training with a skilled team of doctors and within eighteen months had gained the understanding and use of an estimated 1500–2500 words, enabling her to produce complex sentences and correctly use inflection morphology, pronouns, and prepositions by the age of eight.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Processing in Atypical Populations|last=Tartter|first=V. C.|publisher=SAGE publications|year=1998|isbn=|location=California|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As soon as a year and a half after her discovery, Isabelle was energetic and fully mobile. By fourteen, she was excelling in public school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The recovery of Isabelle is clearly different than Anna. In both cases they had very low intellectual abilities when they were discovered and introduced into the world. Their differences arise, however, when you consider that two years after Isabelle's discovery she was deemed to be recovered and a fully functioning girl, but prior to Anna's death she only ever reached the level of socialization of a two or three year old child.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/19920827|title=Society : a brief introduction|last=1944-|first=Robertson, Ian,|date=1989|publisher=Worth Publishers|isbn=9780879014124|location=New York, N.Y.|oclc=19920827}}&lt;/ref&gt; The varying recovery between Anna and Isabelle is suspected to be the result of Anna having less initial mental capacity prior to isolation or to her receiving a lesser standard of care and verbal training during her recovery than Isabelle's team of skilled doctors and physiologists offered her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Some also account Isabelle's recovery to the fact that she was in isolation with her mother.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, the exact reason is hard to pinpoint because Anna died at the age of ten before this could be investigated any further.

Another case Anna is commonly compared to is feral child [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]]. While growing up, Genie's father became convinced that Genie was severely mentally retarded, causing him to withhold from her care and attention. At approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months, this belief of Genie's father cause him to keep her as socially isolated as possible and until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a room. During this time, Genie was strapped to a child's toilet or bound in her crib. This caused Genie's arms and legs to remain completely immobilized, forbade anyone from interacting with her, provided her with almost no stimulation of any kind, and left her severely malnourished and unable to mobilize.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Development of Language in Genie: a Case of Language Acquisition Beyond the "Critical Period"|last=Curtiss|first=Susan|publisher=|year=1974|isbn=|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of her isolation prevented her from being exposed to any significant amount of speech or human interaction, and as a result she did not acquire language during her childhood, similar to Anna. Her abuse came to the attention of Los Angeles child welfare authorities on November 4, 1970 and this caused a media frenzy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Concise Encyclopedia of Special Education: A Reference for the Education of the Handicapped and Other Exceptional Children and Adults|last=Reynolds|first=Cecil R|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2004|isbn=9780471652519|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=428–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Following her discovery, Genie was followed by scientists, physiologists, and linguists, but she has only managed to obtain nonverbal communication skills. Genie has lived much longer than Anna and is believed to be 60 or 61 years old (as of 2017), but she has yet to acquire a functional first language. Unlike Anna, psychologists and linguists continue to frequently discuss Genie to this day, and there is considerable academic and media interest in her development and the research team's methods, since Genie's case has demonstrated the necessity of early language stimulation in the left hemisphere of the brain to start.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The discoveries made through Genie's following and scientific testing relate to Anna because it explains that Anna's lack of language stimulation during her isolated childhood are the basis for why she was never able to acquire the verbal communication skills expected of her age up until the time of her early death.

== Ethical dispute ==
{{Original research section|date=January 2018}}

The difficulty in treating feral children cases like Anna is that the line between care and therapy is blurred. As seen with Genie's case, putting scientific advancement over her personal care is a pitfall that all scientists were guilty of to some degree. Families that had no background in abused child psychology were not equipped to care for her, and scientists that were equipped also were invested in researching how to better treat future children. Additionally Paul Lutus argues that psychology is not a real science because the outcome is not determined by the treatment. And all successes become research somewhere down the line.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arachnoid.com/psychology/index.html|title=Psychology and Neuroscience|last=Lutus|first=Paul|date=|website=www.arachnoid.com|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true in any feral child case as there is no ethical way to perform social isolation experiments on children to the extent of someone like Anna. Psychological treatment relies on a code that ensures professionalism and quality care necessary to gain the trust of the child. The goal is to support the patient so that they can pursue development and autonomy while the psychologist resists potentially controlling or coercing compliance. Treating feral children is understandably difficult as they have little to no means of communication, and are ineffective at communicating wants and desires in a meaningful way. Ethics comes into dispute when the line between teaching and parenting becomes thin.

'''Atmit''' is a [[nutritional supplement]] used to fight [[famine]] in impoverished countries.  The creamy, nutritious food is indigenous to Ethiopia and is now used to feed the severely malnourished and weakened adults and children.  The word ''atmit'' originated in [[Ethiopia]] and refers to a kind of "thin, nourishing [[porridge]]." Traditionally, Atmit can contain over 20 different cereals and recipes can vary widely.

Atmit is made from rolled oats, powdered milk, powdered sugar, vitamins, and minerals.  It is easily digestible, high in protein and calorie content.  Since severely malnourished people cannot eat solid food, atmit is an ideal way to get them essential nutrients.

[[Marta Gabre-Tsadick]], the first woman Senator from Ethiopia and the co-founder of [[Project Mercy, Inc.]], a Christian relief organization, adapted the recipe for production in the United States for shipment to Ethiopia and other African countries.  During 1985 and 1986, Project Mercy sent 930 tons of atmit to Ethiopia, where [[World Vision]] relief workers used it to prepare millions of meals which they distributed among people weakened from the famine.{{Citation needed|reason=may 2009|date=May 2009}}

Charity and relief organizations have created various formulas for this porridge.  [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] formula of atmit, which was sent in 2005 to [[Niger]] was made of the following:

*50% fine [[oatmeal]] [[flour]]
*25% nonfat [[milk]]
*20% [[sugar]]
*5% [[vitamins]] and [[minerals]]

That formula was further developed in 2009 to contain 51% oat flour, 23% nonfat dried milk, and 25% sugar, with the remaining percent composed of a re-developed set of micro nutrients designed to improve vitamin shelf life and decrease vitamin degradation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/byu/news-features/atmits-byu-connection.html&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] sent 1.4 million pounds of the new Atmit formula to Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ldsphilanthropies.org/humanitarian-services/news-features/thousands-grateful-for-atmit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, atmit has been distributed to [[Uganda]], [[Sudan]], [[South Africa]], [[Haiti]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Indonesia]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Niger]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3697">'''Australian Hearing''' is a [[statutory authority]] constituted under the ''Australian Hearing Services Act 1991'', reporting to the Minister for Human Services, and is within the Department of Human Services portfolio. Australian Hearing is the largest Australian government-funded hearing aid dispensing company providing hearing care and technologies. One of their areas of interest is hearing testing and rehabilitation of children under the age of 26.

Its research division, the National Acoustic Laboratories, takes part in collaborative research for the [[Cooperative Research Centre]] for Cochlear Implant and Hearing Aid Innovation (CRC HEAR). Its research can be broadly divided into the areas of hearing assessment, hearing loss prevention, hearing rehabilitation devices, and hearing rehabilitation procedures.

==History==
Australian Hearing is the current incarnation of the Acoustic Research Laboratory that was set up in 1942. Its initial purpose was the investigation of [[noise]] on behalf of the [[Military of Australia|Australian Military]] during [[World War II]]. After the war it helped those children whose hearing was affected by earlier [[rubella]] outbreaks.

The Commonwealth Department of Health (now the [[Department of Health and Ageing (Australia)|Department of Health and Ageing]]) took over the Laboratory and was renamed the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories, with the aim of providing hearing services for children and veterans. It was in 1973 renamed the National Acoustic Laboratories.

The ''Australian Hearing Services Act 1991'' established it as Australian Hearing Services, a Commonwealth Government statutory authority. The name National Acoustics Laboratories was retained for its research division. When the [[Department of Human Services (Australia)|Department of Human Services]] was formed in 2004, the agency now known as Australian Hearing was moved into its portfolio.

==Eligibility criteria==
To be eligible for hearing services from Australian Hearing, one must be an [[Australia]]n resident or [[permanent resident]], and meet one of the following categories:
* Anyone under the age of 26 (before 1 January 2012 eligibility was lost at 21),
* Holders of Pensioner concession cards, or their dependants,
* Recipients of a sickness allowance from [[Centrelink]], or their dependants,
* [[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]] Gold Repatriation Health Card holders, or their dependants,
* [[Department of Veterans' Affairs (Australia)|Department of Veterans' Affairs]] White Repatriation Health Card holders where hearing loss is specified, or their dependants,
* [[Australian Defence Force]] personnel,
* [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples aged 50 and over,
* [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples participating in a Community Development Employment Project (CDEP).

==Possible privatisation==
In February 2014, the [[National Commission of Audit]] recommended in its Phase One Report that the Commonwealth sell its interest in Australian Hearing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncoa.gov.au/report/phase%2Done/part-b/10-1-privatisations.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was passed in the [[California State Senate]] in June 2015 and signed into law by Governor [[Jerry Brown]] on June 30, 2015.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/06/30/california-vaccination-bill-sb-277-signed-by-governor-becomes-law/ | title=California Vaccination Bill SB 277 Signed By Governor, Becomes Law | work=Forbes | date=June 30, 2015 | accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill, co-authored by California state Senators [[Richard Pan]], and [[Ben Allen]], was prompted by the [[Incidents_at_Disneyland_Resort#Guest_altercations|2014 Disneyland measles outbreak]] and low levels of vaccination in pockets of California, with some schools having vaccination rates below 60%.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"/&gt; SB277 was supported by the [[California Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmanet.org/news/detail/?article=cma-joins-vaccine-advocates-to-launch-i-heart |title=CMA joins vaccine advocates to launch "I Heart Immunity" campaign in support of Senate Bill 277 |work=CMA website |publisher=[[California Medical Association]] |date=April 6, 2015 |accessdate=July 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the bill, albeit from "a tiny minority", has been characterized as "possibly the most strident outpouring of political dissent in recent memory".&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/california-vaccine-bill-sb-277-ban-personal-exemptions-sparks-counter-movement-1931383 | title=California Vaccine Bill SB 277: Ban On Personal Exemptions Sparks Counter Movement Despite Recent Measles Outbreak | work=International Business Times | date=May 20, 2015 | accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the bill started a petition to have Senator Pan removed by recall election.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/30/california-sb-277-vaccines-opponents-recall&lt;/ref&gt; On social media Pan was [[Godwin's Law|compared to a nazi]] and death threats were reported against both him and Ben Allen.&lt;ref name="SacBee"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article18533915.html | title=California Capitol on alert over anti-vaccine threats | work=Sacramento Bee | date=April 14, 2015 | accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFgate"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Death-threats-made-to-lawmakers-who-wrote-6207413.php | title=Death threats made to office of state vaccine bill author | work=SFgate | date=April 17, 2015 | accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2015 [[University of California, Hastings College of the Law]] professor [[Dorit Rubinstein Reiss]] gave her testimony on SB 277 before the [[California Senate]] Judiciary Committee. In her testimony, she stated that the legislature had leeway to require school immunization, citing the U.S Supreme Court cases Zucht v. King (1922) and [[Prince v. Massachusetts]] (1944). She also rejected the need of non-medical exemptions and said the bill did not violate the right to education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Transcript| url =http://www.whatthefolly.com/2015/04/29/transcript-u-c-hastings-law-professor-dorit-reisss-testimony-on-sb-277-before-the-senate-judiciary-committee-april-28-2015/| website =What The Folly?|date=April 29, 2015 |accessdate=July 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chief Medical Officer''' (CMO) is the most senior advisor on health matters in a government. There are four CMOs in the United Kingdom who are appointed to advise their respective governments: [[Her Majesty's Government]], the [[Northern Ireland Executive]], the [[Scottish Government]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/NHS-Scotland/17914/10696 |title=Chief Medical Officer (CMO) |publisher=Scottish Government |accessdate=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Welsh Government]]. Each CMO is assisted by one or more Deputy Chief Medical Officers, and are complimented by a [[Chief Nursing Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Nursing Officer]].

In England, the CMO is a member of the board of the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS), a civil servant in the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]], and head of the medical civil service. The [[Republic of Ireland]] has [[Chief Medical Officer (Ireland)|a similar officer]].

The Chief Medical Officer is a qualified [[medical doctor]] whose medical speciality traditionally was [[public health]] medicine, and whose work focused on the health of communities rather than health of individuals.  More recently the appointees have been clinicians without training or experience in [[public health]] medicine. In the UK, the CMO is one of six chief professional officers who advise the government in their respective health and social care disciplines.&lt;ref name = "6 cpo"&gt;

The equivalent US term is [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]. The term Surgeon General is also a used in the [[British Armed Forces]] for the head of medical services.  In non-government organisations, such as policing, chief medical officer may refer to a senior medical post in the organisation. When appointed outside government the chief medical officer will often decide on physical and mental fitness to serve issues, and the role may not be in public health.

Together with the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USPL|111|152}}, {{USStat|124|1029}}, codified as amended at scattered sections of the Internal Revenue Code and in 42 U.S.C., 19 U.S.C., and 20 U.S.C.&lt;/ref&gt; it represents the most significant regulatory overhaul of the [[Health care in the United States|U.S. healthcare system]] since the passage of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="overhaul"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/28/usa-healthcare-court-idUSL2E8HS4WG20120628|title=US top court upholds healthcare law in Obama triumph|publisher=Reuters|first=James|last=Vicini|first2=Jonathan|last2=Stempel|date=June 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACA was enacted with the goals of increasing the quality and affordability of [[health insurance]], lowering the [[Health insurance coverage in the United States|uninsured rate]] by expanding [[Health insurance in the United States#Public health care coverage|public]] and [[Private Option|private]] insurance coverage, and reducing the costs of healthcare for individuals and the government. It introduced a number of mechanisms—including mandates, [[subsidy|subsidies]], and [[Health insurance marketplace|insurance exchanges]]—meant to increase coverage and affordability.&lt;ref name="nyt-critics"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]]|title=Health Law Critics Prepare to Battle Over Insurance Exchange Subsidies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/us/critics-of-health-care-law-prepare-to-battle-over-insurance-exchange-subsidies.html|first=Robert|last=Pear|date=July 7, 2012|accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/04/paul-krugman/krugman-calls-senate-health-care-bill-similar-law-|title=Krugman calls Senate health care bill similar to law in Massachusetts|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=January 31, 2010|work=PolitiFact.com|publisher=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthcare.gov''' is a [[Health insurance exchange|healthcare exchange]] [[website]] created by and operated under the [[United States federal government]] as per the [[Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|provisions]] of the PPACA, designed to serve the residents of the thirty-six U.S. states that opted not to create their own [[Health insurance marketplace|state exchanges]].&lt;ref name='fierce'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/healthcaregov-problems-spark-federal-it-recriminations/2013-10-16|title=Healthcare.gov problems spark federal IT recriminations|date=16 October 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=''[http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/ Fierce Government IT]''|author=David Perera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Americans had until December 23, 2013 to sign up for coverage that would begin in January 2014. The official enrollment period deadline is the last day of March.&lt;ref name=jumps/&gt;

The PPACA detailed the exchange system as a way to comparison shop between different possible [[health insurance]] options for an individual within his or her state, with a visual format somewhat analogous to websites such as [[Amazon.com]] and [[Etsy]].&lt;ref name='bw-opensource'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-16/open-source-everything-the-moral-of-the-healthcare-dot-gov-debacle|title=The Obamacare Website Didn't Have to Fail.

The [[Congressional Budget Office]] (CBO) forecast that about seven million Americans would use the website to obtain coverage during the first year after its launch. The October 1, 2013 roll-out of Healthcare.gov went through as planned, despite the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|concurrent partial government shutdown]]. The website has been marred by serious technological problems since its launch, making it difficult for Americans to sign up for health insurance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title = Obama addresses healthcare website glitches|date = 21 October 2013|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24613022|accessdate = 21 October 2013|work = [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 27, only about seven hundred thousand people filed applications, with even fewer actually enrolled in plans.&lt;ref name=mtp&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/53387824/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/#.Um3obflwrh4|publisher=[[NBC News]] - ''[[Meet The Press]]''|title=Oct. 27: John Kasich, Steve Beshear, Patrick J. Geraghty, Andrea Mitchell, Peter King, Rick Santorum, Jennifer Granholm, Neera Tanden, Alex Castellanos, Brian Williams|accessdate=October 27, 2013|date=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] made a thirty-minute [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] appearance discussing the varied issues. "There's no sugar coating: the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and I think it's fair to say that nobody's more frustrated by that than I am," he remarked. Promising a "tech surge" of the best people that [[Barack Obama administration|his administration]] could assemble, he added, "there's no excuse for the problems, and these problems are getting fixed."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Issues with Healthcare.gov have persisted weeks past the launch, with the website unable to reach its related data services hub on October 28. Said [[glitches]] have particularly beleaguered [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] head [[Kathleen Sebelius]]. As of November 30, over 137,000 people have obtained insurance coverage from Healthcare.gov, a figure representing the strong improvement of the user experience since October yet still vastly trailing past U.S. government estimates.&lt;ref name=jumps&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/12/11/250023704/enrollment-jumps-at-healthcare-gov-though-totals-still-lag|title=Enrollment Jumps At HealthCare.gov, Though Totals Still Lag|date=December 11, 2013|publisher=[[NPR.org]]|accessdate=December 12, 2013|first=Scott|last=Horsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exchange Information Disclosure Act would require the Obama Administration to provide more information related to these problems to Congress and the American public.

==Provisions of the bill==
''This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the [[Congressional Research Service]], a [[public domain]] source.''&lt;ref name=3362sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3362 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/3362|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exchange Information Disclosure Act would amend the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] to expand reporting requirements related to health care exchanges. The bill would require the Secretary of [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to publish reports weekly through March 31, 2015, on: 
:(1) consumer interactions with healthcare.gov or subsequent sites and any efforts undertaken to remedy problems that impact taxpayers and consumers;&lt;ref name="3362sum"/&gt; 
:(2) calls to the federal customer service call center, including the number of calls received by the call center, problems identified by users, and referrals of those calls;&lt;ref name="3362sum"/&gt; 
:(3) all navigators and certified application counselors that have been trained and certified by health care exchanges;&lt;ref name="3362sum"/&gt; and 
:(4) all agents and brokers who have been trained and certified by the federal health care exchange.&lt;ref name="3362sum"/&gt;

==Procedural history==
The Exchange Information Disclosure Act was introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] on October 29, 2013 by [[Lee Terry|Rep. Lee Terry (R, NE-2)]].&lt;ref name=3362allactions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3362 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3362/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means]].&lt;ref name="3362allactions"/&gt; On January 3, 2014, House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced that the bill would be on the schedule for the week of January 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=leadersschedule&gt;{{cite web|title=Leader's Weekly Schedule Week of January 6, 2014|url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/1-6-14.pdf|publisher=House Majority Leader's Office|accessdate=7 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107230909/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/1-6-14.pdf|archivedate=7 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==
Supporters of the bill argue that it would help Congress and the American people judge and follow the progress of the ACA.&lt;ref name=itworld1&gt;{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Grant|title=US House to target HealthCare.gov in two votes this week|url=http://www.itworld.com/internet/398951/us-house-target-healthcaregov-two-votes-week?page=0,0|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=IT World|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] argue that the bill is necessary because the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] has refused to provide information about usage of healthcare.gov and enrollment in new health insurance plans.&lt;ref name="GOPdemand1"/&gt; [[Heritage Action]] notes that the bill is "designed to increase transparency in the operation of American Health Benefits Exchanges" in response to security and transparency failures, but believes "the only acceptable solution is to repeal the law entirely and replace it was a market-based, patient-centered alternative."&lt;ref name=heritageaction&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosario|first=Katherine|title=This Week in Congress|url=http://heritageaction.com/category/this-week-in-congress/|publisher=Heritage Action|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Republicans have also asked for additional information related to Obamacare that is not required in this bill.&lt;ref name="GOPdemand1"/&gt; These Republicans are asking for information about the number of people who have actually paid their first monthly bill and to what degree the enrollees are young, healthy people, versus those who will likely need medical care.&lt;ref name="GOPdemand1"/&gt;

One provision of the bill requires that a list of healthcare navigators be provided, with contact and affiliation information. This is a response to criticism that some navigators have been encouraging people to lie on their enrollment forms to get better deals.&lt;ref name="GOPdemand1"/&gt;

Senator [[Lamar Alexander]], who introduced similar legislation in the Senate, argued in favor of the bill. Alexander noted that "with [[WikiLeaks]] and [[Edward Snowden]] spilling our beans every day, what's happening on the Obamacare exchanges is the only secret left in Washington... the [[National Security Administration]] should learn some lessons from Secretary [[Kathleen Sebelius|Sebelius]]."&lt;ref name="GOPdemand1"/&gt;

''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' columnist Greg Sargent wrote that the vote on the Exchange Information Disclosure Act would "be partly about reassuring the base that ''GOP leaders are still taking the fight to Obamacare, dammit!!!''"&lt;ref name=morningplum&gt;{{cite news|last=Sargent|first=Greg|title=The Morning Plum: The next battle over Obamacare|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/03/the-morning-plum-the-next-battle-over-obamacare/|accessdate=7 January 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sargent argued that the bill was "a political attack coming from a party that wants to see the law fail," even if some people would be interested in the actual data.&lt;ref name="morningplum"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24204">'''Extra-pair copulation''' ('''EPC''') is a [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] [[mating]] behaviour in [[Monogamy in animals|monogamous]] species. Monogamy occurs when an individual has only one sexual partner at any one time, forming a long term bond and combining efforts to raise offspring together; extra-pair copulation occurs when one of these individuals mates outside of this pairing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrie|first=Marion|last2=Kempenaers|first2=Bart|date=1998-02-01|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: explaining variation between species and populations|url=http://www.cell.com/article/S0169534797012329/abstract|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|language=English|volume=13|issue=2|pages=52–58|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01232-9|issn=0169-5347|pmid=21238200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the animal kingdom, extra-pair copulation is common in [[monogamous]] species, and only a very few [[Pair bond|pair-bonded]] species are thought to be exclusively sexually [[monogamous]]. EPC in the animal kingdom has mostly been studied in birds and mammals.&lt;ref name="Houtman, 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gowaty and Bridges 1991a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bollinger and gavin, 1991" /&gt; Possible benefits of EPC can be investigated within non-human species, such as birds.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt; In males, a number of theories are proposed to explain extra-pair copulations. One such hypothesis is that males maximise their [[reproductive success]] by copulating with as many females as possible outside of a pair bond relationship because their [[parental investment]] is lower, meaning they can copulate and leave the female with minimum risk to themselves. Females, on the other hand, have to invest a lot more in their offspring; extra-pair copulations produce a greater cost because they put the resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this, females do seek out extra pair copulations,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forstmeier|first=Wolfgang|last2=Martin|first2=Katrin|last3=Bolund|first3=Elisabeth|last4=Schielzeth|first4=Holger|last5=Kempenaers|first5=Bart|date=2011-06-28|title=Female extrapair mating behavior can evolve via indirect selection on males|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/26/10608|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=108|issue=26|pages=10608–10613|doi=10.1073/pnas.1103195108|issn=0027-8424|pmc=3127899|pmid=21670288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, because of the risk, there is more debate about the evolutionary benefits for females.

==In men==
Extra-pair copulation in men has been explained as being partly due to parental investment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David M|title=Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures.|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–49|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00023992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has suggested&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that copulation poses more of a risk to future investment for women, as they have the potential of becoming pregnant, and consequently require a large parental investment of the [[gestation period]], and then further rearing of the offspring. Contrastingly, men are able to copulate and then abandon their mate as there is no risk of pregnancy for themselves, meaning there is a smaller risk of parental investment in any possible offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert |title=Parental investment and sexual selection |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-35456-3 |pages=795–838 |url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert |title=Parental investment and sexual selection |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-35456-3 |pages=795–838 |url=http://www1.appstate.edu/~kms/classes/psy2664/Documents/trivers.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to having such low parental investment, it is evolutionarily adaptive for men to copulate with as many women as possible, as it will allow them to spread their genes with little risk of future investment. This may therefore lead to more extra-pair copulation in men, as they are able to copulate with other women without the consequences of having to rear new offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gangestad |first1=Steven |last2=Simpson |first2=Jeffry |title=The evolution of human mating: Trade-offs and strategic pluralism |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |date=2000 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=573–644 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0000337X |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=65461&amp;fileId=S0140525X0000337X |pmid=11301543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various factors can increase the probability of EPC in males. Firstly, males with low levels of [[fluctuating asymmetry]] are more likely to have EPCs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=Steven W|last2=Thornhill|first2=Randy|title=The evolutionary psychology of extrapair sex: The role of fluctuating asymmetry|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=1997|volume=18|issue=2|pages=69–88|doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(97)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to the fact that signals of low fluctuating asymmetry suggest that the males have "good genes", making females more likely to copulate with them as it will enhance the genes of their offspring, even if they do not expect long term commitment from the male.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Psychosocial stress early on in life, including behaviours such as physical violence and substance abuse, can predict EPC in later life.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koehler|first1=Nicole|last2=Chisholm|first2=James S|title=Early Psychosocial Stress Predicts Extra-pair Copulations|journal=Evolutionary Psychology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=184–201|doi=10.1177/147470490700500111}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been explained as being due to Life History Theory, which argues that individuals who are reared in environments, where resources are scarce and life expectancy is low, are more likely to engage in reproductive behaviours earlier in life in order to ensure the proliferation of their genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Hillard S|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W|title=Life History Theory and Evolutionary Psychology.|date=2005|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc (Hoboken, NJ, US)|isbn=0471264032|pages=68–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals reared in these environments are said to have short life histories. With respect to Life History Theory, these finding have been explained by suggesting that males who experienced psychosocial stress early in life have short life histories, making them more likely to try and reproduce as much as possible by engaging in EPC to avoid gene extinction.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

However, men may also choose not to have EPCs for multiple reasons. One reason may be that long-term monogamous relationships can help form environments that will aid the successful rearing of offspring, as the male is present to help raise them, leading to an increased probability of the male's genes surviving to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mellen|first1=Sydney|title=The Evolution of Love|date=1981|publisher=Oxford: WH Freeman|isbn=0716712717|pages=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second reason that EPCs may be avoided by a male is that it can be costly to them; their EPC may be discovered, leading to the dissolution of the long-term relationship with their partner and, in some cases, lead to their partner assaulting or even killing them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Men may also avoid EPCs to minimize the risk of putting themselves at increased opportunity for STD transmission which can be common in EPCs. The partners in the EPC may be promiscuous as well leading to a higher statistical chance and probability of contracting venereal diseases; this would counter the lower incidence of STD transmission among exclusively monogamous sexually active couples. Spousal homicide is more likely to be committed by males rather than females, which may make the ramifications of EPC more relevant to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Martin|last2=Wilson|first2=Margo|title=Homicide|date=1988|publisher=Aldine de Gruyter (Hawthorne, NY, US)|isbn=0202011771|pages=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In women==
From an evolutionary perspective, females have to invest a lot more in their offspring than males due to prolonged pregnancy and child rearing, and a child has a better chance of survival and development with two parents involved in child-rearing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morell|first=Virginia|date=1998-09-25|title=A New Look at Monogamy|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/281/5385/1982|journal=Science|language=en|volume=281|issue=5385|pages=1982–1983|doi=10.1126/science.281.5385.1982|issn=0036-8075|pmid=9767050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, extra-pair copulations have a greater cost for women because they put the support and resources that their mate can offer at risk by copulating outside the relationship.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also the increased risk of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is suggested as a possible evolutionary reason for the transition from polygamous to monogamous relationships in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauch|first=Chris T.|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|date=2016-04-12|title=Disease dynamics and costly punishment can foster socially imposed monogamy|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160412/ncomms11219/full/ncomms11219.html|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=7|pages=11219|doi=10.1038/ncomms11219|pmid=27044573|pmc=4832056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, females do seek out extra-pair copulation, with some research finding that women's levels of [[infidelity]] are equal to that of men's, although this evidence is mixed.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buss|first=David M.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|date=1997-06-01|title=Susceptibility to Infidelity in the First Year of Marriage|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656697921759|journal=Journal of Research in Personality|volume=31|issue=2|pages=193–221|doi=10.1006/jrpe.1997.2175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the increased risk, there is more confusion about the evolutionary benefits of extra-pair copulation for females.

The most common theory is that women mate outside of the monogamous relationship to acquire better genetic material for their offspring. A female in a relationship with a male with 'poorer genetic quality' may try to enhance the fitness of her children and therefore the continuation of her own genes by engaging in extra-pair copulation with better quality males.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A second theory is that a woman will engage in extra-pair copulation to seek additional resources for herself or her offspring.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is based on observations from the animal world in which females may copulate outside of their pair-bond relationship with neighbours to gain extra protection, food or nesting materials. Finally, [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] have theorized that extra-pair copulation is an indirect result of [[Natural selection|selection]] on males. The [[allele]]s in males that promote extra-pair copulation as an evolutionary strategy to increase [[reproductive success]] is shared between sexes leading to this behaviour being expressed in females.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are also social factors involved in extra-pair copulation. Both males and females have been found to engage in more sexual behaviour outside of the monogamous relationship when experiencing sexual dissatisfaction in the relationship,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; although how this links to evolutionary theory is unclear. Surveys have found cultural differences in attitudes towards infidelity, though it is relatively consistent that female attitudes are less favorable toward infidelity than male attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CHRISTENSEN|first=HAROLD T.|date=1973-01-01|title=Attitudes Toward Marital Infidelity: A Nine-Culture Sampling of University Student Opinion|jstor=41600842|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=197–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When EPC occurs in animals which show sustained female-male social bonding, this can lead to extra-pair paternity (EPP), in which the female reproduces with an extra-pair male, and hence produces EPO (extra-pair offspring).&lt;ref name="Gowaty chapter"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gowaty |first1=P.A. |editor1-last=Lucas |editor1-first=Jeffrey |editor2-last=Simmons |editor2-first=Leigh |title=Essays in animal behaviour: Celebrating 50 years of animal behaviour |date=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Academic Press |location=Burlington, MA |isbn=0-12-369499-X |pages=221–254 |chapter=Beyond extra-pair paternity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the obvious reproductive success benefits for males,&lt;ref name="Gowaty chapter" /&gt; it used to be thought that males exclusively controlled EPCs.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt;  However, it is now known that females also seek EPC in some situations.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akçay|first1=E.|last2=Roughgarden|first2=J.|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: Review of the genetic benefits|journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research|date=2007|volume=9|issue=5|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/biology_papers/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In birds===
[[File:Taeniopygia guttata -Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada -pair-8a.jpg|thumb|Pair of zebra-finches: Bird Kingdom, Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada.]]
Extra-pair copulation is common in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welty |first1=J.C. |last2=Baptista |first2=L.F. |title=The life of birds |date=1988 |publisher=Saunders College Pub. |location=New York |isbn=0-03-068923-6 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[zebra finch]]es, although [[socially monogamous]], are not sexually [[monogamous]] and hence do engage in extra-pair [[courtship]] and attempts at [[copulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Birkhead |first1=T. |last2=Parker |first2=G. |editor1-last=Krebs |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Davies |editor2-first=Nicholas |title=Behavioural ecology: an evolutionary approach |date=1996 |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-86542-731-3 |pages=121–145 |edition=4th |chapter=Sperm competition and mating systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a laboratory study, female zebra finches copulated over several days, many times with one male and only once with another male. Results found that significantly more eggs were fertilised by the extra-pair male than expected proportionally from just one copulation verses many copulations with the other male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Birkhead |first1=T. R. |last2=Pellatt |first2=J. |last3=Hunter |first3=F. M. |title=Extra-pair copulation and sperm competition in the zebra finch |journal=Nature |date=1988 |volume=334 |issue=6177 |pages=60–62 |doi=10.1038/334060a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPO proportion varies between different species of birds.&lt;ref name="petrie and kempenaers, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petrie|first1=M.|last2=Kempenaers|first2=B.|title=Extra-pair paternity in birds: explaining variation between species and populations|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=1998|volume=13|issue=2|pages=52–58|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01232-9|pmid=21238200}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in eastern bluebirds, studies have shown that around 35% of offspring is due to EPC.&lt;ref name="Gowaty and Bridges 1991a" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In [[Polygyny in animals|socially polygynous]] birds, EPP is only half as common as in [[Monogamy#Varieties in biology|socially monogamous]] birds. Some [[Ethology|ethologists]] consider this finding to be support for the 'female choice' hypothesis of mating systems in birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hasselquist|first1=D.|last2=Sherman|first2=P.|title=Social mating systems and extrapair fertilizations in passerine birds|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2001|volume=12|issue=4|pages=457–466|doi=10.1093/beheco/12.4.457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
[[File:Hylobates lar pair of white and black 02.jpg|thumb|left|Pair of white-handed gibbons]]
Additionally, EPC has been shown in [[monogamous]] [[mammals]], such as the [[white-handed gibbon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Palombit |first1=Ryne A. |title=Extra-pair copulations in a monogamous ape |journal=Animal Behaviour |date=1994 |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=721–723 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1097|url=http://rci.rutgers.edu/~palombit/Palombit_1994b.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of one group found 88% in-pair copulation and 12% extra-pair copulation.&lt;ref name="Reichard"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reichard |first1=U. |title=Extra-pair Copulations in a Monogamous Gibbon (Hylobates lar) |journal=Ethology |date=1995 |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=99–112 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1995.tb00319.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is much variability in rates of EPP in mammals.&lt;ref name="Cohas and Allaine 2009" /&gt; One study found that this disparity in EPP is better predicted by the differing social structures of different mammals, rather than differing types of pair bonding. For example, EPP was lower in species who live in pairs compared to those who live in solitary or family structures.&lt;ref name="Cohas and Allaine 2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohas|first1=A.|last2=Allaine|first2=D.|title=Social structure influences extra-pair paternity in socially monogamous mammals|journal=Biology Letters|date=2009-03-04|volume=5|issue=3|pages=313–316|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0760|pmid=19324647|pmc=2679913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reasons for evolution===
Some argue that EPC is one way in which [[sexual selection]] is operating for [[genetics|genetic]] benefits which is why the extra-pair males involved in EPC seem to be a non-random subset.&lt;ref name="Houtman, 1992" /&gt; There is some evidence for this in birds.&lt;ref name="gray, 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gray|first1=E.M.|title=Do female red-winged blackbirds benefit genetically from seeking extra-pair copulations?|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1997|volume=53|issue=3|pages=605–623|doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0337}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[swallows]], males with longer tails are involved in EPC more than those with shorter tails.&lt;ref name="Moller, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=A.P.|title=Female choice selects for male sexual tail ornaments in the monogamous swallow|journal=Nature|date=1988-04-14|volume=332|issue=6165|pages=640–642|doi=10.1038/332640a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also female swallows with a shorter-tailed within-pair mates are more likely to conduct EPC than those whose mates have longer tails.&lt;ref name="Moller, 1988" /&gt; A similar pattern has been found for [[black-capped chickadees]], in which all extra-pair males had higher rank than the within-pair males.&lt;ref name="smith, 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=S.M.|title=Extra-Pair Copulations in Black-Capped Chickadees: the Role of the Female|journal=Behaviour|date=1988-01-01|volume=107|issue=1|pages=15–23|doi=10.1163/156853988X00160}}&lt;/ref&gt; But some argue that genetic benefits for offspring is not the reason females participate in EPC.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt; A [[meta-analysis]] of genetic benefits of EPC in 55 bird species found that extra-pair offspring were not more likely to survive than within-pair offspring. Also, extra-pair males did not show significantly better ‘good-genes’ traits than within-pair males, except for being slightly larger overall.&lt;ref name="Akçay and Roughgarden 2007" /&gt;

Another potential explanation for the occurrence of EPC in organisms where females solicit EPC is that the alleles controlling such behaviour are intersexually pleiotropic. Under the hypothesis of intersexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the benefit males get from EPC cancels out the negative effects of EPC for females. Thus, the allele that controls EPC in both organisms would persist, even if it would be detrimental to the fitness of females. Similarly, according to the hypothesis of intrasexual antagonistic pleiotropy, the allele that controls EPC in females also controls a behaviour that is under positive selection, such as receptiveness towards within-pair copulation.&lt;ref name="ForstmeierNakagawa2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forstmeier|first1=Wolfgang|last2=Nakagawa|first2=Shinichi|last3=Griffith|first3=Simon C.|last4=Kempenaers|first4=Bart|title=Female extra-pair mating: adaptation or genetic constraint?|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=29|issue=8|year=2014|pages=456–464|issn=01695347|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2014.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gutka vendor in India.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Gutka street vendor, India]]
'''Gutka''' or '''guṭkha''' is a [[chewing tobacco]] preparation made of crushed [[areca nut]], [[tobacco]], [[catechu]], [[paraffin wax]], [[Calcium hydroxide|slaked lime]] and sweet or savory flavorings, commonly used in some parts of [[India]].&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpaaindia.org/activities/projects.htm#gutkha|title=CPAA: Quit Smoking Campaign, Anti Tobacco &amp; Quit Smoking Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains [[carcinogens]], is considered responsible for [[oral cancer]] and other severe negative health effects and hence is subjected in India to the same restrictions and warnings as [[cigarettes]].&lt;ref name=cp /&gt;&lt;ref name="thankyou"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ananth |first1=Venkar |title=Thank you for smoking: A brief history of tobacco warning labels |url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ZNFwGtWis70q2eYpUl9l1L/Thank-you-for-smoking-A-brief-history-of-tobacco-warning-la.html |accessdate=5 October 2018 |publisher=Live Mint |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutka is manufactured in India and exported to a few other countries including [[United States]], often marketed under the guise of a "safer" product than cigarettes and tobacco.  A mild stimulant, it is sold across South Asia in small, individual-sized packets that cost between 2 and 10 [[Indian rupee|rupees]] per packet.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shaukat |first1=Mohammed |title=Tobacco control in India - achievements and remaining challenges |url=http://www.searo.who.int/entity/noncommunicable_diseases/events/ncd-bengaluru-tobacco-control-india.pdf?ua=1 |website=WHO |publisher=Ministry of health and family welfare |accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely consumed in [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and the [[Madhesh]] region of [[Nepal]]. Gutka is consumed by placing a pinch of it between the gum and cheek and gently sucking and chewing, similar to chewing tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/smokeless/betel_quid/|title=CDC - Fact Sheet - Betel Quid with Tobacco (Gutka) - Smoking &amp; Tobacco Use|work=Smoking and Tobacco Use|accessdate=30 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with [[paan]] and other [[smokeless tobacco]] products, there are [[preventive healthcare|preventive]] efforts to encourage users to quit and young people not to start.

== Characteristics ==
Gutka is a powdery, granular, light brownish to white substance. Within moments of chewing mixing with saliva, the gutkha begins to dissolve and turn deep red in color. It may impart upon its user a "buzz" somewhat more intense than that of tobacco chewing, snuffing and smoking. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Panmasala Gutkha stains on wall due to spitting.jpg|thumb|Red stains of Gutka on walls due to spitting]]
Highly [[drug addiction|addictive]] and a known [[carcinogen]], gutkha is the subject of much controversy in India. Many states have sought to curb its immense popularity by taxing sales of gutkha heavily or by banning it outright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/MP-becomes-1st-state-to-ban-Gutka-products-containing-tobacco/Article1-834532.aspx |title=MP becomes 1st state to ban Gutka products containing tobacco |work=Hindustan Times |date=4 April 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905050300/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/MP-becomes-1st-state-to-ban-Gutka-products-containing-tobacco/Article1-834532.aspx |archivedate=5 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive gutkha use can eventually lead to loss of appetite, promote unusual sleep patterns, and loss of concentration along with other tobacco-related problems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} A gutkha user can easily be identified by prominently stained teeth ranging from yellowish-orange to reddish-black. The stains are difficult to remove by normal brushing and usually need the attention of a dentist {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}. After gutkha is consumed, it is generally spat onto a wall or at the ground, causing a red stain that is quite resistant to the elements.  Some building owners have taken to combating this by painting murals of gods on their walls, with the idea that gutkha chewers would not spit on a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhattasali |first=Amitabha |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-15837262 |title=Scheme to save Calcutta's Howrah Bridge from spit |publisher=BBC News |date=23 November 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutka is a combination of arecanut, slaked lime, paraffin and catechu along with tobacco. Promoted as a mouth freshener, this mixture is a combination of 4,000 chemicals of which at least 40 are carcinogenic compounds, say doctors.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

People get addicted to it as gutka is reported to have stimulant and relaxation effects. While most consumers believe that the blend is not harmful, doctors, especially oncologists, say consumption of gutka is more harmful than any other form of tobacco.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

This is because when a person chews gutka, the mixture directly enters the system through the oral cavity. In the case of smoking, 20%  of the harmful chemicals reach the lungs and 80% is exhaled.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

While narrowing of the blood vessels can cause gangrene, stoppage of blood supply in extreme cases can cause stroke. In women, consumption of gutka during pregnancy can result in low birth weight babies, he says.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

“Overall, people can develop cancers of mouth, throat, lung and oesophagus; heart disease and related ailments. While most youngsters get easily addicted to it, women are in the habit of chewing tobacco or even inhaling snuff, which is even more harmful,”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/gutka-more-harmful-than-other-forms-of-tobacco/article4769653.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage ==
Gutkha use can begin at a very young age. Due to its often flavourful taste, easy availability and low price, it is popular with poor children, who can exhibit precancerous lesions at a very early age as a result. Symptoms of cancer often appear by high school or college age{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. [[convention (norm)|Social custom]] does not permit children in India to smoke cigarettes, so gutkha use, being all but invisible to others, is the method of choice. Gutkha is also used by many as an alternative to cigarettes and is claimed to curb the need to smoke, but eventually becomes another habit tough to quit. Gutkha also causes swallowing problems during night time sleeping leading to dry throat and restless sleep. This may eventually lead to throat cancer in users.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.
In 2008, about 5 million children under 15 were addicted to gutkha{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}. A survey in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh found precursors of mouth cancers in 16% of the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-01-17/lucknow/27782855_1_gutka-tobacco-incidence-of-oral-cancer |title=Kids getting addicted to tobacco |work=The Times of India|date=17 January 2008 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco and gutka chewing makes up the majority of those figures with 48.07% of Indians using them, while bidi and cigarette smokers make up 8.4% and 5.9% of the population respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Patna/Use-of-tobacco-products-to-invite-deterrent-tax-Modi/Article1-952810.aspx |title=Use of tobacco products to invite deterrent tax: Modi |work=Hindustan Times |date=31 October 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818084346/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/patna/Use-of-tobacco-products-to-invite-deterrent-tax-Modi/Article1-952810.aspx |archivedate=18 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Many states of India have banned the sale, manufacture, distribution and storage of gutka and all its variants. As of May 2013, gutka is banned in 24 states and 3 [[Union Territory|union territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_cancer-centres-urge-pm-to-ban-gutka-across-india_1767377 |title=Cancer centres urge PM to ban gutka across India |publisher=DNA India |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The federal Food Safety and Regulation (Prohibition) Act 2011 allows harmful products such as gutka to be banned for a year. This can be renewed annually, resulting in a permanent ban.

Research firm [[Edelweiss Group|Edelweiss]] estimates the gutka ban will cause the industry 15-20&amp;nbsp;billion rupees in losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chandramouli, Rajesh |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-09-14/chennai/33842950_1_gutka-ban-gutkha-tobacco |title=Gutka ban loss could be Rs 1500 - Rs 2000 crores |work=The Times of India|date=14 September 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising====
Like alcohol and tobacco products, there is a ban on advertisement of gutka. Often tobacco companies advertise gutka as [[pan masala]] in order to skirt the ban on advertising tobacco products. Surrogate advertisements often use pan masala ads to promote gutka products with similar name and packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/258543/ban-surrogate-advertisements-tobacco-products.html|title=‘Ban surrogate advertisements of tobacco products’|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations, 2011 of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, misleading advertisement of such products invites a fine of  1,000,000 rupees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-16/bhubaneswar/36373255_1_gutka-and-paan-masala-sale-and-advertisement-anti-tobacco | work=The Times of India | title=No relaxation on gutka ban - The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">'''Hadji Baba Afshar''' (افشار، حاجی بابا in Persian) was one of the first [[medical practitioner]]s in [[Iran]] who studied modern medicine in Europe.

He was sent in 1226/1811 together with a number of others to study medicine and chemistry in England at the expense of the crown prince and under the supervision of Sir [[Harford Jones-Brydges]].
Although he stayed for eight years in England, he did not receive a degree. Upon return he was the court physician under Moḥammad Shah Qaǰar [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ḥ. Maḥbūbī Ardakānī, |title=Afsar, Hajji Baba|work=Encyclopædia Iranica, I/6|page=586|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afsar-hajji-baba-court-physician-under-mohammad-shah-qaar|access-date=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hajji Baba may have been the inspiration for the best-selling novels, The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan (1824) and The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan in England (1828), written by [[James Justinian Morier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Green, N.|year=2015|title=The Love of Strangers: What Six Muslim Students Learned in Jane Austen’s London|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stuart, Ḥāǰǰī Bābā was extremely annoyed at Morier’s use of his name for the title of his novel The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan.&lt;ref&gt;W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1862">The '''Hydrodynamic or Fluid Movement theory''' is one of the main theories in [[dentistry]] to explain the mechanism by which a [[tooth]] perceives the sensation of pain. It is currently the most widely accepted theory used to explain tooth sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartold|first=P. M.|date=September 2006|title=Dentinal hypersensitivity: a review|journal=Australian Dental Journal|volume=51|issue=3|pages=212–218; quiz 276|issn=0045-0421|pmid=17037886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cartwright|first=Richard Bryan|date=March 2014|title=Dentinal hypersensitivity: a narrative review|journal=Community Dental Health|volume=31|issue=1|pages=15–20|issn=0265-539X|pmid=24741888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three main theories of [[Dentin hypersensitivity|dentine hypersensitivity]]:
# Direct Innervation (DI) Theory
# Odontoblast Receptor (OR) Theory
# Fluid Movement/Hydrodynamic Theory
The hydrodynamic theory, first proposed by M. Brännström in 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brännström|first=Martin|title=Sensitivity of dentine|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0030-4220(66)90411-7|journal=Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology|volume=21|issue=4|pages=517–526|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(66)90411-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that dentine hypersensitivity is due to the abrupt movement of fluid within the dentinal tubules in response to cold and heat (thermal), osmotic (e.g. eating sugary foods), mechanical (e.g. chewing) and evaporative stimuli (e.g. air blasts).

Cold, osmotic and evaporative stimuli cause an outward flow of fluid and mechanical and hot stimuli cause an inward flow.

The movement of dentinal fluid leads to mechanical deformation and activation of the sensory nerve terminals of low-threshold [[A delta fiber|Aδ fibres]] located in close contact with [[odontoblasts]]

'''Iliotibial band syndrome''' ('''ITBS''') is a common [[injury]] to the [[knee]], generally associated with [[running]], [[cycling]], [[hiking]] or [[weight training|weight-lifting]] (especially [[Squat (exercise)|squats]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
ITBS symptoms range from a stinging sensation just above the knee and outside of the knee (lateral side of the knee) [[joint]], to swelling or thickening of the tissue in the area where the band moves over the femur. The stinging sensation just above the knee joint is felt on the outside of the knee or along the entire length of the [[Iliotibial tract|iliotibial band]]. Pain may not occur immediately during activity, but may intensify over time. Pain is most commonly felt when the foot strikes the ground, and pain might persist after activity. Pain may also be present above and below the knee, where the ITB attaches to the [[tibia]].

== Causes ==
ITBS can result from one or more of the following: training habits, anatomical abnormalities, or muscular imbalances:

{{Col-begin}}
{{Col-break}}
'''Training habits'''
* Spending long periods of time/regularly sitting in lotus posture in yoga. Esp beginners forcing the feet onto the top of the thighs 
* Consistently running on a horizontally banked surface (such as the shoulder of a road or an [[indoor track]]) on which the downhill leg is bent slightly inward, causing extreme stretching of the band against the femur 
* Inadequate warm-up or cool-down
* Excessive up-hill and down-hill running
* Positioning the feet "[[Pigeon toe|toed-in]]" to an excessive angle when cycling
* Running up and down stairs
* Hiking long distances
* Rowing
* [[Breaststroke]]
* Treading water
{{Col-break}}
'''Abnormalities in leg/feet anatomy'''
* [[pes cavus|High]] or [[flat feet|low arches]]
*[[Supination]] of the foot
* Excessive lower-leg rotation due to over-pronation
* Excessive foot-strike force
* Uneven leg lengths
* [[Genu varum|Bowlegs]] or tightness about the iliotibial band.


'''Muscle imbalance'''
* Weak hip abductor muscles
* Weak/non-firing [[multifidus muscle]]
* Uneven left-right stretching of the band, which could be caused by habits such as sitting cross-legged
{{col-end}}
==Anatomical mechanism==
Iliotibial band syndrome is one of the leading causes of lateral [[knee pain]] in runners. The [[iliotibial tract|iliotibial band]] is a thick band of [[fascia]] on the lateral aspect of the knee, extending from the outside of the [[human pelvis|pelvis]], over the [[hip (anatomy)|hip]] and knee, and inserting just below the knee. The band is crucial to stabilizing the knee during running, as it moves from behind the [[femur]] to the front of the femur during activity. The continual rubbing of the band over the [[Lateral epicondyle of the femur|lateral femoral epicondyle]], combined with the repeated [[flexion]] and extension of the knee during running may cause the area to become inflamed.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of iliotibial band syndrome is based on history and physical exam findings, including tenderness at the lateral femoral epicondyle, where the iliotibial band passes over the bone.

== Treatment ==
While ITBS pain can be acute, the iliotibial band can be rested, iced, compressed and elevated ([[RICE (medicine)|RICE]]) to reduce pain and [[inflammation]], followed by stretching.&lt;ref name=barber92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barber|first1=F. Alan|last2=Sutker |first2=Allan N. |title=Iliotibial Band Syndrome |journal=Sports Medicine|volume=14|issue=2|pages=144–148|doi=10.2165/00007256-199214020-00005 |date=August 1992 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 May 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Physical therapy, and many of its modalities, can offer relief if symptoms arise.

'''Impath''' Inc., a [[New York City|New York]] based [[corporation]], was a provider of [[cancer]] related laboratory services. Impath filed for [[bankruptcy]] protection in September 2003.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2006/01/18/impath-ceo-jailed-cx_gl_0118autofacescan13.html|title=Impath Ex-CEO Jailed On Art, Furniture Expenses|publisher=''[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]]''|date=January 18, 2006|accessdate=2011-04-13|author=Greg Levine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1990s and until 2003, its business withered away, but its executives continued to talk up their stock and the profitability of their impending anti-cancer breakthroughs.

In May 2004, [[Genzyme]] acquired several of Impath's laboratories and cancer-testing technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Milford Daily News |date=05-04-2004 |url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/business/x1528515155 |accessdate=2011-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171223/http://www.milforddailynews.com/business/x1528515155 |archivedate=November 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Genzyme Timeline| url=http://www.genzyme.com/corp/structure/timeline_genz.pdf| accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] took action against former [[CEO]] Anuradha Saad and her colleagues, alleging fraudulent accounting.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;
The same month Saad pleaded guilty to two counts of soliciting proxies containing false statements.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;
It was also alleged that Saad improperly charged $120,000 in personal expenses to Impath.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;
On Tuesday, May 30, 2006, the former president and chief operating officer of Impath, [[Richard P. Adelson]], received a sentence from district court judge [[Jed S. Rakoff]].&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;

The '''Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities''' is a regional [[international human rights instruments|human rights instrument]], adopted in 1999 within the [[Organization of American States]].  It calls on states to facilitate the full integration of persons with [[Disability|disabilities]] into society through [[legislation]], social initiatives and [[educational program]]mes.  It entered into force on 14 September 2001.  

As of 2013, 19 states have [[Ratification|ratified]] the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/juridico/english/sigs/a-65.html OAS, Signatories and Ratifications]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Pepper Community''' ('''IPC''') is an [[intergovernmental organisation]] of states that produce agricultural [[Piper (genus)|pepper]].

In [[Bangkok]] on 16 April 1971, the '''Agreement establishing the International Pepper Community''' was concluded. After this [[treaty]] came into force on 29 March 1972, the IPC was created. IPC headquarters are located in [[Jakarta]], [[Indonesia]].

Six states have ratified the IPC Agreement and are thus full members of the IPC: [[Brazil]] (since 1981), [[India]] (1972), [[Indonesia]] (1972), [[Malaysia]] (1972), [[Sri Lanka]] (2002), and [[Vietnam]] (2005). [[Papua New Guinea]] has not ratified the Agreement but has been admitted to the IPC as an associate member.

}}The '''International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation''' (IPSF) is a [[non-governmental]], non-political and non-religious organisation that represents pharmaceutical students, pharmacy students and recent graduates from all over the world. It was founded in 1949 and it is the oldest faculty-based student organisation. ''IPSF'' represents over 320,000 individuals in more than 80 countries with more than 100 different representative pharmacy student organisations.

Every pharmacy and pharmaceutical student, and recent graduates up to four years after receiving their degree may become a member of the Federation individually, or via a representative organisation of pharmacy students.

The Federation is engaged in the following areas: pharmacy education, public health, professional development, advocacy,  cultural awareness, and partnerships developing pharmacists worldwide.

The IPSF Team is entirely student-run and is composed of more than 150 volunteers;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6IaBnVpg9juQ3l5TVN6aHljMGs|title=IPSF Booklet|publisher=International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation|year=2016|location=Netherlands|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
IPSF holds official relations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/about/collaborations/non-state-actors/in-official-relations/en/|title=Non-State actors in official relations with WHO|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization (WHO)|archive-url=|archive-date=January 2017|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and with the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.unesco.org/partnerships/non-governmental-organizations/international-pharmaceutical-students-federation|title=UNESCO – International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation|date=|website=|publisher=United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPSF works in close collaboration with the [[International Pharmaceutical Federation]] (FIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fip.org/ypg_links|title=IPSF and other YPG Links|date=|website=International Pharmaceutical Federation|publisher=International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPSF Secretariat is supported and hosted by FIP in The Hague, The Netherlands.

==History==
The idea of forming IPSF came in 1948 from then-Secretary of the [[British Pharmaceutical Students' Association]], Stephen B. Challen during the 6th Annual Congress of BPSA. The Constitution of the Federation was agreed and signed on August 25, 1949 in London during the Inaugural Conference, marking the organization's founding date. On the same day, Sidney J. Relph was elected as the first President of IPSF along with 4 other Executive Committee members. The 8 founding countries were [[Austria]], [[Australia]], [[Denmark]] (also voting for [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]), [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]], [[Switzerland]] and [[United Kingdom]].

==Objectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6IaBnVpg9juOUJuSGtEZWRsUE0|title=IPSF Official Documents|publisher=International Pharmaceutical Students' Federation|year=2017|location=Netherlands|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
* Provide opportunities for professional development, education and international exchange;
* Disseminate scientific and professional knowledge;
* Advocate for improvements to pharmaceutical education strategies;
* Encourage the formation and development of national pharmaceutical student organisations without trespassing on their domains;
* Provide a platform for member organisations to exchange knowledge, experience and ideas;
* Strengthen international dialogue and cooperation of the Federation with students, professionals, and governmental and non-governmental organisations;
* Advocate for improvements to health systems;

== How to be a member&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ==
IPSF offers several types of memberships. For organisations, these are:
* ''Member in organisation'' (MiA)
* ''Full Member'' (FM)
Every organisation wishing to join IPSF must first become a Member in Association. If you are interested in becoming a member, you should contact the Chairperson of Internal Relations ask for the Membership Form.

You should then send the completed form along with the organisation's constitution in an official IPSF language (English, Arabic, French and Spanish) to Chairperson of Internal Relations.

Afterwards, the IPSF Treasurer shall send you an invoice for the annual membership fee, which has to be paid at least 12 hours before the annual General Assembly commences (around the late July).

Then, at the General Assembly, your delegation, either in person or via Skype, provides a 5-minute long presentation of the organisation. The presentation is then followed by discussion and secret voting by the General Assembly for the acceptance of your organisation, giving you the status of a Member in organisation.

In order to become a Full Member, the organisation has had to have been a MiA for at least one year while also being nationally representative of pharmacy students in a given country. However, according to IPSF Official Documents, if the national organisation does not wish to attain Full Membership, another organisation of any size from the same country may apply. The application and acceptance procedure is then very much the same as for the MiAs.

IPSF also offers individuals to become part of IPSF on their own, should they so desire. An individual may become one of the following: 
* '''Individual Member''' (IM)
* '''Friend of the Federation''' (FoF)
Individual Membership is reserved for pharmacy and pharmaceutical science students or recent graduates up to four years after graduating from their first degree in pharmacy or pharmaceutical sciences.

On the other hand, any individual who wishes to contribute to the advancement of the aims of the Federation to the best of their capabilities, may become a Friend of the Federation. They are thus considered to be affiliated individuals of the Federation.

Lastly, IPSF also recognizes exceptional individuals who have contributed greatly to the status and the goals of the Federation. These are:
* ''Honorary Life Members'' (HLM)
* ''Alumni''
Honorary Life Members are elected at the annual IPSF World Congress. They must be nominated by two organisations and must be accepted by the General Assembly.

Alumni are, like Friends of the Federation, affiliated individuals of IPSF. To become an Alumni, the individual has to have been one of the following:
* ''Past IPSF Team Member;''
* ''Past IPSF Member Organisation Contact Person or Student Exchange Officer;''
* ''Past IPSF Event attendee''
To be recognized as an Alumnus and if the criteria are met, IPSF Membership Coordinator should be contacted  by the interested individual to receive the Alumni Form.

==Projects==
The Federation runs several projects during the year, mainly on Pharmacy Education, Professional Development, Public Health and on Student Exchange. Some of those projects are made and implemented by IPSF alone, and others depend on the active participation of member organisations.

=== Pharmacy education ===
The Pharmacy Education Portfolio focuses on promoting and developing pharmacy education worldwide, a critical objective of the Federation. A key partner of this portfolio in helping meet its objectives is FIPEd (FIP Education Initiative). The main projects are:

==== Publications ====
The Pharmacy Education Portfolio has two main publications: 
* '''Pharmacy Education Newsletter''' (PEN) – It is the Pharmacy Education Featurette of the IPSF Newsletter. containing updates from the portfolio and articles from students and professionals related to pharmacy education around the world;
* '''Phuture''' – It is the scientific publication of IPSF with the goal of promoting research by providing a platform for students and graduates to publish research articles, abstracts, reviews and commentaries;

==== Competitions ====
The main competitions include the Poster Competition, held during IPSF Official Events, and the Critical Essay competition, held in collaboration with FIPed. Information regarding the posters, such as size, format and subject are shared with the Contact Persons and in the call for abstracts prior the event. This information will also be made available on the IPSF website.

==== Research ====
The Pharmacy Education Portfolio undertakes various research projects. The opportunities may be for direct involvement or for collaborating on sharing and promoting the project.

==== Internships ====
The Federation releases calls for Internships with several partners, such as the World Health Organization, Alliance for Health Promotion, International Pharmaceutical Federation among others. These calls are shared with the Contact Persons and with IPSF students through the website and the Facebook Page. Each call may contain different criteria, as criteria pertains to the specific internship.

=== Professional development ===
IPSF is committed to ensuring quality pharmacy education and promoting the role of the pharmacist. Professional Development involves the process of active participation in formal and informal learning activities that assist individuals in developing and maintaining continuing competence, enhancing their professional practice, supporting achievement of their career goals, and optimizing health outcomes as an integral member of the health professional team.

Through professional skills workshops and competitions, pharmacy awareness campaigns and leadership training opportunities, IPSF strives to enhance the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values required by pharmacy professionals and students for their future practice.

==== Patient Counseling Event ====
The Patient Counselling Event (PCE) aims to demonstrate the importance of communication and counselling skills for pharmacists, increase the awareness of pharmacists as public educators, and encourage and promote the development of the pharmacy profession through an expanded scope of practice.

IPSF held their first Patient Counselling Event at a congress in 1989 and today, the PCE is held at every IPSF World Congress, IPSF Regional Symposia and by many of our member organisations under the Professional Development portfolio. The main objectives for the Patient Counselling Event are to promote training in communication skills, and provide an opportunity for pharmacy students and pharmacists to learn how to effectively interact with patients, determine and address any drug therapy problems and educate patients on many medications and disease states  in a fun and competitive environment.

==== Clinical Skills Event ====
The IPSF Clinical Skills Events (CSE) provide educational opportunities for members from across the globe to enhance and demonstrate their clinical pharmaceutical knowledge. The purpose of this event is to increase pharmacy students' awareness of the importance of the pharmacist's role in direct patient care. Individuals and teams compete by demonstrating their skills in assessing patient information and current therapy, identifying and prioritizing drug therapy problems, identifying treatment goals, and recommending a pharmaceutical care plan.

This activity is an interactive, individual or team-based analysis of clinical scenarios for hospital/health-system pharmacists and is open to all students ranging from first year students to recent graduates.

==== Compounding Event ====
The Compounding Event (CE) was created to highlight the importance and the necessity of compounding skills within the pharmacy profession, especially as we are moving towards personalized medicine in health care. This event was first introduced at the 59th IPSF World Congress in Utrecht, the Netherlands in 2013. The Compounding Event has four main objectives:
# ''To raise awareness about the importance of compounding within the pharmacy profession and quality/security measures regarding the production of compounded pharmaceutical products''
# ''To teach students to recognize that certain patients may have the need for individualized pharmaceutical preparations that may not be readily available''
# ''To provide students with an opportunity to develop their knowledge in designing and preparing compounded pharmaceutical formulations''
# ''To provide pharmacy students with an opportunity to practice their compounding skills in an environment that is conducive to learning''
The CE generally has two levels of difficulty, beginner and advanced, and typically begins with an introductory workshop. Following the workshop, students will be given a case and will be challenged to determine the best method to compound the formulation and prepare a finished product.

==== Pharmacy Profession Advocacy Campaign ====
The Pharmacy Profession Advocacy Campaign (PPAC) is aimed at educating the public, policy makers, and other health care professionals about the role pharmacists play as an integral part of the health care team. It aims to provide insight on the daily functions of pharmacists from various sectors, and to promote awareness of the pharmacy profession at all levels, from students and recent graduates, to the general public.

==== Leaders in Training ====
The IPSF Leaders In Training program aims to impart the necessary leadership and management  skills important for taking up professional roles in the future. The main objective of the LIT program is to equip participants with the skills needed to effectively take on roles of responsibility within the Federation as well as in their professional career. These include global roles in health issues, policy making and the pharmacy profession itself.

From the point of a sustainable all round development of personality, leaders in training tries to impart skills such as general leadership responsibilities, strategic planning, project management, teamwork, time management, communication and public speaking, advocacy, etc.

The trainings are delivered by IPSF’s Certified Trainers, as well as members of the IPSF Executive Committee to ensure enough acquaintance to IPSF. The Leaders in Training program is held every year prior to the IPSF World Congress in addition to some of the IPSF Regional Symposia and also locally within some of our member Organisations.

==== Trainers Development Camp ====
The IPSF Trainers Development Camp aims to develop a high quality and sustainable training program for pharmaceutical students and recent graduates worldwide. In order to maintain our leadership programs to an exceptional standard and provide sustainable future leadership within IPSF we need to produce quality trainers to pass down this information. The IPSF TDC provides participants with a background on experience based learning and equips them with the necessary skills set in order to prepare and conduct trainings. IPSF certified trainers are then able to deliver trainings and workshops within the Leaders in Training program and other educational events (IPSF Regional Symposia, IPSF World Congress, etc.).

=== Public Health ===
IPSF strives to engage member organisations in initiatives that positively influence health and health knowledge within their communities. The Federation plays an active role in promoting and implementing Public Health activities and our work is greatly aided by our collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO). The Federation currently holds six focuses, divided into Health Awareness, Medicine Awareness, and Humanitarian categories.

==== Health awareness section ====

===== HIV/AIDS awareness campaign =====
[[File:IPSF HIV-AIDS Campaign Logo.jpg|thumb|HIV/AIDS Campaign Logo]]In 1987, the World Health Organization (WHO) dedicated December 1 to raising awareness of HIV and the AIDS pandemic.  As a partner of WHO, IPSF organisations across the globe organise each year the HIV/AIDS campaign aimed at spreading awareness about HIV, its transmission as well as the ways of prevention.

===== Tobacco Alert Campaign =====
Along with its partner, the WHO, IPSF celebrates World Tobacco Day the 31 May. During this day, IPSFers educate their society about the consequences of consuming tobacco and derivatives. The goal of the Tobacco Alert campaign, is to make young individuals aware of the dangers of tobacco and involve them in the fight against it in order to decrease the use of tobacco.

===== Healthy Living and Diabetes Campaign =====
The Diabetes and Healthy Living Campaign, launched in August 2005, aims to raise awareness of a healthy lifestyle in the prevention and care of diabetes and to encourage pro-active rather than reactive health promotion. To celebrate World Diabetes Day on November 14, IPSF motivates its organisations to collaborate with interdisciplinary organisations from different medical disciplines in order to plan the campaign. During the campaign, IPSF members put their knowledge into practice in order to inform people about diabetes and the risk factors that can accelerate the affection, as well as the steps that should be undertaken to limit the development of this disease. As part of this Campaign, IPSF participates in Healthy Living activities on World Health Day each April 7. World Health Day was developed during the first World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization on 7 April 1948. In 1950, the Assembly declared this date as World Health Day to mark the World Health Organization’s founding and garner worldwide attention to a particular subject concerning global health.   [[File:IPSF Anti-TB Campaign Logo.jpg|thumb|IPSF Anti-TB Campaign Logo|left]]

===== Tuberculosis awareness campaign =====
In 1996, the WHO joined hands with the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD), and today, the Stop TB partnership has been formed as a network of organisations and countries fighting against TB. The goal of this partnership is to eradicate TB by 2050. IPSF has been a strong advocate of organising this campaign to promote awareness about tuberculosis. On 24 March, referring to the official world TB day, IPSF organisations organise the tuberculosis awareness campaign in their home countries, where they share their knowledge as pharmacists and educate the population on the danger of tuberculosis which is still unknown by many individuals.

==== Medicine awareness section ====

===== Anti-Counterfeit Drug Campaign =====
[[File:Logo ACDC.jpg|thumb|ACDC Logo]]According to a WHO announcement, the existence of substandard, spurious, falsely labelled, falsified and counterfeit (SSFFC) medical products is an unacceptable risk to public health.

The Anti-Counterfeit Drug Campaign (ACDC) works towards helping healthcare students create advocacy campaigns in their countries to help combat the problems of counterfeit and substandard medications. IPSF in collaboration with other stakeholders and organisations tends to act against the unlimited growing of fake medicines by raising awareness and advocacy actions.

===== Medicine Awareness Campaign =====
The Medicine Awareness Campaign's goal is to improve awareness among healthcare students and others about medicines in different aspects. In this portfolio you can find subjects such as Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), rational use of medicines, drug abuse, drug disposal and any other issues related to medicines.

A related campaign is the "Drug disposal campaign", in which IPSF focusses on the effect of unstandardized ways of medicine disposal on environment. Raising awareness among healthcare systems, advocacy campaigns and events for drug disposal in community pharmacies is recommended.[[File:IPSF Humanitarian Campaign Logo.jpg|thumb|Humanitarian Campaign Logo|left|210x210px]]

==== Humanitarian section ====

===== Vampire Cup =====
The Vampire Cup is an international blood donation competition among all the IPSF organisations and it was launched in 2011. By participating in the Vampire Cup, members are building the spirit of inter organisation competition, promoting international relationships, and the most important: saving lives. There are two ways to compete: Regular Vampire Cup and the Live Vampire Cup.

In both cases, the organisations need to submit a registration form and a tracker form by the given deadlines. The Live Vampire Cup occurs on specific days decided by the IPSF team. Traditionally, the days chosen are around World Blood Donor Day, June 14.

==== Advocacy activities ====

===== Executive Board Meeting =====
The WHO Executive Board has 34 members who are technically qualified and are designated by Member States that have been elected to serve by the World Health Assembly. The main functions of the Board are to implement the decisions and policies of the Assembly, and advise and facilitate its work.

During the month of January,  the Executive Board convenes to discuss and agree upon the agenda for the Assembly, and to adopt resolutions which will be considered during the Assembly.

Every year, representatives from IPSF attend the Executive Board Meeting to identify what priority issues will be discussed and to determine where the IPSF can contribute in the development of interventions. It is also through this opportunity that the IPSF can build new connections with different Member State actors.

===== World Health Assembly =====
The [[World Health Assembly]] (WHA) is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization. It is annually attended by delegations from all WHO Member States, as well as Non-State Actors. Furthermore, it focuses on the specific health agenda prepared by the Executive Board.

The main functions of the WHA are: 
* ''To determine the policies of the Organisation;''
* ''To appoint the Director-General;''
* ''To supervise financial policies;''
* ''To review and approve the proposed programme budget.''
Every year, the IPSF calls for its members to be part of the IPSF Delegation to attend the WHA during the month of May in Geneva, Switzerland. The selected members are then orientedand trained on how they can actively participate and effectively engage in deliberations, discussions and events, in order for the IPSF to establish new partnerships and sustain existing connections with various stakeholders, and to develop collaborative projects and programs.

=== Student Exchange Programme ===
Student Exchange Programme (SEP) is IPSF's largest project, offering professional pharmacy internships. Every year, more than 900 students around the world are given the opportunity to experience the field of pharmacy in one of the 65 participating countries.

The Student Exchange Programme therefore enables cultural exchange between pharmacy students around the world by sharing knowledge and experiences.

The 74 member Organisations of IPSF involved in SEP organise the exchanges by finding host sites where the students are trained. The programme runs throughout the year (Winter version and Summer version), but the majority of the exchanges take place between May and September.

The length is usually 1 to 3 months with a minimum of 60 working hours per exchange, and possible host sites include:
* ''Community pharmacy;''
* ''Hospital pharmacy;''
* ''Clinical pharmacy;''
* ''Wholesale pharmacy;''
* ''Pharmaceutical industry;''
* ''Research at university;''
* ''Government or private health agencies.''
The host may also provide room, board and/or pocket money in addition to the training site in order to help the applicant.

The SEP is organised by:
* ''Chairperson of Student Exchange''
* ''Student Exchange Committee''
* ''Student Exchange Officers'' (SEOs): The Student Exchange Officers represent their organisation that is a member of IPSF. The Student Exchange Officers are responsible for arranging host sites and accommodation for the incoming students and finding places for the outgoing students by contacting other SEOs.
* ''Local Exchange Officers'' (LEOs): In some countries, where the National organisation is formed by Local organisations, the SEO shares the work with one or more Local Exchange Officers.
* ''Every pharmacy student and recent graduates'' (up to four years after their graduation) can join SEP through an IPSF Member organisation or as Individual Member, when not eligible to their IPSF Member organisation.
If you are a member of an IPSF member organisation, please contact the IPSF Student Exchange Officer (SEO) of your organisation for more information on the application procedure. For any other information about SEP please visit the website.

== Events ==
The Official Events of the Federation are the World Congress and the Regional Symposia – They happen yearly and are defined two years in advance and they do not overlap. The full costs for participating in the IPSF events are on the participant (Tickets and registration fee).

The Registration Fee is defined by the host, and it cannot be bigger than 45 Euros per day.

The host, after being elected at the General Assembly or Regional Assembly, appoints a Reception Committee (RC) – A committee that will be in charge of organising the event, with the Executive Committee. Near to the event, the RC can appoint a Helping Committee (HC) to add human resources to the work.

The head of the organisation, the “Chairperson of World Congress/Regional Symposium” is co-opted in the Executive Committee/Regional Working Group for the term of the office in which the event will be held.

Other annex events that may happen with World Congress or Regional Symposium are the Leaders in Training and the Post Congress Tour.

=== World Congress ===
The World Congress is the main event of the Federation and usually lasts for 10 days. They have been held yearly since 1961. The first conference happened in London, United Kingdom at 1949, and the first Congress happened in 1957 in Mosney, Ireland.

The first World Congress outside Europe was in the African Regional Office in 1974, in Cape Town, South Africa. The Pan American Regional Office then hosted their first Congress in 1977 in Mexico City, Mexico. The Eastern Mediterranean Region followed with in 1984 in Alexandria, Egypt. The Asia Pacific Regional Office then hosted their first Congress in 2003 in Singapore.

During the World Congress, the activities that must happen are:
* ''Official Opening Ceremony''
* ''General Assembly''
* ''Workshops''
* ''Symposia of scientific and educational nature''
* ''Meetings of committees''
The main activity of the World Congress is the General Assembly, where the elections of the Executive Committee happen, approval of reports, changes to the Official Documents and any matter from the members or Executive Committee take place.

=== Regional Symposia ===
Today, four Regional Offices organise a Regional Symposium yearly, which usually last for 7 days.
* ''African Regional Office'' – African Pharmaceutical Symposium (AfPS)
* ''Asia Pacific Regional Office'' – Asia Pacific Pharmaceutical Symposium (APPS)
* ''Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office'' – Eastern Mediterranean Pharmaceutical Symposium (EMPS)
* ''Pan American Regional Office'' – Pan American Regional Symposium (PARS)
The only obligatory activity of the Regional Symposia are the Regional Assemblies. However, they usually resemble the World Congress.

== IPSF Grants and Development Fund ==
IPSF awards a number of grants throughout the year to help ensure students and member organisations can fully participate in IPSF events despite financial barriers.

Four types of grants are awarded over the year. Two are applied for by member organisations and two are applied for by student members individually. Grants are awarded based on the submitted applications reviewed by the IPSF Treasurer, the Development Fund Coordinator and the Development Fund Committee.

=== Membership Grant ===
The Membership Grant is made available to Full Member organisations and Members in Association who have been members of IPSF for at least one year. Any such organisation facing financial difficulties, if awarded a grant, may have their annual membership fees waived for the year.

An organisation can only apply for the Membership Grant twice every three years, if awarded the organisation is expected to complete at least one IPSF project, excluding SEP, in the 12 months following receipt of the grant. In addition, the organisation is expected to submit an article to be published in an IPSF publication.

=== Project Grant ===
The Project Grant is made available to Full Member Organisations and Members in Association planning to undertake a project or campaign and could benefit from financial assistance.

Appropriate projects are not strictly defined, but they should benefit the members of the applying organisation or the public, and should be relevant to a current IPSF campaign or project.

=== Event Grant ===
The Event Grant is designed to better allow pharmacy students facing financial barriers to attend an IPSF event. Students intending to attend the IPSF World Congress or one of the Regional Symposia should submit an application to the Development Fund Committee.

The criteria for a successful application generally focuses on financial need including, but not limited to, cost of travel, visa, registration fee, personal resources, and World Bank economic classification of applying member’s country.

Successful applicants are expected to submit all relevant receipts and a report detailing their experiences at the IPSF event to the Development Fund Coordinator.

=== SEP Grant ===
The objective of the Student Exchange Grant is to allow pharmacy students with limited financial resources the opportunity to participate in the IPSF Student Exchange Programme.

The SEP Grant may cover part of the travel expenses (bus, train or plane tickets) from the applicant’s home country to the country in which the exchange occurs and the SEP fee. The maximum monetary value of the grant may be 1000 Euro and if the actual costs incurred are less than the awarded grant, only the amount of the actual costs will be paid.

The grant will be paid only after completion of the exchange and submission of the required documents. In addition, the applicant’s student exchange fee will be returned to the respective member organisation or to the applicant in the case of an individual membership

Eligible candidates must be currently studying for their pharmacy undergraduate degree (first pharmacy degree) or recent graduate of their first pharmacy degree (up to four years after the date of their graduation). An applicant may be an IPSF member through an IPSF Member Organisation (Full Member or Member in Association) or as an Individual Member (currently undergraduate or recent graduate of their first pharmacy degree).

All candidates may apply after their AF (application form) is either placed or marked successful in the database.

Grant awardees are expected to complete a report of their SEP experience to be submitted to the Development Fund Coordinator and to the Chairperson of Student Exchange along with relevant receipts of their expenses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6494">The '''Japan Chernobyl Foundation''' (JCF) is an officially-approved Japanese [[non-profit organization]], dedicated to providing humanitarian aid, largely through medical care to children with [[leukemia]] and other illnesses. Established in 1991, the foundation initially provided medical support to Ukrainian and Belarusian victims of the [[Chernobyl disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Japan Chernobyl Foundation (eds)|title=Cherunobuiri kara no dengon（『チェルノブイリからの伝言』）Report from Chernobyl|publisher=Office Mu|isbn=9784900918337|pages=7–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; JCF has also been active in providing medical and humanitarian aid in Iraq since 2004, as well as in Japan in the aftermath of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]], and the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]] of 2011. The headquarters of the Japan Chernobyl Foundation are in [[Matsumoto, Nagano]], Japan. The current JCF Chairman is Dr. Minoru Kamata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraku nammin shien ketsui. |trans-title=Decision for Iraqi Refugee Support |issue=Morning ed. |page=27|work=Shinano Mainichi Shinbun [Shinano Mainichi Newspaper]|date=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and activities==
The Japan Chernobyl Foundation was founded in January 1991 in Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan, under the name ''Nihon Cherunobuiri Rentai Kikin'', or Japan Chernobyl Foundation (JCF), with the primary objective of providing medical support to victims of the 1986 disaster at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. The foundation has been particularly active in supporting screening, research and treatment for pediatric leukemia and thyroid cancer in cooperation with medical professionals at Shinshu University, the National Thyroid Cancer Center in Minsk, and the Gomel State Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Japan Chernobyl Foundation (eds)|title=Cherunobuiri kara no dengon（『チェルノブイリからの伝言』）Report from Chernobyl|publisher=Office Mu|isbn=9784900918337|pages=7–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, a training program was begun to establish a bone marrow transplantation center in Belarus, with JCF providing medical machinery, equipment, and materials to set up and maintain the project.

In 2004, JCF began providing medical aid in Iraq, focusing primarily on pediatric oncology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Kzayer|first1=, Lika’a Fasih Y.|title=Genetic Evaluation of Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Iraq Using FTA Cards|journal=Pediatric Blood Cancer|date=2012|volume=59|page=464|pmid=22238115|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1002/pbc.24055}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has sponsored cytotoxic therapy for children with cancer, as well as blood bank services through the donation of cell separator machines. The foundation has also offered training courses for pediatric oncology staff at sites outside Iraq. With financial support from the Kirin Brewery company, JCF was also able to provide specific medical supplies, such as leukocytosis factor agents for chemotherapy, to Iraq’s Central Teaching Hospital and to the Mansour Children's Welfare Teaching Hospital. Through its concurrent affiliation with the Japan-Iraq Medical Network (JIM-NET), JCF continues to help save the lives of Iraqi children with leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ground Zero|date=June 2004|publisher=Japan Chernobyl Foundation|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the March 11, 2011, Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, which resulted in great damage along the north-eastern coast of Japan, and the subsequent nuclear accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, JCF staff have worked to check radiation levels in affected areas and to monitor foods from the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Genpatsu 30 kiro kennai de shien. |trans-title=Support within the 30km nuclear exclusion zone |issue=Morning ed. |page=32|work=Shinano Mainichi Shinbun [Shinano Mainichi Newspaper]|date=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With aid from the Shinshu University School of Medicine, the foundation has also been able to monitor blood radiation levels and watch for signs of thyroid cancer and leukemia in children, as well as provide psychological care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Houshasei busshitsu no osoroshisa manabu |trans-title=Learning the frightening facts about radioactive materials|issue=Morning ed. |page=3|work=Shimin Taimusu [Shimin Times Newspaper]|date=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after the deterioration of the national security situation in Iraq and the ISIS occupation of Mosul and other Iraqi governorates, JCF launched a new initiative in Iraq to provide medical aid to refugees and other internally displaced people (IDP). The Mart-Shmuni Clinic has been sponsored by JCF since November 2014, with additional help from the government of Japan since March 2015. The initial Mart-Shmuni Clinic was simply a tent, staffed by doctors from among the IDP themselves. Subsequent JCF donation drives have provided sufficient support to establish a proper clinic and provide medicine and other supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gijutsu mochikaereru no ka? |trans-title=Can the technology be taken home? |issue=Morning ed. |page= 26|work=Shinano Mainichi Shinbun [Shinano Mainichi Newspaper]|date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JCF Chairman, Dr. Minoru Kamata, and other JCF-affiliated doctors, nurses and staff members, have made numerous visits to Iraq to provide aid. In addition, one JCF member has been working continually on site with local doctors in Erbil, Iraq, to monitor progress of the project and assess clinical needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraku nammim shien ketsui. |trans-title=Decision for Iraqi Refugee Support |issue=Morning ed. |page=27 |work=Shinano Mainichi Shimbun [Shinano Mainichi Newspaper]|date=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Aitkin''' [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 1770–1790) was a Scottish surgeon.

He is believed to have studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he became [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|MRCS]]. in 1770. In 1779 he is described as surgeon and lecturer on surgery in Edinburgh. Either at that time or later, his lectures included besides the practice of physic, anatomy, [[midwifery]], and chemistry. He appears to have been a successful teacher, and wrote several books, chiefly as text-books for his lectures. They are said, and truly, to ‘contain much valuable information and to be well written;’ but to a reader of the present day they are of little value, having shared the unfortunate fate of most text-books written for purposes of instruction, and having become rapidly superannuated.

John Aitkin made certain practical improvements in surgery. He introduced an alteration in the mode of locking the midwifery forceps. He also invented a flexible blade to the lever. He likewise invented and described in his ‘Essays and Cases in Surgery’ a pair of forceps for dividing and diminishing the stone in the bladder, when too large to remove entire by [[lithotomy]].

His portrait forms the frontispiece to ‘Elements of Physic and Surgery,’ London 1783.

==Works==
He wrote:
* ‘Essays on several important subjects in surgery, chiefly with regard to the nature and cure of fractures,’ London, 1771, 8vo. 
* ‘Essays and Cases in Surgery,’ London, 1775, 8vo. 
* ‘Conspectus Rei Chirurgicæ,’ Edin. 1777, 8vo.

* ‘Elements of the Theory and Practice of Surgery,’ Edin. 1779, 8vo, republished with the ‘Elements of the Theory and Practice of Physic,’ thus forming 2 vols. entitled ‘Elements of the Theory and Practice of Physic and Surgery,’ London, 1783, 8vo (with portrait). 
* ‘Outlines of the Theory and Cure of Fever,’ London, 1781, 12mo. 
* ‘Principles of Midwifery or Puerperal Medicine,’ 1784, 8vo.

The '''Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information''' or '''BIREME''' was founded in [[São Paulo]] in 1967 as the Biblioteca Regional de Medicina&lt;ref&gt;Regional Library of Medicine, hence the acronym&lt;/ref&gt;, a specialized center of the [[Pan-American Health Organization]] (PAHO) / [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref&gt;PIRES-ALVES, Fernando. Informação científica, educação médica e políticas de saúde: a Organização Pan-Americana da Saúde e a criação da Biblioteca Regional de Medicina - Bireme. Ciênc. saúde coletiva, Rio de Janeiro, v. 13, n. 3, June 2008 . Available in &lt;http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S1413-81232008000300012&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&gt;. Access in: 16 mai. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

BIREME coordinates the [[model development]] of the ''[[Virtual Health Library]]'' which includes around 20 million references for the access to the scientific and technical literature of the Latin America and Caribbean region.

== Description ==

The center in the campus of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo – Unifesp (Federal University of São Paulo). Since its foundation in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;SILVA, Márcia Regina Barros da; FERLA, Luis and GALLIAN, Dante Marcello Claramonte. Uma 'biblioteca sem paredes': história da criação da Bireme. Hist. cienc. saude-Manguinhos [online]. 2006, vol.13, n.1, pp. 91-112. ISSN 0104-5970. {{doi|10.1590/S0104-59702006000100006}}. 2 2007&lt;/ref&gt; BIREME is established by the agreement between ''PAHO'', ''Brazilian Ministry of Health'', ''Brazilian Ministry of Education'', ''Secretary of Health of the State of São Paulo'', and ''Unifesp''. Since 2009, the agreement coexists with the process of implementation of the new legal statute approved by the 49th Directing Council of PAHO.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter VHL 094: New statute updates the institutional and operational framework of BIREME ISSN 1809-6859. Available in &lt;http://espacio.bvsalud.org/boletim.php?newsletter=20091116&amp;newsLang=en&amp;newsName=Newsletter%20VHL%20094%2016/November/2009&amp;articleId=11121653200918&gt; Access in: 14 jun. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

BIREME has always met the growing demand for up-to-date scientific literature from the Brazilian health systems and the communities of healthcare researchers, professionals and students. In 1982, its name changed to the current Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information, as to better express its dedication to the strengthening and expansion of the flow of scientific and technical health information across the region, but kept the acronym.

Networking, based on decentralization, on the development of local capacities, on sharing information resources, on developing cooperative products and services, on designing common methodologies, has always been the foundation of BIREME’s technical cooperation work. It has been like this that the center established itself as an international model that fosters professional education with managerial and technical information with the adoption of information and communication paradigms that best meet local needs.

The main foundations that gave origin and which support the existence of BIREME are following:
*access to scientific and technical health information is essential for the development of health;
*the need to develop the capacity of Latin American and Caribbean countries to operate their sources of scientific and technical health information in a cooperative and efficient manner;
*the need to foster the use and to respond to the demands for scientific and technical health information from governments, health systems, educational and research institutions.

'''Latvian Biomedical Research and Study centre''' ('''BMC''') is the scientific institute in molecular biology and biomedicine in [[Latvia]]. Since its establishment in 1993 it has evolved into a scientific centre performing basic as well as applied research in [[molecular genetics]], [[vaccine]] development, [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]], cancer biology, [[immunology]], [[biotechnology]], [[stem cell]] biology, [[Structural biology|structure biology]] and other scientific areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww3.lza.lv/EN/INST/IN12.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://izm.izm.gov.lv/science/5170.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712105418/http://izm.izm.gov.lv/science/5170.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://biomed.lu.lv/en/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.likumi.lv/doc.php?id=131177&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
First in 1993 under leadership of Prof. Elmars Grens Biomedical Research and Study centre of the University of Latvia (LU BMC) was established by merge of several research groups from [[Latvian Academy of Sciences]] (LAS), Molecular Biology Institute of University of Latvia and LAS Microbiology institute. From 2006 BMC is an independent state research institution, but it continues to work in close collaboration with University of Latvia and other universities in scientific and educational areas.
At the beginning scientific personnel of BMC consisted of 45 researchers, that carried out research in fields of molecular virology, nucleic acid chemistry, virus like particles and molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases. In 2000 BMC established long term collaboration with Switzerland company „Cytos Biotechnology” Ltd. concerning research of virus structural gene exploration in order to construct virus like particles that could serve as vaccines or immunomodulating therapeutics. New research area of cancer immunology in BMC developed with investigation of anti-cancer humoral immune response triggering proteins. In 2001 novel collaboration project financed by Latvian Council of Science “Genofond research of population of Latvia and its application for human pathology diagnostics and profilaxis” begun that promoted research of human genetics in Latvia. That led to establishment of Latvian Genome Data Base (LGDB) in 2006. LGDB now contains over 17000 samples that are available for research use for scientists of different research institutes.
After Latvia joined [[European Union]] several projects were undertaken financed by European Structural funds. Significant development of infrastructure took place after financial support from State Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;http://ww3.lza.lv/EN/INST/IN12.HTM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://izm.izm.gov.lv/science/5170.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120712105418/http://izm.izm.gov.lv/science/5170.html |archivedate=2012-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the moment BMC scientific personnel exceeds 100 and main research areas are novel vaccine development, molecular virology, [[human genetics]], epidemiology of infectious diseases, cancer biology and immunology, stem cell biology, structure biology and other fundamental as well as applied scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://biomed.lu.lv/en/research/directions-and-labs/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6302">'''Life hack''' (or '''life hacking''') refers to any trick, shortcut, skill, or novelty method that increases [[productivity]] and [[efficiency]], in all walks of life. The term was primarily used by computer experts who suffer from [[information overload]] or those with a playful curiosity in the ways they can accelerate their workflow in ways other than programming.

The terms ''hack'', ''hacking'', and ''[[Hacker (term)|hacker]]'' have a long history of ambiguity in the [[computing]] and geek communities, particularly within the [[free and open source software]] crowds.

==History==

The original definition of the term "[[Hack (computer science)|hack]]" is "to cut with rough or heavy blows." In the modern vernacular it has often been used to describe an inelegant but effective solution to a specific computing problem, such as quick-and-dirty [[shell scripts]] and other [[command line]] utilities that filtered, [[Mung (computer term)|munged]] and processed data streams like [[e-mail]] and [[RSS feeds]].&lt;ref name="ob int" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cd notes" /&gt; The term was later extended to ''life hack,'' in reference to a solution to a problem unrelated to computers that might occur in a programmer's everyday life. Examples of these types of life hacks might include utilities to synchronize files, track tasks, remind oneself of events, or filter e-mail.

==Popularization==

The term life hack was coined in 2004 during the [[O'Reilly Media|O'Reilly]] Emerging Technology Conference in [[San Diego, California]] by technology journalist [[Danny O'Brien (journalist)|Danny O'Brien]] to describe the "embarrassing" [[scripting language|scripts]] and shortcuts productive IT professionals use to get their work done.&lt;ref name="ob int" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lh presentation" /&gt; After his presentation, use of the term ''life hack'' spread in the tech and [[blogging]] community.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

O'Brien and blogger [[Merlin Mann]] later co-presented a session called "Life Hacks Live" at the 2005 O'Reilly Emerging Technology conference.&lt;ref name="lh live" /&gt; The two also co-author a column entitled "Life Hacks" for O'Reilly's [[Make (magazine)|''Make'' magazine]] which debuted in February 2005.&lt;ref name="Life Hacks Column" /&gt;

The [[American Dialect Society]] voted ''lifehack'' (one word) as the runner-up for "most useful word of 2005" behind ''[[podcast]]''.&lt;ref name="ads" /&gt; The word was also added to the Oxford Dictionaries Online in June 2011.&lt;ref name="digitallife" /&gt;

A recent [[YouTube]] trend has shown viral channels (e.g. '5-Minute Crafts') uploading compilation videos demonstrating 'life hacks', although their use of the term is debatable and they have been criticized by other [[YouTubers]] who have commented on them as being impractical and, at times, nonsensical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">The '''Office on Women's Health''' (OWH) is part of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS) and functions to improve the [[health]] and [[well-being]] of U.S. women and girls. The main headquarters, from which the OWH operate, is located in [[Washington, DC]] with ten other regional women's health coordinators positioned across the country to implement local health initiatives.

== Background ==

The OWH was introduced in 1991 within the DHHS and is directed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for [Women's] Health (DASWH.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Department of Health andHuman Services Office on Women’sHealth (OWH)|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/federal-report/OWHStrategicPlan.pdf|publisher=womenshealth.gov|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The OWH typically work alongside federal [[government agencies]]; associations of [[health care professionals]]; tribal organizations; non-profit charities; consumer groups and state, county and [[local governments]]. Through funding and contracts with these organisations, the OWH is able to administer various strategies and programmes to improve women's health in America and increase awareness.

==Awards and recognition==

A number of campaigns employed by the OWH have gained recognition for their work:
* '[[Best Bones Forever]]!', a campaign encouraging girls to eat more foods with [[calcium]] and [[vitamin D]], received a Public Relations Society of America Silver Anvil Award for Best Government Public Service Campaign.
*'[[National Women’s Health Week]]', a week aimed at increasing awareness about women's health, received a Blue Pencil &amp; Gold Screen Award of Excellence from the National Association of Government Communicators.
* The OWH website, womenshealth.gov, won the Government Customer Support Excellence Award in the Customer Focus Excellence category.
*Womenshealth.gov and girlshealth.gov were ranked as top performers in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards and Recognition|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/about-us/awards-recognition/index.html|publisher=womenshealth.gov|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional Coordinators ==

The role of local coordinators is to comply with national strategy established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and to represent the [[Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health]] by initiating campaigns in their communities. Other responsibilities include identifying regional needs in women's health and implementing activities in health care service delivery, research, and education. The regions are split up in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regional women's health offices and programs|url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/about-us/who-we-are/regional-offices/index.html|publisher=womenshealth.gov|accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Region I – Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont
*Region II – New Jersey, New York, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands (St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John)
*Region III – Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia
*Region IV – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee
*Region V – Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin

'''openEHR''' is an [[open standard]] specification in [[health informatics]] that describes the management and storage, retrieval and exchange of health data in [[electronic health records]] (EHRs). In openEHR, all health data for a person is stored in a "one lifetime", vendor-independent, person-centred EHR. The openEHR specifications include an EHR Extract specification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Specifications Editorial Committee|title=openEHR EHR Extract IM|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/docs/ehr_extract/ehr_extract.html|website=openEHR Foundation|publisher=openEHR Foundation|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are otherwise not primarily concerned with the exchange of data between EHR-systems as this is the focus of other standards such as [[EN 13606]] and [[HL7]].

The openEHR specifications are maintained by the openEHR Foundation, a [[not for profit]] foundation supporting the open research, development, and implementation of openEHR EHRs. The specifications are based on a combination of 15 years of European and Australian research and development into EHRs and new paradigms, including what has become known as the archetype methodology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beale|first=Thomas|year=2002|title=Archetypes: Constraint-based Domain Models for Future-proof Information Systems|url=http://www.openehr.org/files/resources/publications/archetypes/archetypes_beale_oopsla_2002.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the 11th OOPSLA Workshop on Behavioural Semantics|volume=|pages=|via=}} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/openEHR/specifications/blob/master/publishing/architecture/overview.pdf?raw=true |title=openEHR Architecture Overview |publisher=openEHR Foundation |year=2007 |author=S. Heard &amp; T. Beale. (eds.) |accessdate=9 April 2013}} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; for specification of content.

The openEHR specifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=openEHR Specification Program|title=openEHR Specifications|url=http://www.openehr.org/programs/specification/releases/currentbaseline|publisher=openEHR Foundation|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; include information and service models for the EHR, demographics, clinical workflow and [[archetype (information science)|archetype]]s. They are designed to be the basis of a medico-legally sound, distributed, versioned EHR infrastructure.

==Architecture==
[[File:Openehr block diagram.png|thumb|Block diagram of openEHR specification components.]]
The architecture of the openEHR specifications as a whole consists of the following key elements:

* information models (aka 'Reference Model');
* the archetype formalism;
* the portable archetype query language;
* service models / APIs.

The use of the first two enable the development of 'archetypes' and 'templates', which are formal models of clinical and related content, and constitute a layer of ''de facto'' standards of their own, far more numerous than the base specifications on which they are built. The query language enables queries to be built based on the archetypes, rather than physical database schemata, thus decoupling queries from physical persistence details. The service models define access to key back-end services, including the EHR Service and Demographics Service, while a growing set of lightweight REST-based APIs based on archetype paths are used for application access.

The openEHR Architecture Overview provides a summary of the architecture and the detailed specifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/architecture_overview.html|title=openEHR Architecture Overview|website=openEHR Foundation|publisher=openEHR Foundation|last1=openEHR Specification Program|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reference model==
A central part of the openEHR specifications is the set of information models, known in openEHR as 'reference models'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/docs/index|title=openEHR Reference Model|publisher=openEHR Foundation|last1=openEHR Specification Program|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The models constitute the base information models for openEHR systems, and define the invariant semantics of the Electronic Health Record (EHR), EHR Extract, and Demographics model, as well as supporting data types, data structures, identifiers and useful design patterns.

Some of the key classes in the EHR component are the ENTRY classes, whose subtypes include OBSERVATION, EVALUATION, INSTRUCTION, ACTION and ADMIN_ENTRY, as well as the Instruction State Machine, a state machine defining a standard model of the lifecycle of interventions, including medication orders, surgery and other therapies.

==Archetypes and multi-level modelling==
A key innovation in the openEHR framework is to leave all specification of clinical information out of the [[information model]] (also known as "reference model") and instead to provide a powerful means of expressing definitions of the content clinicians and patients need to record that can be directly consumed at runtime by systems built on the Reference Model. This is justified by the need to deal scalably with the generic problem in health of a very large, growing, and ever-changing set of information types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/AM/latest/Overview.html#_business_purpose_of_archetypes|title=Archetype Technology Overview|website=openEHR Foundation|publisher=openEHR Foundation|last1=openEHR Specification Program|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical content is specified in terms of two types of artefact which exist outside the information model. The first, known as "[[Archetype (information science)|archetypes]]" provides a place to formally define re-usable data point and data group definitions, i.e. content items that will be re-used in numerous contexts. Typical examples include "systemic arterial blood pressure measurement" and "serum sodium". Many such data points occur in logical groups, e.g. the group of data items to document an allergic reaction, or the analytes in a liver function test result. Some archetypes contain numerous data points, e.g. 50, although a more common number is 10-20. A collection of archetypes can be understood as a "library" of re-usable domain content definitions, with each archetype functioning as a "governance unit", whose contents are co-designed, reviewed and published.

The second kind of artefact is known in openEHR as a "template", and is used to logically represent a use case-specific data-set, such as the data items making up a patient discharge summary, or a radiology report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openehr.org/what_is_openehr|title=What is openEHR |publisher=openEHR Foundation |accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A template is constructed by referencing relevant items from a number of archetypes. A template might only require one or two data points or groups from each archetype. In terms of the technical representation, openEHR templates cannot violate the semantics of the archetypes from which they are constructed. Templates are almost always developed for local use by software developers and clinical analysts. Templates are typically defined for [[GUI]] screen forms, message definitions and document definitions, and as such, correspond to "operational" content definitions.

The justification for the two layers of models over and above the information model is that if data set definitions consist of pre-defined data points from a library of such definitions, then all recorded data (i.e. instances of templates) will ultimately just be instances of the standard content definitions. This provides a basis for standardised querying to work. Without the archetype "library" level, every data set (i.e. chunk of operational content) is uniquely defined and a standard approach to querying is difficult.

Accordingly, openEHR defines a method of querying based on archetypes, known as AQL (Archetype Querying Language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/QUERY/latest/docs/index|title=Archetype Query Language (AQL)|publisher=openEHR Foundation|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, openEHR has been used to model shared care plan. The archetypes have been designed to accommodate the concepts of the shared care plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagglund|first=M|author2=Chen, R. |author3=Koch, S |title=Modeling shared care plans using CONTsys and openEHR to support shared homecare of the elderly|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association|date=2011|volume=18|issue=1|pages=66–69|doi=10.1136/jamia.2009.000216|pmid=21106993|pmc=3005865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While individual health records may be vastly different in content, the core information in openEHR data instances always complies to archetypes. The way this works is by creating archetypes which express clinical information in a way that is highly reusable, even universal in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openehr.org/entry_points/i_am_working_on/clinical_standardisation|title=Clinical Standardisation|publisher=openEHR Foundation| accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archetype formalism===
openEHR archetypes are expressed in "Archetype Definition Language", an openEHR public specification. Two versions are available: ADL 1.4,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archetype Definition Language 1.4|date=12 Dec 2008|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/AM/latest/docs/index|postscript=.|publisher=openEHR Foundation|editor-last=Beale|editor2-last=Heard|editor-first=T|editor2-first=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ADL 2,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archetype Definition Language 2|date=3 Nov 2015|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/AM/latest/docs/index|author=openEHR Specification Program|publisher=openEHR Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new release with better support for specialisation, redefinition and annotations, among other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openehr.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ADL/ADL+2+Specifications|title=ADL/AOM 2 specifications|publisher=openEHR Foundation|accessdate=3 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1.4 release of ADL and its "object model" counterpart Archetype Object Model (AOM) are the basis for the CEN and ISO "Archetype Definition Language" standard ([[ISO/TC 215|ISO standard 13606-2]]).

Templates have historically been developed in a simple, de facto industry-developed XML format, known as ".oet", after the file extension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/1.0.2/its/XML-schema/Template.xsd|title=Template ".oet" XSD|publisher=openEHR Foundation|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADL 2 defines a way to express templates seamlessly with archetypes, using extensions of the ADL language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=openEHR Specification Program|title=Archetype Definition Language (ADL2) specification|url=http://www.openehr.org/releases/AM/latest/docs/ADL2/ADL2.html#_templates|website=openEHR Foundation|publisher=openEHR Foundation|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality assurance of archetypes===
Various principles for developing archetypes have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/openEHR/specifications/blob/master/publishing/architecture/am/archetype_principles.pdf?raw=true |title=Archetype definitions and principles |publisher=openEHR Foundation |year=2005 |author=S. Heard &amp; T. Beale. (eds.) |accessdate=9 April 2013}} (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a set of openEHR archetypes needs to be quality managed to conform to a number of axioms such as being mutually exclusive. The archetypes can be managed independently from software implementations and infrastructure, in the hands of clinician groups to ensure they meet the real needs on the ground. Archetypes are designed to allow the specification of clinical knowledge to evolve and develop over time. Challenges in implementation of information designs expressed in openEHR centre on the extent to which actual system constraints are in harmony with the information design.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

In the field of [[Electronic health record]]s there are a number of existing information models with overlaps in their scope which are difficult to manage, such as between [[HL7|HL7 V3]] and [[SNOMED CT]].  The openEHR approach faces harmonisation challenges unless used in isolation.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==International collaboration==
Following the openEHR approach, the use of shared and governed archetypes globally would ensure openEHR health data could be consistently manipulated and viewed, regardless of the technical, organisational and cultural context. This approach also means the actual data models used by any EHR are flexible, given that new archetypes may be defined to meet future needs of clinical record keeping. Recently work in Australia has demonstrated how archetypes and templates may be used to facilitate the use of legacy health record and message data in an openEHR health record system, and output standardised messages and CDA documents.

The prospect of gaining agreement on design and on forms of governance at the international level remains speculative, with influences ranging from the diverse medico-legal environments to cultural variations, to technical variations such as the extent to which a [[SNOMED CT|reference clinical terminology]] is to be integral.

The openEHR Framework is consistent with the Electronic Health Record Communication Standard ([[ISO 13606]]), and the Archetype Object Model 2 (AOM2) has been officially accepted by ISO TC 215 as the draft specification for the 2017 revision of ISO 13606:2.

== International adoption ==
openEHR archetypes are being used by the [http://www.nehta.gov.au/ National e-Health Transition Authority of Australia], the UK NHS [http://www.hscic.gov.uk/home Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)], the Norwegian [http://www.nasjonalikt.no/no/ Nasjonal IKT organisation], and the Slovenian Ministry of Health.

openEHR has been selected as the basis for the standardised EHR in Brazil [http://bvsms.saude.gov.br/bvs/saudelegis/gm/2011/prt2073_31_08_2011.html].

It is beginning to be utilised in commercial solutions throughout the world, including those produced by the [http://www.openehr.org/industry_partners/index openEHR Industry Partners].

==Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM)==
One of the outcomes of openEHR modelling approach is the open development of archetypes, templates and terminology subsets to represent health data. Due to the open nature of openEHR, these structures are publicly available to be used and implemented in health information systems. Community users are able to share, discuss and approve these structures in a collaborative repository known as the Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM). Some currently used openEHR CKMs:

'''Ordinaire''' is a [[wine bar]], wine shop, and [[bistro]]-style restaurant in [[Oakland, California]]. Located on Grand Avenue in the [[Grand Lake, Oakland, California|Grand Lake District]], Ordinaire had its grand opening in September 2013. Ordinaire only sells [[natural wine]], [[organic wine|produced from organic grapes]] with minimal chemical and technological intervention. Owner Bradford Taylor opened Ordinaire while pursuing a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with a [[Thesis|dissertation]] on the sense of [[taste]] in early 20th century [[Literary modernism|modernist literature]]. Taylor is also an organizer of an annual natural wine festival in Oakland called Brumaire, which has held events at Ordinaire.

In addition to selling and serving wine, Ordinaire serves small plates and periodically partners with chefs to open as a [[pop-up restaurant]] called '''Bistro Ordinaire'''. Food and wine critics have praised Ordinaire for its [[Wine list|selection of wines]] and [[Hip (slang)|hip]] yet unpretentious atmosphere. Amid a wave of interest in natural wine in the United States, Ordinaire has helped to establish Oakland as a natural wine hub. The shop has been described as an important site for natural wine culture within the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], and the United States as a whole.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor has said "there's something productive about how nebulous the term 'natural' is, how it opens itself up to debate every time it comes up,"&lt;ref name="Mobley shrine" /&gt; and:

{{quote|I like the term natural wine. Yes, it is big and baggy, and only loosely fits around the products, processes, communities, and worlds it is meant to contain. Finding a "perfect" word to describe all that is never going to happen, and thank god. I especially like that the term annoys people, which just means that it is language doing what it is supposed to do, making people uncomfortable, forcing us all to question the concepts by which we define ourselves and the objects around us. I think that natural wines do this on a very base, visceral level—so there's a [[Signified and signifier|signifier-signified]] coalescence I find very pleasing. I'll add that I fucking hate when people claim that natural wine is some sort of subjective term that has no meaning. That's always a sign they are trying to get away with something. But then that can spark a useful conversation, too, I suppose.&lt;ref name="Michelman" /&gt;}}

Taylor chose the location because it was less expensive than many of the city's other, better-established commercial districts; he also said he "thought it was ridiculous that this part of Oakland didn't have a shop that was an alternative to [[Trader Joe's]] and [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]]."&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

Jordan Michelman wrote in the wine blog ''[[Sprudge]]'':

{{quote|In its multi-kit [[wiktionary:Swiss Army knife|Swiss Army approach]]—equal parts wine bar and wine shop, local hang and serious destination—Ordinaire exists in a state of mind-boggling multiplicity. It is, at once, one of North America's best natural wine retail destinations; a chill hang; an industry hub for Northern California's booming young wine scene; a fine place to take or hold a meeting; a street-facing outdoor lounge; an example of how good wine can taste when it's served on tap; home to one of the great natural wine fridges known to man; a bottle shop in which you get drunk; and a bar at which you'd be foolish not to leave with a bottle. Regulars call it "The Shop"—a master compliment of understatement.&lt;ref name="Michelman" /&gt;}}

Local news site ''Berkeleyside'' recommended Ordinaire as a natural wine merchant, noting "[y]es, it has a young and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]]-y vibe, but there's zero [[snob]]bery," and called it "one of our country’s greatest wine bars."&lt;ref name="Casey" /&gt; Pamela S. Busch wrote for ''The San Francisco Examiner'' that Ordinaire was worth visiting from San Francisco: "I'd come back here even if it was a [[wiktionary:hole-in-the-wall|hole-in-the-wall]] — but it is not. Ordinaire is sophisticated without being pretentious, and this carries over to the ambiance. I wish it was closer to, if not in, San Francisco, but I get that Oakland needs to have wine bars of this caliber as well. No matter where you live in the Bay Area, Ordinaire is worth the trip."&lt;ref name="Busch worthwhile" /&gt; ''Saveur'' editor Chris Cohen praised the selection, atmosphere, and affordability, writing "I usually dislike drinking wine out—something about seeing a wine listed for triple what I would pay in a store rubs me the wrong way. Ordinaire does things much more civilly: they're also a retail operation, and for $10 corkage they'll open anything in the shop for on-premises consumption."&lt;ref name="Saveur" /&gt; Esther Mobley at the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that domestic and foreign natural wines were well-represented in Ordinaire's selection, but "[i]f it all sounds too [[wiktionary:crunchy granola|crunchy-granola]] for you, there's also excellent normal-tasting wine here: [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet]] from [[Cathy Corison|Corison]]; [[Champagne]] from Bérèche et Fils and Laherte Freres champagne." Adding that Ordinaire had "great" wines at a variety of price points, Mobley continued: "In the spirit of La Verre Volé, Ordinaire is spare, unpolished, even a little disheveled: Open boxes lie along the walls; magazines are piled on the bench of a wooden piano. It's relaxing, like you're in someone's living room. Pours are not stingy, and unsolicited top-offs are not uncommon."&lt;ref name="Mobley shrine" /&gt;

Marissa A. Ross, the wine columnist for ''Bon Appétit'', is an avowed fan of Ordinaire. In her 2017 book ''Wine. All the Time.: The Casual Guide to Confident Drinking'', Ross wrote "I trust my favorite wine shops so much you would assume I was of blood relation to their owners. Places like Domaine LA, Lou, or Ordinaire know me better than I know myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on natural wine for ''Bon Appétit'' co-written by Ross and Belle Cushing, the two opined: "A natural wine bar—whether it's Ordinaire in Oakland or Sub Rosato in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond, VA]]—is a modern version of ''[[Cheers]]'', with hand-harvested pinots instead of pints. And even if [[Where Everybody Knows Your Name|no one knows your name]] (yet), you might recognize some labels on the wall—a sign that you're among friends."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Pahutoxin''', formerly called '''ostracitoxin''', is a [[neurotoxin]] present in  the mucous secretions of [[boxfish]] ([[Ostraciidae]]) skin, while under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/146/3641/244|title=Ostracitoxin: An Ichthyotoxic Stress Secretion of the Boxfish, Ostracion lentiginosus|author=Donald A. Thomson | doi=10.1126/science.146.3641.244|volume=146|journal=Science|pages=244–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an [[ichthyotoxic]], [[hemolytic]], nonpeptide (which is relatively unusual, although similar to [[tetrodotoxin]] in this way) toxin. It is heat-stable and non-[[dialyzable]], that is, foamed in aqueous solutions, and is toxic to various biological systems. It is unique among known fish poisons. It is toxic to other boxfish as well and looks like red tide and [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]] toxins in general properties. Although it is not recommended, it is a growing trend to keep boxfish in a home aquarium. Members of the family Ostraciidae secrete an ichthyotoxic mucus from their skin when stressed or disturbed.

The boxfish must be alive to synthesize its bodily chemicals into the toxin, therefore it cannot release its toxin after it dies. It may, however, have residual toxin if it were in the process of releasing toxin when it died.

'''Potassium-40''' ('''&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K''') is a [[radioactive isotope]] of [[potassium]] which has a very long [[half-life]] of 1.251{{e|9}} years. It makes up 0.012% (120 [[parts-per notation|ppm]]) of the total amount of potassium found in nature.

Potassium-40 is a rare example of an isotope that undergoes both types of [[beta decay]].  About 89.28% of the time, it decays to [[calcium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ca) with emission of a [[beta particle]] (β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, an [[electron]]) with a maximum energy of 1.31&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|MeV]] and an [[antineutrino]]. About 10.72% of the time it decays to [[argon-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar) by [[electron capture]], with the emission of a 1.460 MeV [[gamma ray]]&lt;ref&gt;This photon would be called an [[x-ray]] if emitted from an electron. In nuclear physics, it is common to name photons according to their origin rather than their energy, high energy photons produced by electrical transitions are called "x-rays" while those emitted from atomic nuclei are called "[[gamma rays]]" irrespective of their energy.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[neutrino]]. The radioactive decay of this particular isotope explains the large abundance of argon (nearly 1%) in the earth's atmosphere, as well as its abundance compared to &lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Ar. Very rarely (0.001% of the time) it will decay to &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar by emitting a [[positron]] (β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and a neutrino.&lt;ref name=Engelkemeir&gt;

==Potassium–argon dating==
[[File:Potassium-40-decay-scheme.svg|thumb|Decay scheme]]
Potassium-40 is especially important in [[K–Ar dating|potassium–argon (K–Ar) dating]]. Argon is a gas that does not ordinarily combine with other elements. So, when a [[mineral]] forms – whether from molten [[rock (geology)|rock]], or from substances dissolved in water – it will be initially argon-free, even if there is some argon in the liquid. However, if the mineral contains any potassium, then decay of the &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K isotope present will create fresh argon-40 that will remain locked up in the mineral. Since the rate at which this conversion occurs is known, it is possible to determine the elapsed time since the mineral formed by measuring the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K and &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar atoms contained in it.

The argon found in Earth's atmosphere is 99.6% &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar; whereas the argon in the Sun – and presumably in the primordial material that condensed into the planets – is mostly [[Argon-36|&lt;sup&gt;36&lt;/sup&gt;Ar]], with less than 15% of &lt;sup&gt;38&lt;/sup&gt;Ar. It follows that most of the terrestrial argon derives from potassium-40 that decayed into argon-40, which eventually escaped to the atmosphere.

==Contribution to natural radioactivity==

[[File:Evolution of Earth's radiogenic heat.svg|thumb|right|The evolution of Earth's mantle radiogenic heat flow over time: contribution from &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K in yellow.]]

The radioactive decay of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K in the Earth's mantle ranks third, after [[Thorium-232|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th]] and [[Uranium-238|&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U]], as the source of [[radiogenic heat]].  The core also likely contains radiogenic sources, although how much is uncertain.  It has been proposed that significant core radioactivity (1-2 TW) may be caused by high levels of U, Th, and K.&lt;ref name="WohlersWood2015"&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is the largest source of natural radioactivity in animals including humans. A 70&amp;nbsp;kg human body contains about 140 grams of potassium, hence about 0.000117&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;140&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.0164&amp;nbsp;grams of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K; whose decay produces about 4,300 disintegrations per second ([[becquerel]]s) continuously throughout the life of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The number of radioactive decays per second in a given mass of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is the number of atoms in that mass, divided by the average lifetime of a &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K atom in seconds. The number of atoms in one gram of &lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K is [[Avogadro's number]] 6.022{{e|23}} (the number of atoms per [[Mole (unit)|mole]]) divided by the [[atomic weight]] of potassium-40 (39.96 grams per mole), which is about 0.1507{{e|23}} per gram.  As in any [[exponential decay]], the average lifetime is the half-life divided by the [[natural logarithm]] of 2, or about 56.82{{e|15}} seconds.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Samat&gt;

Progesterone has a variety of important functions in the body. It is also a crucial [[metabolic intermediate]] in the production of other endogenous [[steroid]]s, including the [[sex hormone]]s and the [[corticosteroid]]s, and plays an important role in brain function as a [[neurosteroid]].&lt;ref name="pmid11108866"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baulieu E, Schumacher M | title = Progesterone as a neuroactive neurosteroid, with special reference to the effect of progesterone on myelination | journal = Steroids | volume = 65 | issue = 10–11 | pages = 605–12 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11108866 | doi = 10.1016/s0039-128x(00)00173-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is used as a [[medication]], for instance in [[menopausal hormone therapy]]; for information on progesterone as a medication, see the [[progesterone (medication)]] article.

Progesterone modulates the activity of [[cation channels of sperm|CatSper]] (cation channels of sperm) [[voltage-gated ion channel|voltage-gated]] Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels.

==Biological function==

===Hormonal interactions===
Progesterone has a number of physiological effects that are amplified in the presence of [[estrogen]]s.

Elevated levels of progesterone potently reduce the sodium-retaining activity of aldosterone, resulting in natriuresis and a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone.&lt;ref name="pmid13263410"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Landau RL, Bergenstal DM, Lugibihl K, Kascht ME | title = The metabolic effects of progesterone in man | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 1194–215 | date = October 1955 | pmid = 13263410 | doi = 10.1210/jcem-15-10-1194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Progesterone converts the [[endometrium]] to its secretory stage to prepare the uterus for implantation. At the same time progesterone affects the [[vaginal epithelium]] and [[Cervix#Cervical mucus|cervical mucus]], making it thick and impenetrable to [[sperm]].

Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation does not occur and the [[corpus luteum]] does not develop, levels of progesterone may be low, leading to [[Dysfunctional uterine bleeding#Anovulatory DUB|anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding.]]
* During implantation and [[gestation]], progesterone appears to decrease the maternal [[immune system|immune]] response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy.
* Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine [[smooth muscle]].&lt;ref name="colostate"/&gt;
* In addition progesterone inhibits [[lactation]] during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production.
* A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]].

The [[fetus]] [[metabolize]]s placental progesterone in the production of [[adrenal]] steroids.

====Lobuloalveolar development====
Progesterone plays an important role in [[breast development]] in women. In conjunction with [[prolactin]], it mediates [[mammary alveolus|lobuloalveolar]] maturation of the [[mammary gland]]s during pregnancy to allow for [[milk production]] and thus [[lactation]] and [[breastfeeding]] of [[offspring]] following [[parturition]] (childbirth).&lt;ref name="pmid22844349"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Macias H, Hinck L | title = Mammary gland development | journal = Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Developmental Biology | volume = 1 | issue = 4 | pages = 533–57 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22844349 | pmc = 3404495 | doi = 10.1002/wdev.35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Estrogen]] induces expression of the PR in breast tissue and hence progesterone is dependent on estrogen to mediate lobuloalveolar development.&lt;ref name="HaslamOsuch2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CoadDunstall2011" /&gt; It has been found that {{abbrlink|RANKL|Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand}} is a critical downstream mediator of progesterone-induced lobuloalveolar maturation.&lt;ref name="HiltonGraham2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hilton HN, Graham JD, Clarke CL | title = Minireview: Progesterone Regulation of Proliferation in the Normal Human Breast and in Breast Cancer: A Tale of Two Scenarios? | journal = Molecular Endocrinology | volume = 29 | issue = 9 | pages = 1230–42 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26266959 | doi = 10.1210/me.2015-1152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RANKL [[knockout mice]] show an almost identical mammary phenotype to PR knockout mice, including normal mammary ductal development but complete failure of the development of lobuloalveolar structures.&lt;ref name="HiltonGraham2015" /&gt;

===Skin health===
The [[estrogen receptor]], as well as the [[progesterone receptor]], have been detected in the [[human skin|skin]], including in [[keratinocyte]]s and [[fibroblast]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid12762829"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raine-Fenning NJ, Brincat MP, Muscat-Baron Y | title = Skin aging and menopause : implications for treatment | journal = American Journal of Clinical Dermatology | volume = 4 | issue = 6 | pages = 371–8 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12762829 | doi = 10.2165/00128071-200304060-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16120154"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Holzer G, Riegler E, Hönigsmann H, Farokhnia S, Schmidt JB, Schmidt B | title = Effects and side-effects of 2% progesterone cream on the skin of peri- and postmenopausal women: results from a double-blind, vehicle-controlled, randomized study | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 626–34 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16120154 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2005.06685.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[menopause]] and thereafter, decreased levels of female [[sex hormone]]s result in [[atrophy]], thinning, and increased [[wrinkling]] of the skin and a reduction in skin [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], firmness, and strength.&lt;ref name="pmid12762829" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16120154" /&gt; These skin changes constitute an acceleration in [[Human skin#Aging|skin aging]] and are the result of decreased [[collagen]] content, irregularities in the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[epidermis (skin)|epidermal]] [[skin cell]]s, decreased [[ground substance]] between [[skin fiber]]s, and reduced [[capillary|capillaries]] and [[blood flow]].&lt;ref name="pmid12762829" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16120154" /&gt; The skin also becomes more [[dry skin|dry]] during menopause, which is due to reduced skin [[tissue hydration|hydration]] and [[sebum|surface lipids]] (sebum production).&lt;ref name="pmid12762829" /&gt; Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging.&lt;ref name="pmid12762829" /&gt;

===Sexuality===

====Libido====
{{See also|Sexual motivation and hormones}}
Progesterone and its [[neurosteroid]] [[active metabolite]] [[allopregnanolone]] appear to be importantly involved in [[libido]] in females.&lt;ref name="King2012"&gt;{{cite book | first = Steven R. | last = King | name-list-format = vanc | title = Neurosteroids and the Nervous System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D1fOTC6CP3kC&amp;pg=PA44|date=9 November 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-5559-2|pages=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homosexuality====
Dr. [[Diana Fleischman]], of the [[University of Portsmouth]], and colleagues examined the relationship between progesterone and sexual attitudes. Their research was published in the [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.port.ac.uk/uopnews/2014/11/25/homosexuality-may-help-us-bond/ Homosexuality may help us bond University of Portsmouth UoP News]&lt;/ref&gt; They found that women who have higher levels of progesterone are more likely to be open to the idea of engaging in sexual behaviour with other women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/11251206/Having-homosexual-thoughts-is-an-essential-part-of-human-evolution-study-suggests.html Having homosexual thoughts 'is an essential part of human evolution' study suggests The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel pattern of openness to homosexual behaviour is particularly dramatic in men who have high levels of progesterone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/26/homosexuality-evolution-social-bonding_n_6218406.html Homosexuality May Have Evolved In Humans Because It Helps Us Bond, Scientists Say Huff Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nervous system===
Progesterone, like [[pregnenolone]] and [[dehydroepiandrosterone]] (DHEA), belongs to an important group of endogenous steroids called [[neurosteroid]]s. It can be metabolized within all parts of the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="pmid558037"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I, Karavolas HJ, Goy RW | title = Progesterone metabolism in the pineal, brain stem, thalamus and corpus callosum of the female rat | journal = Brain Research | volume = 125 | issue = 2 | pages = 313–24 | date = April 1977 | pmid = 558037 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(77)90624-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurosteroids are [[neuromodulator]]s, and are [[neuroprotective]], [[neurogenic]], and regulate [[neurotransmission]] and [[myelin]]ation.&lt;ref name="pmid15135772"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schumacher M, Guennoun R, Robert F, Carelli C, Gago N, Ghoumari A, Gonzalez Deniselle MC, Gonzalez SL, Ibanez C, Labombarda F, Coirini H, Baulieu EE, De Nicola AF | title = Local synthesis and dual actions of progesterone in the nervous system: neuroprotection and myelination | journal = Growth Hormone &amp; IGF Research | volume = 14 Suppl A | issue =  | pages = S18-33 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15135772 | doi = 10.1016/j.ghir.2004.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of progesterone as a neurosteroid are mediated predominantly through its interactions with non-nuclear PRs, namely the mPRs and [[PGRMC1]], as well as certain other receptors, such as the σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and nACh receptors.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

===Aging===
Since most progesterone in males is created during testicular production of [[testosterone]], and most in females by the [[ovaries]], the shutting down (whether by natural or chemical means), or removal, of those inevitably causes a considerable reduction in progesterone levels. Previous concentration upon the role of progestogens in female reproduction, when progesterone was simply considered a "female hormone", obscured the significance of progesterone elsewhere in both sexes.

The tendency for progesterone to have a regulatory effect, the presence of progesterone [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s in many types of body tissue, and the pattern of deterioration (or [[tumor]] formation) in many of those increasing in later years when progesterone levels have dropped, is prompting widespread research into the potential value of maintaining progesterone levels in both males and females.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Brain damage===
{{See also|Progesterone (medication)#Brain damage}}
Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to [[traumatic brain injury]] and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of [[estrogen]] and progesterone in females.&lt;ref name="pmid10833057"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roof RL, Hall ED | title = Gender differences in acute CNS trauma and stroke: neuroprotective effects of estrogen and progesterone | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 367–88 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10833057 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2000.17.367 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proposed mechanism====
The mechanism of progesterone protective effects may be the reduction of inflammation that follows brain trauma and hemorrhage.&lt;ref name="pmid18188998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pan DS, Liu WG, Yang XF, Cao F | title = Inhibitory effect of progesterone on inflammatory factors after experimental traumatic brain injury | journal = Biomedical and Environmental Sciences | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 432–8 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 18188998 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmcid27143417"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang C, Zuo F, Wang Y, Wan J, Yang Z, Lu H, Chen W, Zang W, Yang Q, Wang J | title = Progesterone exerts neuroprotective effects and improves long-term neurologic outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage in middle-aged mice | journal = Neurobiology of Aging | volume = 42 | issue =  | pages = 13–24 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27143417 | pmc = 4857017 | doi = 10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.02.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass [[depolarization]] leading to [[excitotoxicity]]. One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]]s that trigger [[neurotransmitter]] release.&lt;ref name="pmid22101209"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luoma JI, Stern CM, Mermelstein PG | title = Progesterone inhibition of neuronal calcium signaling underlies aspects of progesterone-mediated neuroprotection | journal = The Journal of Steroid Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 131 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 30–6 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22101209 | pmc = 3303940 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2011.11.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does so by manipulating the signaling pathways of [[transcription factor]]s involved in this release. Another method for reducing the excitotoxicity is by up-regulating the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]], a widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor.&lt;ref name="pmcid2699575"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein DG | title = Progesterone exerts neuroprotective effects after brain injury | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 386–97 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 17826842 | pmc = 2699575 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainresrev.2007.06.012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progesterone has also been shown to prevent [[apoptosis]] in neurons, a common consequence of brain injury.&lt;ref name="pmid22088981"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Espinoza TR, Wright DW | title = The role of progesterone in traumatic brain injury | journal = The Journal of Head Trauma Rehabilitation | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 497–9 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22088981 | doi = 10.1097/HTR.0b013e31823088fa }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does so by inhibiting enzymes involved in the apoptosis pathway specifically concerning the mitochondria, such as activated [[caspase 3]] and [[cytochrome c]].

===Addiction===
{{See also|Progesterone (medication)#Addiction}}
Progesterone enhances the function of [[serotonin receptor]]s in the brain, so an excess or deficit of progesterone has the potential to result in significant neurochemical issues. This provides an explanation for why some people resort to substances that enhance [[serotonin]] activity such as [[nicotine]], [[alcohol]], and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] when their progesterone levels fall below optimal levels.&lt;ref name="Lynch_Sofuoglu_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lynch WJ, Sofuoglu M | title = Role of progesterone in nicotine addiction: evidence from initiation to relapse | journal = [[Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 451–61 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 21186920 | pmc = 3638762 | doi = 10.1037/a0021265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sex differences in hormone levels may induce women to respond differently than men to nicotine. When women undergo cyclic changes or different hormonal transition phases (menopause, pregnancy, adolescence), there are changes in their progesterone levels.&lt;ref name="pmid22474108"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cosgrove KP, Esterlis I, McKee SA, Bois F, Seibyl JP, Mazure CM, Krishnan-Sarin S, Staley JK, Picciotto MR, O'Malley SS | title = Sex differences in availability of β2*-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in recently abstinent tobacco smokers | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 4 | pages = 418–27 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22474108 | pmc = 3508698 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.1465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, females have an increased biological vulnerability to nicotine’s reinforcing effects compared to males and progesterone may be used to counter this enhanced vulnerability.

* Similar to nicotine, cocaine also increases the release of dopamine in the brain. The neurotransmitter is involved in the reward center and is one of the main neurotransmitters involved with substance abuse and reliance. In a study of cocaine users, it was reported that progesterone reduced craving and the feeling of being stimulated by cocaine. Thus, progesterone was suggested as an agent that decreases cocaine craving by reducing the dopaminergic properties of the drug.&lt;ref name="pmid21796112"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mello NK, Knudson IM, Kelly M, Fivel PA, Mendelson JH | title = Effects of progesterone and testosterone on cocaine self-administration and cocaine discrimination by female rhesus monkeys | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 36 | issue = 11 | pages = 2187–99 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 21796112 | pmc = 3176575 | doi = 10.1038/npp.2011.130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biochemistry==

===Biosynthesis===
[[File:Steroidogenesis.svg|thumb|right|500px|[[Steroidogenesis]], showing progesterone among the progestogens in yellow area.&lt;ref name="HäggströmRichfield2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Richfield|first2=David|year=2014|title=Diagram of the pathways of human steroidogenesis|journal=WikiJournal of Medicine|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.15347/wjm/2014.005|issn=2002-4436|last1=Häggström|first1=Mikael}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In mammals, progesterone, like all other [[steroid]] [[hormone]]s, is synthesized from [[pregnenolone]], which itself is derived from [[cholesterol]].

Cholesterol undergoes double oxidation to produce [[22R-hydroxycholesterol|22''R''-hydroxycholesterol]] and then [[20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol|20α,22''R''-dihydroxycholesterol]]. This vicinal [[diol]] is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C22 to produce pregnenolone. This reaction is catalyzed by [[cytochrome]] [[P450scc]].

The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3β-[[hydroxyl]] group is oxidized to a [[ketone|keto]] group and second, the [[double bond]] is moved to C4, from C5 through a keto/[[enol]] [[tautomer]]ization reaction.&lt;ref name="isbn0-471-49641-3"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Bewick PM | title = Medicinal natural products: a biosynthetic approach | edition = | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 2002 | origyear = | pages = 244 | quote = | isbn = 0-471-49641-3 | oclc = | doi = | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reaction is catalyzed by [[3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase|3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ&lt;sup&gt;5-4&lt;/sup&gt;-isomerase]].

Progesterone in turn is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid [[aldosterone]], and after conversion to [[17α-hydroxyprogesterone]], of [[cortisol]] and [[androstenedione]]. Androstenedione can be converted to [[testosterone]], [[estrone]], and [[estradiol]].

Pregnenolone and progesterone can also be synthesized by [[yeast]].&lt;ref name="pmid9487528"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Duport C, Spagnoli R, Degryse E, Pompon D | title = Self-sufficient biosynthesis of pregnenolone and progesterone in engineered yeast | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 186–9 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9487528 | doi = 10.1038/nbt0298-186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 30&amp;nbsp;mg of progesterone is secreted from the ovaries per day in women, while the adrenal glands produce about 1&amp;nbsp;mg of progesterone per day.&lt;ref name="LemkeWilliams2012 p1397"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas L.

In women, progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the [[menstrual cycle]], rise after [[ovulation]], and are elevated during the [[luteal phase]], as shown in diagram below. Progesterone levels tend to be less than 2&amp;nbsp;ng/mL prior to ovulation, and greater than 5&amp;nbsp;ng/mL after ovulation. If [[pregnancy]] occurs, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is released maintaining the corpus luteum allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. Between 7 to 9&amp;nbsp;weeks the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus luteum, this process is named the luteal-placental shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Csapo AI, Pulkkinen MU, Wiest WG | year = 1973 | title = Effects of lutectomy and progestreone replacement therapy in early pregnancy patients | url = | journal = Am J Obstet Gynecol | volume = 115 | issue = | pages = 759–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the luteal-placental shift progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100 to 200&amp;nbsp;ng/mL at term. Whether a decrease in progesterone levels is critical for the initiation of [[labor (childbirth)|labor]] has been argued and may be species-specific.

===Sources===

====Animal====
Progesterone is produced in high amounts in the [[ovaries]] (by the [[corpus luteum]]) from the onset of [[puberty]] to [[menopause]], and is also produced in smaller amounts by the [[adrenal gland]]s after the onset of [[adrenarche]] in both males and females. To a lesser extent, progesterone is produced in [[nervous tissue]], especially in the brain, and in [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]], as well.

During human [[pregnancy]], progesterone is produced in increasingly high amounts by the ovaries and [[placenta]]. At first, the source is the corpus luteum that has been "rescued" by the presence of [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] (hCG) from the conceptus. However, after the 8th week, production of progesterone shifts to the placenta. The placenta utilizes maternal cholesterol as the initial substrate, and most of the produced progesterone enters the maternal circulation, but some is picked up by the fetal circulation and used as substrate for fetal corticosteroids. At term the placenta produces about 250&amp;nbsp;mg progesterone per day.

An additional animal source of progesterone is milk products. After consumption of milk products the level of bioavailable progesterone goes up.&lt;ref name="titleResult Content View"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/852571020057CCF6852573B1007803AD | title = Milk products are a source of dietary progesterone | accessdate = 2008-03-12 |vauthors=Goodson III WH, Handagama P, Moore II DH, Dairkee S | date = 2007-12-13 | format = | work = | publisher = 30th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium | pages = abstract # 2028 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Plants ====
In at least one plant, ''[[Juglans regia]]'', progesterone has been detected.&lt;ref name="pmid20108949"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauli GF, Friesen JB, Gödecke T, Farnsworth NR, Glodny B | title = Occurrence of progesterone and related animal steroids in two higher plants | journal = Journal of Natural Products | volume = 73 | issue = 3 | pages = 338–45 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20108949 | doi = 10.1021/np9007415 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, progesterone-like [[steroid]]s are found in ''[[Dioscorea mexicana]]''. ''Dioscorea mexicana'' is a plant that is part of the [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] family native to [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="pmid12255132"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Applezweig N | title = Steroids | journal = Chemical Week | volume = 104 | issue =  | pages = 57–72 | date = May 1969 | pmid = 12255132 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a steroid called [[diosgenin]] that is taken from the plant and is converted into progesterone.&lt;ref name="pmid16946542"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Noguchi E, Fujiwara Y, Matsushita S, Ikeda T, Ono M, Nohara T | title = Metabolism of tomato steroidal glycosides in humans | journal = Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 54 | issue = 9 | pages = 1312–4 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16946542 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.54.1312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Diosgenin and progesterone are also found in other ''[[Dioscorea]]'' species, as well as in other plants that are not closely related, such as [[fenugreek]].

Another plant that contains substances readily convertible to progesterone is ''[[Dioscorea pseudojaponica]]'' native to [[Taiwan]]. Research has shown that the Taiwanese yam contains [[saponin]]s — steroids that can be converted to diosgenin and thence to progesterone.&lt;ref name="pmid14558759"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang DJ, Lu TJ, Hwang LS | title = Isolation and identification of steroidal saponins in Taiwanese yam cultivar (Dioscorea pseudojaponica Yamamoto) | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 51 | issue = 22 | pages = 6438–44 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14558759 | doi = 10.1021/jf030390j }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other ''Dioscorea'' species of the yam family contain steroidal substances from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are ''[[Dioscorea villosa]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea polygonoides]]''. One study showed that the ''Dioscorea villosa'' contains 3.5% diosgenin.&lt;ref name="pmid15513824"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Final report of the amended safety assessment of Dioscorea Villosa (Wild Yam) root extract | journal = International Journal of Toxicology | volume = 23 Suppl 2 | issue =  | pages = 49–54 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15513824 | doi = 10.1080/10915810490499055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dioscorea polygonoides]]'' has been found to contain 2.64% diosgenin as shown by [[gas chromatography-mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Diosgenin quantification by HPLC in a Dioscorea polygonoides tuber collection from colombian flora | year = 2007 | journal = Journal of the Brazilian Chemical Society | pages = 1073–1076 | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | doi = 10.1590/S0103-50532007000500030 |vauthors=Niño J, Jiménez DA, Mosquera OM, Correa YM }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the ''Dioscorea'' species that originate from the yam family grow in countries that have tropical and subtropical climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Properties of starches in yam (Dioscorea spp.) tuber | year = 2005 | journal = Current Topics in Food Science and Technology | pages = 105–114 | isbn = 81-308-0003-9 |vauthors=Myoda T, Nagai T, Nagashima T | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis===

====Semisynthesis 1====
An economical [[semisynthesis]] of progesterone from the plant steroid [[diosgenin]] isolated from yams was developed by [[Russell Earl Marker|Russell Marker]] in 1940 for the [[Parke-Davis]] pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref name="Marker1940"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Marker RE, Krueger J | title = Sterols.

Additional semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids. For the example, [[cortisone]] can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in [[chloroform]] to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone.&lt;ref name="pmid3815593"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Numazawa M, Nagaoka M, Kunitama Y | title = Regiospecific deoxygenation of the dihydroxyacetone moiety at C-17 of corticoid steroids with iodotrimethylsilane | journal = Chemical &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 9 | pages = 3722–6 | date = September 1986 | pmid = 3815593 | doi = 10.1248/cpb.34.3722 | url = http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=cpb1958&amp;cdvol=34&amp;noissue=9&amp;startpage=3722 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20121209004311/http://www.journalarchive.jst.go.jp/english/jnlabstract_en.php?cdjournal=cpb1958&amp;cdvol=34&amp;noissue=9&amp;startpage=3722 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Total synthesis====
[[File:Progesterone Synthesis.png|thumb|right|450px|The Johnson total synthesis of progesterone.&lt;ref name="pmid5131151"/&gt;]]
A [[total synthesis]] of progesterone was reported in 1971 by [[William Summer Johnson|W.S. Johnson]].&lt;ref name="pmid5131151"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson WS, Gravestock MB, McCarry BE | title = Acetylenic bond participation in biogenetic-like olefinic cyclizations. II. Synthesis of dl-progesterone | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 93 | issue = 17 | pages = 4332–4 | date = August 1971 | pmid = 5131151 | doi = 10.1021/ja00746a062 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis begins with reacting the [[phosphonium salt]] '''&lt;u&gt;7&lt;/u&gt;''' with [[organolithium reagent|phenyl lithium]] to produce the [[phosphonium ylide]] '''&lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;'''. The ylide '''&lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;''' is reacted with an [[aldehyde]] to produce the [[alkene]] '''&lt;u&gt;9&lt;/u&gt;'''. The [[ketal]] [[protecting group]]s of '''&lt;u&gt;9&lt;/u&gt;''' are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone '''&lt;u&gt;10&lt;/u&gt;''', which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone '''&lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt;'''. The ketone of '''&lt;u&gt;11&lt;/u&gt;''' is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol '''&lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;''', which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation '''&lt;u&gt;13&lt;/u&gt;'''. The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of '''&lt;u&gt;13&lt;/u&gt;''' in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce '''&lt;u&gt;14&lt;/u&gt;'''. This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as ''biomimetic''. In the next step the [[enol]] [[orthoester]] is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone '''&lt;u&gt;15&lt;/u&gt;'''. The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce '''&lt;u&gt;16&lt;/u&gt;'''. Finally, the diketone '''&lt;u&gt;17&lt;/u&gt;''' undergoes an intramolecular [[aldol condensation]] by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone.&lt;ref name="pmid5131151"/&gt;

Milford|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, at the time of the Second International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in [[London, England]], a compromise was made between the groups and the name progesterone (progestational steroidal ketone) was created.&lt;ref name="Josimovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen1970"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen WM | title = Progesterone: how did the name originate? | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 10 | pages = 1151–5 | date = October 1970 | pmid = 4922128 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-197010000-00012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterinary use ===
The use of progesterone in tests dog breeding to pinpoint ovulation is becoming more widely used.  There are several tests available but the most reliable test is a blood test with blood drawn by a veterinarian and sent to a lab for processing.  Results can usually be obtained with 24 to 72 hours.  The rationale for using progesterone tests is that increased numbers begin in close proximity to preovulatory surge in gonadotrophins and continue through ovulation and estrus.  When progesterone levels reach certain levels they can signal the stage of estrus the female is.  Prediction of birth date of the pending litter can be very accurate if ovulation date is known.  Puppies deliver with a day or two of 9 weeks gestation in most cases.  It is not possible to determine pregnancy using progesterone tests once a breeding has taken place however.  This is due to the fact that, in dogs, progestrone levels remain elevated throughout the estrus period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Refsal|first=Kent | name-list-format = vanc |date=February 2009|title=Interpretation of Serum Progesterone Results for Management of Breeding in Dogs|url=https://www.dcpah.msu.edu/sections/endocrinology/Progesterone_Guidelines.pdf|journal=WEBCD.ENDO.REF|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- New health law in Spain --&gt;
The '''Spanish National Health System''' ({{lang-es|Sistema Nacional de Salud}}, '''SNS''') is the agglomeration of public health services that has existed in [[Spain]] since it was established through and structured by the ''Ley General de Sanidad'' (the "General Health Law") of 1986. Management of these services has been progressively transferred to the distinct autonomous communities of Spain, while some continue to be operated by the National Institute of Health Management (''[[Instituto Nacional de Gestión Sanitaria]]'', INGESA), part of the [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health and Social Policy]] (which superseded the Ministry of Health and Consumer Affairs—''Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo''—in 2009). The activity of these services is harmonized by the [[Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health Service]] (''Consejo Interterritorial del Servicio Nacional de Salud de España'', CISNS) in order to give cohesion to the system and to guarantee the rights of citizens throughout Spain.

Article 46 of the ''Ley General de Sanidad'' establishes the fundamental characteristics of the SNS:

* a. Extension of services to the entire population.
* b. Adequate organization to provide comprehensive health care, including promotion of health, prevention of disease, treatment and rehabilitation.
* c. Coordination and, as needed, integration of all public health resources into a single system.
* d. Financing of the obligations derived from this law will be met by resources of public administration, contributions and fees for the provision of certain services.
* e. The provision of a comprehensive health care, seeking high standards, properly evaluated and controlled.&lt;ref&gt;
* a. La extensión de sus servicios a toda la población.
* b. La organización adecuada para prestar una atención integral a la salud, comprensiva tanto de la promoción de la salud y prevención de la enfermedad como de la curación y rehabilitación.
* c. La coordinación y, en su caso, la integración de todos los recursos sanitarios públicos en un dispositivo único.
* d. La financiación de las obligaciones derivadas de esta Ley se realizará mediante recursos de las Administraciones públicas, cotizaciones y tasas por la prestación de determinados servicios.
* e. La prestación de una atención integral de la salud procurando altos niveles de calidad debidamente evaluados y controlados.

== Antecedents to the SNS in Spain ==
Public intervention in collective health problems has always been of interest to governments and societies, especially in the control of [[epidemic]]s through the establishment of naval [[quarantine]]s, the closing of city walls and prohibitions on travel in times of [[Plague (disease)|plague]], but also in terms of hygienic and palliative measures. [[Al-Andalus]]—[[Muslim]]-ruled medieval Spain—was distinguished by its level of medical knowledge relative to the rest of Europe, particularly among the physicians of the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]]. In the years after the ''[[Reconquista]]'', the ''Real Tribunal del Protomedicato'' regulated the practice of medicine in Spain and in its colonies. However, the system of medical faculties at the various universities was very decentralized. Surgery and pharmacy were quite separate from medicine and were considerably less prestigious; the systems of [[Galen]] and [[Hippocrates]] dominated medical practice during most of the era of the ''[[Antiguo Régimen]]''.

Medicine was one of the principal fields of activity for the ''[[novatores]]'' of the late 17th century, but their initiatives were individualized and localized. There is some continuity from their work to the broader work during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], such as through the [[Colegio de Cirugía de San Carlos]] ("San Carlos College of Surgery") in [[Madrid]]. At the beginning of the 19th century, the [[Balmis Expedition]] (1803) to administer the [[smallpox vaccine]] throughout the Spanish colonies was a [[public health]] undertaking of unprecedented geographical scope.

[[File:Real Expedición Filantrópica de la Vacuna 01.svg|thumb|left|The [[Balmis Expedition]] of 1803 was a public health undertaking of unprecedented geographical scope.]]
The [[Cádiz Cortes]] debated a sanitary code (the ''Código Sanitario de 1812''), but nothing was approved due to lack of scientific and technical consensus about the actions to be undertaken. During the [[bienio progresista]], the Law of 28 November 1855 established the basis for a General Health Directorate (''Dirección General de Sanidad''), which was created a few years later and which would last into the 20th century. The Royal Decree of 12 January 1904 approved the General Health Instruction (''Instrucción General de Sanidad''), which altered little of the 1855 scheme besides the name; the name would later change to [[General Inspectorate of Health]] (''Inspección General de Sanidad'').

After the [[Spanish Civil War]], the ''Ley de Bases de 1944'' perpetuated this . The Law of 14 December 1942 create a system of obligatory [[health insurance]] under the already extant National Insurance Institute (''Instituto Nacional de Previsión'', INP). The system was based on a percentage tax linked to employment. This was further modified by the General Law of Social Security (''Ley General de la Seguridad Social'') in 1974, toward the end of the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;Decreto 2065/1974, de 30 de mayo&lt;/ref&gt; Social Security had taken on an increasing number of diseases within its package of services, as well as covering a larger number of individuals and communities.

The General Health Law (''Ley General de Sanidad'') of 25 April 1986 and the creation of Health Councils (''Consejerías de Sanidad'') and a Ministry of Health, fulfilled the mandate of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], in particular Articles 43 and 49 which made protection of health a right of all citizens, and Title VIII, which foresaw that purview over matters of health would devolve to the [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/aeboe/consultas/bases_datos/doc.php?coleccion=iberlex&amp;id=1986/10499 Ley 14/1986, de 25 de abril, General de Sanidad], ''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado|BOE]]'' number 102 of 1986-04-29, pages 15207–15224. (Text of the law, in Spanish.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Laws regulating the Spanish National Health System ==

=== The General Health Law of 1986 ===

The General Health Law of 1986 (''Ley 14/1986 General de Sanidad'') was formulated on two bases. First, it carries out a mandate of the Spanish Constitution, whose articles 43 and 49 establish the right of all citizens to protection of their health. The law recognizes a right to health services for all citizens and for foreigners resident in Spain.

Second, Title VIII of the Constitution confers upon the autonomous communities broad purview in matters of health and health care. The autonomous communities have first-order importance in this area, and the law permits devolution of these functions from the central government to the autonomous communities, in order to provide a health care system sufficient for the needs of their respective jurisdictions. Article 149.1.16 or the Constitution, a further basis for the present law, establishes substantive principles and criteria  that allow general and common characteristics to be consistent throughout the new system, providing a common basis for health services throughout Spanish territory.

The administrative device set up by the law is the National Health System. The presumption underlying the adopted model is that in each autonomous community, authorities are adequately equipped with necessary territorial perspective, so that the benefits of autonomy do not conflict with the needs of management efficiency.

{{quote|The National Health System is thus conceived as the set of health services of the Autonomous Communities properly coordinated.&lt;ref&gt;''El Sistema Nacional de Salud se concibe así como el conjunto de los servicios de salud de las Comunidades Autónomas convenientemente coordinados.'' - Preamble to the General Health Law of 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, the various health services fall under the responsibility of the respective autonomous communities, but also under basic direction and coordination by the central state. The respective health services of the autonomous communities would gradually realize a transfer of health resources from the central government to the autonomous communities.

===Law of Cohesion and Quality (2003)===
The General Health Law was complemented in 2003 by the Law of Cohesion and Quality of the National Health System (''Ley 16/2003 de cohesión y calidad del Sistema Nacional de Salud''), which maintained the basic lines of the General Health Law, but modified and broadened the articulation of that law to reflect existent social and political reality. By 2003, all of the autonomous communities had gradually assumed purview in matters of health and had established stable models to finance the assumed purview. Meanwhile, in the 17 years since the original law, Spanish society had undergone many cultural, technological and socioeconomic changes that affected people's ways of life and affected the country's patterns of disease and illness. These posed new challenges to the National Health System.

Therefore, the 2003 law establishes coordination and cooperation of public health authorities as a means to ensure citizens the right to health protection, with the common goal of ensuring equity, quality and social participation National Health System. The law defines a core set of functions common to all of the autonomous health services. Without interfering with the diversity of forms of organization, management and services inherent in a decentralized system, it attempts to establish certain basic, common safeguards throughout the country. This law attempts to establish collaboration of public health authorities with respect to benefits provided, pharmacy, health professionals, research, health information systems, and the overall quality of the health system.

Toward these ends, the law created or empowered several specialized organs and agencies, all of which are open to the participation of the autonomous communities. Among these are the Agency of Evaluation of Technologies (''Agencia de Evaluación de Tecnologías'', Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Products (''Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios''), the Human Resources Committee (''Comisión de Recursos Humanos''), the Committee to Assess Health Research (''Comisión Asesora de Investigación en Salud''), the [[Charles III Institute of Health]] (''Instituto de Salud Carlos III''), the Institute of Health Information (''Instituto de Información Sanitaria''), the Quality Agency of the National Health System (''Agencia de Calidad del Sistema Nacional de Salud'') and the Observatory of the National Health System (''Observatorio del Sistema Nacional de Salud'').

The basic organ of cohesion is the Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health Service (''Consejo Interterritorial del Servicio Nacional de Salud de España''), which has great flexibility in decision making, as well as mechanisms to build consensus and to bring together the parties taking such decisions. A system of inspection, the ''Alta Inspección'', assures that accords are followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Royal Decree-Law of Urgent Measures to Guarantee the Sustainability of the Sistema Nacional de Salud and Improve the Quality and Security of its Prestations (2012) ===
The Royal Decree-Law 16/2012&lt;ref&gt;Available online at http://boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2012-5403&lt;/ref&gt; was introduced on April 20, 2012. It puts into law severe cuts in the Spanish National Health System, including the following:
* Refusal to give assistance to unregistered foreigners (in effect from September 1, 2012). This hasn't been applied by all the [[Comunidad autónoma|comunidades autónomas]].
* Increase of the percentage of medicines paid by the user:&lt;ref&gt;http://boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-2012-5403. Article 2, section Trece. Checked on March 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Senior citizens didn't pay for medicines before the reform, but now they pay 10% (limited to €8/month if their income is ≤€18,000 a year, €18/month if their income is &gt;€18,000 and ≤€100,000 a year, or €60/month if their income is &gt;€100,000 a year).
** Workers now pay 40% if their income is ≤€18,000 a year, 50% if their income is &gt;€18,000 and ≤€100,000 a year, or 60% if their income is &gt;€100,000 a year.
&lt;!-- It would be great to put this on a table --&gt;

== Governing agencies ==

=== Ministry of Health and Social Policy ===
[[File:Fachada del Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo.jpg|thumb|upright|Seat of the [[Ministry of Health and Social Policy (Spain)|Ministry of Health and Social Policy]]]]

The [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Ministry of Health and Social Policy]] develops the policies of the [[Government of Spain]] in matters of health, in planning and delivery of services, as well as exercising the purview of the [[General Administration of the State (Spain)|General Administration of the State]] to assure citizens the right to protection of their health. The ministry has its headquarters on the [[Paseo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]], across the street from the [[Museo del Prado]].

The Royal Decree 1041/2009 of 29 June lays out the basic organic structure of the Spanish Ministry of Health and Social Policy. From the date of that decree, the new ministry assumed the functions of, and superseded the former Ministry of Health and Consumption (''Ministerio de Sanidad y Consumo'') and Secretary of State for Social Policy, Family, and Attention to Dependency and Disability (''Secretaría de Estado de Política Social, Familia y Atención a la Dependencia y a la Discapacidad'').

The objective of this reorganization is to reinforce the role of the single ministry as the instrument of cohesion for the National Health System (SNS), adding to the portfolio of the Secretary General of Health purview in matters of the quality of the SNS by adding to it the Agency of Quality of the National Health System (''Agencia de Calidad del Sistema Nacional de Salud'') and the General Directorate of Advanced Therapies and Transplants (''Dirección General de Terapias Avanzadas y Trasplantes'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health Service===
[[File:Calendario común de vacunación infantil. España 2016.png|thumb|Childhood [[vaccination]] calendar, promoted by the CISNS.]]
The General Health Law of 1986 created the Interterritorial Council of the Spanish National Health Service (''Consejo Interterritorial del Servicio Nacional de Salud'', CISNS) as the organ of general coordination in matters related to health between the central State and the autonomous communities who were given authority in health matters under that law. It is jointly composed, and coordinates the basic lines of health policy in matters affecting contracts; acquisition of health and pharmaceutical products, as well as other related goods and services; as well as basic health personnel policies.

The 2003 Law of Cohesion and Quality of the SNS introduced significant changes in the composition, functioning, and purview of the CISNS. Under this law, the CISNS functions variously as a plenary body, by delegated committees, through technical commissions, and through work groups. It meets as a plenary body at the initiative of its president or at the initiative of one-third of its members; plenary meetings occur at least four times a year. To some extent, this is a formality: resolutions from CISNS commissions are typically adopted by consensus. Cooperation agreements to conduct joint health actions are formalized in CISNS agreements.

Under the Law of Cohesion, CISNS functions mainly through the adoption of and compliance with joint accords, through the political use of the plenary sessions, with each member making an uncompromising defense of the interests of its region.

Presentations, committees, and working groups have been very important, some more than others. Important committees include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Public Health Committee (''Comisión de Salud Pública'')
* Permanent pharmacy committee (''Comisión permanente de farmacia'')
* Scientific-technical committee of the National Health System (''Comisión científico-técnica del sistema Nacional de Salud'')
* Committee to monitor the health cohesion fund (''Comisión de seguimiento del fondo de cohesión sanitaria'')
* Permanent committee on insurance, funding, and benefits (''Comisión permanente de aseguramiento, financiación y prestaciones'')
* Committee against gender violence (''Comisión contra la violencia de género'')
* Transplant committee (''Comisión de trasplantes'')

Articles 69, 70  and 71 of the Law of Cohesion regulate the principal  functions of the Interterritorial Council of the SNS. The principal aspects of the Interterritorial Council are:

The Interterritorial Council is constituted by the Minister of Health and Consumer Affairs [now of Health and Social Policy], who holds its presidency, and by the Councilors with purview over matters of health of the autonomous communities. The vicepresidency of the body will be fulfilled by one of the Councilors with purview over matters of health of the autonomous communities, elected by all of the Councilors who make up the body.&lt;ref&gt;''El Consejo Interterritorial está constituido por el Ministro de Sanidad y Consumo, que ostentará su presidencia, y por los Consejeros competentes en materia de sanidad de las comunidades autónomas. La vicepresidencia de este órgano la desempeñará uno de los Consejeros competentes en materia de sanidad de las comunidades autónomas, elegido por todos los Consejeros que lo integran.'' (from Article 70 of the Ley de cohesión y calidad de SNS.)&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The CISNS will come to know, debate among other things, and, as appropriate, make recommendations on the following matters:
 
* a) The development of the portfolio of services corresponding to the Catalog of Services of the National Health System, as well as its actualization.
* b) The establishment of health services complementary to the basic services of the National Health System on the part of the autonomous communities.
* c) Minimal guarantees of safety and quality for the authorization of the opening and placing into function of the health centers, services and establishments.
* d) The general and common criteria for the development of collaboration between pharmacy offices.
* e) The basic criteria and conditions of the convocations of professionals to assure their mobility throughout the State.
* f) Declaration of the necessity to realize coordinated actions in matters of public health to which this law refers.
* g) General criteria for the public financing of medicines, medical products and their variables. &lt;!-- if someone can clarify "variables" here, please do." --&gt;
* h) Establishment of criteria and mechanisms in order to guarantee at all times the financial sufficiency of the system.

[[File:Comunidades autónomas de España.svg|thumb|Map of the [[autonomous communities of Spain]].]]
The prior functions shall be exercised without prejudice to the legislative purview of the [[Cortes Generales]] and, as appropriate, the norms of the General Administration of the State; likewise the normal developmental, executive and organizational purview of the autonomous communities.&lt;ref&gt;
''El CISNS conocerá, debatirá entre otros aspectos, y, en su caso, emitirá recomendaciones sobre las siguientes materias:''
 
* ''a) El desarrollo de la cartera de servicios correspondiente al Catálogo de Prestaciones del Sistema Nacional de Salud, así como su actualización. ''
* ''b) El establecimiento de prestaciones sanitarias complementarias a las prestaciones básicas del Sistema Nacional de Salud por parte de las comunidades autónomas. ''
* ''c) Las garantías mínimas de seguridad y calidad para la autorización de la apertura y puesta en funcionamiento de los centros, servicios y establecimientos sanitarios. ''

=== Purview of the autonomous communities in matters of health ===

Article 41 of the General Health Law establishes that:
* The autonomous communities exercise the purview assumed in their [[Statute of Autonomy|statutes &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;of autonomy&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] and those that the state transfers to them or, as appropriate, delegates to them.
* The public policies and actions foreseen in this Act which are not expressly reserved for the state will be deemed to have been delegated to the autonomous communities.&lt;ref&gt;
* ''Las comunidades autónomas ejercerán las competencias asumidas en sus estatutos y las que el estado les transfiera o, en su caso, les delegue.''
* ''Las decisiones y actuaciones publicas previstas en esta ley que no se hayan reservado expresamente al estado se entenderán atribuidas a las comunidades autónomas.''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Delegacionprovincialdesalud.JPG|thumb|Sign for the headquarters of a Health Office (''Delegación de Salud'') in [[Andalusia]].]] 
The State finances, through general taxes, all health benefits and a percentage of pharmaceutical benefits. This tax is shared among the several autonomous communities according to various sharing criteria now that the communities are responsible for health in their respective territories.

Each year the CISNS, after deliberation, establishes the portfolio of services covered by the National Health System, which is published by a Royal Decree of the Ministry of Health. Each autonomous community then establishes its respective portfolio of services, which includes at least the service portfolio of the National Health System.

=== Purview of local governments in matters of health  ===
[[File:Sha1993 smog wkpd.jpg|thumb|[[Air pollution]]; this photo is from [[Shanghai]], [[China]].]]
Article 42 of the General Health Law sets out that ''[[ayuntamiento]]s''—[[municipal government]]s—have the following responsibilities with respect to health, without prejudice to the purview of other public administrative bodies:

* a) Health control of the environment: [[air pollution]], [[water supply]] [and [[water quality]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, [[sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]], [[waste|urban and industrial residue]].
* b) Health control of industries, activities and services, transport, [[noise]] and [[vibration]]s.
* c) Health control of buildings and places of human residence or gathering, especially of food centers, hairdressers, saunas and centers of personal hygiene, hotels and residential centers, schools, tourist campsites and areas of physical activity for sports and recreation.
* d) Health control of [[perishable food]] distribution and supply, beverages and other products directly or indirectly related to human use or consumption, such as means of transport.
* e) Health control of cemeteries and mortuary health policy.&lt;ref&gt;
* ''a) Control sanitario del medio ambiente: [[Contaminación atmosférica]], [[Agua potable|abastecimiento de aguas]], saneamiento de [[aguas residuales]], [[basura|residuos urbanos e industriales]].''
* b) ''Control sanitario de industrias, actividades y servicios, transportes, [[ruido]]s y vibraciones.''
* c) ''Control sanitario de edificios y lugares de vivienda y convivencia humana, especialmente de los centros de alimentación, peluquerías, saunas y centros de higiene personal, hoteles y centros residenciales, escuelas, campamentos turísticos y áreas de actividad físico deportivas y de recreo.''
* d) ''Control sanitario de la distribución y suministro de [[alimento perecedero|alimentos perecederos]], bebidas y demás productos, directa o indirectamente relacionados con el uso o consumo humanos, así como los medios de su transporte.''
* e) ''Control sanitario de los cementerios y policía sanitaria mortuoria.''
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Territorial organization ==
As a consequence of the decentralization contemplated by the Spanish Constitution, each autonomous community has received adequate transfers to create a Health Service, the administrative structure that manages all of the centers, services and establishments of the community itself, as well as its deputations, municipal governments, and whatever other territorial administrations fall within that community. The Law of Cohesion establishes the Interterritorial Council (CISNS) as the organ of coordination and cooperation of the SNS.

In the autonomous cities of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] the corresponding health services are provided by the National Institute of Health Management, INGESA.

==Health coverage in Spain==
Under Chapter III of the 1978 Spanish Constitution, all Spanish citizens are beneficiaries of public health services. Concretely, it establishes that:
* Article 39: The public powers assure social, economic and juridical protection of the family.
* Article 43:  The right to health protection is recognized. It is the responsibility of public authorities to organize and act as guardian over public health through preventive measures and the provision of necessary services. The Law will establish the rights and duties of all in this respect. The public powers will promote health education, physical education and sports.
* Article 49.  The public powers will bring into existence a policy of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and integration of those with physical, sensory or psychological disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
* ''Artículo 39: Los poderes públicos aseguran la protección social, económica y jurídica de la familia.''
* ''Artículo 43:  Se reconoce el derecho a la protección de la salud.  Compete a los poderes públicos organizar y tutelar la salud pública a través de medidas preventivas y de las prestaciones y servicios necesarios. La Ley establecerá los derechos y deberes de todos a ete respecto. Los poderes públicos fomentarán la educación sanitaria, la educación física y el deporte.''
* ''Artículo 49.  Los poderes públicos realizarán una política de previsión, tratamiento, rehabilitación e integración de los disminuidos físicos, sensoriales y psíquicos.''

|accessdate= 2010-01-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, the Organic Law 4/2000 (''Ley Orgánica 4/2000'') establishes the rights and liberties of foreigners resident in Spain. Its effect on the healthcare provision can be seen in the following articles:
* Article  3. Foreigners will enjoy in Spain, in equal conditions with the Spanish, the rights and liberties recognized in Title I of the Constitution and in the laws that develop it, in terms established in this Organic Law.
* Article  10. Foreigners will have the right to engage in remunerated activity in self-employment or working for others, such as access to the Social Security System, in terms foreseen in this Organic Law and in the dispositions that develop it.
* Article  12. Foreigners who are registered in Spain in the municipality in which they are habitually resident have the right to health services on the same conditions as the Spanish. Foreigners who are in Spain have the right to urgent health services in the event of contracting severe illness or having an accident, whatever may be the cause, and the continuity of this care until the time of discharge. Foreign minors of less than 18 years who are in Spain have the right to health care on the same conditions as the Spanish. Pregnant foreigners who are in Spain have the right to health care during the pregnancy, while giving birth, and ''post partum''.&lt;ref&gt;
* ''Artículo 3. Los extranjeros gozarán en España, en igualdad de condiciones que los españoles, de los derechos y libertades reconocidos en el Título I de la Constitución y en sus leyes de desarrollo, en los términos establecidos en esta Ley Orgánica.''
* ''Artículo 10. Los extranjeros tendrán derecho a ejercer una actividad remunerada por cuenta propia o ajena, así como al acceso al Sistema de la Seguridad Social, en los términos previstos en esta Ley Orgánica y en las disposiciones que la desarrollen.''
* ''Artículo 12. Los extranjeros que se encuentren en España inscritos en el padrón del municipio en el que residan habitualmente, tienen derecho a la asistencia sanitaria en las mismas condiciones que los españoles. Los extranjeros que se encuentren en España tienen derecho a la asistencia sanitaria pública de urgencia ante la contracción de enfermedades graves o accidentes, cualquiera que sea su causa, y a la continuidad de dicha atención hasta la situación de alta médica. Los extranjeros menores de dieciocho años que se encuentren en España tienen derecho a la asistencia sanitaria en las mismas condiciones que los españoles. Las extranjeras embarazadas que se encuentren en España tendrán derecho a la asistencia sanitaria durante el embarazo, parto y postparto.''

== Financing of the health system ==

Article 10 of the Law of Cohesion establishes that the financing of the Spanish health system is the responsibility of the autonomous communities in conformity with the accords of transfer and the current system of autonomic financing, notwithstanding the existence of a third party liable to pay. Sufficient financing of services is determined by the resources assigned to the autonomous communities in conformity to what is established in the laws of autonomic financing.
 
Inclusion of a new service in the catalog of services of the National Health System is accompanied by an economic memo that contains the positive or negative financial impact it is expected to imply. This memo is brought up to the Council of Fiscal Policy and Finance for analysis and approval as to whether to proceed.

===Fairness in financing===

Prior to 1986, public financing of health care occurred mostly through highly regressive payroll taxes. In 1986, the law that established the Spanish National Health System also shifted financing toward progressive general taxes and away from payroll taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa-Font|first1=Joan|last2=Gil|first2=Joan|title=Exploring the pathways of inequality in health, health care access and financing in decentralized Spain|journal=Journal of European Social Policy|date=December 2009|volume=19|issue=5|pages=446–458|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2000 report, the World Health Organization ranked Spain 26th of 191 countries in its fairness in financing.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation, World Health Staff, (2000), Haden, Angela; Campanini, Barbara, eds., The world health report 2000 - Health systems: improving performance (PDF), Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organisation, {{ISBN|92-4-156198-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, reform to income tax deductions allowed high income earners to deduct more for private insurance. Although this reform was intended to decrease overconsumption of health care services, it had the side effect of more regressive financing of public health services. Nevertheless, that same year payroll taxes were completely phased out while higher indirect taxes (on excise goods such as alcohol and tobacco) were earmarked for health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puig-junoy|first1=Jaume|last2=Rovira|first2=Joan|title=Issues raised by the impact of tax reforms and regional devolution on health-care financing in Spain, 1996 - 2002|journal=Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date=June 2004|volume=22|issue=3|pages=453–464|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functional organization ==

=== Individual health card===
[[File:Tarjetasanitariaindividual.JPG|thumb|A [[Spanish health insurance card|health card]] (''tarjeta sanitaria'') for the [[Andalusian Health Service]] (2010)]]
Article 57 of the Law of Cohesion establishes that citizens' access to health services will be facilitated by use of an [[Spanish health insurance card|individual health card]] (''tarjeta sanitaria individual''), as the administrative document that accredits its holder and provides certain basic data.

In order to best facilitate collaboration, quality, and continuity of services, the each card includes a standardized form of basic identification data for the holder, and indicates in which autonomic health service the person is enrolled. In particular, the cards incorporate a digital form of this information; health facilities throughout Spain have appropriate equipment to read the digital information from the cards. A cardholder should thereby be able to access all the services of all relevant health professionals throughout the country.

=== Clinical history ===
A patient's [[clinical history]] is a medical-legal document that arises from the interactions between health professionals and their clients. From a medical and legal point of view, the clinical history is the only document valid to track this history of interactions. In primary care, where methods of health promotion are important, the clinical history document is sometimes known as a "health history" (''historia de salud'') or "life history" (''historia de vida'').

====Clinical histories in the SNS====

The Clinical History of the [Spanish] National Health System (''Historia Clínica Digital del Sistema Nacional de Salud'', HCDSNS) is intended to guarantee citizens and health professionals access to whatever clinical information is relevant for medical care of a particular patient. This history should be available at all authorized locations, but nowhere else: except as needed for treatment, the information is considered confidential and access is restricted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health Areas ===
The term "Health Area" ('''Área de Salud''') refers to an administrative district that brings together a functional and organizational group of health centers and primary care professionals. A Health Area may be exclusively focused on primary care or may include specialists as well. Some autonomous communities use different term, such as Direction of a sector (''Dirección de sector''), or of a  [[comarca]], district, department, or other territorial unit used in that autonomous community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title= Catálogo de Centros de Atención Primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud 2009
|publisher= msc.es
|accessdate= 2010-01-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic Health Zones ===
[[File:Kinderarzt.jpg|thumb|upright|Cardiac [[auscultation]], a protocol used in primary care for initial diagnosis of diseases and syndromes of the heart.]] 
Although the autonomous communities differ among themselves in layering subdivisions of their health areas, all eventually come down to a Health Zone (''Zona de Salud'') or Basic Health Zone (''Zona Básica de Salud'') as the unit for a primary health care team. In Andalusia, for example, each existing Basic Health Zone takes care of a population between 5,000 and 20,000 inhabitants. The Basic Health Zone is served by a single [[Hospital#General|general hospital]] and specialists' center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title= Organización del Sistema Nacional de Salud (España)
|publisher= msps.es
|format=pdf
|accessdate= 2009-12-28
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary Care ===
Article 12 of the Law of Cohesion establishes the concept of "primary care," the basic level of patient care that guarantees the comprehensiveness and continuity of care throughout the patient's life, acting as manager and coordinator of cases and regulator of issues. Primary care includes health promotion, health education, prevention of illness, health care, maintenance and recuperation of health, as well as physical rehabilitation and social work. Primary health care includes service provided either on-demand, scheduled, or urgently, both in the clinic as well as in the patient's home.

=== Specialized care ===
Article 13 of the Law of Cohesion regulates characteristics of health care offered in Spain by [[medical specialist]]s, which is provided at the request of primary care physicians. This may be in-patient hospital care or out-patient consultation at specialist centers or [[day hospital]]s. It includes care, diagnosis, therapy, rehabilitation and certain preventive care, as well as health promotion, health education and prevention of illness whose nature makes it appropriate to handle at this level. Specialized care guarantees the continuity of integrated patient care once the capabilities of primary care have been exhausted and until matters can be returned to that level. Insofar as patient condition allows, specialized care is offered in out-patient consultation and in day hospitals. As of 2010, Spain recognizes fifty distinct medical specialties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social-health care ===
Article 14 of the Law of Cohesion defines social-health care (''atención sociosanitaria'') as the combination of care for those patients, generally those with a [[chronic illness]], whose would benefit from the simultaneous and synergistic provision of health services and [[social services]] to increase their personal autonomy, palliate their limitation or hardships, and facilitate their social reinsertion. This group includes:
 
* a) Longterm health care.
* b) Health care connected to [[convalescence]].
* c) Rehabilitation after illness

== Registered health professionals ==
2000 data from the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|INE]] (Spain's National Institute of Statistics) counts 616,232 individuals credentialed by a [[professional association]] as health care professionals. The largest number of these are nursing professionals; that is also the profession with the highest percentage of women. The following table is a breakdown of some of the INE statistics. No exact breakdown is available to indicate what number of these might be related to [[mental health]] and [[psychotherapy]] or [[clinical psychology]].

== Health establishments ==

=== Healthcare centers ===

Royal Decree 1277/2003, of 10 October, establishes the general bases for authorization of health centers, services and establishments. It defines "healthcare center" (''centro sanitario'') as the organized combination of technical means and installations in which trained professionals, identified by their official certification or professional qualification, undertake basic health care activities with the purpose of improving people's health. These may be integrated into one or more health services, which constitute its healthcare portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?c=PTSA_Multimedia_FA&amp;cid=1142333254398&amp;pagename=PortalSalud%2FPTSA_Multimedia_FA%2FPTSA_documentoWebeditpro

|publisher= ''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado|BOE]]'' nº254 23 de octubre de 2003
|accessdate= 2010-01-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Consultorios'' ===

Certain healthcare centers (''centros sanitarios'') are referred to as ''consultorios'', a term roughly equivalent to [[British English]] "surgery" or [[American English]] "doctor's office."  These are offices that, while not full-fledged health centers (''centros de salud''), nonetheless provide care beyond primary care. Some terms used are ''consultorios rurales'', ''consultorios locales'', and ''consultorios periféricos'' (respectively, rural, local and "peripheral"; that last means a center located in a community other than the main settlement of a [[municipality]]), but other terms may exist, analogous to those that refer to various types of health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.msc.es/ciudadanos/prestaciones/centrosServiciosSNS/hospitales/introduccionCentro.htm#inicio
|title= Centros de Sanitarios del SNS 
|publisher= msc.es
|accessdate= 2010-01-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2008 National Catalog of Hospitals (''Catálogo Nacional de Hospitales 2008''), Spain in 2007 had a total of 10,178 ''consultorios'' that allowed health professionals to provide more local services than the health centers in their respective zones, with the purpose of bringing basic services closer to people who reside in nuclei dispersed through rural areas that tend to have an older than average population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health centers ===
[[File:Centro salud Ansoáin3.jpg|thumb|Health center in [[Ansoáin]] ([[Navarre]])]]

A health center (''centro de salud'', distinct from the smaller "healthcare center" ''centro sanitario'') in Spain's SNS is main physical and functional structure devoted to coordinated global, integral, permanent and continuing primary care, based in a team of health care professionals and other professionals who work there as a team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/Satellite?c=PTSA_Multimedia_FA&amp;cid=1142333254398&amp;pagename=PortalSalud%2FPTSA_Multimedia_FA%2FPTSA_documentoWebeditpro

|publisher= ''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado|BOE]]'' nº254 23 de octubre de 2003
|accessdate= 2010-01-14
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health centers basically practice the [[general medicine]] or [[family medicine]], providing a unity of care in which a specialist in community and family medicine is responsible to provide preventive care, health promotion, diagnosis and basic treatment on an outpatient basis. According to the 2008 National Catalog of Hospitals (''Catálogo Nacional de Hospitales''), in 2007 Spain had 2,913 health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title= Actividades y recursos del SNS

|publisher= msps.es
|accessdate= 2010-01-12
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specialized centers ===
Specialized centers are healthcare centers where different health care professionals provide services to particular group identified by common pathologies, age, or other common characteristics. Among these are:

; Dental clinics
: Focused on care of the teeth and mouth.
; Centers for assisted human reproduction
: Biomedical teams focused on [[assisted reproductive technology]].
; Centers for voluntary interruption of pregnancy: Provide [[abortion]] services in legally permitted cases.
[[File:Hemodialysismachine.jpg| thumb |[[Hemodialysis]] machine.]]
; Centers for major outpatient surgery
: Provide surgery and subsidiary services including [[general anesthesia|general]], [[local anesthesia|local]] and [[regional anesthesia|regional]] [[anesthesia]] and [[sedation]]. For surgeries that require only brief [[post-operative care]] and therefore do not require overnight hospitalization.
; [[Dialysis]] centers
: For patients with failed [[kidney]]s.
; Diagnostic centers
: Dedicated to diagnostic, analytic and imaging services.
; Mobile health care centers: Carry human and technical means for the purpose of health care activities.
; [[Blood transfusion|Transfusion]] centers
: Carry out all activities related to the extraction and verification of [[human blood]] and its components, and of treatment, storage, and distribution.
; [[Tissue bank]]s
: Conserve and guarantee the quality of tissues after they are obtained and until they are used as [[allograft]]s or [[autograft]]s.
; Medical inspection centers
: (''Centros de reconocimiento médico''), where examinations and other tests of ability are carried out for applicants or holders of medical and other health care permits or licenses.
; Mental health centers
: Diagnose and treat mental illness on an outpatient basis.

=== Specialized health care establishments ===
Specialized health care establishments are private centers that provide a suite of health care products, ranging from medicines to sophisticated [[prosthesis|prostheses]]. These establishments are grouped by specialty and, on that account, must have accredited or certified technical personnel. Among these establishments are:

; [[Pharmacy|Pharmacies]]
: Private establishments operated in the public interest, subject to health care planning established by the autonomous communities, which provide the public with basic services recognized in Article 1 of Law 16/1997, of 25 April, that regulates pharmacy services (''Ley 16/1997, de 25 de abril, de regulación de los servicios de las oficinas de farmacia'').
; ''Botiquines'': (singular: ''Botiquín'') are authorized to hold, conserve and dispense medicines and health care products in places where there would be special difficulties of accessibility of a pharmacy.
; Optometric offices (Ópticas)
: Evaluate visual capacity using [[optometry|optometric]] techniques; crafting, sale, verification and control  of adequate means for the prevention, detection, protection, and improvement of [[visual acuity]].
; [[Orthopedic|Orthopedia]] centers
: Dispense orthopedic health care products such as [[prosthesis|prostheses]] and [[orthotics]], technical devices to alleviate loss of autonomy, functionality, or physical capacity.
; Audioprosthesis centers
: Dispense health care products, intended for the correction of auditory deficiencies, such as [[hearing aid]]s, with adaptation individualized to each patient.

=== Hospitals ===
[[File:Hospital Torrecárdenas 2.JPG|thumb|[[Hospital Torrecárdenas|Hospital General Torrecárdenas]], [[Almería]].]]
[[File:Clinicaprivadaensevilla.JPG|thumb|ASISA private clinic in [[Seville]].]]
[[File:Hospitalinfantilensevilla.JPG|thumb|Children's hospital in Seville.]]

A [[hospital]] is a health care establishment that provides [[inpatient care]] and specialized (and other) care, providing such services as are needed in its geographical area. A hospital can be a single structure or a hospital complex, even including branch buildings off of its main campus; it can also integrate any number of specialized centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar concept to a hospital is a ''clinic''. In Spain, a clinic (''clínica'') is a health center, typically a private one, where patients can receive health coverage in a broad range of specialties. Some of these clinics include very up-to-date [[operating theater]]s capable of providing [[minimally invasive surgery]], and "hospitalization zones" where patients can recuperate on an inpatient basis. In large Spanish cities, there are numerous clinics. These are the facilities that are normally used by health care professionals whose medical societies cover it: [[ASISA]], [[Adeslas]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Health Law of 1986 establishes that the level of specialized care provided in hospitals and their dependent specialty centers will focus care on complex health problems. Hospital centers will develop, besides their functions strictly related to health care, functions of health promotion, prevention of illnesses and investigation and teaching, in accord with the programs of each area of health, with the object of complementing their activities with those developed by the primary care network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As elsewhere in the world, the size of hospitals in Spain is often gauged by the number of "installed beds" (''camas instaladas''). This is the number of hospital beds with fixed locations; at any given time, some beds may be out of commission.

====General and specialized hospitals====
General hospitals treat a broad range of pathologies and typically provide services including surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics. Other hospitals are more specialized. The following list includes most of the common types of specialized hospitals in Spain, but is not intended to be exhaustive.

{{col-begin|width=""}}
{{col-2}}
* Surgical hospitals
* Medical-surgical hospitals
* Maternity hospitals
* Children's hospitals
* Maternity and Children's hospitals (''materno-infantil'')

* [[Physical trauma|Trauma]]tological and rehabilitation hospitals
* Psycho-physical rehabilitation hospitals
* [[Geriatrics|Geriatric]] and longterm care hospitals
* [[Leprosy|Leprological]] and [[dermatology|dermatological]] hospitals
{{col-end}}

====Health care contracts====
Spanish government-run healthcare administrations sign health care contracts (''conciertos sanitarios'') with privately run entities that provide health care services. They are regulated by the provisions of the General Health Law and the current rules of government contracting. There are some special cases where the relation between the hospital and the managing entity is regulated by a special arrangement called a ''Convenio de Vinculación'' or ''Convenio Singular'' ("Linkage Convention" or "Singluar Convention").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://noticias.juridicas.com/base_datos/CCAA/lr-l2-2002.t8.html
|title= Ley 2/2002, de 17 de abril, de Salud. Colaboración con la iniciativa privada.
|publisher= noticias.juridicas.com
|accessdate= 2010-01-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Catalonia]] there are also centers integrated into the Network of Hospitals for Public Use (Red de Hospitales de Utilización Pública, XHUP) as outlined in the supplement to Decree 124/2008 of the Department of Health of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia (''Anexo del Decreto 124/2008 del Departamento de Salud de la Generalitat de Catalunya'').

====Patrimonial dependency====
The patrimonial dependency (''dependencia patrimonial'') of a hospital (or other health care facility) is the individual or other juridical entity that owns, at least, the building occupied by the facility. Hospitals that are under the dependency of Spanish Social Security belong primarily to the General Treasury of Social Security, although there is a special group within Social Security for the Mutuals of Accidents and Occupational Diseases (''Mutuas de Accidentes de Trabajo y Enfermedades Profesionales'', MATEP). There are also a few cases where patrimony is shared by two or more public entities on a consortium basis.

The 2009 National Catalog of Hospitals contains information about the patrimonial dependency of hospitals, summarized as follows; hospital complexes are each counted here as a single hospital:&lt;ref name="hospital patrimony"&gt;{{cite web

== Services ==

Article 7 of the Law of Cohesion establishes the catalog of services of the National Health System, with the object of guaranteeing the basic and common conditions for an adequate level of integrated, continuous health care. Health care services include prevention, diagnosis, therapy and rehabilitation, as well as promotion and maintenance of citizens' health.

Article 11 of the law establishes the basic lines of public health services:

* 1. The public health service is the ensemble of initiatives organized by public administrations to preserve, protect and promote the health of the population. It is a combination of sciences, capabilities and attitudes directed to the maintenance and improvement of the health of all persons through collective and social acts.
* 2. The services in this ambit include the following activities: [[Epidemiology|Epidemiological]] information and vigilance. Protection of health. Promotion of health. Vigilance and control of possible health risks derived from the importation, exportation and transit of merchandise and of international travel. Promotion and protection of environmental safety. Promotion and protection of health on the job.
* 3. Public health services are to be exercised with an integral character, from public health structures to administrations and the infrastructure of primary care of the National Health System.&lt;ref&gt;
* 1. La prestación de salud pública es el conjunto de iniciativas organizadas por las Administraciones públicas para preservar, proteger y promover la salud de la población. Es una combinación de ciencias, habilidades y actitudes dirigidas al mantenimiento y mejora de la salud de todas las personas a través de acciones colectivas o sociales.
* 2. Las prestaciones en este ámbito comprenderán las siguientes actuaciones: Información y vigilancia epidemiológica. Protección de la salud. Promoción de la salud. Vigilancia y control de los posibles riesgos para la salud derivados de la importación, exportación o tránsito de mercancías y del tráfico internacional de viajeros. Promoción y protección de la sanidad ambiental. Promoción y protección de la salud laboral.
* 3. Las prestaciones de salud pública se ejercerán con un carácter de integralidad, a partir de las estructuras de salud pública de las Administraciones y de la infraestructura de atención primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary care services===
Primary care services constitute the majority of the services of the SNS; this is true of health promotion and education, prevention of illness, hands-on health care, health maintenance, recuperation, rehabilitation, and social work.

The following catalog demonstrates preventive activities, health promotion and education, family care and community care as performed in primary care centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.msps.es/organizacion/sns/docs/prestaciones08.pdf
|title= Prestaciones sanitarias del Sistema Nacional de Sald. Atención primaria

|accessdate= 2010-01-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inculcate healthy life habits in [[adolescent]]s with respect to the use of [[tobacco]], [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[recreational drug]]s  as well as harmful [[eating disorder]]s and healthy conduct with respect to [[human sexuality|sexuality]].
* Orientation of women during [[pregnancy]] and [[birth]], early diagnosis of gynecological cancers and [[breast cancer]], detection and care of problems related to [[menopause]]. [[Family planning]].
* [[Pediatrics]], including infant and child health care, nutrition, general counsel on child development, health education and childhood accidents. [[Vaccination]]s.
* Care for adults in risk groups or with chronic conditions. Counsel on healthy life styles and detection of health problems.
* [[Geriatrics]]: promotion of health and prevention of illness. Homecare for the housebound.
* Detection of [[violence against women]] and [[domestic abuse]], as well as [[child abuse]], [[elder abuse]], and abuse of the disabled.
* Dentistry: Care, diagnosis and therapy, health promotion and education, and illness prevention related to the teeth and mouth.
* Care of terminal patient: integral, individual and continual care either in the home or at a health center.
* [[Mental health]] care: prevention and promotion to maintain mental health, in coordination with specialists.

=== Specialized care ===
[[File:Laprascopy-Roentgen.jpg|thumb|[[Laparoscopy]] is a specialized diagostic tool. Here, a colangiography image done during a laparoscopic [[cholecystectomy]].]]

At times, patients will require specialized health care services. These may be provided in external consultations, day hospitals, or on an inpatient basis.

Examples of specialized services are [[Intensive-care medicine|intensive and critical care]], [[anesthesia]], [[defibrillation]], but also some forms of [[hemotherapy]], rehabilitation, and even nutrition, diet, post-partum treatment, and family planning, especially [[assisted reproductive technology]].  Specialized treatment can also be involved in detecation, prescription and implementation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, especially those related to [[prenatal diagnosis]] in risk groups, diagnosis by imaging, interventionist [[radiology]], [[hemodynamics]], [[nuclear medicine]], [[neurophysiology]], [[endoscopy]], lab tests, [[biopsy|biopsies]],&lt;!-- the original Spanish added "y punciones" which is literally "and punctures"--&gt; [[radiotherapy]], [[radiosurgery]], [[kidney|renal]] [[lithotripsy]], [[dialysis]], techniques of [[respiratory therapy]], [[organ transplant]]s and other tissue and cell transplants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.msps.es/organizacion/sns/docs/prestaciones08.pdf
|title= Prestaciones de la Atención Esppecializada
|publisher= msps.es
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urgent care ===
[[File:Dependencias hospitalariasdeurgencias.JPG|thumb|Emergency room of the Virgen del Rocío hospital, [[Seville]].]]

[[Emergency medicine]] is health care provided in cases where emergency care is needed. Emergency medicine is practiced both in healthcare facilities and at the site of [[work accident]]s, [[traffic accident]]s, etc. or in the home of a patient whose condition prevents them from getting to a healthcare facility. Emergency medicine is a 24-hour-a-day service provided, in particular, by physicians and other medical professionals in hospital [[emergency room]]s, but also in [[ambulance]]s, medical evacuation [[helicopter]]s, etc. ''en route'' to such facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.tuotromedico.com/temas/urgencia_medica.htm
|title= Urgencia médica
|publisher= tuotromedico.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pharmaceutical services ===

Medications in Spain are regulated under Law 29/2006 of 26 July, of guarantees and rational use of medications and health care products (''Ley 29/2006, de 26 de julio, de garantías y uso racional de los medicamentos y productos sanitarios'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.boe.es/boe/dias/2006/07/27/pdfs/A28122-28165.pdf
|title= Ley 29/2006, de 26 de julio, de garantías y uso racional de los medicamentos y productos sanitarios
|publisher=''[[Boletín Oficial del Estado|BOE]]''
|work=boe.es
|accessdate= 2010-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the SNS's priorities with respect to pharmaceuticals is to teach patients to make rational use of medications and to avoid, insofar as possible, unsupervised [[self-medication]].

Pharmaceutical services include medications and health products are provided to patients according to their clinical needs, in precise doses and over an adequate period at the least cost possible. Medications are dispensed by pharmacies, each of which is headed by a licensed pharmacist.

All medications to be prescribed to patients must either be authorized and registered by the Spanish Agency of Medications and Health Care Products (''Agencia Española de Medicamentos y Productos Sanitarios''), or must be formulations prepared by licensed pharmacists. Exceptions to this requirement are cosmetics, dietetic products, dental products and other sanitary products, as well as drugs classified as advertising,&lt;!-- medicamentos calificados como publicitarios--&gt; [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] medicines, and articles and accessories advertised to the general public and where the purchaser pays the full price (that is, no money comes from SNS-related sources).

[[File:Oscar Pistorius-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Runner [[Oscar Pistorius]], with his orthopedic leg.]]
Spanish patients make a [[copayment]] when they acquire pharmaceuticals. The distribution of the cost is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.seg-social.es/Internet_1/Trabajadores/PrestacionesPension10935/Asistenciasanitaria/RegimenGeneral/Contenido/index.htm#30489
|title= Prestaciones famaceúticas del Sistema Nacional de Salud
|publisher= seg-social.es
|accessdate= 2010-01-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Medications dispensed as part of hospitalization are free to the patient.
* Other prescriptions are financed as follows
** Most [[pensioner]]s and their beneficiaries receive their medicines for free. Pensioners who were public functionaries and are protected by MUFACE (Mutualidad General de Funcionarios Civiles del Estado) pay 30 percent of prescription cost.
** Non-pensioners pay 40 percent of the price of prescription drugs. Active functionaries protecte by MUFACE pay 30 percent.
** Communities affected by [[toxic oil syndrome]] and patients with [[AIDS]] receive their prescriptions for free.
** Individuals with toxic treatments pay 10 percent, up to a maximum of 2.64 [[euro]]s per prescription.

=== Orthoprosthetic and complementary services ===
Orthoprosthetic services can be permanent surgically implanted [[prosthesis|prostheses]], external prostheses, special [[orthosis|orthoses]] and prostheses including [[hearing aid]]s and [[earmold]]s for children up to age 16 suffering from bilateral [[hearing impairment]]s.&lt;ref name=complement&gt;{{cite web

"Complementary services" include complex [[dietary therapy|dietary therapies]], vehicles for invalids, and home [[oxygen therapy]].&lt;ref name=complement /&gt;&lt;ref name=complement2 /&gt;

=== Health care transport ===
[[File:Ambulancias DYA Las Arenas.jpg|thumb|DYA [[ambulance]]s in the [[Basque Country (autonomous region)|Basque Country]].]]

The health care transport infrastructure transports people who are ill, accident victims, or otherwise in need of medical attention. It includes [[ambulance]]s, as well as [[air ambulance]]s: helicopters and airplanes whose interiors are specially modified for the purpose. For most purposes, of course, ground transport is preferred, but sometimes distances or the difficulty of reaching particular locations make air transport more practical.

According to data from the [[Instituto Nacional de Estadística (Spain)|National Institute of Statistics]] (''Instituto Nacional de Estadística'', INE), as of January 1, 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/prensa/cp_e2018_p.pdf|title=Population data as of January 1st, 2018 and Migration statistics.|author=National Institute of Statistics of Spain|date=25 June 2018|website=Instituto Nacional de Estadística|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain has a population of 46,659,302, of whom 22,882,286 (49,04%) are male and 23,777,015 (50.96%) female. In recent years, this population has been increasing slowly but progressively. In the last decade, the increase has been largely through immigration: 4,572,055 Spanish residents are foreigners.

These numbers count only citizens and legal immigrants. The health care system must also provide services for thousands of illegal immigrants and for the many tourists who visit Spain each year.

=== Population pyramid ===

Analysis of the population pyramid shows that

* 20 percent of the total population is under 20 years of age.
* 24 percent of the total population is 20 to 40 years of age.
* 31 percent of the total population is 40 to 60 years of age.
* 25 percent of the total population is at least 60 years old.

This structure is typical of a [[demographic transition|modern demographic regimen]], with an evolution toward an aging population and a declining [[birth rate]]. This means that Spain has to expect an increase in use of the services that are targeted at older adults. This effect is further exacerbated by a steadily increasing [[life expectancy]].

'''Sports for Sharing''' is a civic education program that uses sports and games to form better citizens from childhood.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports4sharing.org/who-we-are/what-is-s4s/&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the idea of learning through play and the United Nation's [[Millennium Development Goals]], Sports for Sharing aims to teach children empathy, social awareness and how they can be empowered to create positive change in the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/08/sports-for-sharing-takes-on-global-issues-92440.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based nonprofit, Sports for Sharing currently operates in 5 D.C. elementary schools.

==Origins==
Sports for Sharing is the American launch of the Mexico-based Deportes para-Compartir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deportesparacompartir.org.mx/es/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025201918/http://deportesparacompartir.org.mx/es/ |archivedate=2014-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2007 by Dina Buchbinder Auron as the main program of the AMNU, Deportes para-Compartir has expanded successfully to 26 Mexican states and over 114,000 beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roicommunity.org/blog/forming-global-citizens-childhood-deport |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141010184844/http://www.roicommunity.org/blog/forming-global-citizens-childhood-deport |archivedate=2014-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amnu.org.mx/&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the Canadian program, Sport in a Box, founded in 2005 by the [[United Nations Association in Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;http://unac.org/2013/05/sport-in-a-box/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Veteran_Health_Identification_Card_(VHIC).jpg|thumb|Veterans Health Identification Card {{as of|2014|lc=y}}]]
The '''Veteran Health Identification Card''' ('''VHIC''') is an identification card issued by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA) for eligible veterans to receive [[medical care]] at [[List of Veterans Affairs medical facilities by state|VA Medical Facilities]]. The VHIC protects the privacy of veterans' sensitive information, as it no longer displays the [[Social Security number]] or date of birth on the front of the card. The VHIC will only display the veteran's name, picture, and special eligibility indicators—Service Connected, [[Purple Heart]] and former [[Prisoner of war|POW]], if applicable, on the front of the card. Only veterans who are eligible for VA medical benefits will receive the card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans ID Card|url=http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/access/veteran_identification_card.asp|publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==

===Purpose===
{{multiple image
 | direction = vertical
 | width = 220
 | footer = 
 | image1 = VAID Obverse.png
 | alt1 = Front side of a VHIC issued between 2004 and 2014
 | caption1 = Front side of a VHIC issued between 2004 and 2014
 | image2 = VAID Reverse.png
 | alt2 = Back side of the same card
 | caption2 = Back side of the same card
 }}
The only purpose of the card is for identification and check-in for VA appointments at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), outpatient clinics (OPC) and community based outpatient clinics (CBOC). The VHIC cannot be used as a [[credit card]] or an insurance card, and it does not authorize or pay for care at non-VA facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Veterans Identification Card|url=http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/access/veteran_identification_card.asp|publisher=Dept. of Veterans Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterans Health Identification Card===
In 2014 the Veterans Administration established a newly designed Veterans Health Identification Card (VHIC) to replace the legacy Veterans Identification Card (VIC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.va.gov/health/newsfeatures/2014/february/new-id-cards-for-vets-enrolled-in-va-health-care.asp|title=New ID Cards for Vets Enrolled in VA Health Care -- Veterans Health Administration|website=www.va.gov|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The new Veterans Health Identification Card comes with additional security features and a different look and feel, replaced the old Veteran Identification Card, first issued in 2004. The new cards will protect against identity theft and will be personalized with the emblem of the veteran’s branch of service. Other new features add "VA" in [[braille]], to help visually impaired veterans, along with VA phone numbers and emergency-care instructions.

==Qualification==
===Minimum duty requirements===

Most veterans who enlisted after September 7, 1980, or entered active duty after October 16, 1981, must have served 24 continuous months or the full period for which they were called to active duty in order to be eligible. This minimum duty requirement may not apply to veterans who were discharged for a disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, for a hardship or "early out", or those who served prior to September 7, 1980. Since there are a number of other exceptions to the minimum duty requirements, VA encourages all veterans to apply so that they may determine their enrollment eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apply/veterans.asp|title=Veterans Eligibility|publisher=Dept of Veterans Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Veterans who may qualify{{efn|This is not a comprehensive list and veterans should check with the VA to see if they qualify. Many unique circumstances lead to qualification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get a Veterans ID Card|url=http://militarybenefits.info/how-to-get-a-veterans-id-card/|publisher=Military Benefits}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

*Veterans with a service-connected disability rating
*Served in combat or in a war zone
*Medical conditions incurred while in the service
*Location of service
*Served in theater of combat operations within the past five years
*Received a [[Purple Heart Medal]]
*Former [[Prisoner of War]]
*Receive VA pension or disability benefits
*Make less than [[US$]]62,000 annually 
*Honorable, General, or Other-Than-Honorable, Clemency, Bad Conduct Discharge

;Veterans who are disqualified
*Dishonorable Discharge: with this characterization of service, all veterans' benefits are lost, regardless of any past honorable service

In September 2011, the Veterans ID Card Act, HR 2985, was introduced by [[United States House of Representatives|US Congressmen]] [[Todd Akin]], and [[Silvestre Reyes]]. The bill would allow the VA to issue photo identification cards to veterans who are not retirees but who also do not presently receive VA medical benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/09/military-bill-would-create-id-card-for-all-veterans-092211/|title = Bill would create ID card for all veterans|author = Rick Maze|publisher = Navy Times|date = September 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State and local government veterans cards===
Other jurisdictions at state, county and municipal levels have also created their own identification card schemes for easier veteran access to discounts and other benefits within the jurisdiction. In most states, including Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, a person's driver's license or state identification card may optionally carry a veteran status identifier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://militarybenefits.info/veterans-id-on-drivers-license-id-card-by-state/ Veterans ID on Driver's License] Military Benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5601">'''Viktor Schauberger''' (30 June 1885 in Holzschlag, [[Upper Austria]]&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Coats|first=Callum|title=Who was Viktor Schauberger?|url=http://schauberger.co.uk/viktor-schauberger/|publisher=[[Nexus (magazine)|Nexus]]|issue=11|date=April–May 1996|accessdate=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  – 25 September 1958 in [[Linz]], Austria&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt;) was an Austrian forest caretaker, [[natural history|naturalist]], [[parascientist]]&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Engert: [http://www.kheichhorn.de/html/body_forellenturbine.html ''Die Forellenturbine als Prinzip der kostenlosen Energiegewinnung. Freie Energie durch Implosion''].&lt;/ref&gt;, [[philosopher]], [[inventor]] and [[biomimicry]] experimenter.

Schauberger developed his own ideas based on what he observed in nature. In ''Implosion'' magazine, a magazine released by Schauberger's family, he said that aeronautical and marine engineers had incorrectly designed the propeller. He stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As best demonstrated by Nature in the case of the aerofoil maple-seed, today’s propeller is a pressure-screw and therefore a braking screw, whose purpose is to allow the heavy maple-seed to fall parachute-like slowly towards the ground and to be carried away sideways by the wind in the process. No bird has such a whirling thing on its head, nor a fish on its tail. Only man made use of this natural brake-screw for forward propulsion. As the propeller rotates, so does the resistance rise by the square of the rotational velocity. This is also a sign that this supposed propulsive device is unnaturally constructed and therefore out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Viktor Schauberger, ''Implosion'' Magazine, No. 112, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''WWT London Wetland Centre''' is a [[wetland]] reserve managed by the [[Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust]] in the [[Barnes, London|Barnes]] area of the [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames]], southwest [[London]], [[England]], by [[Barn Elms]]. The site is formed of four disused Victorian reservoirs tucked into a loop in the Thames.

The centre first opened in 2000, and in 2002 an area of 29.9 hectares was designated a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] as the ''Barn Elms Wetland Centre''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sssi.naturalengland.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000457.pdf Natural England, Barn Elms Wetland Centre Citation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The centre occupies more than 100 acres (40 hectares) of land which was formerly occupied by several small reservoirs. These were converted into a wide range of wetland features and habitats before the centre opened in May 2000. It was the first [[urban area|urban]] project of its kind in the [[United Kingdom]].

Many wild birds which have now made their home in the Centre cannot be found anywhere else in London, and there are nationally significant numbers of [[gadwall]] and [[northern shoveler]]. Other wild birds include [[Eurasian bittern]], [[northern pintail]], [[northern lapwing]], [[water rail]], [[rose-ringed parakeet]], [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], [[sand martin]], [[common kingfisher]], [[little grebe]] and [[great crested grebe]]. The centre also holds a collection of captive [[Anatidae|wildfowl]].

It is host to regular lectures and events concerned with preserving Britain's wetland animals, and was featured on the BBC television programme [[Seven Natural Wonders]] in 2005 as one of the wonders of the London area, with a focus on the region's [[parrot|parakeets]], in an episode presented by [[Bill Oddie]]. The site contains a large visitors' building which is occasionally used as a wedding venue.

In 2012 London Wetland Centre was voted Britain's Favourite Nature Reserve in the BBC Countryfile Magazine Awards.

'''Waitakere Hospital''' is a general hospital located in the [[Henderson, New Zealand|Henderson]]/[[Lincoln, Auckland|Lincoln]] suburb area of [[Waitakere City]], part of the [[Auckland]] area of [[New Zealand]]. It is administered by the Waitemata [[District Health Board]] and provides health services to approximately 560,000 residents throughout North Shore, Waitakere and Rodney districts of Auckland. It has 76 medical beds and 6 [[coronary care]] beds, a maternity unit and a surgical unit with 2 [[operating theatre]]s. The hospital’s Emergency Department is open to both adult and paediatric patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waitematadhb.govt.nz/SecondaryHealthServices/WaitakereHospital/tabid/60/Default.aspx Waitakere Hospital] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721082239/http://www.waitematadhb.govt.nz/SecondaryHealthServices/WaitakereHospital/tabid/60/Default.aspx |date=2007-07-21 }} (official hospital website of the district health board)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1945 the original Waitakere Maternity Hospital was a small building in [[Te Atatu]]. The idea of a new hospital was raised that year, but it was another ten years before a site was found for the ‘North Western Hospital’.In the ensuing years a geriatric block was built and the site also became a base for community home health and support services, child disability services and for health services to school children - public health nurses, hearing and vision testing, school dental services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.healthpoint.co.nz/waitakere-hospital |title={title} |access-date=2013-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131006010845/http://www.healthpoint.co.nz/waitakere-hospital/ |archive-date=2013-10-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

HealthWest, a private primary health provider, was as of 2006 in negotiations with the hospital to be allowed to provide fee-paying patients with medical services in the hospital. While this proposed measure did not go forward as of mid-2007, it highlighted the fact that even after the NZ$60 million upgrading to general hospital status, the facility was still facing shortages, like many other public health facilities in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10395492"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/health/news/article.cfm?c_id=204&amp;objectid=10395492 |title=Waitakere patients face fees |author=Johnston, Martin |date=10 August 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153115/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/health/news/article.cfm?c_id=204&amp;objectid=10395492 |archive-date=2013-11-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first five months of 2008, the emergency department of the hospital was forced into partial closure 52 times, and has still not officially become a 24/7 facility. This is being blamed on short-staffing and financial constraints of the [[Waitemata District Health Board]].&lt;ref name="HER"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10524688 |title=Hospital emergency department in 'crisis' |author=Johnston, Martin |date=1 August 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102153012/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10524688 |archive-date=2013-11-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme''', a [[recycled water]] project, is located in the [[South East Queensland|South East]] region of [[Queensland]] in [[Australia]]. The scheme that is managed by [[WaterSecure]] is a key part of the [[SEQ Water Grid]] constructed by the [[Queensland Government]] in response to population growth, [[climate change]] and severe [[drought in Australia|drought]]. The {{AUD}}2.5&amp;nbsp;billion project is reported as the largest recycled water project in Australia.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/mothballs-for-recycling-scheme/story-e6frgczx-1226557771105|title=Mothballs for Brisbane recycling scheme|author=Walker, Jamie|work=[[The Australian]]|date=21 January 2013|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and features==
The Western Corridor is the area from [[Brisbane]]'s south west suburbs towards the city of [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]]. For many years the corridor has experienced significant population growth with the development of the suburb of [[Springfield, Queensland|Springfield]] and the resultante extension of the [[Centenary Highway]] and the upgrade to the [[Ipswich Motorway]].

The scheme involved the construction of three advanced [[water treatment]] plants constructed at [[Bundamba, Queensland|Bundamba]], Luggage Point and Gibson Island, which draw water from six existing [[wastewater]] treatment plants in the region to produce up to {{convert|232|ML|e6impgal+e6USgal}} of purified recycled water daily.&lt;ref name="doe"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/node/24356|title=Western Corridor Recycling Plant|accessdate=5 July 2014|date=|work=[[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of the Environment]]|publisher=Australian Government }}&lt;/ref&gt; The water is distributed via a network of [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] measuring more than {{convert|200|km}} in length. Construction began on the Recycled Water Project in 2006 and completed in late 2008.&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/recycle-pipeline-in-mothballs/story-e6freoof-1225710435782|title=Water recycling pipeline in mothballs|author=Johnstone, Craig|accessdate=5 July 2014 |date=8 May 2009|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|location=Queensland }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veoliawater.com.au/veoliawater/contracts-projects/western-corridor.htm|title=Western Corridor Recycled Water Project, Queensland|work=Key contracts and projects|publisher=[[Veolia Water]]|date=2010|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{AUD}}408&amp;nbsp;million of funding was provided by the [[Australian Government]] via its Water Smart Australia Program.&lt;ref name="fpr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/water/publications/urban/western-corridor-recycled-water.html|title=Final progress report Western Corridor Recycled Water Project: Stage 2|accessdate=14 October 2010|date=4 March 2010|work=[[Department of the Environment (Australia)|Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities]]|publisher=Australian Government }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Stage 1 of the project the scheme has provided an alternative water source for [[Swanbank Power Station]] and both [[Tarong Power Station]] and [[Tarong North Power Station]]. Supplies to Swanbank started in 2007 and supplies to Tarong and Tarong North started in June 2008.

The system has the capacity to provide water to other industrial users, agricultural users and to supplement drinking water supplies in [[Wivenhoe Dam]]. Testing of the pipeline to Wivenhoe Dam has been conducted, however in November 2008, [[Premier of Queensland|Premier]] [[Anna Bligh]] declared that recycled water will not enter the dam unless levels drop to below 40%.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt; As of May 2009, the three power stations are the main customers of the recycled water, consuming {{convert|112|ML|e6impgal+e6USgal}} per day.&lt;ref name="cm"/&gt;

Since coming online in August 2007, through to July 2010, the Western Corridor Recycled Water Scheme has supplied more than {{convert|37|e3ML|e9impgal+e9USgal}} of water into the SEQ Water Grid.

In January 2013 it was reported that the [[Campbell Newman|Newman]] [[Newman Ministry|government]] was considering shutting down part or all of the scheme.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt; In September 2013, former Premier [[Peter Beattie]] admitted that the scheme was a "tragic error of judgment" in the way that the [[Bligh Ministry|Bligh government]] handled the creation of the water grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/beattieera-western-corridor-recycling-scheme-a-27b-white-elephant/story-fnihsrf2-1226718045362|title=Beattie-era Western Corridor Recycling Scheme a $2.7b white elephant |author=Houghton, Des|date=13 September 2013|accessdate=5 July 2014|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|location=Queensland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Conference on Women, 1985''' or the '''Third World Conference on Women''' took place between 15 and 26 July 1985 in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, as the end-decade assessment of progress and failure in implementing the goals established by the [[World Plan of Action]] from the [[World Conference on Women, 1975|1975 inaugural conference on women]] as modified by the [[World Programme of Action]] of the [[World Conference on Women, 1980|second conference]]. Of significance during the conference was the end result of the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 40/108|Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women]] being adopted by [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]], unlike the previous two conferences. The conference marked the first time that [[lesbian rights]] were introduced in a UN official meeting and the turning-point for [[violence against women]] to emerge from being a hidden topic into one which needed to be addressed. Recognizing that the goals of the [[International Women's Year|Decade for Women]] had not been met, the conference recommended and the General Assembly approved on-going evaluation of women's achievements and failures through the year 2000.

==History==

In 1975, the United Nations approved the celebration of [[International Women's Year]]. As part of the celebrations they held the First World Conference on Women in 1975 in [[Mexico City]]. At that meeting, it was proposed that the following decade be proclaimed UN Decade for Women and follow-up meetings to assess progress be held in 1980 and 1985. The General Assembly adopted a World Plan of Action with recommended targets for governments to integrate women's equality, development and participation in peace initiatives. The mid-point meeting was held in [[Copenhagen]],{{sfn|Earth Summit|2002}} adding sections to the revised Programme of Action devoted to ensuring women equal access to education, employment opportunities, and adequate health care.{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} Both of the previous conferences had struggled with the divide caused by [[Cold War]] politics and the needs of the developing world.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|pp=5–7}}{{sfn|West|1999|p=180}} The geopolitical backdrop entering into the third conference was still contentious with a [[Early 1980s recession|worldwide debt crisis]] soaring in [[Economic history of Africa#Independence and the Cold War|Africa]] and [[Latin American debt crisis|Latin America]], protectionist policies under [[Margaret Thatcher]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] causing widespread uncertainty, [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|stagnation of the USSR]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative|arms race]] build up, and the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The question would be whether the conference could remain focused on women's issues in the face of Soviet accusations that the United States imperialistic and war mongering tactics were undermining the goals of the Decade for Women and the US concerns that the [[Eastern Bloc]] attempts at politicization would derail any real improvement in the unique problems faced by women.{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|pp=7–8}}

==Official conference==

The 1985 Conference held from 15 and 26 July in [[Nairobi]], Kenya was the final review of the decade{{sfn|Women's World Conferences|2008}} and was led by conference president [[Margaret Kenyatta (mayor)|Margaret Kenyatta]].{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=7}} [[Leticia Ramos-Shahani|Leticia Shahani]], widowed mother of three children and a [[Philippines|Philippine]] diplomat served as the Secretary-General and made the crucial suggestion that off-the-record discussion by delegates would decrease the polarity which had plagued the previous conferences and would allow a more open discussion and lead to compromise.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} There were 157 countries represented with around 1,400 official delegates, including such prominent delegates as: [[Phoebe Asiyo]] of [[Kenya]]; [[Ylva Ericsson]] of [[Sweden]]; Saida Hassan of [[Djibouti]];{{sfn|''The Salina Journal''|1985|p=6}} {{ill|Elena Lagadinova|bg|Елена Лагадинова}} of [[Bulgaria]];{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} [[Carolyn McAskie]] an official at the [[Canadian International Development Agency]];{{sfn|''Awareness Times''|2007}} [[Maureen O'Neill]] head of the Canadian delegation, who was the coordinator for the [[Minister of Status of Women]];{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=9}}{{sfn|''The Chilliwack Progress''|1986|p=12}} [[Maureen Reagan]], daughter of the US president;{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=9}} [[Yvette Roudy]], the French Minister of Women's Rights;{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=48}} [[Jean Spautz]] of [[Luxembourg]];{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=12}} [[Tom Vraalsen]] of [[Norway]]; among others.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}}

After opening remarks by [[Javier Pérez de Cuéllar]], [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=98}} Kenyan President [[Daniel arap Moi]] welcomed participants, expressing his hope that the conference would prove successful and that the objectives for women would not be obscured by distractions.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=100}} Opening remarks by Margaret Kenyatta on the history of the conference were followed by the general discussion.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=101}} The general session discussed that women ought to be able to live securely under conditions which granted them equality and justice, but there was a recognition that time is required to change traditional views and make people aware of needed change. It was noted that though legal equality had significantly improved, the disparity between the legal reality and practice was still broad. It was discussed that political tension and instability, as well as conflict added to curtailment of advancement, as did colonialism, racism, and economic stagnation.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=109–111}} The conference noted gains in developed nations for parity of education, but significant gaps in girls education versus boys education in developing nations, which impacted future employment options as well.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=117}} Though some progress had been made on women's employment, it was noted that wage gaps, higher unemployment for women than men, and child care services all contributed to women's instability. As for health, it was acknowledged that as women were typically the health care providers for their families, that more effort must be made to ensure that women were healthy to allow them to continue to serve their families. Inadequate education and health facilities, combined with high birth rates and customs or laws that allowed women to control their own fertility were continuing issues.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=117–118}}

Projects throughout the decade had drawn awareness to the need to advance women's opportunities and statistic gathering had improved to measure their progress or lack of advancement. Violence against women was a prevalent problem as was the insecurity of indigenous women, elderly women, migrant and refugee women and their children, and rural women. Water and food uncertainty needed to be addressed as women in many areas devoted the majority of their time into unpaid labors to maintain their families.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=119–120}} Many UN programs had been expanded over the Decade for Women to incorporate women into their development programs, though it was noted that in general women's participation, and even employment in UN agencies though improved was still below targets. Programs directed at agriculture, economics, children, development, housing, health, technology and many others were examined and overall, improvement had been made in the inclusion of women's access. However, it was noted that making provisions for equality was not the same as attaining real equal opportunity.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=121–125}} It was agreed that the cultural role in maintaining [[sexism]] and sex [[stereotypes]] was a complex issue which would involve dedicated effort to change school curricula and transform media messaging to enable women real access to socio-economic, cultural, legal and political parity.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|pp=126–127}} It was noted that for the first time, [[lesbian rights]] were introduced at an official UN conference by the Dutch delegate, [[Annelien Kappeyne van de Coppello]].{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=11}}{{sfn|Swiebel|2015|pp=1–2}}

The first committee, under the chair [[Cecilia López Montaño|Cecilia López]] of [[Colombia]], with vice-chairs, [[Begum Kulsum Saifullah Khan|Kulsum Saifullah]] of [[Pakistan]], [[Olimpia Solomonescu]] of [[Romania]], and [[Laetitia van den Assum]] of the [[Netherlands]], with Rapporteur [[Diaroumeye Gany]] of [[Niger]],{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} discussed the first three chapters of the draft ''Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women''.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=129}} The second committee, under the chair [[Rosario Manalo]] of the [[Philippines]], with vice-chairs, Dame [[Billie Miller]] of [[Barbados]], [[Konjit SineGiorgis]] of [[Ethiopia]], and [[Eva Szilagyi]] of [[Hungary]], with Rapporteur [[Helen Ware (academic)|Helen Ware]] of Australia,{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=104}} discussed the remaining chapters of the Strategies.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=131}} Both committees recommended approving the draft and a discussion with the general session followed with a line by line review of the document.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=143}} Though both committees evaluated a number of draft resolutions, there was inadequate time for the general session to review the resolutions and no formal action was taken upon them.{{sfn|''Report of the World Conference''|1986|p=157}}

==Forum==

Dame [[Nita Barrow]] of [[Barbados]] chaired and organized the Forum,{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} with the assistance of [[Edith Ballantyne]], president of the United Nations' Conference of Non-governmental Organizations (CONGO).{{sfn|Foster|1989|pp=95-97}}{{sfn|Winslow|1995|p=145}} It was attended by more than 15,000 people, of which 60% were representatives from non-industrialized nations, and was held at the [[University of Nairobi]].{{sfn|Fraser|2013}}{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} Unlike the facilities in Copenhagen, in Kenya, a kindergarten was set up for delegates' children.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=56}} A Peace Tent was set up on the lawn of the university and hosted sessions about conflict and its impact of war on women.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} Among prominent attendees were: [[Charlotte Bunch]], a US lesbian activist ;{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} [[Betty Friedan]], founder of the [[National Organization for Women]] (NOW);{{sfn|''The Telegraph''|2006}} [[Eddah Gachukia]] head of the Kenyan NGO committee;{{sfn|Sciolino|1985}} and others.

In addition to the basic themes of the official session, the Forum was asked to address issues concerning women who were poor, elderly, migrant or refugees, youth and address women in media. Round table discussions, workshops and two plenary sessions were established.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=54}} The array of topics discussed in formal and impromptu meetings was vast, including such topics as childcare; consumer education; credit; family planning; [[female genital mutilation]]; the growth of women's studies; legal rights; literacy; [[Exploitation of women in mass media|media portrayals of women]]; motherhood and development programs for families; political prisoners; prostitution; systemic discrimination against women; violence; women and development; women and religion; women and technology; as well as lesbian workshops and many other topics in some 1200 workshops scheduled throughout the duration of the conference.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}}{{sfn|Maters|1986|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|''The San Bernardino County Sun''|1985|p=7}} The lesbian workshops were the "first public discussion of lesbianism in Kenya"{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=10}} and resulted in a lesbian press conference in which it was acknowledged that lesbianism wasn't a [[Western world|Westernized]] concept, but instead effected women's rights throughout the globe.{{sfn|Bunch|Hinojosa|2000|p=11}} It also resulted in a proposal from one of the Dutch representatives for lesbian rights to be addressed in the official conference documents.{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} In a workshop on development, [[Helen Safa]] brought forward the idea that "Gender and Development" (GAD) should replace the former strategy "Women in Development" (WID) used by the [[United Nations Commission on the Status of Women]] (CSW). This mirrored the NGO, [[Development Alternatives with Women for a New Era]] (DAWN)'s belief that WID simply tried to insert women into existing systems without reducing or changing their [[Patriarchy|paternal nature]]. They recommended that GAD, a strategic long-term planning method, become the new standard, which focused on designing systems specifically related to women and their growth.{{sfn|Bae|2004|p=9-12}}

In addition to the workshops, women were invited to participate in a number of cultural events like the Nairobi Film Forum which showed films and videos by and about women and gave workshops; exhibitions of art and photography; folklore workshops; concerts; martial arts classes; field trips to local villages.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=55}} Because of the favorable climate conditions, women were able to gather in the open-air for a variety of both scheduled and unscheduled functions to build networks with other participants.{{sfn|Maters|1986|p=56}} The Forum after 1985 shifted in a way that reflected the divide between [[progressivism]] versus conservatism, as opposed to the polarized capitalist-socialist divide which had split prior conferences. It was recognized by the participants that global problems were women's issues, but that within their governmental systems, there was either a desire to promote or curtail change. A fundamental shift occurred which recognized that no matter the system, women were subordinate and that promoting a world view from women's perspectives allowed them to transcend their differences and focus on the commonalities they shared.{{sfn|Bae|2004|pp=20–22}} For example, aboriginal women recognized that where ever they were from, they battled for indigenous land rights; Arab and Israeli women discussed the need for peace; women lawyers whether from Islamic countries in South Asia or Catholic countries in Latin America recognized the struggle for women's rights under patriarchal religious systems.{{sfn|Sciolino|1985}}

==Outcomes==
[[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 40/108|Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women]] was adopted by consensus because of a strategy developed which allowed delegates to express reservations on the basis of individual paragraphs, rather than of the document as a whole. Because of stronger transnational relationships had been forged by the previous two conferences{{sfn|Ghodsee|2010|p=8}} increased understanding by governments of the needs of their women constituents, a willingness of donors to help women integrate into development and increased effectiveness of NGOs in their activism, the list of topics covered in the Strategies was more extensive, including topics such as: agriculture, communications, constitutional and legal issues, education, employment, energy needs, environmental and water concerns, food security, health, housing, science and technology, social services, social and political equality as well as increased participation. The major themes development, equality, and peace were retained as were focuses on racism and refugees.{{sfn|Fraser|2013}} The document endorsed new strategies moving to the year 2000 and replaced the words [[Apartheid]] and [[Zionism]] with the more general term racism, to maintain the focus on women rather than polarizing issues.{{sfn|''The Ukiah Daily Journal''|1985|p=8}}{{sfn|''The Salina Journal''|1985|p=6}}

Out of the conference forum, several women's groups emerged that would become influential: [[Asian-Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development]] (APWLD), [[Comité de América Latina y El Caribe para la Defensa de los Derechos de la Mujer]] (CLADEM), [[Women in Law and Development in Africa]] (WILDAF),{{sfn|Bunch|2012|p=217}} and the [[Tanzania Media Women's Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tripp|first=Aili Mari|date=January 2003|title=Women in Movement Transformations in African Political Landscapes|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy2.cl.msu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1080/1461674032000080585?needAccess=true|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|language=en|volume=5|issue=2|pages=233–255|doi=10.1080/1461674032000080585|issn=1461-6742|via=Taylor &amp; Francis Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were indicative of the types of exponential growth in NGOs dealing with women and their issues which were founded after the conference ended. Many of the organizations were information-sharing groups which pooled their resources and strategies to create innovative solutions.{{sfn|Chen|1995|p=479}} These networks, shifted the flow of activism and scholarship from the global North toward the Southern hemispheres and from top-down social structures to those which forge coalitions across cultural, racial and social boundaries.{{sfn|Chen|1995|p=480}} The conference also marked a turning point in the silence regarding [[violence against women]], which would ultimately lead to the passage of the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in 1993.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|p=17}} Since the objectives of the Decade for Women had not achieved the goals set out in 1975, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] made a decision after Nairobi to conduct world surveys on women every five years in a continuing effort to follow-up on the implementation of the Strategies for women.{{sfn|Pietilä|1999|pp=23–24}} One of the most important outcomes was moving women out of obscurity and establishing specific mechanisms for measuring women's progress.{{sfn|Zinsser|1990|p=22}}
