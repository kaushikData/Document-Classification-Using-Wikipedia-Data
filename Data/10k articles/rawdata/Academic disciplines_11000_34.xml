In [[molecular biology]], an '''amplicon''' is a piece of [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] that is the source and/or product of [[amplification (molecular biology)|amplification]] or [[DNA replication|replication]] events. It can be formed artificially, using various methods including [[polymerase chain reaction]]s (PCR) or [[ligase chain reaction]]s (LCR), or naturally through [[gene duplication]]. In this context, ''amplification'' refers to the production of one or more copies of a genetic fragment or target sequence, specifically the amplicon. As it refers to the product of an amplification reaction, ''amplicon'' is used interchangeably with common laboratory terms, such as "PCR product."

Artificial amplification is used in [[research]],&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Meyers |editor1-first=Robert A. |title=Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: A Comprehensive Desk Reference |year=1995 |publisher=VCH Publishers |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-56081-925-1 |pages=53, 585}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic science|forensics]],&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=1867860 |year=1991 |last1=Walsh |first1=PS |last2=Metzger |first2=DA |last3=Higuchi |first3=R |title=Chelex 100 as a medium for simple extraction of DNA for PCR-based typing from forensic material |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=506–13 |journal=BioTechniques}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[medicine]]&lt;ref name=Meyers/&gt; for purposes that include detection and quantification of [[Infectious disease|infectious agents]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Consumer Affairs Branch |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/BloodBloodProducts/ApprovedProducts/PremarketApprovalsPMAs/ucm091626.htm |title=Roche Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Test |publisher=FDA |date=2010-08-17 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; identification of human remains,&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ng0294-130 |title=Identification of the remains of the Romanov family by DNA analysis |year=1994 |last1=Gill |first1=Peter |last2=Ivanov |first2=Pavel L. |last3=Kimpton |first3=Colin |last4=Piercy |first4=Romelle |last5=Benson |first5=Nicola |last6=Tully |first6=Gillian |last7=Evett |first7=Ian |last8=Hagelberg |first8=Erika |last9=Sullivan |first9=Kevin |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=130–5 |pmid=8162066}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extracting [[genotypes]] from human hair.&lt;ref name=Walsh /&gt;

Natural [[gene duplication]] plays a major role in [[evolution]]. It is also implicated in several forms of human cancer including [[Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma|primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma]] and [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]].&lt;ref name=Lixin&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ccr.2010.11.013 |title=Cooperative Epigenetic Modulation by Cancer Amplicon Genes |year=2010 |last1=Rui |first1=Lixin |last2=Emre |first2=N.C.

Amplification of the genes encoded by these amplicons generally increases [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of those genes and ultimately the volume of associated [[protein]]s.&lt;ref name=Bignell&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/gr.6522707 |title=Architectures of somatic genomic rearrangement in human cancer amplicons at sequence-level resolution |year=2007 |last1=Bignell |first1=G.

==Structure==
Amplicons in general are [[direct repeat]] (head-to-tail) or [[inverted repeat]] (head-to-head or tail-to-tail) genetic sequences, and can be either linear or circular in structure.&lt;ref name=Cohn&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Cohn|editor1-first=Waldo E. |editor2-last=Moldave |editor2-first=Kivie |title=Progress in Nucleic Acid Research and Molecular Biology |year=1996 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-540054-1 |pages=280–287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circular amplicons consist of imperfect inverted duplications [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics#Annealing|annealed]] into a circle&lt;ref name=Grondin&gt;{{cite journal |year=1996 |last1=Grodin |first1=K |last2=Roy |first2=G |last3=Ouellette |first3=M |title= Formation of extrachromosomal circular amplicons with direct or inverted duplications in drug-resistant Leishmania tarentolae. |volume=16 |issue=7 |pages=3587–3595 |journal=Mol. Cell. Biol. |pmc=231354 |pmid=8668175}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are thought to arise from precursor linear amplicons.&lt;ref name=Grondin2&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998 |last1=Grodin |first1=K |last2=Küding |first2=C |last3=Roy |first3=G |last4=Ouellette |first4=M |title= Linear amplicons as precursors of amplified circles in methotrexate-resistant Leishmania tarentolae. |volume=26|issue=14 |pages=3372–3378|journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |pmc=147699 |pmid=9649621 |doi=10.1093/nar/26.14.3372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During artificial amplification, amplicon length is dictated by the experimental goals.&lt;ref&gt;PCR Primer Design Guidelines. Premier Biosoft: Accelerating Research in Life Sciences. Retrieved from: http://www.premierbiosoft.com/tech_notes/PCR_Primer_Design.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

Analysis of amplicons has been made possible by the development of amplification methods such as [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], and increasingly by cheaper and more [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput]] technologies for [[DNA sequencing]] or [[DNA sequencing#Next-generation methods|next-generation sequencing]], such as [[ion semiconductor sequencing]], popularly referred to as the brand of the developer, Ion Torrent.&lt;ref name="ion torrent"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iontorrent.com/ |title=Ion Torrent Official Webpage |access-date=2018-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106192756/http://www.iontorrent.com/ |archive-date=2012-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA sequencing technologies such as next-generation sequencing have made it possible to study amplicons in [[Genome Biology|genome biology]] and [[genetics]], including [[Genetics of cancer|cancer genetics]] research,&lt;ref name="International Cancer Genome Consortium"&gt;[http://icgc.org International Cancer Genome Consortium Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] research, and [[human genetics]].&lt;ref name="National Human Genome Research Institute Official Website"&gt;[http://www.genome.gov National Human Genome Research Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, using the [[16S rRNA]] gene, which is part of every bacterial and archaeal genome and is highly conserved, bacteria can be taxonomically classified by comparison of the amplicon sequence to known sequences. This works similarly in the fungal domain with the [[18S rRNA]] gene.

Irrespective of the approach used to amplify the amplicons, some technique must be used to quantitate the amplified product.&lt;ref name="Stanley"&gt;Stanley, J. (2002). Essentials of Immunology &amp; Serology by Jacqueline Stanley. Albany, NY: Delmar.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, these techniques incorporate a capture step and a detection step, although how these steps are incorporated depends on the individual [[assay]].

Examples include the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor Assay ([[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|RT-PCR]]), which has the capacity to recognize [[HIV]] in [[Blood plasma|plasma]]; the HIV-1 QT ([[NASBA (molecular biology)|NASBA]]), which is used to measure plasma [[viral load]] by amplifying a segment of the HIV RNA; and Transcription Mediated Amplification, which employs a hybridization protection assay to distinguish ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' infections.&lt;ref name="Stanley"/&gt; Various detection and capture steps are involved in each approach to assess the amplification product, or amplicon. With amplicon sequencing the high number of different amplicons resulting from amplification of a usual sample are concatenated and sequenced. After quality control classification is done by different methods, the counts of identical taxa representing their relative abundance in the sample.

==Applications==

PCR can be used to determine sex from a human DNA sample.&lt;ref name=Mannucci&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01371335 |title=Forensic application of a rapid and quantitative DNA sex test by amplification of the X-Y homologous gene amelogenin |year=1994 |last1=Mannucci |first1=Armando |last2=Sullivan |first2=Kevin M. |last3=Ivanov |first3=Pavel L. |last4=Gill |first4=Peter |journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine |volume=106 |issue=4 |pages=190–3 |pmid=8038111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[locus (genetics)|loci]] of [[Alu element]] insertion is selected, amplified and evaluated in terms of size of the fragment. The sex assay utilizes AluSTXa for the [[X chromosome]], AluSTYa for the [[Y chromosome]], or both AluSTXa and AluSTYa, to reduce the possibility of error to a negligible quantity. The inserted chromosome yields a large fragment when the [[Homologous chromosome|homologous region]] is amplified. The males are distinguished as having two DNA amplicons present, while females have only a single amplicon. The kit adapted for carrying out the method includes a pair of primers to amplify the locus and optionally polymerase chain reaction reagents.&lt;ref name=Hedges&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0003-2697(02)00430-X |title=Mobile element-based assay for human gender determination |year=2003 |last1=Hedges |first1=Dale J |last2=Walker |first2=Jerilyn A |last3=Callinan |first3=Pauline A |last4=Shewale |first4=Jaiprakash G |last5=Sinha |first5=Sudhir K |last6=Batzer |first6=Mark A |journal=Analytical Biochemistry |volume=312 |pages=77–9 |pmid=12479838 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LCR can be used to diagnose [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=T M|title=The ligase chain reaction as a primary screening tool for the detection of culture positive tuberculosis|journal=Thorax|date=1 November 2000|volume=55|issue=11|pages=955–957|doi=10.1136/thorax.55.11.955|pmid=11050266|pmc=1745641}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence containing protein [[antigen]] B is targeted by four [[oligonucleotide]] [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]]—two for the [[sense strand]], and two for the [[Sense (molecular biology)#Antisense DNA|antisense strand]]. The primers bind adjacent to one another, forming a segment of double stranded DNA that once separated, can serve as a target for future rounds of replication. In this instance, the product can be detected via the [[Enzyme immunoassay|microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA)]].

The '''Berman Jewish DataBank''', founded as the '''North American Jewish Data Bank''', is the central online source for social scientific studies of North American Jewry and world Jewish populations and communities. The DataBank’s primary functions are to acquire and archive materials from quantitative studies of North American Jews, including data sets and reports, and to encourage and aid the production and utilization of quantitative research on North American Jews.

The DataBank maintains partnerships with the [[Berman Jewish Policy Archive]] and the [[University of Connecticut]]’s Center for Judaic Studies and Contemporary Jewish Life.

The DataBank holds more than 375 surveys and studies of North American Jews, including more than 200 local community studies usually commissioned by local [[The Jewish Federations of North America|Jewish federations]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the DataBank comes from an endowment provided by the [[Mandell and Madeleine Berman Foundation]] and from [[The Jewish Federations of North America]] (JFNA), and management is provided by JFNA. The DataBank’s professional staff includes Laurence Kotler-Berkowtiz, Director of the Berman Jewish DataBank; [[Ron Miller (sociologist)|Ron Miller]], Senior Research Consultant at the  Berman Jewish DataBank; and [[Arnold Dashefsky]], Director Emeritus and Senior Academic Consultant of the Berman Jewish DataBank.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishdatabank.org/About/staff.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berman Jewish DataBank was founded as the North American Jewish Data Bank in 1986 and operated under that name until July 2013.  Funded throughout that time by the Berman Foundation under an arrangement with the Jewish Federation system, the North American Jewish Data Bank was located at the City University of New York from 1986 until 2002, at Brandeis University (2003-04) and the University of Connecticut (2004-2013) before moving to JFNA and changing names as of July 2013.

[[Danielle Hawkins]] soon launched a blog on Tumblr by the same name. Writing at ''[[The Root]]'', Diamond Sharp describes "carefree black girls" as an idea black women "have used...to anchor expressions of individuality and whimsy in the face of the heavy [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes]] and painful realities that too often color discussions of their demographic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharp|first1=Diamond|title=Why Carefree Black Girls Are Here to Stay|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2014/08/carefree_black_girls_how_the_hashtag_turned_into_a_movement/|accessdate=29 August 2016|work=The Root|date=August 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ''[[Refinery29]]'', Jamala Johns said it was "a way to celebrate all things joyous and eclectic among brown ladies.

[[File:Clonal colony of Iris germanica.jpg|thumb|right|A clonal colony of ''[[Iris germanica]]''-note the [[Rhizome|rhizomatious]] stems by which the plant reproduces.]]
A '''clonal colony''' or '''genet''' is a group of [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals, such as [[plant]]s, [[fungi]], or [[bacteria]], that have grown in a given location, all originating [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], not [[Sexual reproduction|sexually]], from a single ancestor. In plants, an individual in such a population is referred to as a '''ramet'''. In [[fungi]], "individuals" typically refers to the visible [[fruiting bodies]] or [[mushroom]]s that develop from a common [[mycelium]] which, although spread over a large area, is otherwise hidden in the [[soil]]. Clonal [[colony (biology)|colonies]] are common in many plant [[species]]. Although many plants [[sexual reproduction|reproduce sexually]] through the production of [[seed]], [[plant reproduction|reproduction]] occurs by underground [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s in some plants. Above ground, these plants most often appear to be distinct individuals, but underground they remain interconnected and are all clones of the same plant. However, it is not always easy to recognize a clonal colony especially if it spreads underground and is also sexually reproducing.

==Methods of establishment==
* With most [[woody plant]]s, clonal colonies arise by wide-ranging [[root]]s that at intervals send up new [[shoot]]s, termed [[basal shoot|suckers]].  
* [[Tree]]s and [[shrub]]s with [[branch]]es that may tend to bend and rest on the ground, or which possess the ability to form [[aerial root|aerial roots]] can form colonies via [[layering]], or aerial rooting, e. g. [[willow]], [[blackberry]], [[Ficus|fig]], and [[banyan]]. 
* Some [[vine]]s naturally form [[adventitious]] roots on their [[plant stem|stems]] that take root in the soil when the stems contact the ground, e.g. [[Hedera|ivy]] and [[trumpet vine]].
* With other vines, rooting of the stem where nodes come into contact with soil may establish a clonal colony, e.g. [[Wisteria]].
* [[Fern]]s and many [[herbaceous]] [[flowering plant]]s often form clonal colonies via horizontal underground stems termed [[rhizome]]s, e.g. ostrich fern ''[[Matteuccia struthiopteris]]'' and [[goldenrod]].
* A number of herbaceous flowering plants form clonal colonies via horizontal surface stems termed [[stolon]]s, or runners; e.g. [[strawberry]] and many [[grass]]es.
* Non-woody plants with underground [[storage organ]]s such as [[bulb]]s and [[corm]]s can also form colonies, e.g. ''[[Narcissus (genus)|Narcissus]]'' and ''[[Crocus]]''.
* A few plant species can form colonies via adventitious [[plantlet]]s that form on leaves, e.g. ''[[Kalanchoe daigremontiana]]'' and ''[[Tolmiea menziesii]]''.
* A few plant species can form colonies via asexual seeds, termed [[apomixis]], e.g. [[dandelion]].

==Record colonies==
The only known natural example of [[King's Lomatia]] (''Lomatia tasmanica'') found growing in the wild is a clonal colony in [[Tasmania]] estimated to be 43,600 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |title=Tasmanian bush could be oldest living organism |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=[[Discovery Channel]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723041627/http://www.exn.ca/Stories/1996/10/21/01.asp |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group of 47,000 [[Quaking Aspen]] (''Populus tremuloides'') trees (nicknamed "[[Pando (tree)|Pando]]") in the [[Wasatch Mountains]], [[Utah]], United States, has been shown to be a single clone connected by the root system. It is sometimes considered the world's [[largest organism]] by [[mass]], covering {{convert|106|acres}}, and also as amongst the world's oldest living organisms, at an estimated 80,000 years old.  It is possible that other unknown clonal colonies of trees rival or exceed its size and/ or age.

Another possible candidate for [[list of long-living organisms|oldest organism]] on [[earth]] is an underwater meadow of the [[marine botany|marine plant]] ''[[Posidonia oceanica]]'' in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which could be up to 100,000 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/node/76071 |title=Ibiza's Monster Marine Plant |accessdate=2008-05-07 |publisher=Ibiza Spotlight }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
When woody plants form clonal colonies, they often remain connected through the root system, sharing roots, water and [[plant nutrition|mineral nutrients]]. A few non-vining, woody plants that form clonal colonies are:
*[[Aspen]], Quaking, ''Populus tremuloides''
*[[Bayberry]], ''Myrica pensylvanica''
*[[Black locust]], ''Robinia pseudoacacia''
*[[Creosote bush]], ''Larrea tridentata'' 
*[[Staphylea|Bladdernut]], ''Staphylea'' species
*[[Blueberry]], ''Vaccinium'' species
*[[Devil's Club]] Oplopanax horridus
*[[Forsythia]], ''Forsythia'' species
*[[Hazelnut]], ''Corylus'' species
*[[Honey locust]], ''Gleditsia triacanthos''
*[[Kentucky coffeetree]], ''Gymnocladus dioicus''
*[[Kerria (plant)|Kerria]], ''Kerria japonica''
*[[Asimina triloba|Pawpaw]], ''Asimina triloba''
*[[Pando (tree)|Pando tree]], a clonal colony of a single male ''Populus tremuloides'', all determined to be part of a single living organism
*[[Populus|Poplar]]s, ''Populus'' species
*[[Sassafras]], ''Sassafras albidum''
*[[Sumac]], ''Rhus'' species
*Sweetgum, ''[[Liquidambar styraciflua]]''

Collection maintenance is a form of [[collections care]] that consists of the day-to-day hands on care of collections and cultural heritage. The primary goal of '''collections maintenance''' is to prevent further decay of cultural heritage by ensuring proper storage and upkeep including performing regular housekeeping of the spaces and objects and monitoring and controlling storage environments. Collections maintenance is closely linked to [[collections care]] and [[collections management (museum)|collections management]]. The professionals most influenced by collections maintenance include [[collection manager]]s, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], and [[archivist]]s.

==Environmental Control==
There are four main environmental agents of deterioration which should be monitored on a regular basis as part of maintenance. These are temperature, relative humidity, light and dust. It is important to recognize the type of damage each agent may present as well as ways to mitigate any harm.

===Temperature===
Temperature as an agent of deterioration acts primarily in conjunction with relative humidity but can trigger damage in its own right. At the extremes, temperature can cause structural damage to some materials; paint may become brittle in excessive heat and some plastics may soften or melt in the heat.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp4"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 4: Museum Collections Environment|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; “High temperatures also accelerate chemical and biological processes.” &lt;ref name="Historic House chp 5"&gt;{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =5: Agents of Deterioration|page =51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative Humidity===
[[File:Termoigrografo 01.jpg|thumbnail|A thermo-hygrograph]]

[[Relative Humidity]] (RH) is the amount of water held in the air as related to how much could be held in fully saturated air. The possible amount of moisture held at a given time is directly related to temperature; warm air holds more humidity than cold. Collecting institutions aim to keep the RH constant in exhibitions and storage areas because many organic objects expand and contract as both temperature and RH change.&lt;ref name="Basics ch3"&gt;{{cite book|last =Ambrose|first =Timothy|last2 =Paine|first2 =Crispin |title =Museum Basics|place =London|publisher =Routledge|year =2006|edition =2|chapter =3: The Development and Care of the Museum’s Collections}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture will swell and stick with high moisture, but may crack or shrink if there is too little. “Rapidly fluctuating temperature and relative humidity compound all of these effects.” &lt;ref name="Concerns pg15"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Control of Temperature and Humidity in Small Collections|page =15}}&lt;/ref&gt; High humidity may accelerate mold growth and some chemical changes, like metal corrosion, if not properly maintained.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp10"&gt;{{cite book|last =Staniforth|first =Sarah|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =10: Relative Humidity as an Agent of Deterioration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some changes undergone by objects are reversible by adjusting the RH, but damage like cracks are more permanent. Keeping the RH within a reasonable span for the type of object and as consistent as possible will prevent most RH based damage. It is important to measure the RH of spaces regularly by using a number of tools including humidity strips, [[thermo-hygrograph]]s, [[hygrometer]]s, psychrometer and [[data logger]]s. Once the per cent humidity identified, there are a number of ways to adjust it by using humidifiers, dehumidifiers, improve heating and air conditioning systems and adjust the temperature of the space.

===Light===
Light, as it relates to collections maintenance, consists of visual and [[ultraviolet]] light (UV). Both types of light can cause damage as “light radiation falling on a surface provides energy to induce chemical changes in the molecules of the material.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Bullock|first =Linda|title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =9: Light as an Agent of Deterioration|page =93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage from light, including loss of color and strength, is cumulative and irreversible. It is therefore crucial that light levels are monitored.

Preventing light damage is difficult because it is necessary for visitors as well as people who are working with the objects. Exposure, however, can be diminished by ensuring lights are only on when people are present, either by vigilant staff members turning on and off lights, timer switches or with motion sensors.  Natural light from windows should be reduced or eliminated in all spaces by covering them with curtains, shades or UV absorbing filters.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where lights frequently on, like in galleries and office areas, a [[light meter]] should be used to determine how much exposure the collections are getting at least once a year and adjustments should be made accordingly.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp4"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 4: Museum Collections Environment|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAPTER4.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dust and Dirt===
Dust can contain a number of materials including skin, mold and inorganic fragments like silica or sulfur. It is important to keep collections free of dust whenever possible because it can become bound to a surface over time, making it that significantly more difficult to remove.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp6"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =6: Physical Agents of Deterioration|page =62}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dust is [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]], meaning it is able to attract and hold water molecules creating an ideal climate for [[mold]] spores to grow and cause biological damage.&lt;ref name="Winterthur chp1"&gt;{{cite book|last =Landrey|first =Gregory|last2=Hoag|first2=Robert|title =The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections|place =Hanover|publisher =University Press of New England|year =2000|chapter =1:General Care|page =13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hygroscopic trait can also prompt chemical reactions on a surface, especially upon metals. Inorganic dust particles may have tough sharp edges which can cause a number of types of damage from tearing fibers to [[abrasion (mechanical)|abrading]] softer surfaces if not properly removed. Wiping a clean cloth over a surface dusty with these inorganic particles may result in irreversible abrasions.

The best way to prevent damage from dust is to control and prevent substantial buildup of dust in the first place. This can be done by using air filters in the heating and air conditioning systems as well as using vacuum cleaners equipped with [[HEPA]] filters when possible. Limiting the amount of exposed surface areas of collections can also prevent dust from settling on objects. This can be done by storing objects in acid-free boxes, object specific enclosures, in drawers or covering open shelves with a [[polyethylene]] sheet.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winterthur chp1"/&gt;

Maintaining a clean and orderly spaces ensures not only ease of accessibility but also the safety of the collections and those who work with them.

===Organization===
[[File:Archival collection.JPG|thumbnail|Example of two "layers;" the boxes and the shelves they rest upon]]
It is essential that collections have an organizational system to store and house objects. The system may be grounded in relations to size, material, cultural or historical grouping as it makes sense to the collection.&lt;ref name="Concerns"&gt;{{cite book|last =Bachmann|first =Konstanze|title =Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|place =Washington, D.C.|publisher =Smithsonian Books|year =1992|chapter =Principles of Storage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp7"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structured organizational systems make identifying object locations straightforward and consistent which will help locating and returning an object to its proper space.

Part of a system is the use of “successive layers of protective envelopes and enclosures.” &lt;ref name="NPS,Chp7"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 7: Museum Collections Storage|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP7.pdf|accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of “layers” include nearly everything from storage spaces, padded shelves, non-acidic archival boxes and individual packaging. Each new layer should provide further protection by creating a microclimate buffer between an object and environmental fluctuations, light, dust and pollutants.

===Housekeeping===
Keeping spaces clean and clear of debris is crucial to the preservation of object in several ways. Primarily it ensures that objects don’t become over exposed to detrimental agents like dust, but it also ensures that the areas are safe for people and objects to move within, unobstructed by potential hazards. Tasks that fall under this purview include routine inspection and dusting of work areas and objects, and general cleaning of work areas. Spaces and objects should be monitored and inspected regularly to ensure that any problem is caught and resolved quickly or note any condition change.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp12"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regularity of dusting and cleaning will differ institution to institution, and will depend upon factors like foot-traffic, how well the space is sealed off from the outside, and how long it takes for dust to build up. As a general rule, work areas should be cleaned frequently, storage areas and furniture less so, and objects dusted occasionally and only after consulting a conservator.&lt;ref name="NPS,Chp13"&gt;{{Citation |last =National Park Service|author-link=National Park Service|title=Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections|year =1998|chapter =Chapter 13: Museum Housekeeping|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/CHAP13.pdf |accessdate= April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inside work areas, floors should be swept or vacuumed and work surfaces should be cleared off and dusted. Storage areas probably need less frequent attention, but should still have the floors cleaned and exposed surfaces of storage furniture like shelves wiped down. Objects themselves may sometimes need dusting if they are not boxed or wrapped up. Prior to dusting an object, the condition and stability needs to be considered, and a conservator should be consulted before any attempt is made. Research should also be done into how best to clean a particular type of medium or object.&lt;ref name="Housekeeping chp12"&gt;{{cite book|last =Lloyd|first =Helen| last2 =Lithgow|first2 =Katy |title =Manual of Housekeeping: The Care of Collections in Historic Houses Open to the Public|place =Amsterdam |publisher =Elsevier|year =2006|chapter =12: Housekeeping Tasks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DeepDream''' is a [[computer vision]] program created by [[Google]] engineer Alexander Mordvintsev which uses a [[convolutional neural network]] to find and enhance patterns in [[image]]s via [[algorithm]]ic [[pareidolia]], thus creating a [[dream]]-like [[hallucinogenic]] appearance in the deliberately over-processed images.&lt;ref name=codexample/&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper/&gt;&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt;

Google's program popularized the term (deep) "dreaming" to refer to the generation of images that produce desired [[activation (neural network)|activation]]s in a trained [[deep neural network|deep network]], and the term now refers to a collection of related approaches.

==History==
The DeepDream software originated in a deep [[convolutional neural network|convolutional network]] codenamed "Inception" after the [[Inception|film of the same name]],&lt;ref name=codexample&gt;{{cite web|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708233542/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|archivedate=2015-07-08|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/deepdream-code-example-for-visualizing.html|title=DeepDream - a code example for visualizing Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=arxiv&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christian |last1=Szegedy  |first2=Wei |last2=Liu |first3=Yangqing |last3=Jia|first4=Pierre |last4=Sermanet|first5=Scott |last5=Reed|first6=Dragomir |last6=Anguelov|first7=Dumitru |last7=Erhan|first8=Vincent |last8=Vanhoucke|first9=Andrew |last9=Rabinovich|title = Going Deeper with Convolutions|journal= Computing Research Repository|year=2014 |arxiv= 1409.4842|bibcode=2014arXiv1409.4842S}}&lt;/ref&gt; was developed for the [[ImageNet#ImageNet_Challenge|ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge]] (ILSVRC) in 2014&lt;ref name=arxiv/&gt; and released in July 2015.

The dreaming idea and name became popular on the internet in 2015 thanks to Google's DeepDream program.  The idea dates from early in the history of neural networks,&lt;ref name=lewis88&gt;{{cite conference |last=Lewis |first=J.P. |title=Creation by refinement: a creativity paradigm for gradient descent learning networks |conference=IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks|year=1988|doi=10.1109/ICNN.1988.23933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and similar methods have been used to synthesize visual textures.&lt;ref name=portilla00&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portilla |first=J |last2=Simoncelli |first2=Eero |title=A parametric texture model based on joint statistics of complex wavelet coefficients |journal=International Journal of Computer Vision |year=2000|doi=10.1023/A:1026553619983 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Related visualization ideas were developed (prior to Google's work) by several research groups.&lt;ref name=erhan09&gt;{{cite conference |last=Erhan |first=Dumitru. |title=Visualizing Higher-Layer Features of a Deep Network |conference=International Conference on Machine Learning Workshop on Learning Feature Hierarchies|year=2009|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Aaron_Courville/publication/265022827_Visualizing_Higher-Layer_Features_of_a_Deep_Network/links/53ff82b00cf24c81027da530.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=simonyan14&gt;{{cite conference |last=Simonyan |first=Karen |last2=Vedaldi |first2=Andrea |last3=Zisserman |first3=Andrew |title=Deep Inside Convolutional Networks: Visualising Image Classification Models and Saliency Maps |conference=International Conference on Learning Representations Workshop |year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Google published their techniques and made their code [[open source]],&lt;ref name=github&gt;{{GitHub|google/deepdream}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of tools in the form of web services, mobile applications, and desktop software appeared on the market to enable users to transform their own photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/03/google-deep-dream |title= These Google "Deep Dream" Images Are Weirdly Mesmerising |work= Wired |author= Daniel Culpan |date= 2015-07-03 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

}}
The software is designed to [[face detection|detect faces]] and other patterns in images, with the aim of automatically classifying images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/7/8904641/fear-and-loathing-clip-google-deep-dream-visualization |title= Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is terrifying through the eyes of a computer |date= 7 July 2015 |accessdate= 2015-07-25 |author= Rich McCormick |work= The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, once trained, the network can also be run in reverse, being asked to adjust the original image slightly so that a given output neuron (e.g. the one for faces or certain animals) yields a higher confidence score. This can be used for visualizations to understand the emergent structure of the neural network better, and is the basis for the DeepDream concept. However, after enough reiterations, even imagery initially devoid of the sought features will be adjusted enough that a form of [[pareidolia]] results, by which [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]] and [[Surrealism|surreal]] images are generated algorithmically. The optimization resembles [[Backpropagation]], however instead of adjusting the network weights, the weights are held fixed and the input is adjusted.

For example, an existing image can be altered so that it is "more cat-like", and the resulting enhanced image can be again input to the procedure.&lt;ref name=goingdeeper&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703064823/http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|archivedate=2015-07-03|url=http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html|title=Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks|publisher=Google Research|first1=Alexander |last1=Mordvintsev|first2=Christopher |last2=Olah|first3=Mike|last3=Tyka|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage resembles the activity of looking for animals or other patterns in clouds.

Applying gradient descent independently to each pixel of the input produces images in which
adjacent pixels have little relation and thus the image has too much high frequency information.
The generated images can be greatly improved by including a prior or [[regularization (mathematics)|regularizer]] that prefers inputs
that have natural image statistics (without a preference for any particular image), or are simply smooth.&lt;ref name="simonyan14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mahendran&gt;{{cite conference |last=Mahendran |first=Aravindh |last2=Vedaldi |first2=Andrea |title=Understanding Deep Image Representations by Inverting Them |conference=IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition |year=2015 |doi=10.1109/CVPR.2015.7299155 |arxiv=1412.0035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yosinski15&gt;{{cite conference |last=Yosinski |first=Jason |last2=Clune |first2=Jeff |last3=Nguyen |first3=Anh |last4=Fuchs |first4=Thomas |title=Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization |conference=Deep Learning Workshop, International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Deep Learning Workshop |year=2015 |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.06579}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, Mahendran et al.&lt;ref name=mahendran/&gt; used the total variation regularizer that prefers images that are piecewise constant. Various regularizers are discussed further in.&lt;ref name=yosinski15/&gt; An in-depth, visual exploration of feature visualization and regularization techniques was published more recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olah|first=Chris|last2=Mordvintsev|first2=Alexander|last3=Schubert|first3=Ludwig|date=2017-11-07|title=Feature Visualization|url=https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/|journal=Distill|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=11|doi=10.23915/distill.00007|issn=2476-0757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cited resemblance of the imagery to [[LSD]]- and [[psilocybin]]-induced hallucinations is suggestive of a functional resemblance between artificial neural networks and particular layers of the visual cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=LaFrance|first1=Adrienne|title=When Robots Hallucinate|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/09/robots-hallucinate-dream/403498/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
[[File:Deep Dreamscope (19822170718).jpg|thumb|left|A late-stage ''DeepDream'' processed photograph of three men in a pool]]
The dreaming idea can be applied to hidden (internal) neurons other than those in the output, 
which allows exploration of the roles and representations of various parts of the network.&lt;ref name=yosinski15/&gt;
It is also possible to optimize the input to satisfy either a single neuron (this usage is sometimes called Activity Maximization)&lt;ref name=nguyen16&gt;{{cite conference |last=Nguyen |first=Anh |last2=Dosovitskiy |first2=Alexey |last3=Yosinski |first3=Jason |last4=Brox |first4=Thomas |title=Synthesizing the preferred inputs for neurons in neural networks via deep generator networks |conference=arxiv |arxiv=1605.09304 |year=2016 |bibcode=2016arXiv160509304N }}&lt;/ref&gt; or an entire layer of neurons.

While dreaming is most often used for visualizing networks or producing computer art, it has recently been proposed that adding "dreamed" inputs to the training set can improve training times for abstractions in Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last=Arora |first=Sanjeev |last2=Liang |first2=Yingyu |last3=Tengyu |first3=Ma |title=Why are deep nets reversible: A simple theory, with implications for training |conference=arxiv |arxiv=1511.05653 |year=2016 |bibcode=2015arXiv151105653A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DeepDream model has also been demonstrated to have application in the field of [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spratt|first=Emily L.|date=2017|title=Dream Formulations and Deep Neural Networks: Humanistic Themes in the Iconology of the Machine-Learned Image|url=https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/handle/18452/19403/Spratt%20-%20final.pdf|journal=Kunsttexte|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|volume=4|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DeepDream was used for [[Foster the People]]'s music video for the song "Doing It for the Money".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=fosterthepeopleVEVO|title=Foster The People - Doing It for the Money|date=2017-08-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ1VorN9Cl0|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Guillaume de La Perrière - Le Théâtre des bons engins LX.jpg|thumb|Woodcut from [[Guillaume de La Perrière]], ''Le Théâtre des bons engins'', 1545.]]
An '''emblem book''' is a [[book]] collecting [[emblem]]s (allegorical illustrations) with accompanying explanatory text, typically morals or poems. This category of books was popular in Europe during the [[16th century in literature|16th]] and [[17th century in literature|17th centuries]].

Emblem books are collections of sets of three elements: an icon or image, a motto, and text explaining the connection between the image and motto.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|date=2011|publisher=The J. Paul Getty Museum|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|pages=92-93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text ranged in length from a few lines of verse to pages of prose.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; Emblem books descended from medieval bestiaries that explained the importance of animals, proverbs, and fables.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;  In fact, writers often drew inspiration from Greek and Roman sources such as [[Aesop's Fables]] and [[Plutarch's Lives]]. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

== Definition ==
{{quote|But if someone asks me what Emblemata really are? I will reply to him, that they are mute images, and nevertheless speaking: insignificant matters, and none the less of importance: ridiculous things, and nonetheless not without wisdom [...]|Jacob Cats, ''Voor-reden over de Proteus, of Minne-beelden, verandert in sinne-beelden''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al de werken van I. Cats|location= Amsterdamfirst= Jan Jacobsz. |last=Schipper|year= 1665|url=http://www.brill.com/sites/default/files/ftp/downloads/31773_Titlelist.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholars differ on the key question of whether the actual [[emblem]]s in question are the visual images, the accompanying texts, or the combination of the two.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} This is understandable, given that first emblem book, the ''[[Emblemata]]'' of [[Andrea Alciato]], was first issued in an unauthorized edition in which the [[woodcut]]s were chosen by the printer without any input from the author, who had circulated the texts in unillustrated manuscript form. It contained around a hundred short verses in Latin.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt; One image it depicted was the lute which symbolized the need for harmony instead of warfare in the city-states of Italy. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

Some early emblem books were unillustrated, particularly those issued by the French printer Denis de Harsy.&lt;!-- As of 3/2015, there is not even a French article on him.--&gt; With time, however, the reading public came to expect emblem books to contain picture-text combinations. Each combination consisted of a [[woodcut]] or [[engraving]] accompanied by one or more short texts, intended to inspire their readers to reflect on a general [[morality|moral]] lesson derived from the reading of both picture and text together. The picture was subject to numerous interpretations: only by reading the text could a reader be certain which meaning was intended by the author. Thus the books are closely related to the personal symbolic picture-text combinations called [[personal device]]s, known in Italy as ''{{Lang|it|imprese}}'' and in France as ''{{Lang|fr|devises}}''.  Many of the symbolic images present in emblem books were used in other contexts, on clothes, furniture, street signs, and the facades of buildings. &lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;  For instance, a sword and scales symbolized death.&lt;ref name="Books: A Living History" /&gt;

== Miscellany == &lt;!-- I'm not happy about the name of this headline, but I couldn't find a better name, and we need one to mark the end of the "Definition" section. --&gt;
Emblem books, both [[secular]] and [[religious]], attained enormous popularity throughout continental Europe, though in Britain they did not capture the imagination of readers to quite the same extent. The books were especially numerous in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France.

Many emblematic works borrowed plates or texts (or both) from earlier exemplars, as was the case with [[Geoffrey Whitney]]'s ''Choice of Emblemes'', a compilation which chiefly used the resources of the [[Plantin Press]] in Leyden.

Early European studies of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], like that of [[Athanasius Kircher]], assumed that the hieroglyphs were emblems, and imaginatively interpreted them accordingly.

A similar collection of emblems, but not in book form, is [[Lady Drury's Closet]].

{{Conservation status}}
[[File:Linces1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Iberian lynx]] (''Lynx pardinus''), an endangered species.]]
An '''endangered species''' is a [[species]] which has been categorized  as very likely to become [[Extinction|extinct]]. E&lt;!--Capital "E" as this is a specific IUCN category--&gt;ndangered (EN), as categorized by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List]], is the second most severe [[conservation status]] for wild populations in the IUCN's schema after [[Critically endangered|{{allow wrap|Critically Endangered}}]]&amp;nbsp;(CR).

In 2012, the IUCN Red List featured 3079 [[animal]] and 2655 [[plant]] species as endangered&amp;nbsp;(EN) worldwide.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf |title=IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EN, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List |accessdate=2012-12-31 |publisher=[[IUCN]] |year=2012 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures for 1998 were, respectively, 1102 and 1197.

Many nations have [[Environmental law|law]]s that protect [[conservation-reliant species]]: for example, forbidding [[hunting]], restricting [[land development]] or creating preserves. Population numbers, trends and species' conservation status can be found at the [[lists of organisms by population]].

{{main|Conservation status}}

The [[conservation status]] of a [[species]] indicates the likelihood that it will become [[extinct]].  Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natureserve.org/infonatura/Lnsstatus.htm |title=NatureServe Conservation Status |date=April 2007 |publisher=NatureServe |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/ |title=Threatened Species |publisher=Conservation and Wildlife |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913043721/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species |archivedate=September 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the [[United States]], such plans are usually called [[Endangered Species Recovery Plan|Species Recovery Plan]]s.

Though labelled a list, the [[IUCN Red List]] is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes "Data Deficient"&amp;nbsp;(DD) species&amp;nbsp;– species for which more data and assessment is required before their status may be determined&amp;nbsp;– as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of "[[Near-threatened species|Near Threatened]]"&amp;nbsp;(NT) and "[[Least concern|Least Concern]]"&amp;nbsp;(LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms "endangered species" and "threatened species" with particular meanings: "Endangered"&amp;nbsp;(EN) species lie between "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]"&amp;nbsp;(VU) and "[[Critically Endangered species|Critically Endangered]]"&amp;nbsp;(CR) species, while "Threatened" species are those species determined to be Vulnerable, Endangered or Critically Endangered.

The IUCN categories, with examples of animals classified by them, include:

== Endangered species in the United States ==
There is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]] (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Shogren|editor1-first=Jason F.|editor2-last=Tschirhart|editor2-first=John|title=Protecting Endangered Species in the United States: Biological Needs, Political Realities, Economic Choices|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521662109|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endangered Species Act===
[[File:Status ESA LE.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|"Endangered" in relation to "threatened" under the ESA.]]
Under the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] in the [[United States]], species may be listed as "endangered" or "threatened". The [[Salt Creek tiger beetle]] (''Cicindela nevadica lincolniana'') is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species, and adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove &amp; Master, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;414).

Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include: criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and criteria for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered; whether restrictions on land development constitute a "taking" of land by the [[government]]; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their lands; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from [[hunting|hunters]] and various industries like the [[petroleum industry]], [[construction]] industry, and [[logging]], has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws.

The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the [[Obama administration]], this policy has been reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/news/newsreleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=EE78C309-C119-D9DC-042421265ACD62A4|title=FWS.gov|author=|date=|website=fws.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Courchamp |first=Franck |author2=Elena Angulo |author3=Philippe Rivalan |author4=Richard J. Hall |author5=Laetitia Signoret |author6=Leigh Bull |author7=Yves Meinard |title=Rarity Value and Species Extinction: The Anthropogenic Allee Effect |publisher=PLoS Biology |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040415 |accessdate=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dharmananda |first=Subhuti |title=Endangered Species issues affecting turtles and tortoises used in Chinese medicine |publisher=Institute for Traditional Medicine, Portland, Oregon |url=http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0040415 |accessdate=2006-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the "shoot, shovel, and shut-up" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to silently kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat, thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/34933.html |title=Shoot, Shovel and Shut Up |work=Reasononline |publisher=Reason Magazine |date=2003-12-31 |accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973|Endangered Species Act]]&amp;nbsp;– which coined the term "endangered species"&amp;nbsp;– has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |title=USFWS Threatened and Endangered Species System (TESS) |publisher=U. S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |accessdate=2007-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728035106/http://ecos.fws.gov/tess_public/DelistingReport.do |archivedate=2007-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esasuccess.org/reports/|title=ESA Successes|author=|date=|website=www.esasuccess.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law.&lt;!--Too vague: &lt;ref&gt;Glenn, 2006 (webpage).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws as the Endangered Species Act. According to [[NatureServe conservation status|NatureServe's global conservation status]], approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.&lt;ref name="WM2008"&gt;Wilcove &amp; Master 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refpages|415|16}} Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction.&lt;ref name="WM2008"/&gt;{{refpage|416}} This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act.

[[File:2010-bald-eagle-kodiak.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Bald eagle]]
[[File:American bison k5680-1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|American bison]]
Ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over-hunting and fishing has been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the [[dodo]], [[passenger pigeon]], [[great auk]], [[Tasmanian tiger]] and [[Steller's sea cow]] are some of the more well known examples; with the [[bald eagle]], [[grizzly bear]], [[American bison]], [[Eastern timber wolf]] and [[sea turtle]] having been hunted to near-extinction.  Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or ''[[Bald eagle|Haliaeetus leucocephalus]]'' is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haliaeetus leucocephalus (Bald Eagle)|url = http://oldredlist.iucnredlist.org/details/22695144/0|website = www.iucnredlist.org|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A present-day example of the over-hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt reduction in whaling and increase population sizes, including prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).  But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as [[Japan]] continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of "scientific purposes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Bill |title=Endangered species |journal=Gale |year=2008 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list and could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.

== Invasive species ==
{{main|Introduced species}}

The introduction of non-indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chiras |first=Daniel D. |title=Invader Species |url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=3753825|journal=Grolier |year=2011 |series=Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[File:Dhole.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[dhole]], Asia's most endangered [[top predator]], is on the edge of extinction.]]

===Captive breeding===
{{main|Captive breeding}}
Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilize the population of the species that it will not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/ConservationAndScience/EndangeredSpecies/CapBreedPops/default.cfm |title=Captive Breeding Populations - National Zoo |publisher=Nationalzoo.si.edu |accessdate=2009-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the [[Père David's deer]]. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. [[hilsa]]). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced [[gene pool]] and reduce [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].

In 1981, the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) created a [[Species Survival Plan]] (SSP) in order to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding.  With over 450 SSP Plans, there are a number of endangered species that are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups.  These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and a number of other wildlife conservation efforts.  The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums.  Some animals that are part of SSP programs are [[giant pandas]], lowland gorillas, and [[California condors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =https://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|archive-url =https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090803071836/http://www.aza.org/species-survival-plan-program/|dead-url =yes|archive-date =2009-08-03|title =Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Programs|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private farming===
[[File:Ostafrikanisches Spitzmaulnashorn.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Black rhino]]
[[File:Thmac u0.gif|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Southern bluefin tuna]]
Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern [[black rhinoceros]] and southern [[white rhinoceros]]. Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, "Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into the conservation programmes. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping our work."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/hes-black-and-hes-back-private-enterprise-saves-southern-africas-rhino-from-extinction-848482.html He's black, and he's back!

Conservation experts view the effect of China's [[turtle farming]] on the wild turtle populations of China and South-Eastern Asia&amp;nbsp;– many of which are endangered&amp;nbsp;– as "poorly understood".&lt;ref name="scale"&gt;{{cite news |title=Evidence for the massive scale of turtle farming in China |last=Shi |first=Haitao |last2=Parham |first2=James F. |last3=Fan |first3=Zhiyong |last4=Hong |first4=Meiling |last5=Yin |first5=Feng |publication-date= |date=2008-01-01 |periodical=Oryx |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=42 |pages=147–150 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=1738732&amp;jid=ORX&amp;volumeId=42&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=1738724 |doi=10.1017/S0030605308000562 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with [[Turtle farming|farm-raised turtles]] in the marketplace&amp;nbsp;– the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the "visible" trade grew from around 30% in 2000 to around 70% in 2007&lt;ref name="ff"&gt;"[http://www.fishfarmer-magazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/993/Turtle_farms_threaten_rare_species,_experts_say.html Turtle farms threaten rare species, experts say] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218191219/http://www.fishfarmer-magazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/993/Turtle_farms_threaten_rare_species%2C_experts_say.html |date=2012-02-18 }}".

Their source is an article by James Parham, Shi Haitao and two other authors, published in February 2007 in the journal ''Conservation Biology''.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– they worry that many wild animals are caught to provide farmers with breeding stock.  The conservation expert Peter Paul van Dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock. Turtle farmers may, therefore, seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species.&lt;ref name="ff"/&gt;

In 2009, researchers in Australia managed to coax [[southern bluefin tuna]] to breed in landlocked tanks, raising the possibility that [[fish farming]] may be able to save the species from [[overfishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1945379_1944416_1944425,00.html The Top 10 Everything of 2009: Top 10 Scientific Discoveries: 5.

'''Ethnobotany''' is the study of a region's plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of a local culture and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/ethnobotany/|title=Ethnobotany|website=www.fs.fed.us|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethnobotanist thus strives to document the local customs involving the practical uses of local flora  for many aspects of life, such as plants as medicines, foods, and clothing.&lt;ref name=eplantscience&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eplantscience.com/index/ethnobotany.php|title=Ethnobotany|website=www.eplantscience.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Evans Schultes]], often referred to as the "father of ethnobotany",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/13/us/richard-e-schultes-86-dies-trailblazing-authority-on-hallucinogenic-plants.html|title=Richard E.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ethnobotany simply means ... investigating plants used by societies in various parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kochhar, S.

Since the time of Schultes, the field of ethnobotany has grown from simply acquiring ethnobotanical knowledge to that of applying it to a modern society, primarily in the form of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;Soejarto, D.D. et. al.

==History==
[[Image:Ojibweherbalistmedicine.png|thumb|Plants have been widely used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] healers, such as this [[Ojibwa]] man.]]
The idea of ethnobotany was first proposed by the early 20th century botanist [[John William Harshberger]].&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=James T.|title=The National cyclopædia of American biography ... v.21.|date=1931|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Harshberger did perform ethnobotanical research extensively, including in areas such as North Africa, Mexico, Scandinavia, and Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; it was not until [[Richard Evans Schultes]] began his trips into the Amazon that ethnobotany become a more well known science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponman, Bussmann|first1=Bruce E, Rainer W.|title=Medicinal Plants and the Legacy of Richard E. Schultes|year=2012|publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden|isbn=0984841520|url=http://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/mbalick/Balick_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice of ethnobotany is thought to have much earlier origins in the first century AD when a Greek physician by the name of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive botanical text detailing the medical and culinary properties of "over 600 mediterranean plants" named [[De Materia Medica]].&lt;ref name=eplantscience/&gt; Historians note that Dioscorides wrote about traveling often throughout the Roman empire, including regions such as "Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Petra",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mazal, Otto|title=Dioscorides: De Materia Medica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/materiamedica.html|website=Uchicago.edu|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so obtained substantial knowledge about the local plants and their useful properties. European botanical knowledge drastically expanded once the New World was discovered due to ethnobotany. This expansion in knowledge can be primarily attributed to the substantial influx of new plants from the Americas, including crops such as potatoes, peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/columbianb.htm|title=The Columbian Exchange, Native Americans and the Land, Nature Transformed, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center|website=nationalhumanitiescenter.org|publisher=[[National Humanities Center]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One French explorer in the 16th century, [[Jacques Cartier]],  learned a cure for scurvy (a tea made from boiling the bark of the Sitka Spruce) from a local [[Iroquois]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/treebook/sitkaspruce.htm|title=Sitka spruce|website=www.for.gov.bc.ca|place=[[British Columbia]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance==
During the medieval period, ethnobotanical studies were commonly found connected with [[Christian monasticism#Contributions|monasticism]]. Notable at this time was [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard von Bingen]]. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as [[physic garden]]s attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern [[anthropologist]] might approach ethnobotany today.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Age of Reason==
Carl Linnaeus carried out in 1732 a [[Expedition to Lapland|research expedition]] in Scandinavia asking the [[Sami people]] about their [[Ethnology|ethnological]] usage of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Before Boas: The Genesis of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology Series|author=Han F. Vermeulen|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780803277380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[age of enlightenment]] saw a rise in economic [[botanical]] exploration. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] collected data from the New World, and [[James Cook]]'s voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in 1759. The directors of the gardens sent out [[List of gardener-botanist explorers of the Enlightenment|gardener-botanist explorers]] to care for and collect plants to add to their collections.

As the 18th century became the 19th, ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clarke]] which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them. [[Edward Palmer (botanist)|Edward Palmer]] collected [[material culture]] artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West ([[Great Basin]]) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of "aboriginal botany" was established—the study of all forms of the vegetable world which [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal peoples]] use for food, medicine, [[textile]]s, ornaments and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Economic Botany: Principles and Practices|author=G.E. Wickens|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9789401009690|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and application in modern science==
The first individual to study the [[emic]] perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of the 19th century: Leopold Glück. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnobotany and Biocultural Diversities in the Balkans: Perspectives on Sustainable Rural Development and Reconciliation|editor=Andrea Pieroni, Cassandra L. Quave|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781493914920|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], Zuni plants (1915); [[Frank Hamilton Cushing|Frank Cushing]], Zuni foods (1920); [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, [[John Peabody Harrington]], and [[Barbara Freire-Marreco]], Tewa pueblo plants (1916).

In the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people's lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed cross-disciplinary data began.

Beginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called "father" of this discipline is [[Richard Evans Schultes]], even though he did not actually coin the term "ethnobotany". Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.

[[Mark Plotkin]], who studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and [[Tufts University]], has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the [[Tirio people]] of [[Suriname]] detailing their medicinal plants; ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' (1994); ''The Shaman's Apprentice,'' a children's book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and  ''Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets'' (2000).

Plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by ''[[South American Explorers|South American Explorer]]'' magazine, just after the release of ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' and the [[IMAX]] movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No medical system has all the answers—no shaman that I've worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I've been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn't be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems ([[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]], [[herbalism]], [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]], and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shaman's Apprentice|accessdate=May 2, 2018}} ''South American Explorer'', Autumn 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sood, S.K., Nath, R. and Kalia, D.C. 2001. ''Ethnobotany of Cold Desert Tribes of Lahoul-Spiti'' (''N.W. Himalaya''). Deep Publications, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In ''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing &amp; Chinese Medicine'' by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest [[David Winston]] describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing and Chinese Medicine'', by Hernan Garcia, Antonio Sierra, Hilberto Balam, and Jeff Connant&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist [[William N. Fenton]], in his work ''Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany'' (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explains that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient [[cosmological]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|volume=20|issue=2|publisher=American Indian Culture and Research Center, University of California|year=1996|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick’s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, J. W. (1995). ''Iroquois Medical Botany''. Syracuse, NY: [[Syracuse University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Cassandra Quave at Emory University has used ethnobotany to address the problems that arise from antibiotic resistance. Quave notes that the advantage of medical ethnobotany over Western medicine rests in the difference in mechanism. For example, elmleaf blackberry extract focuses instead on the prevention of bacterial collaboration as opposed to directly exterminating them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/could-ancient-remedies-hold-the-answer-to-the-looming-antibiotics-crisis.html|title=Could Ancient Remedies Hold the Answer to the Looming Antibiotics Crisis?|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{clarify section|reason=it should explain what kind of gender biases exist, and how they came to be|date=September 2017}}
Many instances of [[gender bias]] have occurred in ethnobotany, creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions. Anthropologists would often consult with primarily men. In Las Pavas, a small farming community in Panama, anthropologists drew conclusions about the entire community's use of plant from their conversations and lessons with mostly men. They consulted with 40 families, but the women only participated rarely in interviews and never joined them in the field. Due to the division of labor, the knowledge of wild plants for food, medicine, and fibers, among others, was left out of the picture, resulting in a distorted view of which plants were actually important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/163864/Gender_Bias_in_Ethnobotany_Propositions_and_Evidence_of_a_Distorted_Science_and_Promises_of_a_Brighter_Future|title=Gender Bias in Ethnobotany: Propositions and Evidence of a Distorted Science and Promises of a Brighter Future.|author=Howard, Patricia|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K0s__h3ipY|title=Gender bias in ethnobotany -- a legacy and process|publisher=TeachEthnobotany|date=2 July 2013|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ethnobotanists have also assumed that ownership of a resource means familiarity with that resource. In some societies women are excluded from owning land, while being the ones who work it. Inaccurate data can come from interviewing only the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeanine M. Pfeiffer|author2=Ramona J. Butz|year=2005|title=Assessing Cultural And Ecological Variation In Ethnobiological Research: The Importance Of Gender|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=envs_pub|journal=Journal of Ethnobiology|publisher=[[San Jose State University]]|volume=25|issue=2|pages=240–278|doi=10.2993/0278-0771(2005)25[240:ACAEVI]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other issues include ethical concerns regarding interactions with [[indigenous populations]], and the International Society of Ethnobiology has created a code of ethics to guide researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnobiology.net/what-we-do/core-programs/ise-ethics-program/code-of-ethics/|title=The ISE Code of Ethics - International Society of Ethnobiology|website=ethnobiology.net|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flores de Otero''''', 426 U.S. 572 (1976), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] that invalidated a state law that excluded [[alien (law)|aliens]] from the practice of [[civil engineering]]. The Court invalidated the law on the basis of [[equal protection]] using a [[strict scrutiny]] standard of review.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Examining Board v. Flores de Otero|volume=426|page=572|pin=|year=1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varat, J.D. et al.  ''Constitutional Law Cases and Materials, Concise Thirteenth Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2009, p. 667&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior history==
A [[Puerto Rico]] law permits only [[United States citizen]]s to practice privately as civil engineers. Appellees are alien civil engineers residing in Puerto Rico, one of whom (Flores de Otero) was denied a license under this law, and the other of whom (Perez Nogueiro) was granted only a conditional license to work for the Commonwealth.  Each appellee brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief against appellant Examining Board and its members in the [[United States District Court]] for the [[District of Puerto Rico]], claiming jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1343(3) and alleging that the statute's citizenship requirement violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

'''Foton''' (or Photon) is the project name of two series of [[Russia]]n science [[satellite]] and [[reentry vehicle]] programs. Although [[Unmanned space mission|unmanned]], the design was adapted from the manned [[Vostok spacecraft]] capsule.  The primary focus of the Foton project is [[materials science]] research, but some missions have also carried experiments for other fields of research including [[biology]].  The original Foton series included 12 launches from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]] from 1985 to 1999.  The second series, under the name '''Foton-M''', incorporates many design improvements over the original Foton, and is still in use.  So far, there have been four launch attempts of the Foton-M.  The first was in 2002 from the [[Plesetsk Cosmodrome]], which [[Foton-M1|ended in failure]] due to a problem in the launch vehicle.  The last three were from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], in 2005, 2007, and 2014; all were successful.  Both the Foton and Foton-M series used [[Soyuz-U]] (11A511U and 11A511U2) rockets as launch vehicles. Starting with the Foton-7 mission, the [[European Space Agency]] has been a partner in the Foton program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=facfoton | title = Foton | publisher = [[ESA]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060323090947/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=facfoton | archivedate = 2006-03-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foton-M==
'''Foton-M''' is a new generation of [[Russia]]n [[robotic spacecraft]] for research conducted in the [[microgravity]] environment of Earth [[orbit]]. The Foton-M design is based on the design of the [[Foton (space programs)|Foton]], with several improvements including a new [[telemetry]] and [[telecommand]] unit for increased data flow rate, increased [[battery (electricity)|battery]] capacity, and a better thermal control system. It is produced by [[Progress State Research and Production Rocket Space Center|TsSKB-Progress]] in [[Samara, Russia|Samara]].

The first launch, of [[Foton-M No.1|Foton-M1]], failed because of a malfunction of the [[Soyuz-U]] [[launch vehicle|launcher]]. The second launch, of [[Foton-M No.2|Foton-M2]], was, however, a success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMZDJ0DU8E_index_0.html | title = European experiments successfully launched aboard Foton spacecraft | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foton-M3 was launched on 14 September 2007 carried by a [[Soyuz-U]] rocket lifting off from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in Kazakhstan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMQDB13J6F_index_0.html | title = Lift-off for Foton microgravity mission | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Nadezhda (cockroach)|Nadezhda]], a cockroach that was the first earth creature  to produce offspring that had been conceived in space. It returned successfully to Earth on September 26, 2007, landing in [[Kazakhstan]] at 7:58 [[GMT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEMFVO6H07F_index_0.html |title=Foton-M3 experiments return to Earth |accessdate= 2007-09-26 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reentry ==
The Foton capsule has limited thruster capability. As such, the reentry path and orientation can not be controlled after the capsule has separated from the engine system. This means that the capsule has to be protected from reentry heat on all sides, thus explaining the spherical design (as opposed to Project Mercury's conical design), which allows for maximum volume while minimizing the external surface. However, the lack of lift means the capsule experiences high forces on reentry, up to 8 to 9g.

The '''Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory''' ('''GFDL''') is a laboratory in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) [[Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research]] (OAR). The current director is Dr. [[Venkatachalam Ramaswamy]]. It is one of seven NOAA Research Laboratories (RLs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Research Laboratories |publisher = NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research |date = |url = http://ci.noaa.gov/NOAAResearchLaboratories.aspx |accessdate = 2014-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GFDL is engaged in comprehensive long lead-time research to expand the scientific understanding of the physical processes that govern the behavior of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and the [[ocean]]s as [[Fluid mechanics|complex fluid systems]]. These systems can then be modeled mathematically and their [[Empirical research|phenomenology]] can be studied by computer simulation methods.

GFDL's accomplishments include the development of the first climate models to study global warming, the first comprehensive ocean prediction codes, and the first dynamical models with significant skill in hurricane track and intensity predictions. Much current research within the laboratory is focused around the development of Earth System Models for assessment of natural and human-induced climate change.

==Major accomplishments==
*The first global numerical simulations of the atmosphere — defining the basic structure of the numerical weather prediction and climate models that are still in use today throughout the world.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL|url=http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/mag104.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415022846/http://www.magazine.noaa.gov/stories/mag104.htm|archivedate=2012-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first numerical simulation of the world ocean.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;
*The initial definition and further elaborations of many of the central issues in global warming research, including water vapor feedback, polar amplification of temperature change, summer mid-continental dryness and cloud feedback.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;
*The first coupled atmosphere-ocean climate models and the first simulations of global warming using these models (including the above feedback processes and the potential weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation).&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;
*The development of a state-of-art hurricane model and its transfer to operations in the NOAA National Weather Service and the Navy.&lt;ref name="NOAA Magazine Article on GFDL"/&gt;

== Scientific groups ==
The GFDL has a diverse community of about 300 researchers, collaborators and staff, with many from Britain, India, China, Japan, France, etc. The laboratory is currently organized into several scientific groups (listed alphabetically below) as well as a large computer support group.

===Atmospheric physics, chemistry and climate===
Current head: Dr. Hiram Levy II

This group focuses on processes that affect the vertical structure of the atmosphere, such as convection and radiation. A particular focus is the role of aerosols in climate, both through direct effects on the radiative balance, and indirect effects on cloud physics.

===Climate and ecosystems===
Current head: Ron Stouffer

This group focuses on interactions between the physical climate
and biogeochemical systems, both in the land and ocean. Development of GFDL's Earth System Model is centered in this group.

===Climate diagnostics===
Current head: Dr. Ngar-Chung (Gabriel) Lau

This group focuses on comparing models with observations, developing observational datasets that can be compared with models, and using models to isolate key processes that regulate interannual variability in the ocean and atmosphere.

===Climate change, variability and prediction===
Current head: Dr. Tom Delworth

The largest group in the lab centers on the development
of numerical models for predictions and projections of climate
on seasonal-to-centennial time scales. Major projects include the development of El Nino predictions for seasonal forecasting, and the production of IPCC-class climate models.

===Oceans and climate ===
Current head: Dr. Robert Hallberg

This group focuses on the role played by the oceans in the large-scale climate system, and on developing state-of-the-art numerical codes to simulate the ocean.

===Weather and atmospheric dynamics===
Current head: Dr. [[Isaac Held]]

This group focuses on the dynamics of the atmosphere, with particular emphasis on the interactions between waves and turbulence and the large-scale flow. Development of GFDL's hurricane model is supported from this group.

== Facilities ==
The GFDL is located at [[Princeton University]]'s Forrestal Campus in Princeton, NJ.

Since March 2011, the GFDL no longer possesses an on-site [[supercomputer]]. They instead utilize a [[massively parallel]] [[Cray]] supercomputer with over 30,000 [[processor core]]s  which is currently located at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]]. This contrasts from their previous systems architecture, which consisted of eight [[Silicon Graphics]] [[Altix]] computers, each housing 1024 [[processor core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCRC website|url=http://www.ncrc.gov/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hardware updates occur on average, every 18 months.

The GFDL has been using high-performance computing systems to perform numerical modeling since the 1950s.

== Alumni ==
* [[Joseph Smagorinsky]]: GFDL's first director
* [[Jerry Mahlman]]: GFDL's second director
* Ants Leetmaa: GFDL's third director
* [[Kirk Bryan (American Oceanographer)]]
* [[Syukoro Manabe]]
* Yoshio Kurihara

[[File:Girih tiles2.svg|thumb|right|200px|Patterned Girih tiles]]
[[File:Girih tiles3.svg|thumb|right|200px|Construction lines are usually hidden: geometric tiles on left, girih pattern on right.]]
'''Girih tiles''' are a set of five [[tile]]s that were used in the creation of [[Islamic geometric patterns]] using [[strapwork]] ([[girih]]) for decoration of buildings in [[Islamic architecture]]. They have been used since about the year 1200 and their arrangements found significant improvement starting with the [[Darb-i Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]] in [[Iran]] built in 1453.

==Five tiles==

The five shapes of the tiles are:
* a regular [[decagon]] with ten interior angles of 144°;
* an elongated (irregular convex) [[hexagon]] with interior angles of 72°, 144°, 144°, 72°, 144°, 144°;
* a [[bow tie]] (non-convex hexagon) with interior angles of 72°, 72°, 216°, 72°, 72°, 216°;
* a [[rhombus]] with interior angles of 72°, 108°, 72°, 108°; and
* a regular [[pentagon]] with five interior angles of 108°.

These modules have their own specific Persian names:  The quadrilateral tile is called Torange,  the pentagonal tile is called Pange, the concave octagonal tile is called Shesh Band , the bow tie tile is called Sormeh Dan, decagram tile is called Tabl. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarhangi|first=Reza|date=|title=Interlocking Star Polygons in Persian Architecture: The Special Case of the Decagram in Mosaic Designs|url=|journal=Nexus Netw J|volume=14|pages=350|via=JSTORE}}&lt;/ref&gt;All sides of these figures have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s). All of them, except the pentagon, have bilateral (reflection) symmetry through two perpendicular lines. Some have additional symmetries. Specifically, the decagon has tenfold [[rotational symmetry]] (rotation by 36°); and the pentagon has fivefold rotational symmetry (rotation by 72°). 

== The Emergence of Girih Tiles ==
By the late 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic artists in North Africa start to use “tile mosaic”, which is the predecessor of tessellation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islam : art and architecture|last=Hattstein /Delius.|first=Markus/Peter|publisher=Potsdam : H.F. Ullmann|year=2013|isbn=3848003805|location=|pages=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; . By 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, the Islamic discovered a new way to construct the “tile mosaic” due to the development of arithmetic calculation and geometry—the girih tiles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lu/Steinhardt|first=Peter/Paul|date=2007|title=Decagonal and Quasi-Crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture|url=|journal=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20039057|volume=315|pages=2|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

==Girih==

[[Girih]] are lines ([[strapwork]]) that decorate the tiles. The tiles are used to form girih patterns, from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|[[wikt:گره#Persian|گره]]}}, meaning "knot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sebastian R. Prange |date=September–October 2009 | title = The Tiles of Infinity | journal = Saudi Aramco World | pages = 24–31 | url = http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200905/the.tiles.of.infinity.htm
}}{{deadlink|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In most cases, only the girih (and other minor decorations like flowers) are visible rather than the boundaries of the tiles themselves. The girih are piece-wise straight lines that cross the boundaries of the tiles at the center of an edge at 54° (3π/10) to the edge. Two intersecting girih cross each edge of a tile. Most tiles have a unique pattern of girih inside the tile that are continuous and follow the symmetry of the tile. However, the decagon has two possible girih patterns one of which has only fivefold rather than tenfold rotational symmetry.

== Mathematics of girih tilings ==


In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu|Peter J. Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt|Paul J. Steinhardt]] suggested that girih tilings possessed properties consistent with [[self-similar]] [[fractal]] [[quasicrystalline]] tilings such as [[Penrose tiling]]s, predating them by five centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Peter J. Lu and Paul J. Steinhardt | year = 2007 | title = Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 315 | pages = 1106–1110 | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5815/1106.full | doi = 10.1126/science.1135491
 | pmid = 17322056 | issue = 5815 | bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf Supplemental figures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326095515/http://www.physics.harvard.edu/~plu/publications/Science_315_1106_2007_SOM.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This finding was supported both by analysis of patterns on surviving structures, and by examination of 15th-century Persian scrolls. However, we have no indication of how much more the architects may have known about the mathematics involved. It is generally believed that such designs were constructed by drafting zigzag outlines with only a straightedge and a compass. Templates found on scrolls such as the 97-foot- (29.5 metres) long [[Topkapi Scroll]] may have been consulted. Found in the [[Topkapi Palace]] in Istanbul, the administrative center of the Ottoman Empire and believed to date from the late 15th century, the scroll shows a succession of two- and three- dimensional geometric patterns. There is no text, but there is a grid pattern and color-coding used to highlight symmetries and distinguish three-dimensional projections. Drawings such as shown on this scroll would have served as pattern-books for the artisans who fabricated the tiles, and the shapes of the girih tiles dictated how they could be combined into large patterns. In this way, craftsmen could make highly complex designs without resorting to mathematics and without necessarily understanding their underlying principles.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"&gt;{{cite book | author = Gulru Necipoglu  | year = 1995 | title = The Topkapi Scroll:  Geometry and Ornament in Islamic Architecture | publisher = Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of repeating patterns created from a limited number of geometric shapes available to craftsmen of the day is similar to the practice of contemporary European [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] artisans. Designers of both styles were concerned with using their inventories of geometrical shapes to create the maximum diversity of forms. This demanded a skill and practice very different from mathematics.&lt;ref name="Topkapi"/&gt;

=== Geometric construction of an interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design ===
Firstly, divide the right angle A into five parts with same degree by creating four rays that start from A. Find an arbitrary point C on the second ray and drop perpendiculars from C to the sides of angle A counter-clockwise. This step creates the rectangle ABCD along with four segments that each has an endpoint at A and other endpoints are the intersections of the four rays with the two sides of BC and DC of rectangle ABCD. Then, find the midpoint of the fourth segment created from the fourth ray point E. Construct an arc with center A and radius AE to intersect AB at point F and the second ray at point G. The second segment is now a part of the rectangle’s diagonal. Make a line, parallel to AD and passing through point G, that intersects the first ray at point H and the third ray at point I. The line HF passes through point E and intersects the third ray at L and line AD at J. Construct a line, passing through J which is parallel to the third ray. Also construct line EI and find M which is the intersection of this line with AD. From the point F make a parallel line to the third ray to meet the first ray at K. Construct segments GK, GL, and EM. Find the point N such that GI = IN by constructing a circle with center I and radius IG. Construct the line DN which is parallel to GK, to intersect the line emanate from J, to find P to complete the regular pentagon EINPJ. Line DN meets the perpendicular bisector of AB at Q. From Q construct a line parallel to FK to intersect ray MI at R. As shown in the figure, using O which is the center of the rectangle ABCD, as a center of rotation for 180°, one can make the fundamental region for the tiling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:WX20181125-203644@2x.png|thumb|An interlocking decagram-polygon mosaic design]]

=== Geometric construction of A tessellation from Mirza Akbar architectural scrolls ===
First, divide the right angle into five congruent angles, a arbitrary point P was selected on the first ray counterclockwise. For the radius of the circle inscribed in the decagram one half of the segment created from the third ray, segment AM, was selected. The following figure illustrates a step-by-step compass-straightedge visual solution to the problem by the author.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;Note that the way to divide a right angle into five congruent angles is not a part of the instructions provided, because it is considered an elementary step for designers.

&lt;/gallery&gt;The girih has been widely applied on the architecture. To begin with, the patterns on the Persian geometric windows meet the need of the Persian architecture. “The specific types of embellishments utilized in orosi typically linked the windows to the patron’s social and political eminence.”The more ornate a window is, the higher social and economic status the owner is more likely to have. A good example for this would be Azad Koliji. The Azad Koliji is a Dowlatabad Garden in Iran. With the girih patterns on its window, the architects successfully demonstrate multiple layers. The first layer would be the actual garden which people can have a glimpse at when they open the window. In addition to this natural layer, the first girih pattern on the outside of the window (the carved pattern. Another artificial layer would be the colorful glasses on the window. The multi-color layer create a sense of a mass of flowers. This layer is abstract which forms a clear contradiction with the real layer outside the window, and gives the audience enough space to imagine.

'''Human ecology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] and [[transdisciplinary]] study of the relationship between [[human]]s and their [[natural environment|natural]], [[Social environment|social]], and [[built environment]]s. The philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in [[ecology]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[zoology]], [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], and [[home economics]], among others.

==Historical development==
{{more|History of ecology}}
The roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the Greeks and a lengthy list of developments in [[natural history|natural history science]]. Ecology also has notably developed in other cultures. Traditional knowledge, as it is called, includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge, intelligent relations, understanding, and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Huntignton00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huntington | first1=H.

Like other contemporary researchers of his time, Haeckel adopted his terminology from [[Carl Linnaeus]] where human ecological connections were more evident. In his 1749 publication, ''Specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae'', Linnaeus developed a science that included the ''economy and polis of nature''. Polis stems from its Greek roots for a political community (originally based on the city-states), sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearce10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pearce | first1=T. | title=A great complication of circumstances | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | date=2010 | volume=43 | issue=3 | pages=493–528 | doi=10.1007/s10739-009-9205-0 | pmid=20665080 | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331011216/http://home.uchicago.edu/~/trpearce/Pearce2010.pdf | archivedate=2012-03-31 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kricher09"&gt;{{cite book | last1=Kricher | first1=J. | title=The balance of nature: Ecology's enduring myth | publisher=Princeton University Press | pages=252 | isbn=0-691-13898-2 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=G66yLaHLv2QC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Specimen+academicum+de+oeconomia+naturae+to+english#v=onepage&amp;q=Specimen%20academicum%20de%20oeconomia%20naturae&amp;f=false| date=2009-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Egerton07"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Egerton | first1=F.

Ecology is not just biological, but a human science as well.&lt;ref name="Odum05" /&gt; An early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was [[Herbert Spencer]]. Spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of Charles Darwin. Herbert Spencer coined the phrase "[[survival of the fittest]]", he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism, and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Catton94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Catton | first1=W.

In 1894, an influential [[Chicago school (sociology)|sociologist at the University of Chicago]] named [[Albion W. Small]], collaborated with sociologist [[George E. Vincent]] and published a "‘‘laboratory guide’’ to studying people in their ‘‘every-day occupations.’’"&lt;ref name="Gross04" /&gt;{{rp|578}} This was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study [[society]] in a way that a [[natural history|natural historian]] would study birds. Their publication "explicitly included the relation of the social world to the material environment."&lt;ref name="Gross04" /&gt;{{rp|578}}

The first English-language use of the term "ecology" is credited to American chemist and founder of the field of home economics, [[Ellen Swallow Richards]]. Richards first introduced the term as "[[oekology]]" in 1892, and subsequently developed the term "human ecology".&lt;ref name="Merchant2"/&gt;

The term "human ecology" was published in 1907 in [[Ellen Swallow Richards]] work "Sanitation in Daily Life", defined there as "the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Richards|first=Ellen H.|title=Sanitation in Daily Life|origyear=1907 |year=2012|publisher=Forgotten Books|asin=B008KX8KGA|pages=v.|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sanitation-Daily-Life-Classic-Reprint/dp/B008KX8KGA#reader_B008KX8KGA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature.&lt;ref name="Merchant2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Merchant|first=C.|title=American Environmental History: An Introduction|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0231140355|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book "Introduction to the Science of Sociology",&lt;ref name="Park21"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Park | editor1-first=R.

Human ecology has a fragmented academic history with developments spread throughout a range of disciplines, including: home economics, geography, anthropology, sociology, zoology, and psychology.

Human ecology has been defined as a type of analysis applied to the relations in human beings that was traditionally applied to plants and animals in ecology.&lt;ref name="Park36"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Park | first1=R. E. | date=1936 | title=Human ecology | journal=American Journal of Sociology | volume=42 | issue=1 | pages=1–15 | jstor=2768859 | doi=10.1086/217327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toward this aim, human ecologists (which can include [[sociologists]]) integrate diverse perspectives from a broad spectrum of disciplines covering "wider points of view".&lt;ref name="Borden08"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Borden | first1=R.J | title=A brief history of SHE: Reflections on the founding and first twenty five years of the Society for Human Ecology | journal=Human Ecology Review | volume=15 | issue=1 | date=2008 | pages=95–108 | url=http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her151/borden.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|107}} In its 1972 premier edition, the editors of ''[[Human Ecology (journal)|Human Ecology: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'' gave an introductory statement on the scope of topics in human ecology.&lt;ref name="HEJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Editors | title=Introductory statement | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=1 | date=1972 | jstor=4602239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their statement provides a broad overview on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic:

* Genetic, physiological, and social adaptation to the environment and to environmental change;
* The role of social, cultural, and psychological factors in the maintenance or disruption of ecosystems;
* Effects of population density on health, social organization, or environmental quality;
* New adaptive problems in urban environments;
* Interrelations of technological and environmental changes;
* The development of unifying principles in the study of biological and cultural adaptation;
* The genesis of maladaptions in human biological and cultural evolution;
* The relation of food quality and quantity to physical and intellectual performance and to demographic change;
* The application of computers, remote sensing devices, and other new tools and techniques&lt;ref name="HEJ" /&gt;{{rp|1}}

Forty years later in the same journal, [[Daniel Bates|Daniel G. Bates]] (2012)&lt;ref name="Bates12"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bates | first1=D. G. | title=On forty years: Remarks from the editor | journal=Hum. Ecol. | volume=40 | issue=1 | pages=1–4 | doi=10.1007/s10745-012-9461-z| date=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; notes lines of continuity in the discipline and the way it has changed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today there is greater emphasis on the problems facing individuals and how actors deal with them with the consequence that there is much more attention to decision-making at the individual level as people strategize and optimize risk, costs and benefits within specific contexts. Rather than attempting to formulate a cultural ecology or even a specifically “human ecology” model, researchers more often draw on demographic, economic and evolutionary theory as well as upon models derived from field ecology.&lt;ref name="Bates12" /&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While theoretical discussions continue, research published in ''[[Human Ecology Review]]'' suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology. Some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether. Scholarship has increasingly tended away from [[Gerald L. Young]]'s idea of a "unified theory" of human ecological knowledge—that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline—and more toward the pluralism best espoused by [[Paul Shepard]]: that human ecology is healthiest when "running out in all directions.".&lt;ref name="Shepard67"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Shepard | first1=P. | date=1967 | title=What ever happened to human ecology? | journal=BioScience | volume=17 | issue=12 | pages=891–894 | jstor=1293928 | doi = 10.2307/1293928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  But human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory, rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate, synthesize, and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature. This new human ecology emphasizes complexity over [[reductionism]], focuses on changes over stable states, and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people.

==Application to epidemiology and public health==
The application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications, with Carl Linnaeus having played a seminal role. However, the term appears to have come  into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Corwin EHL. Ecology of health. New York: Commonwealth Fund, 1949. Cited in le Riche WH, Milner J. Epidemiology as Medical Ecology.  Churchill Livingstone. Edinburgh and London. 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Audy | first1 = JR. | date = 1958 | title = Medical ecology in relation to geography | journal = British Journal of Clinical Practice | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 102–110 | pmid = 13510527 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was strengthened in 1971 by the publication of Epidemiology as Medical Ecology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=le Riche|first1=W.

Ecohealth research in practice: Innovative Applications of an Ecosystem Approach to Health. Springer, IDRC 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing in turn from the application of concepts such as the social-ecological model of health, human ecology has converged with the mainstream of global public health literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=F |last1=White |first2=L |last2=Stallones |first3=JM. |last3=Last |title=Global Public Health: Ecological Foundations|date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-975190-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection to home economics==
In addition to its links to other disciplines, human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of [[Ellen Swallow Richards]], among others. However, as early as the 1960s, a number of universities began to rename home economics departments, schools, and colleges as human ecology programs. In part, this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term home economics in a modernizing society, and reflects a recognition of human ecology as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become home economics.&lt;ref name=Cornell&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Change to Human Ecology?|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/homeEc/cases/namechange.html|publisher=Cornell University |accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current human ecology programs include [[Cornell University College of Human Ecology]] and the University of Alberta's Department of Human Ecology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Alberta Department of Human Ecology|url=http://www.hecol.ualberta.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.

Nature is a [[Resilience (ecology)|resilient]] system. Ecosystems regenerate, withstand, and are forever adapting to fluctuating environments. Ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time. However, persistent, systematic, large and nonrandom disturbance caused by the niche constructing behavior of human beings, habitat conversion and land development, has pushed many of the Earth's ecosystems to the extent of their resilient thresholds. Three planetary thresholds have already been crossed, including [[biodiversity loss]], [[climate change]], and [[nitrogen cycle]]s. These biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and naturally resilient, but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an [[Anthropocene]] epoch, where the threshold for planetary scale resilience has been crossed and the ecological state of the Earth is deteriorating rapidly to the detriment of humanity.&lt;ref name="Rockström09"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Rockström |first = W. |last2 = Noone |first2 = K. |last3=Persson| first3=A. | last4=Chapin| first4=S. | last5=Lambin | first5=E.

[[Ecological economics]] is an [[economics|economic science]] that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss.&lt;ref name="de Groot02" /&gt; Natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities.&lt;ref name="Costanza97"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Costanza, R. |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |pages=253–260 |date=1997 |url=http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |ref=harv |issue=6630 |display-authors=1 |last2=d'Arge |first2=Ralph |last3=De Groot |first3=Rudolf |last4=Farber |first4=Stephen |last5=Grasso |first5=Monica |last6=Hannon |first6=Bruce |last7=Limburg |first7=Karin |last8=Naeem |first8=Shahid |last9=O'Neill |first9=Robert V. |last10=Paruelo |first10=Jose |last11=Raskin |first11=Robert G. |last12=Sutton |first12=Paul |last13=Van Den Belt |first13=Marjan |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226124242/http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Nature_Paper.pdf |archivedate=2009-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services.

The work of [[Kenneth E. Boulding]] is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins. Boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics, most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system, and indicated that the “household of man” and the “household of nature” could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value.&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, K.E. 1950. ''An Ecological Introduction''.  In A Reconstruction of Economics, Wiley, New York. pp. 3-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boulding, K.E. 1966. ''Economics and Ecology''.

==Interdisciplinary approaches==
{{quote box
| quote =
Human ecology may be defined: (1) from a bio-ecological standpoint as the study of man as the ecological dominant in plant and animal communities and systems; (2) from a bio-ecological standpoint as simply another animal affecting and being affected by his physical environment; and (3) as a human being, somehow different from animal life in general, interacting with physical and modified environments in a distinctive and creative way. A truly interdisciplinary human ecology will most likely address itself to all three.&lt;ref name="Young74" /&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}
| width = 30%
| align = right}}

Human ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind. People's perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate, both in time and in space. This concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability: "think global, act local." Moreover, people's conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from "community as place, community as way of life, or community of collective action."&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;

In these early years, human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines: geography, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. Scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research.&lt;ref name="Young74"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07" /&gt;

===In art===

While some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology, it was Sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art. [[Bill Carpenter (writer)|Bill Carpenter]] (1986) calls human ecology the "possibility of an aesthetic science," renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective. According to Carpenter, human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, B. 1986. ''Human Ecology: The Possibility of an Aesthetic Science''. Paper presented at the Society for Human Ecology conference.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In education===

While the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing, there is no human ecology at the primary and secondary education levels. Educational theorist Sir [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Kenneth Robinson]] has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic (i.e.- educate their “whole being”) activities to implement a “new conception of human ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K. 2006. TED Talk, http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioregionalism and urban ecology==
{{main article|Bioregionalism}}
{{see also|Urban ecology}}

In the late 1960s, ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields, namely [[architecture]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[planning]]. [[Ian McHarg]] called for a future when all planning would be “human ecological planning” by default, always bound up in humans’ relationships with their environments. He emphasized local, place-based planning that takes into consideration all the “layers” of information from [[geology]] to [[botany]] to zoology to [[cultural history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McHarg | first1 = I. | date = 1981 | title = Ecological Planning at Pennsylvania | url = | journal = Landscape Planning | volume = 8 | issue = 2| pages = 109–120 | doi=10.1016/0304-3924(81)90029-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the [[new urbanism]] movement, like [[James Howard Kunstler]] and [[Andres Duany]], have embraced the term human ecology as way to describe the problem of—and prescribe the solutions for—the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society. Duany has called the human ecology movement to be "the agenda for the years ahead."&lt;ref&gt;In Kunstler, J.H. 1994. ''The Geography of Nowhere''. New York:Touchstone. pp.260&lt;/ref&gt; While McHargian planning is still widely respected, the [[landscape urbanism]] movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations.  Among these theorists is [[Frederich Steiner]], who published ''Human Ecology: Following Nature's Lead'' in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape, culture, and planning. The work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology.  While Steiner discusses specific ecological settings, such as cityscapes and waterscapes, and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions, he also takes a diverse approach to ecology—considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and [[political geography]]. [[Deiter Steiner]]'s 2003 ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary'' view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology.  Part literature review, the book is divided into four sections: "human ecology", "the implicit and the explicit", "structuration", and "the regional dimension".&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, D. and M. Nauser (eds.). 1993. ''Human Ecology: Fragments of Anti-fragmentary Views of the World.'' London and New York: Routledge. Human Ecology Forum 108 ''Human Ecology Review'', 2008; Vol. 15, No. 1,&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity, antidualism, and wholeness of perspective.

The '''hydrogen anion''', H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, is a [[Electric charge|negative]] [[ion]] of hydrogen, &lt;!-- don’t link as [[hydrogen ion]], it’s a set index! --&gt;that is, a [[hydrogen atom]] that has captured an extra electron. The hydrogen anion is an important constituent of the atmosphere of [[star]]s, such as the [[Sun]].  In chemistry, this ion is called '''[[hydride]]'''. The ion has [[Two-electron atom|two electrons]] bound by the [[electromagnetic force]] to a nucleus containing one proton.

The binding energy of H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; equals the binding energy of an extra electron to a hydrogen atom, called [[electron affinity]] of hydrogen. It is measured to be {{val|0.754195|(19)|ul=eV}} or {{val|0.0277161|(62)|ul=hartree}} (see [[Electron affinity (data page)]]). The total ground state energy thus becomes {{val|-14.359888|u=eV}}.

==Occurrence==
The hydrogen anion is an important species in the photosphere of the Sun. It absorbs energies in the range 0.75–4.0 [[electronvolt|eV]], which ranges from the [[infrared]] into the [[visible spectrum]] ({{harvnb|Rau|1999}}, {{harvnb|Srinivasan|1999}}). It also occurs in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] ({{harvnb|Rau|1999}}), and can be produced in particle accelerators.

Its existence was first proven theoretically by [[Hans Bethe]] in 1929 ({{harvnb|Bethe|1929}}). H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is unusual because, in its free form, it has no [[bound state|bound]] [[energy level|excited states]], as was finally proven in 1977 ({{harvnb|Hill|1977}}). It has been studied experimentally using [[particle accelerator]]s ({{harvnb|Bryant|1977}}).

In chemistry, the [[hydride]] anion is hydrogen that has the formal [[oxidation state]] −1.

The term hydride is probably most often used to describe compounds of hydrogen with other elements in which the hydrogen is in the formal −1 [[oxidation state]].  In most such compounds the bonding between the hydrogen and its nearest neighbor is covalent. An example of a hydride is the [[borohydride]] anion ({{chem|BH|4|-}}).

In [[computational complexity theory]], an '''interactive proof system''' is an [[abstract machine]] that models [[computation]] as the exchange of messages between two parties. The parties, the verifier and the prover, interact by exchanging messages in order to ascertain whether a given [[string (computer science)|string]] belongs to a [[formal language|language]] or not. The prover is all-powerful and possesses unlimited computational resources, but cannot be trusted, while the verifier has bounded computation power. Messages are sent between the verifier and prover until the verifier has an answer to the problem and has "convinced" itself that it is correct.

All interactive proof systems have two requirements:
* '''Completeness''': if the statement is true, the honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) can be convinced of this fact by an untrusted prover.
* '''[[Soundness (interactive proof)|Soundness]]''': if the statement is false, no prover, even if it doesn't follow the protocol, can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small [[probability]].

It is assumed that the verifier is always honest.

The specific nature of the system, and so the [[complexity class]] of languages it can recognize, depends on what sort of bounds are put on the verifier, as well as what abilities it is given&amp;mdash;for example, most interactive proof systems depend critically on the verifier's ability to make random choices. It also depends on the nature of the messages exchanged&amp;mdash;how many and what they can contain. Interactive proof systems have been found to have some important implications for traditional complexity classes defined using only one machine. The main complexity classes describing interactive proof systems are '''[[AM (complexity)|AM]]''' and  '''[[IP (complexity)|IP]]'''.

== NP ==

The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]] may be viewed as a very simple proof system. In this system, the verifier is a deterministic, polynomial-time machine (a [[P (complexity)|P]] machine). The protocol is:
* The prover looks at the input and computes the solution using its unlimited power and returns a polynomial-size proof certificate.
* The verifier verifies that the certificate is valid in deterministic polynomial time. If it is valid, it accepts; otherwise, it rejects.

In the case where a valid proof certificate exists, the prover is always able to make the verifier accept by giving it that certificate. In the case where there is no valid proof certificate, however, the input is not in the language, and no prover, however malicious it is, can convince the verifier otherwise, because any proof certificate will be rejected.

== Arthur–Merlin and Merlin–Arthur protocols ==
{{main|Arthur–Merlin protocol}}
Although NP may be viewed as using interaction, it wasn't until 1985 that the concept of computation through interaction was conceived (in the context of complexity theory) by two independent groups of researchers. One approach, by  [[László Babai]], who published "Trading group theory for randomness",&lt;ref&gt;László Babai. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=22192 Trading group theory for randomness]. ''Proceedings of the Seventeenth Annual Symposium on the Theory of Computing'', ACM. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; defined the ''Arthur–Merlin'' ('''AM''') class hierarchy. In this presentation, Arthur (the verifier) is a [[probabilistic Turing machine|probabilistic]], polynomial-time machine, while Merlin (the prover) has unbounded resources.

The class '''MA''' in particular is a simple generalization of the NP interaction above in which the verifier is probabilistic instead of deterministic. Also, instead of requiring that the verifier always accept valid certificates and reject invalid certificates, it is more lenient:
* '''Completeness:''' if the string is in the language, the prover must be able to give a certificate such that the verifier will accept with probability at least 2/3 (depending on the verifier's random choices).
* '''Soundness:''' if the string is not in the language, no prover, however malicious, will be able to convince the verifier to accept the string with probability exceeding 1/3.

This machine is potentially more powerful than an ordinary NP [[interaction protocol]], and the certificates are no less practical to verify, since '''BPP''' algorithms are considered as abstracting practical computation (see [[Bounded-error probabilistic polynomial|BPP]]).

== Public coin protocol versus private coin protocol ==

In a ''public coin'' protocol, the random choices made by the verifier are made public. They remain private in a private coin protocol.

In the same conference where Babai defined his proof system for '''MA''', [[Shafi Goldwasser]], [[Silvio Micali]] and [[Charles Rackoff]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Goldwasser | first1=S. | last2=Micali | first2=S. | last3=Rackoff | first3=C. | title=The knowledge complexity of interactive proof systems | url=http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/COMP647/2007/TOPIC02/GMR89.pdf | publisher=[[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] | location=Philadelphia | year=1989 | journal=SIAM Journal on Computing | issn=1095-7111 | volume=18 | issue=1 | pages=186–208 | doi=10.1137/0218012}} [http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/pubs/shafi/1985-stoc.pdf Extended abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; published a paper defining the interactive proof system '''IP'''[''f''(''n'')]. This has the same machines as the '''MA''' protocol, except that ''f''(''n'') ''rounds'' are allowed for an input of size ''n''. In each round, the verifier performs computation and passes a message to the prover, and the prover performs computation and passes information back to the verifier. At the end the verifier must make its decision. For example, in an '''IP'''[3] protocol, the sequence would be VPVPVPV, where V is a verifier turn and P is a prover turn.

In Arthur–Merlin protocols, Babai defined a similar class '''AM'''[''f''(''n'')] which allowed ''f''(''n'') rounds, but he put one extra condition on the machine: the verifier must show the prover all the random bits it uses in its computation. The result is that the verifier cannot "hide" anything from the prover, because the prover is powerful enough to simulate everything the verifier does if it knows what random bits it used. This is called a ''public coin'' protocol, because the random bits ("coin flips") are visible to both machines. The '''IP''' approach is called a ''private coin'' protocol by contrast.

The essential problem with public coins is that if the prover wishes to maliciously convince the verifier to accept a string which is not in the language, it seems like the verifier might be able to thwart its plans if it can hide its internal state from it. This was a primary motivation in defining the '''IP''' proof systems.

In 1986, Goldwasser and [[Michael Sipser|Sipser]]&lt;ref&gt;Shafi Goldwasser and Michael Sipser. [http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/pubs/shafi/1986-stoc.pdf Private coins versus public coins in interactive proof systems]. ''Proceedings of ACM STOC'86'', pp. 58–68. 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  showed, perhaps surprisingly, that the verifier's ability to hide coin flips from the prover does it little good after all, in that an Arthur–Merlin public coin protocol with only two more rounds can recognize all the same languages. The result is that public-coin and private-coin protocols are roughly equivalent.  In fact, as Babai shows in 1988, '''AM'''[''k'']='''AM''' for all constant ''k'', so the '''IP'''[''k''] have no advantage over '''AM'''.&lt;ref&gt;László Babai and [[Shlomo Moran]]. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=49987 Arthur–Merlin games: a randomized proof system, and a hierarchy of complexity classes]. ''Journal of Computer and System Sciences'', 36: p.254–276. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

To demonstrate the power of these classes, consider the [[graph isomorphism problem]], the problem of determining whether it is possible to permute the vertices of one graph so that it is identical to another graph. This problem is in '''NP''', since the proof certificate is the permutation which makes the graphs equal. It turns out that the 
[[complement (complexity)|complement]] of the graph isomorphism problem, a co-'''NP''' problem not known to be in '''NP''', has an '''AM''' algorithm and the best way to see it is via a private coins algorithm.&lt;ref name="O. Goldreich, S. Micali 1991"&gt;O. Goldreich, S. Micali, A. Wigderson. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=116852 Proofs that yield nothing but their validity]. ''Journal of the ACM'', volume 38, issue 3, p.690–728. July 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

== IP ==
{{main|IP (complexity)}}
Private coins may not be helpful, but more rounds of interaction are helpful. If we allow the probabilistic verifier machine and the all-powerful prover to interact for a polynomial number of rounds, we get the class of problems called '''IP'''.
In 1992, [[Adi Shamir]] revealed in one of the central results of complexity theory that '''IP''' equals '''[[PSPACE]]''', the class of problems solvable by an ordinary [[deterministic Turing machine]] in polynomial space.&lt;ref&gt;Adi Shamir. [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=146585.146609 IP = PSPACE]. ''Journal of the ACM'', volume 39, issue 4, p.869–877. October 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

== QIP ==
{{main|QIP (complexity)}}
If we allow the elements of the system to use [[quantum computation]], the system is called a '''quantum interactive proof system''', and the corresponding complexity class is called '''QIP'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1012.4427v2|author1=Tsuyoshi Ito|author2=Hirotada Kobayashi|author3=John Watrous|title=Quantum interactive proofs with weak error bounds|class=quant-ph|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of recent results culminating in a paper published in 2010 is believed to have demonstrated that '''QIP''' = '''PSPACE'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Jain | first1=Rahul | last2=Ji | first2=Zhengfeng | last3=Upadhyay | first3=Sarvagya | last4=Watrous | first4=John | author4-link=John Watrous (computer scientist) | title=STOC '10: Proceedings of the 42nd ACM symposium on Theory of computing | publisher=ACM | isbn=978-1-4503-0050-6 | year=2010 | chapter=QIP = PSPACE | pages=573–582 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aaronson | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1145/1859204.1859230 | title = QIP = PSPACE breakthrough | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 53 | pages = 101 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zero knowledge ==
{{main|Zero-knowledge proof}}
Not only can interactive proof systems solve problems not believed to be in '''NP''', but under assumptions about the existence of [[one-way function]]s, a prover can convince the verifier of the solution without ever giving the verifier information about the solution. This is important when the verifier cannot be trusted with the full solution.  At first it seems impossible that the verifier could be convinced that there is a solution when the verifier has not seen a certificate, but such proofs, known as [[zero-knowledge proof]]s are in fact believed to exist for all problems in '''NP''' and are valuable in [[cryptography]]. Zero-knowledge proofs were first mentioned in the original 1985 paper on '''IP''' by Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff, but the extent of their power was shown by [[Oded Goldreich]], [[Silvio Micali]] and [[Avi Wigderson]].&lt;ref name="O. Goldreich, S. Micali 1991"/&gt;

== MIP ==
One goal of '''IP''''s designers was to create the most powerful possible interactive proof system, and at first it seems like it cannot be made more powerful without making the verifier more powerful and so impractical. Goldwasser et al. overcame this in their 1988 "Multi prover interactive proofs: How to remove intractability assumptions", which defines a variant of '''IP''' called '''MIP''' in which there are ''two'' independent provers.&lt;ref name="M. Ben-or, Shafi Goldwasser 1988"&gt;M. Ben-or, Shafi Goldwasser, J. Kilian, and A. Wigderson. [http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~cis/pubs/shafi/1988-stoc-bgkw.pdf Multi prover interactive proofs: How to remove intractability assumptions]. ''Proceedings of the 20th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing'', pp. 113–121. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The two provers cannot communicate once the verifier has begun sending messages to them. Just as it's easier to tell if a criminal is lying if he and his partner are interrogated in separate rooms, it's considerably easier to detect a malicious prover trying to trick the verifier into accepting a string not in the language if there is another prover it can double-check with.

In fact, this is so helpful that Babai, Fortnow, and Lund were able to show that '''MIP''' = '''[[NEXPTIME]]''', the class of all problems solvable by a [[nondeterministic Turing machine|nondeterministic]] machine in ''exponential time'', a very large class.&lt;ref&gt;László Babai, L. Fortnow, and C. Lund. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/15039.html Non-deterministic exponential time has two-prover interactive protocols]. ''Computational Complexity'', volume 1, pp. 3–40. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; NEXPTIME contains PSPACE, and is believed to strictly contain PSPACE. Adding a constant number of additional provers beyond two does not enable recognition of any more languages. This result paved the way for the celebrated [[PCP theorem]],  which can be considered to be a "scaled-down" version of this theorem.

'''MIP''' also has the helpful property that zero-knowledge proofs for every language in '''NP''' can be described without the assumption of one-way functions that '''IP''' must make. This has bearing on the design of provably unbreakable cryptographic algorithms.&lt;ref name="M. Ben-or, Shafi Goldwasser 1988"/&gt; Moreover, a '''MIP''' protocol can recognize all languages in '''IP''' in only a constant number of rounds, and if a third prover is added, it can recognize all languages in '''NEXPTIME''' in a constant number of rounds, showing again its power over '''IP'''.

== PCP ==
{{main|Probabilistically checkable proof}}
While the designers of '''IP''' considered generalizations of Babai's interactive proof systems, others considered restrictions. A very useful interactive proof system is '''PCP'''(''f''(''n''), ''g''(''n'')), which is a restriction of '''MA''' where Arthur can only use ''f''(''n'') random bits and can only examine ''g''(''n'') bits of the proof certificate sent by Merlin (essentially using [[random access]]).

There are a number of easy-to-prove results about various '''PCP''' classes. {{tmath|1=\mathsf{PCP}(0,\mathsf{poly})}}, the class of polynomial-time machines with no randomness but access to a certificate,  is just '''NP'''. {{tmath|1=\mathsf{PCP}(\mathsf{poly},0)}}, the class of polynomial-time machines with access to polynomially many random bits is '''co-[[RP (complexity)|RP]]'''. Arora and Safra's first major result was that {{sans-serif|1= PCP(log, log) = NP }}; put another way, if the verifier in the '''NP''' protocol is constrained to choose only {{tmath|O(\log n)}} bits of the proof certificate to look at, this won't make any difference as long as it has {{tmath|O(\log n)}} random bits to use.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjeev Arora and [[Shmuel Safra]]. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/arora92probabilistic.html Probabilistic Checking of Proofs: A New Characterization of NP]. ''Journal of the ACM'', volume 45, issue 1, pp. 70–122. January 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the [[PCP theorem]] asserts that the number of proof accesses can be brought all the way down to a constant. That is, {{tmath|1=\mathsf{NP} = \mathsf{PCP}(\mathsf{log}, O(1))}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjeev Arora, C. Lund, R. Motwani, M. Sudan, and M. Szegedy. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/376426.html Proof Verification and the Hardness of Approximation Problems]. Proceedings of the 33rd IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 13–22. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; They used this valuable characterization of '''NP''' to prove that [[approximation algorithm]]s do not exist for the optimization versions of certain [[NP-complete]] problems unless [[P = NP]]. Such problems are now studied in the field known as [[hardness of approximation]].

A '''liana''' is any of various long-[[Plant stem|stemmed]], [[Woody plant|woody]] [[vine]]s that are [[root]]ed in the soil at ground level and use trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] to get access to well-lit areas of the forest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/338786/liana |title=liana|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lianas are characteristic of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist deciduous forests]] (especially [[Tropical seasonal forest|seasonal forests]]), but may be found in [[temperate rainforests]]. There are also [[temperate]] lianas, for example the members of the ''[[Clematis]]'' or ''[[Vitis]]'' (wild grape) genera. Lianas can form bridges amidst the forest canopy, providing [[Arboreal locomotion|arboreal]] animals with paths across the forest. These bridges can protect weaker trees from strong winds. Lianas compete with forest trees for sunlight, water and nutrients from the soil.&lt;ref name="SCHNITZER-BONGERS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schnitzer |first1=S. A. |last2=Bongers |first2=F. |year=2002 |title=The ecology of lianas and their role in forests |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=223–230 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02491-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forests without lianas grow 150% more fruit; trees with lianas have twice the probability of dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Landers|first1=Jackson|title=Tarzan's Favorite Mode of Travel, the Liana Vine, Chokes Off a Tree's Ability to Bear Fruit|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/tarzans-mode-travel-liana-vine-chocking-tropical-forests-180963636/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "liana" is not a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] grouping, but rather a description of the way the plant grows – much like "[[tree]]" or "[[shrub]]". Lianas may be found in many different plant [[family (biology)|families]]. One way of distinguishing lianas from trees and shrubs is based on the [[stiffness]], specifically, the [[Young's modulus]] of various parts of the stem. Trees and shrubs have young twigs and smaller branches which are quite flexible and older growth such as [[Trunk (botany)|trunks]] and large branches which are stiffer. A liana often has stiff young growths and older, more flexible growth at the base of the stem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.3732/ajb.92.8.1381 | title = Evolution of shrub-like growth forms in the lianoid subfamily Secamonoideae (Apocynaceae s.l.) of Madagascar: phylogeny, biomechanics, and development | year = 2005 | author = Lahaye, R. | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 92 | pages = 1381–96 | last2 = Civeyrel | first2 = L. | last3 = Speck | first3 = T. | last4 = Rowe | first4 = N.

For example, in the Eastern [[tropical forest]]s of [[Madagascar]], many [[lemur]]s achieve higher mobility from the web of lianas draped amongst the vertical tree species. Many lemurs prefer trees with lianas for their roost sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rendigs |first1=A. |last2=Radespiel |first2=U. |last3=Wrogemann |first3=D. |last4=Zimmermann |first4=E. |year=2003 |title=Relationship between microhabitat structure and distribution of mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.) in northwestern Madagascar |journal=International Journal of Primatology |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=47–64 |doi=10.1023/A:1021494428294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lianas also provide support for trees when strong winds blow.&lt;ref name="GarridoPerez"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrido-Pérez |first1=E.

As noted by [[Charles Darwin]], because lianas are supported by other plants, they may conserve resources that other plants must allocate to the development of structure and use them instead for growth and reproduction. In general, lianas are detrimental to the trees that support them. Growth rates are lower for trees with lianas; they directly damage hosts by mechanical abrasion and strangulation, render hosts more susceptible to ice and wind damage, and increase the probability that the host tree falls. Lianas also make the canopy of trees more accessible to animals which eat leaves. Because of these negative effects, trees which remain free of lianas are at an advantage; some species have evolved characteristics which help them avoid or shed lianas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/2387889| jstor = 2387889| pages = 19–23| title = How trees avoid and shed lianas| journal = Biotropica| volume = 16| issue = 1| year = 1984| author1 = Putz | first1 = F.

The '''Lifting Operations Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998''' (LOLER) are set of regulations created under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]] which came into force in Great Britain on 5 December 1998 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1998/2307/contents/made|title=Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Citation Ltd|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced a number of other pieces of legislation which covered the use of [[lifting equipment]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Lifting+Operations+and+Lifting+Equipment+Regulations+1998&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;filesize=66680 Statute Law - Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment regulations 1998 - schedule 2, revocation of instruments] The regulations replaced the 'Quarries (Ropeways and Vehicles) Regulations 1958', 'Construction (Lifting Operations) Regulations 1961', 'Offices, Shops and Railway Premises (Hoists and Lifts) Regulations 1968', 'Offshore Installations (Operational Safety, Health and Welfare) Regulations 1976', 'The Hoists and Lifts (Metrication) Regulations 1983', 'The Construction (Metrication) Regulations 1984', 'The Health and Safety (Miscellaneous Modifications) Regulations 1989', 'The Lifting Plant and Equipment (Records of Test and Examination etc.) Regulations 1992'&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of the regulations was to reduce the risk of injury from lifting equipment used at work.&lt;ref name="HSE simple guide"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg290.pdf HSE - Simple guide to the Lifting Operations and Lifting equipment regulations 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;  Areas covered in the regulations include the requirement for lifting equipment to be strong and stable enough for safe use and to be marked to indicate safe working loads; ensuring that any equipment is positioned and installed so as to minimise risks; that the equipment is used safely ensuring that work is planned, organised and performed by a competent person; that equipment is subject to ongoing thorough examination and where appropriate, inspection by competent people.&lt;ref name="HSE simple guide"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifting equipment==
The regulations define lifting equipment as "work equipment for lifting or lowering loads and includes its attachments used for anchoring, fixing or supporting it".&lt;ref name="mid suffolk"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/lift-equipment.htm What is lifting equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations involve anything which involves the lifting of goods or people at work. Equipment covered would include lifts, cranes, ropes, slings, hooks, shackles, eyebolts, rope and pulley systems and forklift trucks.&lt;ref name="LHC LOLER"&gt;[http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/71fact.htm London Hazards Centre - Lifting Operations Lifiting Equipment Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324061410/http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/71fact.htm |date=2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations apply to all workplaces and all the provisions of the '[[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998]]' also apply to lifting equipment.&lt;ref name="LHC LOLER"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe working load===
A [[safe working load]] (SWL) should, according to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on the configuration of the equipment, accessories for lifting such as eye bolts, lifting magnets and lifting beams should also be marked.&lt;ref name="loler 98"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Lifting+Operations+and+Lifting+Equipment+Regulations+1998&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;filesize=66680 Loler 1998 - Regulation 7]&lt;/ref&gt;  The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely.  Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.&lt;ref name="loler 98"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passenger lifts===
The regulations stated that all lifts provided for use with work activities should be thoroughly examined by a 'competent person' at regular intervals.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 9 of the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations requires all employers to have their equipment thoroughly examined prior to it being put into service and after there has been any major alteration that could affect its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/passenger-lifts.htm passenger lifts]  Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER&lt;/ref&gt; Owners or people responsible for the safe operation of a lift at work are known as 'dutyholders' and have a responsibility to ensure that the lift has been thoroughly examined and is safe to use.  Lifts when in use should be thoroughly examined every six months if, at any time, the lift has been used to carry people.  Lifts used to only carry loads should be examined every 12 months.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Any substantial or significant changes should have been made to the equipment then this would also require an examination as would any change in operating condition which is likely to affect the integrity of the equipment.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg339.pdf HSE - Thorough examination and testing of lifts - simple guidance]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LOLER Inspections ===
These are a legal requirement and should be carried out by a competent person, usually your insurance company will request a 3rd party independent Inspector. These inspections should be carried out at 6month intervals for all lifting items and 12 months for those that could be covered by [[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998|PUWER]] although a competent person may deem different time scales:

Standards state that as a minimum;
* Every six months for lifting equipment used for lifting/lowering persons.
* Every six months for lifting accessories.
* Every 12 months for all other lifting equipment not falling into either of the above categories
* A competent person may deem different time scale

==Prosecutions arising from the regulations==
On 17 January 2011 a Liverpool nursing home was fined £18,000 after Frances Shannon, an 81-year-old woman fell to the ground whilst being lifted out of bed.

The Christopher Grange nursing home run by the Catholic Blind Institute was prosecuted by the health and safety executive for failing to carry out regular checks of the sling equipment which was used to lift Mrs Shannon, who suffered a broken shoulder and injuries to her back and elbow.  

Taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Mrs Shannon died the day following the incident.  Speaking of the prosecution Sarah Wadham, the HSE's inspecting officer, said that the incident could have been prevented, saying to the press "There should have been regular checks of the sling and it should have been thoroughly examined at least once every six months. Sadly this did not happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moderngov.rotherham.gov.uk/documents/s43180/BULLETIN%20March%2011.pdf|title=Rotherham Local Government Bulletin March 2011|last=Team|first=Emergency and Safety|date=March 2011|website=Rotherham Local Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Blind Institute was charged under section 9 of the Lifting Operation and Lifting Equipment regulations and ordered to also pay £13,876 costs.

==Requirements That LOLER 1998 Places On Employers and Workers== 
LOLER 1998 essentially puts in place four key protocols that all employers and workers must abide by:
1) All equipment must be safe and suitable for purpose    
The manufacturer must identify any hazards associated with the equipment in question, they must  then assess these hazards to bring them down to acceptable levels. All lifting equipment is normally put through an independent type testing process to establish that it will safely perform the tasks required to one of the below standards.
• BS (British Standard, used mainly in the UK)
• ISO Standards (International Standard)
• EN ([[Euronorm]], used throughout Europe)
• CEN/CENELEC (Euronorm Standards)
The above standards are a published specification that establishes a common language and contains a technical specification or other precise criteria. They are designed to be used consistently as a rule, guideline or definition.

2) All personnel must be suitably trained.
All manufacturers of lifting equipment are obliged to send out instructions for use of all products. 
The employer is then obliged to make sure employees are aware of these instructions and use the lifting equipment correctly.
To achieve this the employees must be competent. Competence is achieved through experience, technical knowledge and training. 

3) All equipment must be maintained in a safe condition.
It is good practice for all personnel using lifting equipment to conduct a pre-use inspection on all items.
Regulation 9 of LOLER also outlines specific requirements for the formal inspection of lifting equipment at mandatory intervals. 
These inspections are to be performed by a competent person and the findings of the inspections recorded.
Maximum fixed periods for thorough examinations and inspection of lifting equipment as stated in regulation 9 of LOLER are:
•Lifting Accessories – 6 Months
•Lifting Appliances – 12 Months
•Man Riding Equipment – 6 Months
Or in accordance with a written scheme of examination. Any inspection record must be made in line with the requirements of schedule 1 of LOLER
The only exception to this is: If the lifting equipment has not been used before and; In the case of lifting equipment issued with an EC declaration of conformity, the employer has possession of such declaration and it is not made more than 12 months before the lifting equipment is put into service.

== LOLER &amp; Record Keeping ==
You are legally required to ensure that reports of thorough examinations are kept available for consideration by health and safety inspectors for at least two years or until the next report, whichever is longer.

Records must be kept for all equipment. All equipment manufactured should be given a “birth certificate”.  This should prove that when first made, it complied with any requirement.  In Europe today, this document would normally be an EC Declaration of conformity plus a manufacturers certificate if called for by the standard worked to.

They may be kept electronically as long as you can provide a written report if requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.garageequipmentonline.com/loler-puwer-and-mvr|title=Loler, Puwer and MVR|last=Pengelly|first=Jason|date=21 March 2017|website=Garage Equipment Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4090">'''Material religion''' is a framework used by [[Religious studies|scholars of religion]] examining the interaction between [[religion]] and [[material culture]]. Its specific focus is on the place of objects, images, spaces, and buildings in religious communities.

Some scholars within the study of religion have criticised the material religion approach for often seeking to reintroduce the [[phenomenology of religion]] into the discipline.

==Definition==
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=Religion, being a prime human activity throughout history, is rooted in the body and in its sensual relations with the world. It always has been and always will be. We can make sense out of the senses. This is the first true thing we can say about religion, because it is also the first true thing we can say about being human. We are sentient beings, and religion is sensuous.|source=— Scholar of religion S. Brent Plate, 2014{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=7}} }}

The scholar of religion S. Brent Plate was of the view that "religion must be understood as deriving from rudimentary human experiences, from lived, embodied practices".{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=15}} He stated that "to learn about religion we have to come to our senses. Literally. We have to begin to discover... that we cannot know the worlds of any other culture, let alone our own, unless we get inside the sensational operations of human bodies."{{sfn|Plate|2014|p=8}}

==History==

The material religion framework has been promoted by the scholars such as Birgit Meyer, Sally Promey, S. Brent Plate, David Morgan, etc.

In 2005, the peer-reviewed journal ''Material Religion: The Journal of Objects, Art and Belief'' was launched. In their editorial statement, the editors described it as "a new project in the study of religious images, objects, spaces, and material practices."{{sfn|Editors|2005|p=5}}

==Criticism==
The anthropologist [[Simon Coleman (anthropologist)|Simon Coleman]] suggested that the term "material religion" was [[tautology (grammar)|tautological]], in that "religion is inherently material in its very constitution."{{sfn|Coleman|2009|p=360}}

The scholars of religion Christopher R. Cotter and David G. Robertson suggested that the material religion framework could be an alternative means to explore religion, in contrast to the dominant [[world religions]] paradigm which they regarded as problematic.{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|pp=12–13}} They nevertheless thought that material religion represented "phenomenology by stealth".{{sfn|Cotter|Robertson|2016|p=13}}

In [[organization]]al [[management]], '''mean down time''' ('''MDT''') is the [[average]] time that a system is non-operational. This includes all downtime associated with [[repair]], [[Corrective maintenance|corrective]] and [[preventive maintenance]], self-imposed [[downtime]], and any [[logistics]] or [[Administration (business)|administrative]] delays.

==Description==
The inclusion of delay times distinguishes mean down time from [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), which includes only downtime specifically attributable to repairs.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite book |title=Reliability, Maintainability and Risk: Practical Methods for Engineers |last=Smith |first=David J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2011 |publisher=Elsevier |location= |isbn= |page=22 |pages= |accessdate=June 12, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ewh1jHEyr1AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mean Down Time key factors:
# '''SYSTEM FAILURE'''
## ''Identification &amp; Recovery Time.''  First, the fact that the system is down must be identified, and maintainers notified &amp; brought to action
## ''[[Fault detection and isolation]].''  The problem must be identified and the faulty part identified.
## ''Parts Procurement.''  Replacement parts needed (if any) must be obtained
## ''System Repair.''  Faulty parts must be replaced or repaired.
# '''SCHEDULED DOWNTIME'''
## ''Preventive Maintenance.''  Preventive maintenance checks are often intrusive and require the system to be down{{Why?|date=September 2010}} (unless [[prognostics]] are used), e.g., checking oil in a car engine.
## ''System Upgrade.''  System downtime is usually required to bring new features to the system.
## ''Calibration.''  Many forms of mechanical or electronic equipment require periodic intrusive calibration.
## ''Other administrative actions''

There are four main ways of reducing MDT:
# ''Design the system to fail less often.''  A more reliable system that doesn't fail often reduces the Down Time.
# ''Make the system [[repairable]].'' If an item is repairable, it will be used for a longer time, and the user will become more familiar with its operation. This will decrease the MDT because the user will be able to detect abnormal operation sooner, and the system will be repaired before the problem becomes too serious.
# ''Let the user repair the system.'' By designing a system to be user-repairable, the MDT will be considerably decreased, as it will not have to be taken out of service for long periods of time while it is being repaired by the manufacturer (which of course includes time spent in transit to and from the manufacturer).
# ''Provide the user with a repair support system.'' The closer critical spare parts are to the system, the faster it will be able to be repaired, as this eliminates the delay involved in ordering parts from the manufacturer and waiting to receive them. Also, the clarity of any instructions on how to repair an item will greatly contribute to the speed at which it is repaired.

[[File:Microplastic sample .jpg|thumb|Image of microplastic samples in a lab]]
Additionally, plastics degrade slowly, often over hundreds if not thousands of years. This increases the probability of microplastics being ingested and incorporated into, and [[bioaccumulation|accumulated]] in, the bodies and tissues of many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Grossman |first=Elizabeth |date=2015-01-15 |title=How Plastics from Your Clothes Can End up in Your Fish |url=http://time.com/3669084/plastics-pollution-fish/ |magazine=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://4ocean.com/blogs/blog/how-long-does-it-take-trash-to-biodegrade|title=How Long Does it Take Trash to Decompose|first=|date=20 January 2017|work=4Ocean|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle and movement of microplastics in the environment is not yet known, but research is currently underway to investigate this issue.

Primary microplastics are small pieces of plastic that are purposefully manufactured&lt;ref name="KarbalaeiHWC" /&gt;. They are usually used in facial [[cleanser]]s and [[cosmetics]], or in [[Air blaster|air blasting]] technology. In some cases, their use in medicine as [[drug vector|vectors for drugs]] was reported.&lt;ref name="Patel,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=Mayur M.|last2=Goyal|first2=Bhoomika R.|last3=Bhadada|first3=Shraddha V.|last4=Bhatt|first4=Jay S.|last5=Amin|first5=Avani F.|date=January 2009|title=Getting into the Brain: Approaches to Enhance Brain Drug Delivery|url=|journal=[[CNS Drugs]]|volume=23|issue=1|pages=35–58|doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00003|pmid=19062774|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastic "scrubbers", used in [[exfoliating]] hand cleansers and facial scrubs, have replaced traditionally used natural ingredients, including ground [[Almond|almonds]], [[oatmeal]], and [[pumice]]. Primary microplastics have also been produced for use in air blasting technology. This process involves blasting [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]], [[melamine]], or [[polyester]] microplastic scrubbers at machinery, engines, and boat hulls to remove rust and paint. As these scrubbers are used repeatedly until they diminish in size and their cutting power is lost, they often become contaminated with [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] such as [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Lindeque |first2=Pennie |last3=Halsband |first3=Claudia |last4=Galloway |first4=Tamara S. |date=December 2011 |title=Microplastics as contaminants in the marine environment: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2588–2597 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.09.025|pmid=22001295 |hdl=10871/19649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many companies have committed to reducing the production of microbeads, there are still many bioplastic microbeads that also have a long degradation life cycle similar to normal plastic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Secondary microplastics===
Secondary plastics are small pieces of plastic derived from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, both at sea and on land. Over time, a culmination of physical, biological, and chemphotodegradation, including photodegradation caused by sunlight exposure, can reduce the structural integrity of plastic debris to a size that is eventually undetectable to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masura|first=Julie|last2=Baker|first2=Joel|last3=Foster|first3=Gregory|last4=Arthur|first4=Courtney|date=July 2015|editor-last=Herring|editor-first=Carlie|title=Laboratory Methods for the Analysis of Microplastics in the Marine Environment: Recommendations for quantifying synthetic particles in waters and sediments|url=|journal=[[NOAA|NOAA Marine Debris Program]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of breaking down large plastic material into much smaller pieces is known as fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011" /&gt; It is considered that microplastics might further degrade to be smaller in size, although the smallest microplastic reportedly detected in the oceans at present is 1.6 micrometres (6.3×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; in) in diameter.[[Microplastics#cite%20note-Cole%20Mathew%2C2011-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The prevalence of microplastics with uneven shapes suggests that fragmentation is a key source.[[Microplastics#cite%20note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Other sources: as a by-product/dust emission during wear and tear===
There are countless sources of both primary and secondary microplastics. Microplastic fibers enter the environment from the washing of synthetic clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/sources-effect-microplastics-humans-animals-environment.php |title=What are the Sources of Microplastics and its Effect on Humans and the Environment? - Conserve Energy Future |date=2018-05-19 |work=Conserve Energy Future |access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00267-017-0947-8 |pmid=29043380 |title=Are We Underestimating Microplastic Contamination in Aquatic Environments? |journal=Environmental Management |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2018 |last1=Conkle |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Báez Del Valle |first2=Christian D. |last3=Turner |first3=Jeffrey W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tires, composed partly of synthetic styrene butadiene rubber, will erode into tiny plastic and rubber particles as they are used. Furthermore, 2.0-5.0 mm plastic pellets, used to create other plastic products, often enter ecosystems due to spillages and other accidents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A Norwegian Environment Agency review report about microplastics published in early 2015&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014"&gt;Sundt, Peter and Schulze, Per-Erik: "Sources of microplastic-pollution to the marine environment", "Mepex for the Norwegian Environment Agency", 2015&lt;/ref&gt; states it would be beneficial to classify these sources as primary, as long as microplastics from these sources are added from human society at the "start of the pipe", and their emissions are inherently a result of human material and product use and not secondary defragmentation in nature.

The existence of microplastics in the environment is often established through aquatic studies. These include taking [[plankton]] samples, analyzing sandy and muddy [[sediment]]s, observing [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] consumption, and evaluating chemical [[pollutant]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivar do Sul|first1=Juliana A.|last2=Costa|first2=Monica F.|date=February 2014|title=The present and future of microplastic pollution in the marine environment|url=|journal=[[Environmental Pollution (journal)|Environmental Pollution]]|volume=185|pages=352–364|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036|pmid=24275078|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such methods, it has been shown that there are microplastics from multiple sources in the environment.

Microplastics could contribute up to 30% of the [[Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]] polluting the world’s oceans and, in many developed countries, are a bigger source of marine plastic pollution than the visible larger pieces of marine litter, according to a 2017 [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sewage treatment plants ===
[[Sewage treatment]] plants, also known as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), remove contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage, using various physical, chemical, and biological processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most plants in developed countries have both [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] stages. In the primary stage of treatment, physical processes are employed to remove oils, sand, and other large solids using conventional filters, [[clarifier]]s, and settling tanks.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite report |date=1997 |title=Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Treatment |url=https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/wastewater/EPA_water_%20treatment_manual_primary_secondary_tertiary1.pdf |series=Wastewater Treatment Manuals |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland |location=Wexford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary treatment uses biological processes involving [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] to break down organic matter. Common secondary technologies are [[activated sludge]] systems, [[trickling filter]]s, and [[constructed wetland]]s. The optional tertiary treatment stage may include processes for nutrient removal ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) and [[disinfection]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Microplastics have been detected in both the primary and secondary treatment stages of the plants. A study estimated that about one particle per liter of microplastics are being released back into the environment, with a removal efficiency of about 99.9%.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Steve A.|last2=Liu|first2=Jin|last3=Tesoro|first3=Arnold G.|date=15 March 2016|title=Transport and fate of microplastic particles in wastewater treatment plants|url=|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=91|pages=174–182|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.01.002|pmid=26795302|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estahbanati|first=Shirin|last2=Fahrenfeld|first2=N.L.|date=November 2016|title=Influence of wastewater treatment plant discharges on microplastic concentrations in surface water|url=http://raritan.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Estahbanati-Fahrenfeld-2016-Influence-of-wastewater-treatment-plant-discharges-on-microplastic-concentratison-in-surface-water.pdf|journal=[[Chemosphere (journal)|Chemosphere]]|volume=162|pages=277–284|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.083|pmid=27508863|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mintenig|first=S.M.|last2=Int-Veen|first2=I.|last3=Löder|first3=M.G.J.|last4=Primpke|first4=S.|last5=Gerdts|first5=G.|date=2017-01-01|title=Identification of microplastic in effluents of waste water treatment plants using focal plane array-based micro-Fourier-transform infrared imaging|url=|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=108|pages=365–372|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.015|pmid=27838027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study showed that most microplastics are actually removed during the primary treatment stage where solid skimming and sludge settling are used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When these treatment facilities are functioning properly, the contribution of microplastics into oceans and surface water environments from WWTPs is not disproportionately large.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Fionn|last2=Ewins|first2=Ciaran|last3=Carbonnier|first3=Frederic|last4=Quinn|first4=Brian|date=2016-06-07|title=Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW) as a Source of Microplastics in the Aquatic Environment|url=|journal=[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]|volume=50|issue=11|pages=5800–5808|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b05416|pmid=27191224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note that in certain countries sewage sludge is used for soil fertilizer, which exposes plastics in the sludge to the weather, sunlight, and other biological factors, causing fragmentation. As a result, microplastics from these biosolids often end up in storm drains and eventually into bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weithmann|first=Nicolas|last2=Möller|first2=Julia N.|last3=Löder|first3=Martin G. J.|last4=Piehl|first4=Sarah|last5=Laforsch|first5=Christian|last6=Freitag|first6=Ruth|date=2018-04-01|title=Organic fertilizer as a vehicle for the entry of microplastic into the environment|url=|journal=[[Science Advances]]|volume=4|issue=4|pages=eaap8060|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aap8060|pmc=5884690|pmid=29632891|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some studies show that microplastics do pass through filtration processes at some WWTPs (Microplastics as Contaminants, 2011). According to a study from the UK, samples taken from sewage sludge disposal sites on the coasts of six continents contained an average one particle of microplastic per liter. A significant amount of these particles was of clothing fibers from washing machine effluent.&lt;ref name="Browne2011" /&gt;

=== Car and truck tires ===
Wear and tear from tires significantly contributes to the flow of (micro-)plastics into the environment. Estimates of emissions of microplastics to the environment in [[Denmark]] are between [[orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|{{convert|5,500|and|14,000|tonne}}]] per year. Secondary microplastics (e.g. from car and truck tires or footwear) are more important than primary microplastics by two orders of magnitude. The formation of microplastics from the degradation of larger plastics in the environment is not accounted for in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2015 |title=Microplastics: Occurrence, effects and sources of releases to the environment in Denmark |url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2015/10/978-87-93352-80-3.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Environment and Food in Denmark, Danish Environmental Protection Agency |location=Copenhagen |id=Environmental project No. 1793 |page=14 |isbn=978-87-93352-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated per capita emission ranges from 0.23 to 4.7 kg/year, with a global average of 0.81 kg/year. The emissions from car tires (100%) are substantially higher than those of other sources of microplastics, e.g., airplane tires (2%), artificial turf (12–50%), brake wear (8%), and road markings (5%). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tire wear and tear to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5–10%. In air, 3–7% of the particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is estimated to consist of tire wear and tear, indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The wear and tear also enter our food chain, but further research is needed to assess human health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kole|first=Pieter Jan|last2=Löhr|first2=Ansje J.|last3=Van Belleghem|first3=Frank|last4=Ragas|first4=Ad|last5=Kole|first5=Pieter Jan|last6=Löhr|first6=Ansje J.|last7=Van Belleghem|first7=Frank G.

===Cosmetics industry===
Some companies have replaced natural [[exfoliating]] ingredients with microplastics, usually in the form of "[[microbead]]s" or "micro-exfoliates". These products are typically composed of [[polyethylene]], a common component of plastics, but they can also be manufactured from [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], and [[nylon]].&lt;ref name="BeattheMicrobead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatthemicrobead.org/en/|title=International Campaign against Microbeads in Cosmetics|last=|first=|date=|website=Beat the Microbead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315021442/http://beatthemicrobead.org/en/|archive-date=15 March 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often found in face washes, [[hand soap]]s, and other personal care products, so the beads are usually washed into the [[sewage]] system immediately after use. Their small size prevents them from fully being retained by preliminary treatment screens at wastewater plants, thereby allowing some to enter rivers and oceans.&lt;ref name="Fendall2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.04.025 |pmid=19481226 |title=Contributing to marine pollution by washing your face: Microplastics in facial cleansers |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1225–1228 |year=2009 |last1=Fendall |first1=Lisa S. |last2=Sewell |first2=Mary A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wastewater treatment plants only remove an average of 95–99.9% of microbeads because of their small design . This leaves an average of 0-7 microbeads per litre being discharged.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.10.048 |pmid=27836135 |title=Microplastics in personal care products: Exploring perceptions of environmentalists, beauticians and students |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=1–2 |pages=454–460 |year=2016 |last1=Anderson |first1=A.G. |last2=Grose |first2=J. |last3=Pahl |first3=S. |last4=Thompson |first4=R.C. |last5=Wyles |first5=K.J. |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/812629/1/Anderson%20et%20al%20%282016%29%20-%20MPB%20-%20microbeads%20%28accepted%20manuscript%29.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that one treatment plant discharges 160 trillion liters of water per day, around 8 trillion microbeads are released into waterways every day.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt; This averages out to around 8 trillion microbeads being released into waterways per day. This number doesn’t account for the sewage sludge that is reused as fertilizer after the waste water treatment that has been know to still contain these microbeads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03909 |pmid=26334581 |title=Scientific Evidence Supports a Ban on Microbeads |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=49 |issue=18 |pages=10759–10761 |year=2015 |last1=Rochman |first1=Chelsea M. |last2=Kross |first2=Sara M. |last3=Armstrong |first3=Jonathan B. |last4=Bogan |first4=Michael T. |last5=Darling |first5=Emily S. |last6=Green |first6=Stephanie J. |last7=Smyth |first7=Ashley R. |last8=Veríssimo |first8=Diogo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an issue at the household level because it has been estimated that around 808 trillion beads per household are discharged in a single day whether due to cosmetic exfoliates, face wash, toothpaste, or other sources. Although many companies have committed to phasing out the use of microbead in their products a research found that there are at least 80 different facial scrub products that are still being sold with microbeads as a main component.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt; This fact contributes to the total of 80 metric tons of microbead discharge per year just by the United Kingdom alone. This not only has a negative impact on the wildlife and food chain but also in terms of toxicity because plastics such as microbeads have been proven to absorb dangerous chemicals such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt;

===Clothing===
Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.leitat.org/mermaids/|title=LIFE-MERMAIDS Project|last=|first=|date=2014-08-08|website=LEITAT|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that many synthetic fibers, such as polyester, nylon and acrylics, can be shed from clothing and persist in the environment.&lt;ref name = "GrossmanJan"&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth: “How Microplastics from Your Fleece Could End up on Your Plate”, “Civil Eats”, January 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Each garment in a load of [[laundry]] can shed more than 1,900 fibers of microplastics, with [[Polar fleece|fleeces]] releasing the highest percentage of fibers, over 170% more than other garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1504135112 |pmid=25944930 |pmc=4426466 |title=News Feature: Microplastics present pollution puzzle |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=18 |pages=5547–5549 |year=2015 |last1=Katsnelson |first1=Alla }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Browne2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es201811s |pmid=21894925 |title=Accumulation of Microplastic on Shorelines Woldwide: Sources and Sinks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=21 |pages=9175–9179 |year=2011 |last1=Browne |first1=Mark Anthony |last2=Crump |first2=Phillip |last3=Niven |first3=Stewart J. |last4=Teuten |first4=Emma |last5=Tonkin |first5=Andrew |last6=Galloway |first6=Tamara |last7=Thompson |first7=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washing machine]] manufacturers have also reviewed research into whether washing machine filters can reduce the amount of microfiber fibers that need to be treated by water treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patagonia.com/blog/2017/02/an-update-on-microfiber-pollution/|title=An Update on Microfiber Pollution|last=|first=|date=2017-02-03|website=Patagonia|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These microfibers have been found to persist throughout the food chain from [[zooplankton]] to larger animals such as whales.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The primary fiber that persist throughout the textile industry is polyester which is a cheap cotton alternative that can be easily manufactured. However, these types of fibers contribute greatly to the persistence to microplastics in terrestrial, aerial, and marine ecosystems. The process of washing clothes causes garments to lose an average of over 100 fibers per liter of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es201811s |pmid=21894925 |title=Accumulation of Microplastic on Shorelines Woldwide: Sources and Sinks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=21 |pages=9175–9179 |year=2011 |last1=Browne |first1=Mark Anthony |last2=Crump |first2=Phillip |last3=Niven |first3=Stewart J. |last4=Teuten |first4=Emma |last5=Tonkin |first5=Andrew |last6=Galloway |first6=Tamara |last7=Thompson |first7=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked with health effects possibly caused by the release of monomers, dispersive dyes, mordants, and plasticisers from manufacturing. The commonality of these types of fibers in the common households has been shown to represent 33% of all fibers in indoor environments.&lt;ref name="Browne2011" /&gt;

Anthropomorphic fibers have been studied in both indoor and outdoor environments to study the concentration of these to see what the average human exposure to microfibers look like. The indoor concentration was 1.0–60.0 fibers/m^3 whereas the outdoor concentration was much lower at 0.3-1.5 fibers/m^3.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.12.013 |pmid=27989388 |title=A first overview of textile fibers, including microplastics, in indoor and outdoor environments |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=221 |pages=453–458 |year=2017 |last1=Dris |first1=Rachid |last2=Gasperi |first2=Johnny |last3=Mirande |first3=Cécile |last4=Mandin |first4=Corinne |last5=Guerrouache |first5=Mohamed |last6=Langlois |first6=Valérie |last7=Tassin |first7=Bruno |url=https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01418927/file/dris2017.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposition rate indoors was 1586-11,130 fibers per day/m^3 which accumulates to around 190-670 fibers/mg of dust.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The largest concern with these concentrations is that it increases exposure to children and the elderly which can cause adverse health effects.

===Manufacturing===
The manufacture of plastic products uses [[granular material|granules]] and small [[resin]] pellets as their raw material. In the United States, production increased from 2.9 million pellets in 1960 to 21.7 million pellets in 1987. Through accidental spillage during land or sea transport, inappropriate use as [[packing material]]s, and direct outflow from processing plants, these raw materials can enter [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. In an assessment of [[Sweden|Swedish]] waters using an 80&amp;nbsp;µm mesh, KIMO Sweden found typical microplastic concentrations of 150–2,400 microplastics per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; in a harbor adjacent to a plastic production facility, the concentration was 102,000 per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011"/&gt;

Many industrial sites in which convenient raw plastics are frequently used are located near bodies of water. If spilled during production, these materials may leak into the surrounding environment, polluting waterways.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; “More recently, Operation Cleansweep (www.opcleansweep.org), a joint initiative of the American Chemistry Council and Society of the Plastics Industry, is aiming for industries to commit to zero pellet loss during their operations”.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011" /&gt; Overall, there is a significant lack of research conducted about specific industries and companies that contribute to microplastics pollution.

===Fishing industry===
[[Recreational fishing|Recreational]] and [[commercial fishing]], [[marine vessel]]s, and marine industries are all sources of plastic that can directly enter the marine environment, posing a risk to biota both as macroplastics, and as secondary microplastics following long-term degradation. [[Marine debris]] observed on beaches also arises from beaching of materials carried on inshore and ocean currents. [[Fishing gear]] is a form of plastic debris with a marine source. Discarded or lost fishing gear, including plastic monofilament line and nylon [[fishing net|netting]], is typically neutrally [[buoyant]] and can, therefore, drift at variable depths within the oceans. Various countries have reported that microplastics from the industry and other sources have been accumulating in different types of seafood. In [[Indonesia]], 55% of all fish species had evidence of manufactured debris similar to America which reported 67%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep14340 |pmid=26399762 |pmc=4585829 |title=Anthropogenic debris in seafood: Plastic debris and fibers from textiles in fish and bivalves sold for human consumption |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |pages=14340 |year=2015 |last1=Rochman |first1=Chelsea M. |last2=Tahir |first2=Akbar |last3=Williams |first3=Susan L. |last4=Baxa |first4=Dolores V. |last5=Lam |first5=Rosalyn |last6=Miller |first6=Jeffrey T. |last7=Teh |first7=Foo-Ching |last8=Werorilangi |first8=Shinta |last9=Teh |first9=Swee J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of debris in Indonesia was plastic, while in North America the majority was synthetic fibers found in clothing and some types of nets. The implication that fish are being contaminated with microplastic is that those plastics and chemicals will bioaccumulate in the food chain.

One study analyzed the plastic-derived chemical called [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]] (PBDEs) in the stomachs of [[short-tailed shearwater]]s. It found that one-fourth of the birds had higher-brominated congeners that are not naturally found in their prey. However, the PBDE got into the birds' systems through plastic that was found in the stomachs of the birds. It is therefore not just the plastics that are being transferred through the food chain but the chemicals from the plastics as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.12.010 |pmid=23298431 |title=Accumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in tissues of seabirds ingesting marine plastics |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=69 |issue=1–2 |pages=219–222 |year=2013 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Kosuke |last2=Takada |first2=Hideshige |last3=Yamashita |first3=Rei |last4=Mizukawa |first4=Kaoruko |last5=Fukuwaka |first5=Masa-aki |last6=Watanuki |first6=Yutaka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packaging and shipping===
[[Shipping]] has significantly contributed to marine pollution. Some statistics indicate that in 1970, commercial shipping fleets around the world dumped over 23,000 tons of plastic waste into the marine environment. In 1988, an international agreement ([[MARPOL 73/78]], Annex V) prohibited the dumping of waste from ships into the marine environment. However, shipping remains a dominant source of [[plastic pollution#Ocean|plastic pollution]], having contributed around 6.5 million tons of plastic in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Derraik2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5 |title=The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=842–852 |year=2002 |last1=Derraik |first1=José G.B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0284 |pmid=19528054 |pmc=2873017 |title=Transport and release of chemicals from plastics to the environment and to wildlife |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2027–2045 |year=2009 |last1=Teuten |first1=E.

=== Plastic water bottles ===
In one study, 93% of the bottled water from 11 different brands showed microplastic contamination. Per liter, researchers found an average of 325 microplastic particles.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Sherri, A.|last2=Welch|first2=Victoria|last3=Neratko|first3=Joseph|date=|title=Synthetic Polymer Contamination in Bottled Water|url=https://orbmedia.org/sites/default/files/FinalBottledWaterReport.pdf|journal=State University of New York at Fredonia|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the tested brands, Nestlé Pure Life and Gerolsteiner bottles contained the most microplastic with 930 and 807 microplastic particles per liter (MPP/L), respectively.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; San Pellegrino products showed the least quantity of microplastic densities. Compared to water from taps, water from plastic bottles contained twice as much microplastic. Some of the contamination likely comes from the process of bottling and packaging the water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Potential effects on the environment==
{{split section|Environmental impacts of microplastics|date=September 2016}}
Participants at the 2008 International Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris at the [[University of Washington]] at Tacoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Arthur |editor1-first=Courtney |editor2-last=Baker |editor2-first=Joel |editor3-last=Bamford |editor3-first=Holly |title=Proceedings of the Intenational Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects, and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris, September 9-11, 2008 |journal=Technical Memorandum NOS-OR&amp;R-30 |date=2009 |pages=49 |url=https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/file/2192/download?token=5dvqb-YY |accessdate=2018-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that microplastics are a problem in the marine environment, based on:
*the documented occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment,
*the long residence times of these particles (and, therefore, their likely buildup in the future), and
*their demonstrated ingestion by [[marine organism]]s.

So far, research has mainly focused on larger plastic items. Widely-recognized problems facing marine life are entanglement, ingestion, [[suffocation]] and general debilitation often leading to death and/or strandings. This causes serious public concern. In contrast, microplastics are not as conspicuous, being less than 5&amp;nbsp; mm, and are usually invisible to the naked eye. Particles of this size are available to a much broader range of species, enter the food chain at the bottom, become embedded in animal tissue, and are then undetectable by unaided visual inspection.

Microplastics have been detected not just in marine but also in freshwater systems in three continents (Europe, North America and Asia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eerkes-Medrano |first1=D. |last2=Thompson |first2=R.C. |last3=Aldridge |first3=D.C. |date=May 2015 |title=Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review of the emerging threats, identification of knowledge gaps and prioritisation of research needs |url= |journal=Water Research |volume=75 |issue= |pages=63–82 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.012|pmid=25746963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples collected across 29 [[Great Lakes]] tributaries from six states in the United States were found to contain plastic particles, 98% of which were microplastics ranging in size from 0.355mm to 4.75mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldwin |first1=Austin K. |last2=Corsi |first2=Steven R. |last3=Mason |first3=Sherri A. |date=2016 |title=Plastic Debris in 29 Great Lakes Tributaries: Relations to Watershed Attributes and Hydrology |url= |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=50 |issue=19 |pages=10377–10385 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.6b02917|pmid=27627676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological integration into organisms===
Microplastics can become embedded in animals' tissue through ingestion or respiration. Various annelid species, such as deposit-feeding [[Lugworm|lugworms]] (''Arenicola marina''), have been shown to have microplastics embedded in their [[gastrointestinal tract]]s. Many [[Crustacean|crustaceans]], like the shore crab ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'', have been seen to integrate microplastics into both their respiratory and digestive tracts.&lt;ref name = "GrossmanJan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24972075&gt;{{cite journal |laydate=8 July 2014 |laysummary=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microplastics-lodge-crab-gills-and-guts |laysource=Science News |doi=10.1021/es501090e |pmid=24972075 |title=Uptake and Retention of Microplastics by the Shore Crab Carcinus maenas |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=48 |issue=15 |pages=8823–8830 |year=2014 |last1=Watts |first1=Andrew J.

Additionally, [[Bottom feeder|bottom feeders]], such as [[benthic]] [[Sea cucumber|sea cucumbers]], who are non-selective scavengers that feed on debris on the ocean floor, ingest large amounts of sediment. It has been shown that four species of sea cucumber (''Thyonella gemmate'', ''[[Holothuria floridana]]'', ''H. grisea'' and ''[[Cucumaria frondosa]]'') ingested between 2- and 20-fold more PVC fragments and between 2- and 138-fold more nylon line fragments (as much as 517 fibers per organism) based on plastic-to-sand grain ratios from each sediment treatment. These results suggest that individuals may be selectively ingesting plastic particles. This contradicts the accepted indiscriminate feeding strategy of sea cucumbers, and may occur in all presumed non-selective feeders when presented with microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.031 |pmid=23545014 |title=The physical impacts of microplastics on marine organisms: A review |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=178 |pages=483–492 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=Stephanie L. |last2=Thompson |first2=Richard C. |last3=Galloway |first3=Tamara S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only fish and free-living organisms can ingest microplastics. [[Scleractinia|Scleractinian corals]], which are primary reef-builders, have been shown to ingest microplastics under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=N.M. |last1=Hall |first2=K.L.E. |last2=Berry |first3=L. |last3=Rintoul |first4=M.O. |last4=Hoogenboom |date=4 February 2015 |title=Microplastic ingestion by scleractinian corals |journal=Marine Biology |doi=10.1007/s00227-015-2619-7 |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=725–732}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effects of ingestion on these corals has not been studied, corals can easily become stressed and bleach. Microplastics have been shown to stick to the exterior of the corals after exposure in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The adherence to the outside of corals can potentially be harmful, because corals cannot handle sediment or any particulate matter on their exterior and slough it off by secreting mucus, and they expend a large amount of energy in the process, increasing the chances of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2639-2_25 |chapter=Impacts of Sediment on Coral Reefs |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs |pages=575–586 |series=Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series |year=2011 |last1=Risk |first1=Michael J. |last2=Edinger |first2=Evan |isbn=978-90-481-2638-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zooplankton]] ingest microplastics beads (1.7–30.6 μm) and excrete fecal matter contaminated with microplastics. Along with ingestion, the microplastics stick to the appendages and exoskeleton of the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es400663f |pmid=23692270 |title=Microplastic Ingestion by Zooplankton |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=47 |issue=12 |pages=6646–6655 |year=2013 |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Lindeque |first2=Pennie |last3=Fileman |first3=Elaine |last4=Halsband |first4=Claudia |last5=Goodhead |first5=Rhys |last6=Moger |first6=Julian |last7=Galloway |first7=Tamara S. |hdl=10871/19651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zooplankton, among other marine organisms, consume microplastics because they emit similar infochemicals, notably [[dimethyl sulfide]], just as [[phytoplankton]] do.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1600395 |pmid=28861463 |pmc=5569953 |title=Marine plastic debris emits a keystone infochemical for olfactory foraging seabirds |journal=Science Advances |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=e1600395 |year=2016 |last1=Savoca |first1=M.

It can take at least 14 days for microplastics to pass through an animal (as compared to a normal digestion periods of 2 days), but enmeshment of the particles in animals' [[gill]]s can prevent elimination entirely.&lt;ref name=pmid24972075/&gt; When microplastic-laden animals are consumed by predators, the microplastics are then incorporated into the bodies of higher trophic-level feeders.

A study done at the Argentinean coastline of the [[Rio de la Plata]] [[estuary]], found the presence of microplastics in the guts of 11 species of coastal freshwater fish. These 11 species of fish represented four different feeding habits: [[detritivore]], [[planktivore]], [[omnivore]] and [[ichthyophagous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.007 |pmid=28633946 |title=Microplastics in gut contents of coastal freshwater fish from Río de la Plata estuary |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=122 |issue=1–2 |pages=85–90 |year=2017 |last1=Pazos |first1=Rocío S. |last2=Maiztegui |first2=Tomás |last3=Colautti |first3=Darío C. |last4=Paracampo |first4=Ariel H. |last5=Gómez |first5=Nora }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is one of the few so far to show the ingestion of microplastics by freshwater organisms.

Many people can expect to come in contact with various types of microplastics on a daily basis in the aforementioned sources (see sources). However, the average citizen is exposed to microplastics through their various types of food included in a normal diet. For instance: Salt. Researchers in China tested three types of table salt samples available in supermarkets and found the presence of microplastics in all of them. [[Sea salt]] has the highest amounts of microplastics compared to lake salt and rock/well salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03163 |pmid=26486565 |title=Microplastic Pollution in Table Salts from China |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=49 |issue=22 |pages=13622–13627 |year=2015 |last1=Yang |first1=Dongqi |last2=Shi |first2=Huahong |last3=Li |first3=Lan |last4=Li |first4=Jiana |last5=Jabeen |first5=Khalida |last6=Kolandhasamy |first6=Prabhu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea salt and rock salt which are commonly used table salts in Spain have also been found to contain microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09128-x |pmid=28819264 |pmc=5561224 |title=Microplastics in Spanish Table Salt |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=8620 |year=2017 |last1=Iñiguez |first1=Maria E. |last2=Conesa |first2=Juan A. |last3=Fullana |first3=Andres }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of microplastic found in both these studies was [[Polyethylene terephthalate|polyethylene terephthalate (PET).]]

An example of bioaccumulation in the food chain that leads to human exposure was a study done into the tissue samples of mussels to approximate concentration of microplastics.

===Buoyancy===
Approximately half of the plastic material introduced to the marine environment is [[buoyant]], but fouling by organisms can cause plastic debris to sink to the [[sea floor]], where it may interfere with sediment-dwelling species and sedimental gas exchange processes. Several factors contribute to microplastic’s buoyancy, including the density of the plastic it is composed as well as the size and shape of the microplastic fragments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep33882 |pmid=27721460 |pmc=5056413 |title=The effect of particle properties on the depth profile of buoyant plastics in the ocean |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |pages=33882 |year=2016 |last1=Kooi |first1=Merel |last2=Reisser |first2=Julia |last3=Slat |first3=Boyan |last4=Ferrari |first4=Francesco F. |last5=Schmid |first5=Moritz S. |last6=Cunsolo |first6=Serena |last7=Brambini |first7=Roberto |last8=Noble |first8=Kimberly |last9=Sirks |first9=Lys-Anne |last10=Linders |first10=Theo E.

===Persistent organic pollutants===
Plastic particles may highly concentrate and transport synthetic organic compounds (e.g. persistent organic pollutants, [[POPs]]), commonly present in the environment and ambient seawater, on their surface through [[adsorption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es0010498 |title=Plastic Resin Pellets as a Transport Medium for Toxic Chemicals in the Marine Environment |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=318–324 |year=2001 |last1=Mato |first1=Yukie |last2=Isobe |first2=Tomohiko |last3=Takada |first3=Hideshige |last4=Kanehiro |first4=Haruyuki |last5=Ohtake |first5=Chiyoko |last6=Kaminuma |first6=Tsuguchika }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastics can act as carriers for the transfer of POPs from the environment to organisms.&lt;ref name="Derraik2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5 |title=The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=842–852 |year=2002 |last1=Derraik |first1=José G.B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19528054&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0284 |pmid=19528054 |pmc=2873017 |title=Transport and release of chemicals from plastics to the environment and to wildlife |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2027–2045 |year=2009 |last1=Teuten |first1=E.

Additives added to plastics during manufacture may leach out upon ingestion, potentially causing serious harm to the organism. [[Endocrine disruption]] by plastic additives may affect the [[reproductive health]] of humans and wildlife alike.&lt;ref name=pmid19528054/&gt;

Plastics, polymers derived from [[mineral oil]]s, are virtually [[non-biodegradable]]. However, renewable natural polymers are now in development which can be used for the production of biodegradable materials similar to that of oil-based polymers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Where microplastics can be found ==

=== Oceans ===
There is truly a staggering amount of microplastics in our world’s oceans. Though there is debate over exactly how much microplastic is in the world’s oceans a 2015 study estimated that there was between 93 and 236 thousand metric tons of microplastics in the world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124006 |title=A global inventory of small floating plastic debris |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=124006 |year=2015 |last1=Van Sebille |first1=Erik |last2=Wilcox |first2=Chris |last3=Lebreton |first3=Laurent |last4=Maximenko |first4=Nikolai |last5=Hardesty |first5=Britta Denise |last6=Van Franeker |first6=Jan A. |last7=Eriksen |first7=Marcus |last8=Siegel |first8=David |last9=Galgani |first9=Francois |last10=Law |first10=Kara Lavender }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2016/04/04/pesky-plastic-the-true-harm-of-microplastics-in-the-oceans/|title=Pesky plastic: The true harm of microplastics in the oceans – National Geographic Blog|website=blog.nationalgeographic.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the distribution of Eastern Pacific Ocean surface plastic debris helps to illustrate how the concentration of plastics in the ocean is on the rise. Though the study admits further research is needed to predict trends in ocean plastic concentration, the study, using data on surface plastic concentration (pieces of plastic km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) from 1972-1985 n=60 and 2002-2012 n=457 within the same plastic accumulation zone, found the mean plastic concentration increase between the two sets of data, including a 10-fold increase of 18,160 to 189,800 pieces of plastic km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es4053076 |pmid=24708264 |title=Distribution of Surface Plastic Debris in the Eastern Pacific Ocean from an 11-Year Data Set |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=4732–4738 |year=2014 |last1=Law |first1=Kara Lavender |last2=Morét-Ferguson |first2=Skye E. |last3=Goodwin |first3=Deborah S. |last4=Zettler |first4=Erik R. |last5=Deforce |first5=Emelia |last6=Kukulka |first6=Tobias |last7=Proskurowski |first7=Giora }}&lt;/ref&gt; And though this study is based on data of surface plastic concentration, not specifically microplastic, additional research has found microplastics to account for 92% of plastic debris on the ocean’s surface, which adds context to the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00267-017-0947-8 |pmid=29043380 |title=Are We Underestimating Microplastic Contamination in Aquatic Environments? |journal=Environmental Management |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2018 |last1=Conkle |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Báez Del Valle |first2=Christian D. |last3=Turner |first3=Jeffrey W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freshwater ecosystems ===
Though there have only been a few studies of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, microplastics are being increasingly detected in the world’s aquatic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.06.074 |pmid=27431693 |title=Microplastics in aquatic environments: Implications for Canadian ecosystems |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=218 |pages=269–280 |year=2016 |last1=Anderson |first1=Julie C. |last2=Park |first2=Bradley J. |last3=Palace |first3=Vince P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first study on microplastics in freshwater ecosystems was published in 2011 that found an average of 37.8 fragments per square meter of Lake Huron sediment samples. Additionally, studies have found MP (microplastic) to be present in all of the Great Lakes with an average concentration of 43,000 MP particle km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/anie.201606957 |pmid=27618688 |title=Microplastic in Aquatic Ecosystems |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1720–1739 |year=2017 |last1=Ivleva |first1=Natalia P. |last2=Wiesheu |first2=Alexandra C. |last3=Niessner |first3=Reinhard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastics have also been detected in freshwater ecosystems outside of the United States. The highest concentration of microplastic ever discovered in a studied freshwater ecosystem was recorded in the Rhine river at 4000 MP particles kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b05367 |pmid=29337537 |pmc=5822217 |title=Microplastic Effect Thresholds for Freshwater Benthic Macroinvertebrates |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=2278–2286 |year=2018 |last1=Redondo-Hasselerharm |first1=Paula E. |last2=Falahudin |first2=Dede |last3=Peeters |first3=Edwin T. H. M. |last4=Koelmans |first4=Albert A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil ===
A substantial portion of microplastics are expected to end up in the world’s soil, yet very little research has been conducted on microplastics in soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.01805 |pmid=29093730 |pmc=5651362 |title=Microplastic Incorporation into Soil in Agroecosystems |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=8 |pages=1805 |year=2017 |last1=Rillig |first1=Matthias C. |last2=Ingraffia |first2=Rosolino |last3=De Souza Machado |first3=Anderson A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists some speculation that fibrous secondary microplastics from washing machines could end up in soil through the failure of water treatment plants to completely filter out all of the microplastic fibers. Furthermore, [[geophagous soil fauna]], such as earthworms, mites, and collembolan could contribute to the amount of secondary microplastic present in soil by converting consumed plastic debris into microplastic via digestive processes. Further research, however, is needed. There is concrete data linking one the use of organic waste materials to synthetic fibers being found in the soil; but most studies on plastics in soil merely report its presence and do not quantify how much there is or where it came from.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es302011r |pmid=22676039 |title=Microplastic in Terrestrial Ecosystems and the Soil? |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=6453–6454 |year=2012 |last1=Rillig |first1=Matthias C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the air ===
Airborne microplastics have been detected in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], as well as indoors and outdoors. A 2017 study found indoor airborne microfiber concentrations between 1.0–60.0 microfibers per cubic meter (33% of which were found to be microplastics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.coesh.2017.10.002 |title=Microplastics in air: Are we breathing it in? |journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Science &amp; Health |volume=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2018 |last1=Gasperi |first1=Johnny |last2=Wright |first2=Stephanie L. |last3=Dris |first3=Rachid |last4=Collard |first4=France |last5=Mandin |first5=Corinne |last6=Guerrouache |first6=Mohamed |last7=Langlois |first7=Valérie |last8=Kelly |first8=Frank J. |last9=Tassin |first9=Bruno }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looked at microplastic in the street dust of Tehran Iran and found 2649 particles of microplastic within ten samples of street dust, with ranging samples concentrations from 83 particle – 605 particles (+/- 10) per 30.0 g of street dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11356-017-9674-1 |pmid=28707239 |title=Microplastic pollution in deposited urban dust, Tehran metropolis, Iran |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=24 |issue=25 |pages=20360–20371 |year=2017 |last1=Dehghani |first1=Sharareh |last2=Moore |first2=Farid |last3=Akhbarizadeh |first3=Razegheh }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much like freshwater ecosystems and soil, more studies are needed to understand the full impact and significance of airborne microplastics.

== Proposed solutions ==
Some researchers have proposed incinerating plastics to use as energy, which is known as energy recovery. As opposed to losing the energy from plastics into the atmosphere in [[Landfill|landfills]], this process turns some of the plastics back into energy that can be used. However, as opposed to recycling, this method does not diminish the amount of plastic material that is produced. Therefore, recycling plastics is considered a more efficient solution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Increasing education through recycling campaigns is another proposed solution for microplastic contamination. While this would be a smaller scale solution, education has been shown to reduce littering, especially in urban environments where there are often large concentrations of plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If recycling efforts are increased, a cycle of plastic use and reuse would be created to decrease our waste output and production of new raw materials. In order to achieve this, states would need to employ stronger infrastructure and investment around recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kershaw|first=Peter J.|date=2016|title=Marine Plastic Debris and Microplastics|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-10/pdf/Marine_plastic_debris_and_microplastic_technical_report_advance_copy.pdf|dead-url=No|journal=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]|volume=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011052123/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-10/pdf/Marine_plastic_debris_and_microplastic_technical_report_advance_copy.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocate for improving recycling technology to be able to recycle smaller plastics to reduce the need for production of new plastics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Biodegradation is another possible solution to large amounts of microplastic waste. In this process, microorganisms consume and decompose synthetic polymers with using degrading enzymes.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auta|first=H.S.|last2=Emenike|first2=C.U|last3=Fauziah|first3=S.H|date=May 2017|title=Distribution and importance of microplastics in the marine environment: A review of the sources, fate, effects, and potential solutions|url=|journal=[[Environment International]]|volume=102|pages=165–176|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2017.02.013|pmid=28284818|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plastics can then be used in the form of energy and as a source of [[carbon]] once broken down. The microbes could potentially be used to treat sewage wastewater, which would decrease the amount of microplastics that pass through into the surrounding environments.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Policy and legislation==
With increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of microplastics on the environment, groups are now advocating for the removal and ban of microplastics from various products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.001 |title=Reducing marine pollution from single-use plastics (SUPs): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=137 |pages=157–171 |year=2018 |last1=Schnurr |first1=Riley E.J. |last2=Alboiu |first2=Vanessa |last3=Chaudhary |first3=Meenakshi |last4=Corbett |first4=Roan A. |last5=Quanz |first5=Meaghan E. |last6=Sankar |first6=Karthikeshwar |last7=Srain |first7=Harveer S. |last8=Thavarajah |first8=Venukasan |last9=Xanthos |first9=Dirk |last10=Walker |first10=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such campaign is "Beat the Microbead", which focuses on removing plastics from personal care products.&lt;ref name = "BeattheMicrobead" /&gt; The Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation run the Global Microplastics Initiative, a project to collect water samples to provide scientists with better data about microplastic dispersion in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Microplastics Initiative|url=http://www.adventurescientists.org/microplastics.html|publisher=Adventure Scientists|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has sponsored research and global assessment programs due to the trans-boundary issue that microplastic pollution constitutes.&lt;ref name="GreenFacts"&gt;Morris and Chapman: "Marine Litter", "Green Facts: Facts on Health and the Environment", 2001-2015&lt;/ref&gt; These environmental groups will keep pressuring companies to remove plastics from their products in order to maintain healthy ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Philip: "'Microplastics' In Great Lakes Pose 'Very Real Threat' To Humans and Animals", International Business Times, 29 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States

In the US, some states have taken action to mitigate the negative environmental effects of microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.048 |pmid=28238328 |title=International policies to reduce plastic marine pollution from single-use plastics (plastic bags and microbeads): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1–2 |pages=17–26 |year=2017 |last1=Xanthos |first1=Dirk |last2=Walker |first2=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois was the first US state to ban cosmetics containing microplastics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; On the national level, the [[Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015]] was enacted after being signed by President [[Barack Obama]] on December 28, 2015. The law bans "rinse-off" cosmetic products that perform an exfoliating function, such as toothpaste or face wash. It does not apply to other products such as household cleaners. The act took effect on July 1, 2017, with respect to manufacturing, and July 1, 2018, with respect to introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="PL114-114"&gt;United States. Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. {{uspl|114|114}}. Approved 2015-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25th, 2018, a microplastic reduction amendment was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/756/text|title=Text - S.756 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Save Our Seas Act of 2018|last=Dan|first=Sullivan|date=2018-07-26|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation, as part of the Save Our Seas Act designed to combat marine pollution, aims to support the [[NOAA]]'s Marine Debris Program. In particular, the amendment is geared towards promoting NOAA’s Great Lakes Land-Based Marine Debris Action Plan to increase testing, cleanup, and education around plastic pollution in the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] signed the re-authorization and amendment bill into effect on October 11, 2018.

'''Japan'''

On June 15th, 2018, the Japanese government passed a bill with the goal of reducing microplastic production and pollution, especially in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/15/national/bill-reduce-microplastics-released-environment-passed-japans-upper-house/|title=Bill to reduce microplastics released into the environment passed by Japan’s Upper House|last=|first=|date=15 June 2018|work=[[The Japan Times]]|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed by the Environment Ministry and passed unanimously by the Upper House, this is also the first bill to pass in Japan that is specifically targeted at reducing microplastic production, specifically in the personal care industry with products such as face wash and toothpaste.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This law is revised from previous legislation, which focused on removing plastic marine debris. It also focuses on increasing education and public awareness surrounding recycling and plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Environment Ministry has also proposed a number of recommendations for methods to monitor microplastic quantities in the ocean (Recommendations, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2018|title=Recommendations by Experts on the Required Parameters for Microplastics Monitoring in the Ocean|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/water/marine_litter/pdf/recommendation.pdf|journal=Ministry of Environment, Japan|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislation does not specify any penalties for those who continue manufacturing products with microplastics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

The "Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017" law from passed by the UK government bans the production of any rinse-off personal care products (such as exfoliants) containing microbeads.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1312/pdfs/uksi_20171312_en.pdf|journal=Cabinet of the United Kingdom|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular law denotes specific penalties when it is not obeyed. Those who do not comply are required to pay a fine. In the event that a fine is not paid, product manufacturers may receive a stop notice, which prevents the manufacturer from continuing production until they have followed regulation preventing the use of microbeads. Criminal proceedings may occur if the stop notice is ignored.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Action for creating awareness ==
On April 11, 2013 in order to create awareness, artist [[Maria Cristina Finucci]] founded The [[Garbage patch state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/the_garbage_patch_territory_turns_into_a_new_state/#.U71u8fl_u9U|title=The garbage patch territory turns into a new state

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) launched its "Trash-Free Waters" initiative in 2013 to prevent single-use plastic wastes from ending up in waterways and ultimately the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/CoastalZoneManagement/EPA_Trash_Free_Waters_Program_Virginia_Marine_Debris_Summit_2013.pdf |title=EPA National Trash Free Waters Program |last1=Benson |first1=Bob |last2=Weiler |first2=Katherine |last3=Crawford |first3=Cara |date=2013-02-27 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.|id=Presentation at Virginia Marine Debris Summit, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA collaborates with the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]–Caribbean Environment Programme (UNEP-CEP) and the [[Peace Corps]] to reduce and also remove trash in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/international-initiatives-address-marine-debris |title=International Initiatives to Address Marine Debris |date=2018-04-18 |website=Trash-Free Waters |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has also funded various projects in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] including one that is aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastics such as disposable cups, spoons and straws, from three [[University of California]] campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/trash-free-waters-projects |title=Trash-Free Waters Projects |date=2017-09-27 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are many organizations advocating action to counter microplastics and that is spreading microplastic awareness. One such group is the Florida Microplastic Awareness Project (FMAP), a group of volunteers who search for microplastics in coastal water samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/flagler/marine-and-coastal/microplastics/|title=Microplastics  - UF/IFAS Extension|last=Communications|first=IFAS|website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanup ==
Computer modelling done by [[The Ocean Cleanup]], a Netherlands foundation, has suggested that collecting devices placed nearer to the coasts could remove about 31% of the microplastics in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Connor |first=Steve |date=2016-01-19 |title=How scientists plan to clean up plastic waste in the oceans |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/how-scientists-plan-to-clean-up-the-plastic-waste-threatening-marine-life-a6820276.html |work=The Independent |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Marine_debris#Environmental_impact|some bacteria]] have evolved to eat plastic, and some bacteria species have been genetically modified to eat (certain types of) plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aabgu.org/eating-away-the-worlds-plastic-waste-problem/|title=Eating Away the World's Plastic Waste Problem |date=2017-01-23 |website=News; Natural Sciences |publisher=American Associates, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 9, 2018, The Ocean Cleanup launched the world’s first ocean cleanup system, 001 aka “Wilson”, which is being deployed to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theoceancleanup.com/updates/system-001-has-launched-into-the-pacific/|title=System 001 has launched into the Pacific|last=www.theoceancleanup.com|first=The Ocean Cleanup,|work=The Ocean Cleanup|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; System 001 is 600 meters long that acts as a U-shaped skiff that uses natural oceanic currents to concentrate plastic and other debris on the ocean’s surface into a confined area for extraction by vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoceancleanup.com/technology/|title=The Ocean Cleanup Technology|last=www.theoceancleanup.com|first=The Ocean Cleanup|website=The Ocean Cleanup|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been met with criticism from oceanographers and plastic pollution experts, though it has seen wide public support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.deepseanews.com/2014/07/the-ocean-cleanup-part-2-technical-review-of-the-feasibility-study/|title=The Ocean Cleanup, Part 2: Technical review of the feasibility study|last=Martini|first=Kim|last2=Goldstein|first2=Miriam|date=14 July 2014|website=Deep Sea News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southernfriedscience.com/i-asked-15-ocean-plastic-pollution-experts-about-the-ocean-cleanup-project-and-they-have-concerns/|title=I asked 15 ocean plastic pollution experts about the Ocean Cleanup project, and they have concerns|last=Shiffman|first=David|date=13 June 2018|website=Southern Fried Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/26/ocean-cleanup-project-environment-pollution-boyan-slat|title=Too good to be true?

{{for|the scientific journal|Molecular Ecology}}
{{More citations needed|date=September 2014}}
'''Molecular ecology''' is a field of [[evolutionary biology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Brian|title=Measures of Divergence Between Populations and the Effect of Forces that Reduce Variability|url=http://www.filogeografia.dna.ac/PDFs/Charlesworth_B_98_Fst.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is concerned with applying molecular [[population genetics]], [[molecular phylogenetics]], and more recently [[genomics]] to traditional [[ecology|ecological]] questions (e.g., species diagnosis, conservation and assessment of biodiversity, species-area relationships, and many questions in behavioral ecology).  It is virtually synonymous with the field of "Ecological Genetics" as pioneered by [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[E. B. Ford]], [[Godfrey Hewitt|Godfrey M. Hewitt]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miglani |title=Essentials of Molecular Genetics |date=2015 |publisher=Alpha Science International Limited |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These fields are united in their attempt to study genetic-based questions "out in the field" as opposed to the laboratory. Molecular ecology is related to the field of [[Conservation genetics]].

Methods frequently include using [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellites]] to determine gene flow and [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between populations. The development of molecular ecology is also closely related to the use of [[microarray|DNA microarrays]], which allows for the simultaneous analysis of the expression of thousands of different genes. [[Quantitative PCR]] may also be used to analyze [[gene expression]] as a result of changes in environmental conditions or different response by differently adapted individuals.

==Bacterial diversity==
Molecular ecological techniques have recently been used to study ''in situ'' questions of bacterial diversity.  This stems from the fact that many [[microorganisms]] are not easily obtainable as cultured [[Strain (biology)|strains]] in the laboratory, which would allow for identification and characterisation. It also stems from the development of [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR technique]], which allows for rapid amplification of genetic material.

The amplification of [[DNA]] from environmental samples using general of group-specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]] leads to a mix of genetic material that has to be sorted out before sequencing and identification. The classic technique to achieve this is through cloning, which involves incorporating the amplified DNA fragments into bacterial [[plasmid]]s. Techniques such as [[temperature gradient gel electrophoresis]], allow for a faster result. More recently, the advent of relatively low-cost, next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, such as [[454 life sciences|454]] and [[Illumina (company)|Illumina]] platforms, has allowed exploration of bacterial ecology in relation to continental-scale environmental gradients such as pH&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lauber |first1=Christian L. |last2=Hamady |first2=Micah |last3=Knight |first3=Rob |last4=Fierer |first4=Noah |date=2009 |title=Pyrosequencing-based assessment of soil pH as a predictor of soil bacterial community structure at the continental scale |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=75 |issue=15 |pages=5111–5120 |doi=10.1128/AEM.00335-09 |pmc=2725504 |pmid=19502440}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was not feasible with traditional technology.

==Fungal diversity==

Exploration of fungal diversity ''in situ'' has also benefited from next-generation DNA sequencing technologies. The use of high-throughput sequencing techniques has been widely adopted by the fungal [[ecology]] community since the first publication of their use in the field in 2009.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Větrovský |first1=Tomáš |last2=Baldrian |first2=Petr |date=2013 |title=Analysis of soil fungal communities by amplicon pyrosequencing: current approaches to data analysis and the introduction of the pipeline SEED |journal=Biology and Fertility of Soils |volume=49 |issue=8 |pages=1027–1037 |doi=10.1007/s00374-013-0801-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to exploration of bacterial diversity, these techniques have allowed high-resolution studies of fundamental questions in fungal ecology such as [[phylogeography]],&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Amend | first1 = AS | last2 = Seifert | first2 = KA | last3 = Samson | first3 = R | last4 = Bruns | first4 = TD | year = 2010 | title = Indoor fungal composition is geographically patterned and more diverse in temperate zones than in the tropics | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 107 | issue = 31| pages = 13748–13753 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1000454107 | pmid=20616017 | pmc=2922287}}&lt;/ref&gt; fungal diversity in forest soils,&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buéé | first1 = M | last2 = Reich | first2 = M | last3 = Murat | first3 = C | last4 = Morin | first4 = E | last5 = Nilsson | first5 = RH | last6 = Uroz | first6 = S | last7 = Martin | first7 = F | year = 2009 | title = 454 Pyrosequencing analyses of forest soils reveal an unexpectedly high fungal diversity | url = | journal = New Phytol | volume = 184 | issue = 2| pages = 449–456 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03003.x| pmid = 19703112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; stratification of fungal communities in soil horizons,&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldrian | first1 = P | last2 = Kolarik | first2 = M | last3 = Stursova | first3 = M | last4 = Kopecky | first4 = J | last5 = Valaskova | first5 = V | last6 = Vetrovsky | first6 = T | display-authors = 6 | last7 = et al | year = 2012 | title = Active and total microbial communities in forest soil are largely different and highly stratified during decomposition | url = | journal = ISME J | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 248–258 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.95| pmid = 21776033 | pmc = 3260513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and fungal [[Ecological succession|succession]] on decomposing plant litter.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Voříšková | first1 = J | last2 = Baldrian | first2 = P | year = 2013 | title = Fungal community on decomposing leaf litter undergoes rapid successional changes | url = | journal = ISME J | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 477–486 | doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.116| pmid = 23051693 | pmc = 3578564 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of fungal ecology research leveraging next-generation sequencing approaches involves sequencing of [[PCR]] [[amplicons]] of conserved regions of DNA (i.e. marker genes) to identify and describe the distribution of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic groups]] in the fungal community in question, though more recent research has focused on sequencing functional gene [[amplicons]]&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; (e.g. Baldrian et al. 2012&lt;ref name="four" /&gt;). The locus of choice for description of the taxonomic structure of fungal communities has traditionally been the [[internal transcribed spacer]] (ITS) region of [[ribosomal RNA]] genes &lt;ref name="six"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seifert | first1 = KA | year = 2009 | title = Progress towards DNA barcoding of fungi | url = | journal = Mol Ecol Resour | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 83–89 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-0998.2009.02635.x| pmid = 21564968 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its utility in identifying fungi to genus or species taxonomic levels,&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Horton | first1 = TR | last2 = Bruns | first2 = TD | year = 2001 | title = The molecular revolution in ectomycorrhizal ecology: peeking into the black-box | url = | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 8| pages = 1855–1871 | doi=10.1046/j.0962-1083.2001.01333.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its high representation in public sequence databases.&lt;ref name="six" /&gt; A second widely used locus (e.g. Amend et al. 2010,&lt;ref name="two" /&gt; Weber et al. 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weber |first1=Carolyn. F. |last2=Vilgalys |first2=Rytas |last3=Kuske |first3=Cheryl R. |date=2013 |title=Changes in fungal community composition in response to elevated atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and nitrogen fertilization varies with soil horizon |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=4 |page=78 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2013.00078 |pmid=23641237 |pmc=3621283 |issn=1664-302X}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the D1-D3 region of [[28S ribosomal RNA]] genes, may not allow the low taxonomic level classification of the ITS,&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schoch | first1 = C.

== Extra-pair fertilizations ==
In recent years, molecular data and analyses have been able to supplement traditional approaches of [[behavioral ecology]], the study of animal behavior in relation to its ecology and evolutionary history. One behavior that molecular data has helped scientists better understand is extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs), also known as [[Extra-pair copulation|extra-pair copulations (EPCs)]]. These are mating events that occur outside of a social bond, like monogamy and are hard to observe.

Without molecular ecology, identifying individuals that participate in EPFs and the offspring that result from EPFs would be impossible.

== Isolation by distance ==
[[Isolation by distance]] (IBD), like reproductive isolation, is the effect of physical barriers to populations that limit migration and lower gene flow.  The shorter the distance between populations the more likely individuals are to disperse and mate and thus, increase gene flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wright | first1 = Sewall | year = 1943 | title = Isolation by Distance | url = | journal = Genetics | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 114–138 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of molecular data, specifically allele frequencies of individuals among populations in relation to their geographic distance help to explain concepts such as, sex-biased [[Inbreeding avoidance|dispersal]], [[speciation]], and landscape genetics.

The [[Mantel test]] is an assessment that compares genetic distance with geographic distance and is most appropriate because it doesn't assume that the comparisons are independent of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-74833-6|location=|pages=135|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are three main factors that influence the chances of finding a correlation of IBD, which include sample size, metabolism, and taxa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jenkins | first1 = D. G. | last2 = Carey | first2 = M. | last3 = Czerniewska | first3 = J. | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al | year = 2010 | title = A meta-analysis of isolation by distance: relic or reference standard for landscape genetics? | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06285.x | journal = Ecography | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 315–320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, based on the meta-analysis, ectotherms are more likely than endotherms to display greater IBD.

== Metapopulation theory ==

[[Metapopulation]] theory dictates that a metapopulation consists of spatially distinct populations that interact with one another on some level and move through a cycle of extinctions and recolonizations (i.e. through dispersal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levins | first1 = R | year = 1969 | title = Some demographic and genetic consequences of environmental heterogeneity for biological control | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Entomological Society of America | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 237–240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common metapopulation model is the extinction-recolonization model which explains systems in which spatially distinct populations undergo [[stochastic]] changes in population sizes which may lead to extinction at the population level. Once this has occurred, dispersing individuals from other populations will immigrate and "rescue" the population at that site. Other metapopulation models include the source-sink model (island-mainland model) where one (or multiple) large central population(s) produces disperses to smaller satellite populations that have a population growth rate of less than one and could not persist without the influx from the main population.

Metapopulation structure and the repeated extinctions and recolonizations can significantly affect a population's genetic structure. Recolonization by a few dispersers leads to [[population bottlenecks]] which will reduce the [[effective population size]] (Ne), accelerate [[genetic drift]], and deplete genetic variation. However, dispersal between populations in the metapopulation can reverse or halt these processes over the long term. Therefore, in order for individual sub-populations to remain healthy, they must either have a large population size or have a relatively high rate of dispersal with other subpopulations. Molecular ecology focuses on using tests to determine the rates of dispersal between populations and can use [[molecular clocks]] to determine when historic bottlenecks occurred. As habitat becomes more fragmented, dispersal between populations will become increasingly rare. Therefore, subpopulations that may have historically been preserved by a metapopulation structure may start to decline. Using mitochondrial or nuclear markers to monitor dispersal coupled with population Fst values and allelic richness can provide insight into how well a population is performing and how it will perform into the future.

==Molecular clocks==
The molecular clock hypothesis states that DNA sequences roughly evolve at the same rate and because of this the dissimilarity between two sequences can be used to tell how long ago they diverged from one another. The first step in of using a molecular clock is it must be calibrated based on the approximate time the two lineages being study diverged. The sources usually used to calibrate the molecular clocks are fossils or known geological events in the past. After calibrating the clock the next step is to calculate divergence time by dividing the estimated time since the sequences diverged by the amount of sequence divergence. The resulting number is the estimated rate at which molecular evolution is occurring. The most widely cited molecular clock is a ‘universal’ mtDNA clock of approximately 2 per cent sequence divergence every million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = W. M. | last2 = Prager | first2 = E. M. | last3 = Wang | first3 = A. | last4 = Wilson | first4 = A. C. | year = 1982 | title = Mitochondrial DNA sequences of primates: tempo and mode of evolution | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 18 | issue = 4| pages = 225–239 | doi=10.1007/bf01734101 | pmid=6284948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is referred to as a universal clock, this idea of "universal" clock is not really possible considering rates of evolution differ within DNA regions. Another drawback to using molecular clocks is that they ideally need to be calibrated from an independent source of data other than the molecular data. This poses a big problem for taxa that don’t fossilize or preserve well because its almost impossible to calibrate their molecular clocks. Despite these inconveniences, the molecular clock hypothesis is still used today, and has been successful in dating events happening as long ago as 65 million years such as the emergence of ancestral mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kumar | first1 = S. | last2 = Hedges | first2 = S. B. | year = 1998 | title = A molecular timescale for vertebrate evolution | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 392 | issue = | pages = 917–920 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mate choice hypotheses ==
The concept of [[mate choice]] explains how organisms select their mates based on two main methods; The Good Genes Hypothesis and Genetic Compatibility. 
The Good Genes Hypothesis, also referred to as the [[sexy son hypothesis]], suggests that the females will choose a male that produce an offspring that will have increased fitness advantages and [[genetic viability]]. Therefore, the mates that are more 'attractive" are more likely to be chosen for mating and pass on their genes to the next generation. In species which exhibit [[polyandry]] the females will search out for the most suitable males and re-mate until they have found the best sperm to fertilize their eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yasui |first1=Yukio |date=March 1997 |title=A "Good-Sperm" model can explain the evolution of costly multiple mating by females |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=149 |issue=3 |pages=573–584 |doi=10.1086/286006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Genetic compatibility is where mates are choosing their partner based on the compatibility of their genotypes. The mate which is doing the selecting must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Puurtinen |first1=Mikael |last2=Ketola |first2=Tarmo |last3=Kotiaho |first3=Janne S. |date=April 2005 |title=Genetic compatibility and sexual selection |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=157–158 |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.005 |pmid=16701361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic compatibility in most instances is limited to specific traits, such as the [[major histocompatibility complex]] in mammals, because of complex genetic interactions. This behavior is potentially seen in humans. A study looking at women's choice in men based on body odors concluded that the scent of the odors were influenced by the MHC and that they influence mate choice in human populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedekind |first1=Claus |last2=Seebeck |first2=Thomas |last3=Bettens |first3=Florence |last4=Paeke |first4=Alexander J. |date=1995 |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences |volume=260 |issue=1359 |pages=245–249 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087 |issn=0962-8452 |pmid=7630893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex-Biased Dispersal ==
Sex-biased dispersal, or the tendency of one sex to disperse between populations more frequently than the other, is a common behavior studied by researchers. Three major hypotheses currently exist to help explain sex-biased dispersal. The resource-competition hypothesis infers that the more philopatric sex (the sex more likely to remain at its natal grounds) benefits during reproduction simply by having familiarity with natal ground resources. A second proposal for sex-biased dispersal is the local mate competition hypothesis, which introduces the idea that individuals encounter less mate competition with relatives the farther from their natal grounds they disperse. And the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis suggests individuals disperse to decrease inbreeding.

Studying these hypotheses can be arduous since it is nearly impossible to keep track of every individual and their whereabouts within and between populations. To combat this time-consuming method, scientists have recruited several molecular ecology techniques in order to study sex-biased dispersal. One method is the comparison of differences between nuclear and mitochondrial markers among populations. Markers showing higher levels of differentiation indicate the more philopatric sex; that is, the more a sex remains at natal grounds, the more their markers will take on a unique I.D, due to lack of gene flow with respect to that marker. Researchers can also quantify male-male and female-female pair relatedness within populations to understand which sex is more likely to disperse. Pairs with values consistently lower in one sex indicate the dispersing sex. This is because there is more gene flow in the dispersing sex and their markers are less similar than individuals of the same sex in the same population, which produces a low relatedness value. FST values are also used to understand dispersing behaviors by calculating an FST value for each sex. The sex that disperses more displays a lower FST value, which measures levels of inbreeding between the subpopulation and the total population. Additionally, assignment tests can be utilized to quantify the number of individuals of a certain sex dispersing to other populations. A more mathematical approach to quantifying sex-biased dispersal on the molecular level is the use of spatial autocorrelation. This correlation analyzes the relationship between geographic distance and spatial distance. A correlation coefficient, or r value, is calculated and the plot of r against distance provides an indication of individuals more related to or less related to one another than expected.&lt;ref&gt;Freeland, Joanna; Kirk, Heather; Petersen, Stephen (2011).

== Quantitative trait loci ==
A [[quantitative trait locus]] (QTL) refers to a suite of genes that controls a quantitative trait. A quantitative trait is one that is influenced by several different genes as opposed to just one or two.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Peterson|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-119-99308-7|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=169–172|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; QTLs are analyzed using Qst. Qst looks at the relatedness of the traits in focus. In the case of QTLs, clines are analyzed by Qst. A [[cline (biology)]] is a change in allele frequency across a geographical distance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This change in allele frequency causes a series of intermediate varying phenotypes that when associated with certain environmental conditions can indicate selection. This selection causes local adaptation, but high gene flow is still expected to be present along the cline.

For example, barn owls in Europe exhibit a cline in reference to their plumage coloration. Their feathers range in coloration from white to reddish-brown across the geological range of the southwest to the northeast.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antoniazza|first=Sylvain|last2=Burri|first2=Reto|last3=Fumagalli|first3=Luca|last4=Goudet|first4=Jérôme|last5=Roulin|first5=Alexandre|date=2010-07-01|title=Local adaptation maintains clinal variation in melanin-based coloration of European barn owls (Tyto alba)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1944–1954|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.00969.x|issn=1558-5646|pmid=20148951}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study sought to find if this phenotypic variation was due to selection by calculating the Qst values across the owl populations. Because high gene flow was still anticipated along this cline, selection was only expected to act upon the QTLs that incur locally adaptive phenotypic traits. This can be determined by comparing the Qst values to Fst ([[fixation index]]) values. If both of these values are similar and Fst is based on neutral markers then it can be assumed that the QTLs were based on neutral markers (markers not under selection or locally adapted) as well. However, in the case of the barn owls the Qst value was much higher than the Fst value. This means that high gene flow was present allowing the neutral markers to be similar, indicated by the low Fst value. But, local adaptation due to selection was present as well, in the form of varying plumage coloration since the Qst value was high, indicating differences in these non-neutral loci.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, this cline of plumage coloration has some sort of adaptive value to the birds.

== Fixation indices ==
[[Fixation indices]] are used when determining the level of genetic differentiation between sub-populations within a total population. F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; is the script used to represent this index when using the formula:
: &lt;math&gt; F_{ST} = \frac{ H_{T} - H_{S} } { H_{T} } &lt;/math&gt;
In this equation, H&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; represents the expected [[heterozygosity]] of the total population and H&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the expected heterozygosity of a sub-populations. Both measures of heterozygosity are measured at one loci. In the equation, heterozygosity values expected from the total population are compared to observed heterozygosity values of the sub-populations within this total population. Larger F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values imply that the level of genetic differentiation between sub-populations within a total population is more significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Freeland |first1=Joanna R. |last2=Kirk |first2=Heather |last3=Petersen |first3=Stephen D. |title=Molecular ecology |date=2011 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell (an imprint of John Wiley &amp; Sons) |location=Chicester |isbn=978-0-470-74833-6 |pages=131–135 |edition=2nd rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of differentiation is the result of a balance between [[gene flow]] amongst sub-populations (decreasing differentiation) and [[genetic drift]] within these sub-populations (increasing differentiation); however, some molecular ecologists note that it cannot be assumed that these factors are at equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Woiwood |first1=Ian |last2=Reynolds |first2=D.

In these cases, higher F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values typically imply higher amounts of inbreeding within the sub-populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inbreeding and Population Structure |url=http://www.uvm.edu/~dstratto/bcor102/readings/inbreeding.pdf |publisher=University of Vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other factors such as selection pressures may also affect F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hu |first1=Xin-Sheng |last2=He |first2=Fangliang |title=Background selection and population differentiation |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |url=https://sites.ualberta.ca/~fhe/He-publications/Hu_He.JTB05.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2005.01.004 |pmid=15862590 |volume=235 |issue=2 |year=2005 |pages=207–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values are accompanied by several analog equations (F&lt;sub&gt;IS&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;, etc.).These additional measures are interpreted in a similar manner to F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; values; however, they are adjusted to accompany other factors that F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt; may not, such as accounting for multiple loci.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=An Introduction to Restoration Genetics: How is Genetic Diversity Distributed in Natural Populations? |url=https://www.nps.gov/plants/restore/pubs/restgene/2.htm |website=www.nps.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inbreeding depression ==
[[Inbreeding depression]] is the reduced fitness and survival of offspring from closely related parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charlesworth|first1=Deborah|last2=Willis|first2=John|title=The genetics of inbreeding depression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=November 2009|volume=10|issue=11|pages=783–796|doi=10.1038/nrg2664|url=http://www.nature.com/nrg/journal/v10/n11/full/nrg2664.html|accessdate=2016-12-12|pmid=19834483}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding is commonly seen in small populations because of the greater chance of mating with a relative due to limited [[mate choice]]. Inbreeding, especially in small populations, is more likely to result in higher rates of [[genetic drift]], which leads to higher rates of homozygosity at all loci in the population and decreased [[heterozygosity]]. The rate of inbreeding is based on decreased heterozygosity. In other words, the rate at which heterozygosity is lost from a population due to genetic drift is equal to the rate of accumulating inbreeding in a population. In the absence of migration, inbreeding will accumulate at a rate that is inversely proportional to the size of the population.

There are two ways in which inbreeding depression can occur. The first of these is through '''dominance''', where beneficial alleles are usually dominant and harmful alleles are usually recessive. The increased homozygosity resulting from inbreeding means that harmful alleles are more likely to be expressed as homozygotes, and the deleterious effects cannot be masked by the beneficial dominant allele. 
The second method through which inbreeding depression occurs is through [[overdominance]], or heterozygote advantage. Individuals that are heterozygous at a particular locus have a higher fitness than homozygotes at that locus. Inbreeding leads to decreased heterozygosity, and therefore decreased fitness.

Deleterious alleles can be scrubbed by natural selection from inbred populations through [[genetic purging]]. As homozygosity increases, less fit individuals will be selected against and thus those harmful alleles will be lost from the population.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeland|first1=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Peterson|first3=Stephen|title=Molecular Ecology|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=John Wiley &amp; Son Ltd, The Atrium, Southern Gate, Chichester, West Sussex, PO19 8SQ, UK|isbn=978-0-470-74834-3|pages=337–341|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outbreeding depression ==
Outbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness in the offspring of distantly related parents. The decline in fitness due to outbreeding is attributed to a breakup of coadapted gene complexes or favorable epistatic relationships.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynch | first1 = Michael | year = 1991| title = The genetic interpretation of inbreeding depression and outbreeding depression | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 1991 | issue = 3| pages = 622–629 | doi=10.2307/2409915| jstor = 2409915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[inbreeding depression]], outbreeding depression places emphasis on interactions between loci rather than within them.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Risks of outbreeding depression increase with increased distance between populations. If outbreeding is limited and the population is large enough selective pressure acting on each generation may be able to restore fitness. Selection acts on out bred generations using increased diversity to adapt to the environment. This may result in greater fitness among offspring than the original parental type.

== Conservation units ==
Conservation units are classifications often used in [[conservation biology]], [[conservation genetics]], and molecular ecology in order to separate and group different species or populations based on genetic variance and significance for protection.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Ecology|last=Freeland|first=Joanna|last2=Kirk|first2=Heather|last3=Petersen|first3=Stephen|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2011|isbn=978-0-470-74833-6|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=332–333|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the most common types of conservation units are:
* Management Units (MU): Management units are populations that have very low levels of [[gene flow]] and can therefore be genetically differentiated from other populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
* [[Evolutionarily significant unit]]s (ESU): Evolutionarily significant units are populations that show enough genetic differentiation to warrant their management as distinct units.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
Conservation units are often identified using both neutral and non-neutral genetic markers, with each having its own advantages. Using neutral markers during unit identification can provide unbiased assumptions of [[genetic drift]] and time since reproductive isolation within and among species and populations, while using non-neutral markers can provide more accurate estimations of adaptive evolutionary divergence, which can help determine the potential for a conservation unit to adapt within a certain habitat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Because of conservation units, populations and species that have high or differing levels of genetic variation are can be distinguished in order to manage each individually, which can ultimately differ based on a number of factors. In one instance, [[Atlantic salmon]] located within the [[Bay of Fundy]] were given evolutionary significance based on the differences in genetic sequences found among different populations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandersteen Tymchuk|first=Wendy|last2=O’reilly|first2=Patrick|last3=Bittman|first3=Jesse|last4=Macdonald|first4=Danielle|last5=Schulte|first5=Patricia|date=2010-05-01|title=Conservation genomics of Atlantic salmon: variation in gene expression between and within regions of the Bay of Fundy|journal=Molecular Ecology|language=en|volume=19|issue=9|pages=1842–1859|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04596.x|pmid=20529070|issn=1365-294X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This detection of evolutionary significance can allow each population of salmon to receive customized conservation and protection based on their adaptive uniqueness in response to geographic location.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Phylogenies ==
Phylogenies are the evolutionary history of an organism, also known as [[Phylogeography]]. A [[Phylogenetic tree]] is a tree that shows evolutionary relationships between different species based on similarities/differences among genetic or physical traits. Phylogenies embrace aspects of both time (evolutionary relationships) and space (geographic distribution).&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011"&gt;Freeland, Joanna, Stephen Petersen, and Heather Kirk. Molecular Ecology. 2nd ed. Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically phylogeny trees include tips, which represent groups of descendent species, and nodes, which represent the common ancestors of those descendants. If two descendants split from the same node, they are called [[Sister groups]]. They also may include an [[outgroup (cladistics)|outgroup]], a species outside of the group of interest.&lt;ref&gt;		"Reading trees: A quick review" Understanding Evolution. University of California Museum of Paleontology. 22 August 2008 &lt;http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/news/060101_batsars&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The trees depict [[clades]], which is a group of organisms that include an ancestor and all descendants of that ancestor. The [[maximum parsimony]] tree is the simplest tree that has the minimum number of steps possible.

Phylogenies confer important historical processes that shape current distributions of genes and species.&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011"/&gt; When two species become isolated from each other they retain some of the same ancestral alleles also known as allele sharing. Alleles can be shared because of lineage sorting and hybridization. Lineage sorting is driven by genetic drift  and must occur before alleles become species specific. Some of these alleles over time will simply be lost, or they may proliferate. Hybridization leads to [[introgression]] of alleles from one species to another.

== Species concepts ==
Species concepts are the subject of debate in the field of molecular ecology. Since the beginning of taxonomy, scientists have wanted to standardize and perfect the way species are defined. There are many species concepts that dictate how ecologists determine a good species. The most commonly used concept is the [[biological species concept]] which defines a species as groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups (Mayr, 1942).&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011" /&gt; This concept is not always useful, particularly when it comes to hybrids. Other species concepts include phylogenetic species concept which describes a species as the smallest identifiable monophyletic group of organisms within which there is a parental pattern of ancestry and descent.&lt;ref name="Freeland, Joanna 2011" /&gt; This concept defines species on the identifiable. It would also suggest that until two identifiable groups actually produce offspring, they remain separate species. In 1999, John Avise and Glenn Johns suggested a standardized method for defining species based on past speciation and measuring biological classifications as time dependent. Their method used temporal banding to make genus, family and order based on how many tens of millions of years ago the speciation event that resulted in each species took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Avise |first=John |last2=Johns |first2=Glenn |year=1999 |title=Proposal for a standardized temporal scheme of biological classification for extant species |journal=Evolution |volume=96 |issue=13 |pages=7358–7363 |pmc=22090 |pmid=10377419 |doi=10.1073/pnas.96.13.7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape Genetics ==
Landscape genetics is a rapidly emerging interdisciplinary field within molecular ecology. Landscape genetics relates genetics to landscape characteristics, such as land-cover use (forests, agriculture, roads, etc.), presence of barriers and corridors, rivers, elevation, etc. Landscape genetics is used to answer how landscape affects dispersal and gene flow.

Barriers are any landscape features that prevents dispersal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Barriers for terrestrial species can include mountains, rivers, roads, and unsuitable terrain, such as agriculture fields. Barriers for aquatic species can include islands or dams. Barriers are species specific; for example a river is a barrier to a field mouse, while a hawk can fly over a river. Corridors are areas over which dispersal is possible.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Corridors are stretches of suitable habitat and can also be man-made, such as overpasses over roads and fish ladders on dams.

Geographic data used for landscape genetics can include data collected by radars in planes, land satellite data, marine data collected by NOAA, as well as any other ecological data. In landscape genetics researchers often use different analyses to attempt to determine the best way for a species to travel from point A to point B. Least cost path analysis uses geographic data to determine the most efficient path from one point to another.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Circuit scape analysis predicts all the possible paths and the probability of each path's use between point A and point B. These analyses are used to determine the route a dispersing individual is likely to travel.

Landscape genetics is becoming an increasingly important tool in wildlife conservation efforts. It is being used to determine how habitat loss and fragmentation affects the movement of species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holderegger|first=Rolf|last2=Wagner|first2=Helene H.|date=2008-03-01|title=Landscape Genetics|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/3/199|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=58|issue=3|pages=199–207|doi=10.1641/B580306|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to determine which species need to be managed and whether to manage subpopulations the same or differently according to their gene flow.

It is based in part on the [[Ship of Theseus]] which, however, is standardly used to illustrate other philosophical questions, to do with problems of [[identity (philosophy)|identity]].&lt;ref name=ONPSP&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|title=Otto Neurath: Philosophy Between Science and Politics|volume=38|series=Ideas in Context|first1=Nancy|last1=Cartwright|authorlink1=Nancy Cartwright (philosopher) |first2=Jordi|last2=Cat|first3=Lola|last3=Fleck|first4=Thomas E.|last4=Uebel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=9780521041119|chapter=On Neurath's Boat|pages=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popularised by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in ''[[Word and Object]]'' (1960).

==Different versions==
Neurath used the simile in several occasions,&lt;ref name=ONPSP/&gt;&lt;ref name=antispengler&gt;{{cite book |last=Neurath |first=Otto |title=Anti-Spengler |year=1921 |doi=10.1007/978-94-010-2525-6_6 |isbn=978-90-277-0259-3 |at=Vienna Circle Collection vol. 1: ''Empiricism and Sociology'' (1973)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first being in Neurath's text ''Problems in War Economics''.

{{quote|We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom. Where a beam is taken away a new one must at once be put there, and for this the rest of the ship is used as support. In this way, by using the old beams and driftwood the ship can be shaped entirely anew, but only by gradual reconstruction.}}

[[Keith Stanovich|Stanovich]], in his book ''The Robot's Rebellion'', refers to it as a '''Neurathian bootstrap''' and uses it as an analogy to the [[recursion|recursive]] nature of revising one's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2004-05-15). ''The Robot's Rebellion: Finding Meaning in the Age of Darwin'' (1 ed.). University Of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0-226-77089-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A "rotten plank" on the ship, for instance, might refer to a [[meme|meme virus]] or a junk meme (i.e., a meme that is either maladaptive to the individual, or serves no beneficial purpose for the realization of an individual's life goals). It may be impossible to bring the ship to shore for repairs, therefore one may stand on planks that are not rotten in order to repair or replace the ones that are. At a later time, the planks previously used for support may be tested by standing on other planks that are not rotten:

{{quote|"We can conduct certain tests assuming that certain [[memeplex]]es (e.g., science, logic, rationality) are foundational, but at a later time we might want to bring these latter memeplexes into question too. The more comprehensively we have tested our interlocking memeplexes, the more confident we can be that we have not let a meme virus enter into our mindware..." (p. 181)}}

In this way, one might proceed to examine and revise their beliefs so as to become more rational.

'''Object literacy''' is a relatively new term that has grown out of Object Based Learning (OBL), which has long been a fundamental part of museum and library work. The increasing availability of digital images and texts makes objects more accessible than ever. Now that the objects and texts are more available, there is an increasing interest in the physicality of the object or text, and a growing understanding of the need to understand objects and texts  in the fullest, most comprehensive context.

== Definitions of Object Literacy ==
* "Object literacy is a special skill gained through the process of discovery and discussion about original objects. It is a skill which, like others, must be learned. Museums have original objects, artifacts, or works of art. Therefore, museums are logical places in which to teach people to become object literate." - Sally Leahy (1995)&lt;ref&gt;Sally Leahy, “Object Literacy,” The Docent Educator 4.3 (Spring 1995): 17. http://www.museum-ed.org/object-literacy/ - retrieved 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object literacy is also seen as "a subset of [[visual literacy]], leading to a new brand of museum literacy." - Carin Jacobs (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Carin Jacobs, "Beyond the field trip: museum literacy and higher education", ''Museum Management and Curatorship'', Vol. 24, No. 1, March 2009, 5�27 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09647770902731585 - retrieved 25 June 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
* Object literacy recognises "the current trend for printed material and text as a visual medium” in which people “study ways in which the physical aspects of rare books [and other objects] contribute to the understanding the text”.&lt;ref&gt;Tabitha Tuckett and Elizabeth Lawes, "Object literacy at University College London Library Services", ''Art Libraries Journal'', Volume 42, Issue 2 (Information Literacy in UK and US Art Libraries), April 2017 , pp. 99-106.   https://doi.org/10.1017/alj.2017.13 - Retrieved 25 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent projects relating to Object Literacy ==
* [[University College London]] (UCL): “In keeping with the UCL 2034 strategy, the Connected Curriculum encourages participation in research at all levels of study and OBL methods enable interdisciplinary enquiry and collaborative practices.”

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9939">The term '''phonestheme''' ({{IPAc-en|f|oʊ|ˈ|n|ɛ|s|θ|iː|m}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Merriam-Webster|phonestheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''phonaestheme''' in British English) was coined in 1930 by British linguist [[J. R. Firth]] (from the Greek φωνή ''phone'', "sound", and αἴσθημα ''aisthema'', "perception" from αίσθάνομαι ''aisthanomai'', "I perceive")  to label the systematic pairing of form and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in a [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Firth, J. R. | authorlink = J. R. Firth |year=1964 |orig-year=1930 |title = The Tongues of Men, and Speech | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = London | page = 211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such pairing would violate the [[Course_in_General_Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness principle]] of [[semantics]].

A phonestheme is different from a [[morpheme]] because it does not meet the normal criterion of [[compositionality]].

Within [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce's]] "theory of signs" the phonestheme is considered to be an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|icon]]" rather than a "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|symbol]]" or an "[[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon, index, symbol|index]]".

==Identification==
Phonesthemes are of critical interest to students of the internal structure of words because they appear to be a case where the internal structure of the word is non-compositional; i.e., a word with a phonestheme in it has other material in it that is not itself a morpheme.  Phonesthemes "fascinate some linguists", as [[Ben Zimmer]] has phrased it, in a process that can become "mystical" or "unscientific".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |author-link=Ben_Zimmer |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/lexicon_valley/2014/10/lexicon_valley_the_etymology_and_history_of_the_word_snark_with_lexicographer.html |title=Where Did the Word ''Snark'' Come From? |website=Lexicon Valley |publisher=Slate |host=Bob Garfield and Mike Vuolo |date=2014-10-20 |time=0:27:30 |access-date=2015-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For example, the English phonestheme "gl-" occurs in a large number of words relating to light or vision, like "glitter", "glisten", "glow", "gleam", "glare", "glint", "glimmer", "gloss", and so on; yet, despite this, the remainder of each word is not itself a phonestheme (i.e., a pairing of form and meaning); i.e., "-isten", "-ow", and "-eam" do not make meaningful contributions to "glisten", "glow", and "gleam".
There are three main ways in which phonesthemes are empirically identified.

===Corpus studies===
The first is through corpus studies, where the words of a language are subjected to statistical analysis, and the particular form-meaning pairing, or phonestheme, is shown to constitute a statistically unexpected distribution in the lexicon or not.

Corpus studies can inform a researcher about the current state of the lexicon, a critical first step, but importantly are completely uninformative when it comes to questions of whether and how phonesthemes are represented in the minds of language users.

===Study of patterns in neologisms===
The second type of approach makes use of the tendency for phonesthemes to participate in the coinage and interpretation of [[neologisms]] (i.e., new words in a language). Various studies have demonstrated that, when asked to invent or interpret new words, subjects tend to follow the patterns that are predicted by the phonesthemes in their language. It is known, for example, that the word ''bangle'' is a [[Loanword|loan]] from [[Hindi language|Hindi]] but speakers tend to associate it with English [[onomatopoeia]] like ''bang''. While this approach demonstrates the vitality of phonesthemic patterns, it does not provide any evidence about whether (or how) phonesthemes are represented in the minds of speaker-hearers.

===Study of linguistic processing patterns===
The final type of evidence uses the methods of [[psycholinguistics]] to study exactly how phonesthemes participate in language processing. One such method is phonesthemic priming — akin to morphological priming — which demonstrates that people represent phonesthemes much as they do typical morphemes, despite the fact that phonesthemes are non-compositional.

Discussions of phonesthesia are often grouped with other phenomena under the rubric of [[sound symbolism]].

==Distribution==
Phonesthemes have been documented in numerous languages from diverse language families, among them English, Swedish, and other [[Indo-European languages]], [[Austronesian languages]], and Japanese.

While phonesthemes have mostly been identified in the onsets of words and syllables, they can have other forms. There has been some argument that sequences like "-ash" and "-ack" in English also serve as phonesthemes, due to their patterning in words that denote forceful, destructive contact ("smash", "crash", "bash", etc.) and abrupt contact ("smack", "whack", "crack", etc.), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bolinger |first=Dwight |date=1980 |title=Language, the Loaded Weapon: The use and abuse of language today |location=New York |publisher=Longman |page=20 |isbn=0582291089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the distribution of phonesthemes, linguists consider their ''motivation''. In some cases, there may appear to be good sound-symbolic reasons why phonesthemes would have the form they have. In the case of "-ack", for example, we might imagine that the words sharing this phonestheme do so because they denote events that would produce a similar sound. But critically, there are many phonesthemes for which there can be no sound-symbolic basis, such as "gl-", for the simple reason that their meanings (such as 'pertaining to light or vision') entail no sound.

While there are numerous studies on living languages, research is lacking about ancient languages, although the first documented example of phonesthemes dates back to at least the fourth century B.C.: Plato's
Cratylus clearly mentioned the gl- and st- phonesthemes and their explanation in terms of phonosemantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Leonardi |first=Filippo Maria |date=2015 |title=Phonesthemes in Latin Language |publisher=Academia.edu |url=https://www.academia.edu/17549917/Phonesthemes_in_Latin_Language_2015_}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of phonesthemes in English (aside from "gl-"), include "sn-", related to the mouth or nose, as in "snarl", "snout", "snicker", "snack", and so on; and there is also a set of words starting with "sl-", which appears in words denoting frictionless motion, like "slide", "slick", "sled", and so on - which are themselves a subset of a larger set of words beginning with sl- that are pejorative behaviours, traits, or events: slack, slouch, sludge, slime, slosh, slash, sloppy, slug, sluggard, slattern, slut, slang, sly, slither, slow, sloth, sleepy, sleet, slip, slipshod, slope, slit, slay, sleek, slant, slovenly, slab, slap, slough, slum, slump, slobber, slaver, slur, slog, slate.

==Ablaut phonesthesia==
{{original research|section|date=November 2018}}
A further phonesthetic phenomenon, ablaut [[phonesthesia]], mimics the paradigm of a strong verb like ''swim'' : ''swam'' : ''swum'' with internal vowel change or ''[[apophony]]''. Take the word "flip."  It has an alliterative group, "fl-", that evokes the volatility of fly, flow, flee, fleet, flash, flake, and flick. Its rhymes, dip, sip, quip, drip, pip, tip, slip, and so forth, add to a connotation of minor labile action. But it is also part of an ablaut series where vowel alternation has semantic value (as in "flip-flop").

This kind of vowel alternation can be found in reduplicated word pairs like "pitter-patter," "chit-chat," "tip-top," or "tip-tap."

A regularity of phonesthetic relationship is shown by proportional analogies such as '''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp''';&lt;ref&gt;The conventionally abbreviated expressions, such as "'''clip : clasp :: grip : grasp'''", when fully expanded, are read as "'''clip''' is to '''clasp''' in precisely the same way as '''grip''' is to '''grasp'''", and so on.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''crash : crush :: mash : mush'''; or '''crash : crunch :: mash : munch'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite mailing list |mailing-list=Linguist List |last=Grew |first=Philip |title=re: 9.1050 Phonological Clusters of Semantically Similar Words |date=1998-08-05 |url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/9/9-1106.html |access-date=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''picture dictionary''' or '''pictorial dictionary''' is a [[dictionary]] where the definition of a word is displayed in the form of a drawing or photograph. Picture dictionaries are useful in a variety of teaching environments, such as teaching a young child about their [[native language]], or instructing older students in a [[foreign language]], such as in the [[Culturally Authentic Pictorial Lexicon]]. Picture dictionaries are often organized by topic instead of being an alphabetic list of words, and almost always include only a small corpus of words.

A similar but distinct concept is the [[visual dictionary]], which is composed of a series of large, labelled images, allowing the user to find the name of a specific component of a larger object.

[[File:Skandinavism.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The mid-19th century [[Scandinavism]] political movement led to the modern use of the term [[Scandinavia]].]]

In the [[social science]]s, a '''political movement''' is a [[social group]] that operates together to obtain a [[political]] [[goal]],&lt;ref&gt;[[dict:political movement|Political movement]]. dict.org&lt;/ref&gt; on a local, regional, national, or international scope. Political [[Political process theory|movements develop]], [[Coordination game|coordinate]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Coordination failure (political science)|Coordination failure]]&lt;/ref&gt; promulgate,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[decree]]s, [[Speech_act#Classifying_illocutionary_speech_acts|declaration]]s, and [[wikt:announcement|announcement]]s&lt;/ref&gt; revise,&lt;ref&gt;''See:'' [[Historical revisionism|political revisionism]] and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negationism]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amendment|amend]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Constitutional amendment]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermeneutics|interpret]],&lt;ref&gt;''See also:'' [[Judicial interpretation]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Propaganda|produce materials]] that are intended to address the goals of the [[Identity politics|base of the movement]]. A [[social movement]] in the area of [[politics]] can be organized around a single issue or set of issues, or around a set of shared concerns of a [[social group]]. In a [[political party]], a [[political organization]] seeks to influence, or control, [[government policy]], usually by nominating their candidates and seating candidates in politics and governmental offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mc Donald|first=Neil|title=The Study of Political Parties|year=1963|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, parties participate in [[elections|electoral campaigns]] and educational outreach or protest actions aiming to convince citizens or governments to take action on the issues and concerns which are the focus of the movement. Parties often espouse an [[ideology]], expressed in a party program, bolstered by a written [[Party platform|platform]] with specific goals, forming a [coalition] among [[disparate]] interests.

==Examples==
Some political movements have aimed to change government policy, such as the [[Peace movement|anti-war movement]], the [[ecology movement]], and the [[anti-globalization movement]].  Many have aimed to establish or broaden the rights of subordinate groups, such as [[abolitionism]], the [[women's suffrage]] movement, the [[civil rights movement]], [[feminism]], [[LGBT social movements|gay rights movement]], the [[disability rights movement]], or the inclusive [[human rights]] movement.  Some have represented class interests, such as the [[Labour movement]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], others have expressed national aspirations, such as [[Anticolonialism|anticolonialist]] movements, [[Ratana]], [[Zionism]], and [[Sinn Féin]].  Political movements can also involve struggles to decentralize or centralize state control, as in [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]].

With [[globalization]], [[global citizens movement]]s may have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Global Citizens Movement. A New Actor For a New Politics | publisher=TransNational Institute | date=2001-10-18 | accessdate=2013-06-05 | author=George, Susan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movements may be named by outsiders, as with the [[levellers]] political movement in 17th century England was so named as a [[term of disparagement]]. Yet admirers of the movement and its aims later came to use the term, and it is the term by which they are known to history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Plant, David | url = http://www.british-civil-wars.co.uk/glossary/levellers.htm | title = The Levellers | accessdate = 2013-06-05| date = 2005-12-14 | work = British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ProgramByDesign project''', formerly known as '''TeachScheme! project''', is an outreach effort of the [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]]
research group. The goal is to train college faculty, high school teachers and
possibly even middle school teachers in programming and computing.

==History==

[[Matthias Felleisen]] and [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]] started the effort in 1995 (January, one day after the POPL symposium)
in response to observations of his Rice freshmen students and the algebra curriculum
of local public schools. His objective was to use functional programming to bring
mathematics alive and to help inject design knowledge into the introductory
[[computer science]] [[curriculum]].

The group raised funds from several private foundations, the US Department of Education, and the National Science Foundation to create 
* software appropriate for novices in functional programming
* courseware (curricula, lecture notes, exercises, mini-projects)
* teacher training camps.

Over ten years, it ran several dozen one-week workshops for some 550 teachers.  In
2005, the TeachScheme! project ran an Anniversary workshop where two dozen teachers
presented their work with students.

In 2010, [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]] renamed its major programming language [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]].  At the same time, the group renamed  DrScheme to [[DrRacket]] and a little later TeachScheme! to ProgramByDesign.

==Functional Programming, Computing and Algebra==

The starting point of ProgramByDesign is the observation that students act as computers in
grade school courses on arithmetic and middle/high school courses on
pre/algebra. Teachers program them with rules and run specific problems via
exercises. The key is that students execute purely functional programs.

If we can turn students into teachers that create functional programs and run them
on computers, we can reinforce this content and show students how writing down
mathematics and how writing down functional programs creates lively animated scenes
and even computer games.

Here is an example: 
&lt;source lang="racket"&gt;
(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

;; create an image from the current time 
(define (create-image t) 
   (place-image APPLE 50 (* 1/10 t t) SPACE))

;; names for basic images 
(define APPLE (circle 3 "solid"  "red"))
(define SPACE (empty-scene 100 100))

(animate create-image)
&lt;/source&gt;
This short program simulates an apple falling from the top to the bottom of a
small white canvas. It consists of three parts: 
* a function definition for create-image, which is a one-line function in mathematics, assuming an algebra of images with place-image, circle, and empty-scene have been introduced;
* two abbreviations, where names are equated with some value, just as in "let x be 5" in an algebra text; and
* one line for running the program.

A teacher can explain create-image as easily as any ordinary function in an algebra
course. For example, one can first draw a table with two rows and ''n''
columns where each column contains ''t'' at the top and an appropriate image at
the bottom. That is, if the numbers increase from left to right, then on each image the
red dot is a little bit lower.

Finally the animate line applies the given function, create-image, at the
rate of 28 ticks per second to 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The resulting images are 
displayed on the computer monitor at the same pace. That's how movies are made.

The background needed for such an example is little more than knowledge about making
movies, about the algebra of pictures in [[DrRacket]] (which is like the one for
numbers), and minimal pre-algebra. The ProgramByDesign project claims, however, that
children would have more fun with such "live" functions than with algebraic
expressions that count the number of garden tiles [see Prentice Hall books for
grades 8-9].

The ProgramByDesign project proposes that both traditional mathematics as well as
science courses could benefit from an integration of this form of programming. In
contrast to the traditional Basic or Visual Basic blocks in such books, a Racket
program consists of as many lines as the mathematics. Moving between the mathematics
and the program is thus straightforward. Better still, the meaning of the two are
the same. [[DrRacket]]'s algebraic stepper can illustrate how Racket evaluates the
program as if it were a sixth or seventh grade student, step by step, using plain
algebra.

==Functional Programming, Computing and Design in Programming 101==

For the introductory curriculum on programming, the ProgramByDesign project emphasizes
that courses should focus on the role of systematic design. Even if students never
program again, they should see how helpful a systematic approach to problem solving
is. This should help them whether they become programmers or doctors or journalists or
photographers. Thus, an introductory course in programming would not be perceived as a
place where students learn about the syntax of the currently fashionable (and soon-to-be-obsolete) programming
languages, but a place where they can learn something widely applicable.

The key design element of the ProgramByDesign curriculum is the ''design recipe''.
It has two dimensions: the process dimension and the data dimension.

Along the process dimension students learn that there are six steps to designing a
(simple) program, before they can run it and others can use it: 
# problem analysis with the goal of describing the classes of data that go into the program and come out;
# the reformulation of the problem statement as a concise purpose statement;
# the creation of examples that illustrate the purpose statement and that serve as criteria for success;
# the organization of givens, also called a template or inventory;
# coding;
# and the creation of a test suite from examples to ensure the program works properly on small inputs.
Note that, as in [[test-driven development]], test cases are written ''before'' coding, as part of requirements analysis, rather than afterward as part of testing.

Almost any human endeavour can benefit from clearly understanding the problem, defining criteria for success, analyzing the available resources/givens, developing a proposed solution, and checking it against the criteria, in that order.
A journalist, for example, benefits from
a similar process: figuring out the major concepts in a story; coining a headline;
lining up examples and specific data; organizing the article about the story of
the givens and how the story unfolded; writing; and fact checking.

The data dimension can be summarized by the maxim ''the shape of the data determines the shape of the code and tests.''  For example, if the input or output data type has three variants, a test suite should have at least one test case from each variant, and program code will probably contain a three-way conditional (whether explicit or hidden in a polymorphic dispatch).  If the input or output data type has three fields, a test suite will have to specify values for those three fields, and program code will have to refer to those three fields.  If the input or output data type has a simple ''base case'' and one or more self-referential variants, the test suite should include a base case and one or more non-base cases, and the program code will probably have a base case and one or more self-referential cases, isomorphic to the data type.  The technique of [[recursion]], rather than being scary and mysterious, is simply the application of already-learned techniques to a self-referential data type.

Organizing the givens is the task of translating the descriptions of data into a
program skeleton. Each form of description determines a specific form of program
organization. The transformation is nearly mechanical and helps the students focus
on the creative part of the task.

[[How to Design Programs]] is the text book authored by the core of the ProgramByDesign
group.

==ProgramByDesign and choice of programming language==

The name TeachScheme! appears to imply that this design recipe requires Scheme (now [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]])
and is only teachable with Scheme. Neither conclusion is true, however.  Members of PLT and their trainees have successfully applied the design recipe
in Assembly, C, Java, ML, Python, and other programming languages, not to speak of
poetry, geometry, and biology courses. The fundamental idea of ProgramByDesign is to stress programming as a design activity. 
This misconception is one of the reasons for the renaming actions taken in 2010.

To get started the ProgramByDesign project has produced three essential elements:
* a series of successively more powerful and permissive teaching languages, which are dialects of Racket, matched to the design recipe but with error reporting matched to the student's level (for example, many things that are legal in standard Racket, but which a beginning student doesn't need, are flagged as errors in the Beginning Student level);
* a beginner-friendly, freely-downloadable, pedagogic programming environment, [[DrRacket]], that enforces these language levels;
* a curriculum, encoded mostly in the book [[HTDP]] and its (draft) successor [http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/ HtDP 2nd Edition]
Their choice of Racket reflects their belief that Racket is a good language for a
small team with little funding (in comparison to Java) to validate their
conjectures. The PLT group has always tried to ensure, however, that the ideas remain
portable to other contexts.

==ProgramByDesign for Java==

Over the past few years, the team has also created a second part of the
curriculum. It demonstrates how the same design recipe ideas apply to a complex
[[object-oriented programming]] language, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
This phase of the curriculum applies the same design recipe to Java, initially in a functional paradigm, then introducing object-oriented concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance, and then introducing the imperative techniques that are idiomatic in mainstream Java.

A part of the team has a grant from the National Science Foundation for conducting field tests in colleges 
and high schools. Professional-development workshops took place in the summer of 2007, 2008, 2009, and  2010. This part of the project is dubbed ReachJava; the accompanying book is
tentatively titled "How to Design Classes."

==ProgramByDesign and Bootstrap==

In 2006 PLT at Northeastern University and [[Citizen Schools]] from Boston made joint efforts to reach out to inner city students with after-school programs. Citizen Schools is a nationwide organization that matches volunteers with after-school program sites and gets them started with scripted curricula. The goal of the effort is to translate the material into a sixth-grade curriculum. The first few tests were a great success in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/Moby-Bootstrap/&lt;/ref&gt; The effect on the mathematics courses of this program has encouraged Microsoft
and Google to fund a national scale-up effort, developing materials for training teachers and creating sites in Texas, California, and other volunteer cities.

In the field of [[Big Bang]] theory, and [[physical cosmology|cosmology]], '''reionization''' is the process that caused the matter in the [[universe]] to reionize after the lapse of the "[[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|dark ages]]".

Reionization is the second of two major [[phase transition]]s of [[gas]] in the [[universe]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} While the majority of [[baryon#Baryonic matter|baryonic matter]] in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, reionization usually refers strictly to the reionization of [[hydrogen]], the element.

It's believed that the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|primordial]] [[helium]] also experienced the same phase of reionization changes, but at different points in the history of the universe. This is usually referred to as '''helium reionization'''.

== Background ==
[[Image:reion diagram.jpg|thumb|275px|Schematic timeline of the universe, depicting reionization's place in cosmic history.]]
{{Nature timeline}}
The first phase change of hydrogen in the universe was [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]], which occurred at a [[redshift]] ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1089 (379,000 years after the Big Bang), due to the cooling of the universe to the point where the rate of recombination of [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s to form neutral hydrogen was higher than the re[[ionize|ionization]] rate.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} The universe was opaque before the recombination, due to the [[Thomson scattering|scatter]]ing of photons (of all wavelengths) off free electrons (and, to a significantly lesser extent, free protons), but it became increasingly transparent as more electrons and protons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. While the electrons of neutral hydrogen can absorb photons of some wavelengths by rising to an [[Lyman series|excited state]], a universe full of neutral hydrogen will be relatively opaque only at those absorbed wavelengths, but transparent throughout most of the spectrum. The Dark Ages of the universe start at that point, because there were no light sources other than the gradually redshifting cosmic background radiation.

The second phase change occurred once objects started to condense in the early [[universe]] that were energetic enough to re-ionize neutral hydrogen. As these objects formed and [[Electromagnetic radiation|radiated]] energy, the universe reverted from being neutral,  to once again being an ionized [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This occurred between 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (at a redshift 6&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;20).{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} At that time, however, matter had been diffused by the expansion of the universe, and the scattering interactions of photons and electrons were much less frequent than before electron-proton recombination. Thus, the universe was full of low density ionized hydrogen and remained transparent, as is the case today.

== Detection methods ==
Looking back so far in the history of the universe presents some observational challenges. There are, however, a few observational methods for studying reionization.

===Quasars and the Gunn-Peterson trough===
One means of studying reionization uses the [[spectrum|spectra]] of distant [[quasar]]s. Quasars release an extraordinary amount of energy, meaning they are among the brightest objects in the universe. As a result, some quasars are detectable from as far back as the epoch of reionization. Quasars also happen to have relatively uniform spectral features, regardless of their position in the sky or distance from the [[Earth]]. Thus it can be inferred that any major differences between quasar spectra will be caused by the interaction of their emission with [[atom]]s along the line of sight. For [[wavelength]]s of light at the energies of one of the [[Lyman series|Lyman transitions]] of hydrogen, the [[scattering cross-section]] is large, meaning that even for low levels of neutral hydrogen in the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM), [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] at those wavelengths is highly likely.

For nearby objects in the universe, spectral absorption lines are very sharp, as only photons with energies just sufficient to cause an atomic transition can cause that transition. However, the distances between quasars and the telescopes which detect them are large, which means that the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]] causes light to undergo noticeable redshifting. This means that as light from the quasar travels through the IGM and is redshifted, wavelengths which had been below the Lyman Alpha limit are stretched, and will in effect begin to fill in the Lyman absorption band. This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar's light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a [[Gunn-Peterson trough]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=J.E. Gunn | author2=B.A. Peterson | last-author-amp=yes | date=1965 | title=On the Density of Neutral Hydrogen in Intergalactic Space | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=142 | pages=1633–1641 | bibcode=1965ApJ...142.1633G | doi=10.1086/148444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The redshifting for a particular quasar provides temporal (time) information about reionization. Since an object's redshift corresponds to the time at which it emitted the light, it is possible to determine when reionization ended. Quasars below a certain redshift (closer in space and time) do not show the Gunn-Peterson trough (though they may show the [[Lyman-alpha forest]]), while quasars emitting light prior to reionization will feature a Gunn-Peterson trough. In 2001, four quasars were detected (by the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]]) with redshifts ranging from ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.82 to ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.28. While the quasars above ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6 showed a Gunn-Peterson trough, indicating that the IGM was still at least partly neutral, the ones below did not, meaning the hydrogen was ionized. As reionization is expected to occur over relatively short timescales, the results suggest that the universe was approaching the end of reionization at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=R.H. Becker | display-authors=etal | date=2001 | title=Evidence For Reionization at z ~ 6: Detection of a Gunn-Peterson Trough In A z=6.28 Quasar | journal=Astronomical Journal | volume=122 | issue=6 | pages=2850–2857 | arxiv=astro-ph/0108097 | doi=10.1086/324231 | bibcode=2001AJ....122.2850B}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, suggests that the universe must still have been almost entirely neutral at ''z''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;10.

===CMB anisotropy and polarization===

The anisotropy of the [[cosmic microwave background]] on different angular scales can also be used to study reionization. Photons undergo scattering when there are free electrons present, in a process known as [[Thomson scattering]]. However, as the universe expands, the density of free electrons will decrease, and scattering will occur less frequently. In the period during and after reionization, but before significant expansion had occurred to sufficiently lower the electron density, the light that composes the CMB will experience observable Thomson scattering. This scattering will leave its mark on the CMB [[anisotropy]] map, introducing secondary anisotropies (anisotropies introduced after recombination).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Manoj Kaplinghat | display-authors=etal | date=2003 | title=Probing the Reionization History of the universe using the Cosmic Microwave Background Polarization | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=583 | issue=1 | pages=24–32 | bibcode=2003ApJ...583...24K | doi=10.1086/344927|arxiv = astro-ph/0207591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall effect is to erase anisotropies that occur on smaller scales. While anisotropies on small scales are erased, [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] anisotropies are actually introduced because of reionization.&lt;ref name=Dore_Patchy&gt;{{cite journal| author=O. Dore| display-authors=etal| title=Signature of patchy reionization in the polarization anisotropy of the CMB| year=2007| journal=Physical Review D| volume=76| issue=4| pages=043002| doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.76.043002| bibcode=2007PhRvD..76d3002D| arxiv=astro-ph/0701784v1}}&lt;/ref&gt; By looking at the CMB anisotropies observed, and comparing with what they would look like had reionization not taken place, the electron column density at the time of reionization can be determined. With this, the age of the universe when reionization occurred can then be calculated.

The [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] allowed that comparison to be made. The initial observations, released in 2003, suggested that reionization took place from 11&amp;nbsp;&lt;''z''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=A. Kogut | display-authors=etal | year=2003 | title=First Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Temperature-Polarization Correlation | journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=148 | issue=1 | pages=161–173 | bibcode=2003ApJS..148..161K | doi=10.1086/377219|arxiv = astro-ph/0302213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This redshift range was in clear disagreement with the results from studying quasar spectra. However, the three year WMAP data returned a different result, with reionization beginning at ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;11 and the universe ionized by ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=D.N. Spergel | display-authors=etal | year=2007 | title=Three-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Implications for Cosmology | journal=The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series | volume=170 | issue=2 | pages=377–408 | bibcode=2007ApJS..170..377S | doi=10.1086/513700|arxiv = astro-ph/0603449 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in much better agreement with the quasar data.

Results in 2018 from [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] mission, yield an instantaneous reionization redshift of z = 7.68 ± 0.79.&lt;ref name=Planck_Results_2018&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Planck Collaboration| title=Planck 2018 results. VI. Cosmological parameters| date=2018|eprint=1807.06209| class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parameter usually quoted here is τ, the "optical depth to recombination," or alternatively, z&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt;, the redshift of reionization, assuming it was an instantaneous event.  While this is unlikely to be physical, since reionization was very likely not instantaneous, z&lt;sub&gt;re&lt;/sub&gt; provides an estimate of the mean redshift of reionization.

===21-cm line===
Even with the quasar data roughly in agreement with the CMB anisotropy data, there are still a number of questions, especially concerning the energy sources of reionization and the effects on, and role of, [[structure formation]] during reionization. The [[hydrogen line|21-cm line]] in hydrogen is potentially a means of studying this period, as well as the "dark ages" that preceded reionization. The 21-cm line occurs in neutral hydrogen, due to differences in energy between the spin triplet and spin singlet states of the electron and proton. This transition is [[forbidden line|forbidden]], meaning it occurs extremely rarely. The transition is also highly [[temperature]] dependent, meaning that as objects form in the "dark ages" and emit Lyman-alpha [[photon]]s that are absorbed and re-emitted by surrounding neutral hydrogen, it will produce a 21-cm line signal in that hydrogen through [[Wouthuysen-Field coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rennan Barkana | author2=Abraham Loeb | last-author-amp=yes | year=2005 | title=Detecting the Earliest Galaxies through Two New Sources of 21 Centimeter Fluctuations | journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=626 | issue=1 | pages=1–11 | bibcode=2005ApJ...626....1B | doi=10.1086/429954|arxiv = astro-ph/0410129 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Alvarez_enhanced&gt;{{cite journal| author=M.A. Alvarez| author2=Ue-Li Pen| author3=Tzu-Ching Chang| title=Enhanced Detectability of Pre-reionization 21 cm Structure| date=2010| journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters| volume=723| issue=1| doi=10.1088/2041-8205/723/1/L17| bibcode=2010ApJ...723L..17A| arxiv=1007.0001v1| pages=L17–L21}}&lt;/ref&gt; By studying 21-cm line emission, it will be possible to learn more about the early structures that formed. Observations from the [[Experiment to Detect the Global Epoch of Reionization Signature]] (EDGES) points to a signal from this era, follow-up observations will be needed to confirm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02616-8|title=Astronomers detect light from the Universe’s first stars|date= 28 February 2018|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other projects hope to make headway in this area in the near future, such as the [[Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization]] (PAPER), [[LOFAR|Low Frequency Array]] (LOFAR), [[Murchison Widefield Array]] (MWA), [[Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope]] (GMRT), the [[Dark Ages Radio Explorer]] (DARE) mission, and the [[Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages|Large-Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Ages]] (LEDA).

==Energy sources==
While observations have come in which narrow the window during which the epoch of reionization could have taken place, it is still uncertain which objects provided the photons that reionized the IGM. To ionize neutral hydrogen, an energy larger than 13.6 [[electronvolt|eV]] is required, which corresponds to photons with a wavelength of 91.2 [[nanometre|nm]] or shorter. This is in the [[ultraviolet]] part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which means that the primary candidates are all sources which produce a significant amount of energy in the ultraviolet and above. How numerous the source is must also be considered, as well as the longevity, as protons and electrons will recombine if energy is not continuously provided to keep them apart. Altogether, the critical parameter for any source considered can be summarized as its "emission rate of hydrogen-ionizing photons per unit cosmological volume."&lt;ref name="qso_source1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Piero Madau | display-authors=etal | date=1999 | title=Radiative Transfer in a Clumpy Universe.

=== Dwarf galaxies ===
[[Dwarf galaxies]] are currently the primary source of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization.&lt;ref name=Bouwens_LLG&gt;{{cite journal| author=R.J.Bouwens| display-authors=etal| title=Lower-luminosity Galaxies Could Reionize the Universe: Very Steep Faint-end Slopes to the UV Luminosity Functions at z &gt;= 5-8 from the HUDF09 WFC3/IR Observations| date=2012| journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|  volume=752| issue=1| doi=10.1088/2041-8205/752/1/L5| bibcode=2012ApJ...752L...5B| arxiv=1105.2038v4| pages=L5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most scenarios, this would require the log-slope of the UV galaxy [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]], often denoted α, to be steeper than it is today, approaching α = -2.&lt;ref name=Bouwens_LLG/&gt;

A new study shows that dwarf galaxies contributed nearly 30% of the ultraviolet light during the process of reionization. The dwarfs had such a big impact because a larger fraction of ionizing photons are able to escape dwarf galaxies (clocking in at 50%) as opposed to larger galaxies (clocking in at a mere 5%).&lt;ref name=Sky&amp;Tel&gt;{{cite web| author=Shannon Hall| title=Dwarf Galaxies Packed a Mighty Punch| url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/dwarf-galaxies-packed-mighty-punch-072320142|

Afterwards, larger galaxies (but still much smaller than the Milky Way by about 100 times in mass) take over the job of reionizing the universe."&lt;ref name=Sky&amp;Tel/&gt;

===Quasars===
[[Quasars]], a class of [[active galactic nuclei]] (AGN), were considered a good candidate source because they are highly efficient at converting [[mass]] to [[energy]], and emit a great deal of light above the threshold for ionizing hydrogen. It is unknown, however, how many quasars existed prior to reionization. Only the brightest of quasars present during reionization can be detected, which means there is no direct information about dimmer quasars that existed. However, by looking at the more easily observed quasars in the nearby universe, and assuming that the [[Luminosity function (astronomy)|luminosity function]] (number of quasars as a function of [[luminosity]]) during reionization will be approximately the same as it is today, it is possible to make estimates of the quasar populations at earlier times. Such studies have found that quasars do not exist in high enough numbers to reionize the IGM alone,&lt;ref name="qso_source1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="qso_source0"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Paul Shapiro | author2=Mark Giroux | last-author-amp=yes | date=1987 | title=Cosmological H II regions and the photoionization of the intergalactic medium| journal=The Astrophysical Journal | volume=321 | pages=107–112 | bibcode=1987ApJ...321L.107S | doi=10.1086/185015}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "only if the ionizing background is dominated by low-luminosity AGNs can the quasar luminosity function provide enough ionizing photons."&lt;ref name="qso_source2"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Xiaohu Fan | display-authors=etal | date=2001 | title=A Survey of z&gt;5.8 Quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

===Population III stars===
[[Image:NASA-WMAP-first-stars.jpg|thumb|300px|Simulated image of the first stars, 400 Myr after the [[Big Bang]].]] [[Stellar population#Population III stars|Population III stars]] were the earliest stars, which had no elements more massive than hydrogen or [[helium]]. During [[Nucleosynthesis#Big Bang nucleosynthesis|Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], the only elements that formed aside from hydrogen and helium were trace amounts of [[lithium]]. Yet quasar spectra have revealed the presence of heavy elements in the [[intergalactic medium]] at an early era. [[Supernova]] explosions produce such heavy elements, so hot, large, Population III stars which will form supernovae are a possible mechanism for reionization.

The term '''somatic''' is often used in biology to refer to the cells of the body in contrast to the germ line cells which usually give rise to the [[gamete]]s ([[ovum]] or [[sperm]]). These [[somatic cell]]s are [[diploid]] containing two copies of each [[chromosome]], whereas the germ cells are [[haploid]] as they only contain one copy of each chromosome. Although under normal circumstances all somatic cells in an organism contain identical [[DNA]], they develop a variety of tissue-specific characteristics. This process is called [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], through [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] and regulatory alterations. The grouping of like cells and tissues creates the foundation for organs.

[[Somatic mutation]]s are changes to the genetics of a multi-cellular organism which are not passed on to its offspring through the germ-line. Many [[cancer]]s are somatic mutations.

Somatic is also defined as relating to the wall of the body cavity, particularly as distinguished from the head, limbs or [[Viscus|viscera]].

It is also used in the term [[somatic nervous system]] which is the portion of the [[vertebrate]] [[nervous system]] which regulates voluntary movements of the body.
==Mutation frequency==

The frequency of [[mutation]]s in mouse somatic tissue ([[brain]], [[liver]], [[Sertoli cell]]s) was compared to the mutation frequency in male [[germline]] cells at sequential stages of [[spermatogenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

Barthelemy, "Morphogenesis of Spatial Networks", Springer (2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest mathematical realization is a [[Lattice graph|lattice]] or a [[random geometric graph]], where nodes are distributed uniformly at random over a two-dimensional plane; a pair of nodes are connected if the [[Euclidean distance]] is smaller than a given neighborhood radius. [[Transport network|Transportation and mobility networks]], [[Internet]], [[cellular network|mobile phone networks]], [[electrical grid|power grids]], [[social network|social and contact networks]] and [[neural network]]s are all examples where the underlying space is relevant and where the graph's [[topology]] alone does not contain all the information. Characterizing and understanding the structure, resilience and the evolution of spatial networks is crucial for many different fields ranging from urbanism to epidemiology.

== Examples ==
An urban spatial network can be constructed by abstracting intersections as nodes and streets as links, which is referred to as, [[Transportation network (graph theory)|transportation network]]. Beijing traffic was studied as a dynamic network and its percolation properties have been found useful to identify systematic bottlenecks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=D.|last2=Fu|first2=B.|last3=Wang|first3=Y.|last4=Lu|first4=G.|last5=Berezin|first5=Y.|last6=Stanley|first6=H.E.|last7=Havlin|first7=S.|date=2015|title=Percolation transition in dynamical traffic network with evolving critical bottlenecks|url=|journal=PNAS|volume=112|pages=669|via=|bibcode=2015PNAS..112..669L|doi=10.1073/pnas.1419185112|pmc=4311803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might think of the 'space map' as being the negative image of the standard map, with the open space cut out of the background buildings or walls.&lt;ref name="SocLo"&gt;Hillier B, Hanson J, 1984, The social logic of space (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizing spatial networks==
The following aspects are some of the characteristics to examine a spatial network:&lt;ref name="Bart" /&gt;
* Planar networks
In many applications, such as rail, roads, and other transportation networks the network is assumed to be [[planar graph|planar]]. Planar networks build up an important group out of the spatial networks, but not all spatial networks are planar. Indeed, the airline passenger
networks is a non-planar example: All airports in the world are connected through direct flights. 
* The way it is embedded in space
There are examples of networks, which seem to be not "directly" embedded in space. Social networks for instance
connect individuals through friendship relations. But in this case, space intervenes in the fact that the connection
probability between two individuals usually decreases with the distance between them.
* Voronoi tessellation
A spatial network can be represented by a [[Voronoi diagram]], which is a way of dividing space into a number of regions.  The dual graph for a Voronoi diagram corresponds to the [[Delaunay triangulation]] for the same set of points.
Voronoi tessellations are interesting for spatial networks in the sense that they provide a natural representation model
to which one can compare a real world network.
* Mixing space and topology

[[File:Lattice network 2d.png|alt=Lattice network in two dimensions|thumb|Fig. 1. Lattice network in two dimensions. The balls are the nodes the edges connecting neighboring nodes are the links.]]
[[File:Spatially interdependent networks.png|alt=Spatially interdependent networks|thumb|Fig. 2. Spatially interdependent networks. Two square lattices A and B, where in each lattice a node has two types of links: connectivity links and dependency links. Every node is connected (with connectivity links) to its four nearest neighbors within the same lattice via connectivity links and a fraction of nodes in each network have dependency links to the other network. If a node fail in one network its dependent node in the other network will also fail, even if it is still connected to its network via connectivity links.]]
Examining the topology of the nodes and edges itself is another way to characterize networks.  The distribution of [[Degree (graph theory)|degree]] of the nodes is often considered, regarding the structure of edges it is useful to find the [[Minimum spanning tree]], or the generalization, the [[Steiner tree]] and the [[relative neighborhood graph]].
[[File:Lattice-layout-z15.png|thumb|Fig. 3:  Spatially embedded multiplex networks. The nodes occupy regular locations in two-dimensional lattice  while the links in each layer (blue and green) have lengths
that are exponentially distributed with characteristic length
ζ = 3 and are connected at random with degree k=4.]]

==Lattice networks==
 
Lattice networks (see Fig. 1) are useful models  for spatial embedded networks. Many physical phenomenas have been studied on these structures. Examples include Ising model for spontaneous magnetization,&lt;ref name="McCoyWu1968"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Barry M.|last2=Wu|first2=Tai Tsun|title=Theory of a Two-Dimensional Ising Model with Random Impurities.

==Probability and spatial networks ==
In the "real" world many aspects of networks are not deterministic - randomness plays an important role. For example, new links, representing friendships, in social networks are in a certain manner random. Modelling spatial networks in respect of stochastic operations is consequent. In many cases the [[spatial Poisson process]] is used to approximate data sets of processes on spatial networks. Other stochastic aspects of interest are: 
* The [[Poisson line process]]
* Stochastic geometry: the [[Erdős–Rényi model|Erdős–Rényi graph]]
* [[Percolation theory]]

==Approach from the theory of space syntax==
Another definition of spatial network derives from the theory of [[space syntax]]. It can be notoriously difficult to decide what a spatial element should be in complex spaces involving large open areas or many interconnected paths. The originators of space syntax, Bill Hillier and Julienne Hanson use [[axial line]]s and [[convex space]]s as the spatial elements. Loosely, an axial line is the 'longest line of sight and access' through open space, and a convex space the 'maximal convex polygon' that can be drawn in open space. Each of these elements is defined by the geometry of the local boundary in different regions of the space map. Decomposition of a space map into a complete set of intersecting axial lines or overlapping convex spaces produces the axial map or overlapping convex map respectively. Algorithmic definitions of these maps exist, and this allows the mapping from an arbitrary shaped space map to a network amenable to graph mathematics to be carried out in a relatively well defined manner. Axial maps are used to analyse [[urban network]]s, where the system generally comprises linear segments, whereas convex maps are more often used to analyse [[building|building plans]] where space patterns are often more convexly articulated, however both convex and axial maps may be used in either situation.

Currently, there is a move within the space syntax community to integrate better with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS), and much of the [[Spatial network analysis software|software]] they produce interlinks with commercially available GIS systems.

==History==
While networks and graphs were already for a long time the subject
of many studies in [[mathematics]], physics, mathematical sociology,
[[computer science]], spatial networks have been studied intensively during the 1970s in quantitative geography. Objects of studies in geography are inter alia locations, activities and flows of individuals, but also networks evolving in time and space.&lt;ref name="NetAnal"&gt;P. Haggett and R.J. Chorley. ''Network analysis in geog-
raphy''. Edward Arnold, London, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the important problems such
as the location of nodes of a network, the evolution of
transportation networks and their interaction with population
and activity density are addressed in these earlier
studies. On the other side, many important points still remain unclear, partly because at that time datasets of large networks and larger computer capabilities were lacking.  
Recently, spatial networks have been the subject of studies in [[Statistics]], to connect probabilities and stochastic processes with networks in the real world.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/206-SNET/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ergonomics ===
{{Main|Ergonomics}}
Ergonomics, also called &lt;!-- "[[Engineering psychology]]" or --&gt; "[[human factors]]", is the application of scientific information concerning objects, systems and environment for human use (definition adopted by the [[International Ergonomics Association]] in 2007). Ergonomics is commonly described as the way companies design tasks and work areas to maximize the efficiency and quality of their employees’ work. However, ergonomics comes into everything which involves people. Work systems, sports and leisure, health and safety should all embody ergonomics principles if well designed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Equipment design is intended to maximize productivity by reducing operator fatigue and discomfort. The field is also called human engineering and [[human factors engineering]]. Ergonomic research is primarily performed by ergonomists who study human capabilities in relationship to their work demands. Information derived from ergonomists contributes to the design and evaluation of tasks, jobs, products, environments and systems in order to make them compatible with the needs, abilities and limitations of people.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Family system therapy===
{{Main|Family therapy}}
Family system therapy, also referred to as "family  therapy" and "couple and family therapy", is a branch of [[psychotherapy]] related to [[relationship counseling]] that works with [[family|families]] and couples in [[intimate relationship]]s to nurture change and development. It tends to view the family as a system, family relationships as an important factor in psychological health. As such, family problems have been seen to arise as an [[emergence|emergent]] property of systemic interactions, rather than to be blamed on individual members. Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) are the most specifically trained in this type of psychotherapy.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

=== Organizational psychology ===
{{Main|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
Industrial and organizational psychology also known as "work psychology", "occupational psychology" or "personnel psychology" concerns the application of [[psychology|psychological]] theories, research methods, and intervention strategies to workplace issues. Industrial and organizational psychologists are interested in making organizations more productive while ensuring workers are able to lead physically and psychologically healthy lives. Relevant topics include personnel psychology, [[motivation]] and [[leadership]], employee selection, training and development, organization development and guided change, [[organizational behavior]], and job and family issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Perceptual control theory ===
{{Main|Perceptual control theory}}
Perceptual control theory (PCT) is a psychological theory of animal and [[human behavior]] originated by [[William T. Powers]]. In contrast with other theories of psychology and behavior, which assume that behavior is a function of perception — that perceptual inputs determine or cause behavior — PCT postulates that an organism's behavior is a means of controlling its perceptions. In contrast with [[control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference variable for each [[negative feedback]] control loop in a control hierarchy is set from within the system (the organism), rather than by an external agent changing the [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] of the [[Controller (control theory)|controller]].&lt;ref name="CT_disfunctions"&gt;[[control theory|Engineering control theory]] also makes use of [[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]], [[Model predictive control|predictive control]], and other functions that are not required to model the behavior of living organisms.&lt;/ref&gt; PCT also applies to nonliving [[Autonomic Systems|autonomic systems]].&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604100935/http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html |date=4 June 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthomyiidae sp. 1 (aka).jpg|thumb|Arthropods (such as flies) are the most abundant terrestrial animals by species count.]]
''' Terrestrial animals''' are [[animal]]s that live predominantly or entirely on land (e.g., [[cat]]s, [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s), as compared with [[aquatic animal]]s, which live predominantly or entirely in the water (e.g., [[fish]], [[lobster]]s, [[octopus]]es), or [[amphibian]]s, which rely on a combination of aquatic and terrestrial [[habitat]]s (e.g., [[frog]]s, or  [[newt]]s). Terrestrial invertebrates include [[ants]], [[Fly|flies]], crickets, grasshoppers and spiders.

==Terrestrial Classes==

The term terrestrial is typically applied for species that live primarily on the ground, in contrast to [[arboreal]] species, which live primarily in trees.

There are other less common terms that apply to specific groups of terrestrial animals:
*'''[[wiktionary:saxicolous|Saxicolous]]''' creatures are rock dwelling. Saxicolous is derived from the Latin word "saxum," meaning a rock. 
*'''[[wiktionary:arenicolous|Arenicolous]]''' creatures live in the sand.
*'''[[Troglofauna]]''' predominantly live in caves.

==Taxonomy==
Terrestrial invasion is one of the most important events in the [[history of life]].&lt;ref&gt;Shear WA: The early development of terrestrial ecosystems. Nature 1991, 351:283-289.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermeij GJ, Dudley R, ''Why are there so few evolutionary transitions between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems?'' Biol J Linn Soc, 2000, 70:541-554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Garwood"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garwood |first1=Russell J. |last2=Edgecombe |first2=Gregory D. |date=September 2011 |title=Early Terrestrial Animals, Evolution, and Uncertainty |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |location=New York |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]] |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=489–501 |doi=10.1007/s12052-011-0357-y |url=https://www.academia.edu/891357/ |issn=1936-6426 |accessdate=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial lineages evolved in several&lt;!--refers to "seven" phyla, but see below--&gt; animal phyla, among which vertebrates, arthropods, and mollusks are representatives of more successful groups of terrestrial animals.

Terrestrial animals do not form a unified [[clade]]; rather, they share only the fact that they live on land. The transition from an aquatic to terrestrial life has evolved independently and successfully many times by various groups of animals.&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; Most terrestrial lineages originated under a mild or [[tropical climate]] during the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]], whereas few animals became fully terrestrial during the [[Cenozoic]].

When excluding internal [[parasite]]s, free living species in terrestrial environments are represented by the following ten phyla:  [[flatworm]]s ([[planarian]]s), [[Nemertea|nemerteans]] (ribbon worms), [[Nematoda|nematodes]] (roundworms), [[rotifer]]s, [[tardigrade]]s (water bears), [[Onychophora]] (velvet worms), [[arthropod]]s, [[mollusks]] ([[gastropods]]: [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s), [[annelid]]s and [[chordate]]s ([[tetrapods]]). Roundworms, tardigrades, and rotifers are microscopic animals that require a film of water to live in, and are not considered truly terrestrial. Flatworms, ribbon worms, velvet worms and annelids all depend on more or less moist habitats, as do the arthropods [[centipede]]s and [[millipede]]s. The three remaining phyla, arthropods, mollusks, and chordates, all contain species that have adapted totally to dry terrestrial environments, and contain species that have no aquatic phase in their life cycles.

===Difficulties===
[[File:Pygoscelis papua -Nagasaki Penguin Aquarium -swimming underwater-8a.jpg|thumb| Animals do not fall neatly into terrestrial or aquatic classification but lie along a continuum: e.g., penguins spend much of their time under water.]]
Labeling an animal species "terrestrial" or "aquatic" is often obscure and becomes a matter of judgment. Many animals considered terrestrial have a life-cycle that is partly dependent on being in water. [[Penguins]], [[Pinniped|seals]], and [[walruses]] sleep on land and feed in the ocean, yet they are all considered terrestrial. Many insects, e.g. [[mosquito]]s, and all [[terrestrial crab]]s, as well as other clades, have an aquatic life cycle stage: their eggs need to be laid in and to hatch in water; after hatching, there is an early aquatic form, either a [[nymph]] or [[larva]].

There are crab species that are completely aquatic, crab species that are amphibious, and crab species that are terrestrial. [[Fiddler crabs]] are called "semi-terrestrial" since they make burrows in the muddy substrate, to which they retreat during high tides. When the tide is out, fiddler crabs search the beach for food. The same is true in the [[mollusca]]. Many hundreds of [[gastropod]] genera and species live in intermediate situations, such as for example, [[Truncatella (gastropod)|''Truncatella'']]. Some gastropods with gills live on land, and others with a lung live in the water.

As well as the purely terrestrial and the purely aquatic animals, there are many borderline species. There are no universally accepted criteria for deciding how to label these species, thus some assignments are disputed.

==Terrestrialization==
{{main|Vertebrate land invasion}}
Fossil evidence has shown that sea creatures, likely related to arthropods, first began to make forays on to land around 530 million years ago. There is little reason to believe, however, that animals first began living reliably on land around this same time period. A more likely hypothesis is that these early arthropods' motivation for venturing on to dry land was to mate (as modern horseshoe crabs do) or lay eggs out of the reach of predators.&lt;ref&gt;MacNaughton, R. B et al. First steps on land: Arthropod trackways in Cambrian-Ordovician eolian sandstone, southeastern Ontario, Canada. Geology, 30, 391 - 394, (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; As time went on, evidence suggests that by approximately 375 million years ago&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; the bony fish best adapted to life in shallow coastal/swampy waters (such as ''Tiktaalik roseae''), were much more viable as amphibians than were their arthropod predecessors. Thanks to relatively strong, muscular limbs (which were likely weight-bearing, thus making them a preferable alternative to traditional fins in extremely shallow water),&lt;ref&gt;Hohn-Schulte, Bianca, Holger Preuschoft, Ulrich Witzel, and Claudia Distler-Hoffman. "Biomechanics and Functional Preconditions for Terrestrial Lifestyle in Basal Tetrapods, with Special Consideration of ''Tiktaalik Roseae''." Historical Biology 25.2 (2013): 167-81. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; and lungs which existed in conjunction with gills, ''Tiktaalik'' and animals like it were able to establish a strong foothold on land by the end of the Devonian period. As such, they are likely the most recent common ancestor of all modern tetrapods.

== Terrestrial gastropods ==
{{main|land snail|semi-slug|slug}}
[[Gastropod]] mollusks are one of the most successful animals that have diversified in the fully terrestrial habitat.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; They have evolved terrestrial taxa in more than nine lineages.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; They are commonly referred to as [[land snail]]s and [[slug]]s.

Terrestrial invasion of gastropod mollusks has occurred in [[Neritopsina]], [[Cyclophoroidea]], [[Littorinoidea]], [[Rissooidea]], [[Ellobioidea]], [[Onchidioidea]], [[Veronicelloidea]]&lt;!--listed as Rathouisioidea that consist of the same two families--&gt;, [[Succineoidea]], and [[Stylommatophora]], and in particular, each of Neritopsina, Rissooidea and Ellobioidea has likely achieved land invasion more than once.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

Most terrestrialization events have occurred during the [[Paleozoic]] or [[Mesozoic]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Gastropods are especially unique due to several fully terrestrial and epifaunal lineages that evolved during the [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Some members of rissooidean families [[Truncatellidae]], [[Assimineidae]], and [[Pomatiopsidae]] are considered to have colonized to land during the Cenozoic.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Most truncatellid and assimineid snails amphibiously live in [[intertidal]] and [[supratidal]] zones from [[brackish water]] to pelagic areas.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Terrestrial lineages likely evolved from such ancestors.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; The [[rissooidea]]n gastropod family [[Pomatiopsidae]] is one of the few groups that have evolved fully terrestrial taxa during the late Cenozoic in the [[Japanese Archipelago]] only.&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt; Shifts from aquatic to terrestrial life occurred at least twice within two Japanese endemic lineages in Japanese Pomatiopsidae and it started in the [[Late Miocene]].&lt;ref name="Kameda 2011"/&gt;

About one-third of gastropod species is terrestrial.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; In terrestrial habitats they are subjected to daily and seasonal variation in temperature and water availability.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Their success in colonizing different habitats is due to physiological, behavioral, and morphological adaptations to water availability, as well as ionic and thermal balance.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; They are adapted to most of the habitats on Earth.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; The shell of a snail is constructed of [[calcium carbonate]], but even in acidic soils one can find various species of shell-less slugs.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Land-snails also live in deserts, where they must contend with heat and aridity.&lt;ref name="Raz 2012"/&gt; Terrestrial gastropods are primarily herbivores and only a few groups are carnivorous.&lt;ref name="Siriboon 2013"/&gt; Carnivorous gastropods usually feed on other gastropod species or on weak individuals of the same species; some feed on insect larvae or earthworms.&lt;ref name="Siriboon 2013"/&gt;

==Understanding the Book==
Scholars{{who|date=September 2015}} have generally found this book difficult to understand. It has also been suggested{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} that it is better to begin by understanding some of the following articles written by [[S.N.

==Review==

In this “ground-breaking work … SN Balagangadhara … wrote a devastating critique of the very language we use today to describe religious phenomena in India. In his book … Balagangadhara questioned whether it is appropriate to use terms like "religion", "orthodoxy" and "Hinduism" at all. He asked whether what are essentially Christian categories may be imputed to non-Western systems of belief and practice without utterly misunderstanding their content and misrepresenting their function."&lt;ref&gt;"The Hindus: a celebration of religious variety", The National staff, 31 Jul 2009 [http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/the-hindus-a-celebration-of-religious-variety#page2]&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic thesis that this book presents, "that Hinduism does not exist", it has been pointed out, "will alter our notion of Indian culture and social structure fundamentally. This seemingly pulls the carpet out from under the feet of the caste studies. ... [But] it does not leave the caste studies reeling helplessly.Rather,it provides a strong conceptual foundation and shows new directions to caste studies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jalki|first1=Dunkin|title=New Directions to the Caste Studies: Contributions of S.N.

A review of the Kannada translation of the work claims that Balagangadhara's book has "prompted an intellectual revolution of sorts and those who have engaged with the questions he raises in the book cannot escape engaging with the answers he provides as well. To put it strongly — any scholar in the field of cultural studies and its related disciplines, will have to respond to his work. ...

In [[biophysics]], '''transduction''' is the [[wiktionary:conveyance|conveyance]] of energy from one [[electron]] (a donor) to another (a receptor), at the same time that the class of energy changes.

Photonic energy, the [[kinetic energy]] of a [[photon]], may follow the following paths:
* be released again as a photon of less energy;
* be transferred to a recipient with no change in class;
* be dissipated as heat; or
* be transduced

In [[photosynthesis]], when the electrons of the "[[chlorophyll]] pair" receive the photon energy from the "collecting" associated [[pigments]], the photonic energy is "destined" to link one molecule of [[phosphate]] to one of [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NAD]]. The resulting [[NADP]] in turn will use the stored energy in the generation of [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], which is the end point of the light-induced photosynthetic process. [This is quite wrong: NADP is reduced (electrons are added) to NADPH in the light reactions of linear electron transport. No ATP involved directly. Phosphate is "linked" to ADP, forming ATP, but this does not involve NADP(H), it involves the proton gradient (and ATP synthase) generated by photosynthetic electron transport processes.] This means that the photon's energy ends up its circuit by being ''transduced'' to an electron that takes part in the formation of a molecular link of energy-rich phosphate.

In the pathway of this end-point transduction, the energy is ''transferred'' along a number of molecules ([[cytochrome]]s), in a downward way so that energy is partially ''dissipated'' at each step. The liberated heat energy serves the [[homeostasis]] of the plant, and at the end of the chain the remaining energy is perhaps exactly the one that is needed to build NADP.

This process is committed; i.e. there is no return path. Homeostasis, theoretically, might save the day only at the beginning: before the luminic energy transferred to the "chlorophyl pair" is conveyed to the first element of the cytochrome chain, there is a gap in the process when the energy is carried as a series of ''excitons''. These are now called ''resonant-energy-transferring'' molecules of the chlorophyll class, which transfer what is considered electromagnetic energy, from one to its neighbor with no participation of electrons nor enzymes. At this stage, if the first pigment has received an excess of light, the "exciton" perhaps might ''dissipate'' the energy as heat.

[[File:HWDP Part.jpg|thumb|Heavy-weight drill string part due to stress cracking]]
'''Tripping pipe''' (or "Making a round trip" or simply "Making a trip") is the physical act of pulling the [[drill string]] out of the [[wellbore]] and then running it back in. This is done by physically breaking out or disconnecting (when pulling out of the hole) ''every other 2 or 3 joints of [[drill pipe]]'' at a time (called a [[stand (drill pipe)|stand]]) and racking them vertically in the [[derrick]]. When feasible the [[Driller (oil)|driller]] will start each successive trip on a different "break" so that after several trips fresh [[pipe dope]] will have been applied (when running back in the hole) to every segment of the drill string.
[[File:Pulling Pipe on the Derrick Floor preparing to trip into the hole.JPG|thumb|Pulling Pipe on the Derrick Floor preparing to trip into the hole]]
[[File:Collection of 90 foot stands after tripping out of the hole for a bit trip.JPG|thumb|Collection of 90 foot stands after tripping out of the hole for a bit trip]]

The most typical reason for tripping pipe is to replace a worn-out [[drill bit]]. Though there are many problems that occur to warrant the tripping of pipe. Downhole tools such as [[Measurement while drilling|MWD]] (measurement while drilling), [[Logging while drilling|LWD]] (logging while drilling) or [[mud motor]]s break down quite often. Another common reason for tripping is to replace damaged drill pipe. It is important to get the pipe out of the wellbore quickly and safely before it can snap.

==Bit trip==
[[File:Vertical Drill Bit.JPG|thumb|Vertical Drill Bit]]
Drill bits wear and tear like most any other piece of equipment. Once a bit becomes too worn to drill at an adequate rate or make a full-gauge hole, or if the bearings are thought to be near failure, a trip is undertaken to replace the bit. A trip is not considered a bit trip when the purpose of replacing the bit is to change sizes. This is only done when the crew "sets surface, intermediate or longstring" as appropriate.

==Fishing trip==
A fishing trip is when a crew is forced to trip pipe to retrieve loose items in the [[wellbore]]. This can result from something being dropped in the hole, i.e. a tool, that would cause damage to the bit if the crew attempted to drill with it on bottom. 

===Twisting off===
Another major cause is known as a "twist off". Twisting off is when the drill string parts by failing catastrophically under the torsional stress.  This may happen if the drill string below is pinched in the wellbore, or as the result of a structural weakening of the pipe caused by a washout or a crack in a threaded connection member.

===Broken string or broken bit===
When pipe snaps or a part of the bit breaks off, the crew has to recover all of the separated items from the wellbore. Recovering snapped pipe usually involves placing a specialized tool (an "overshot") with grips set inside of it over the broken pipe in an attempt to capture it. The grip works in a manner similar to [[Chinese fingercuffs]]. Sometimes the jagged top of the fish must be milled back to a round outside shape before the overshot can slip over it.  The overshot contains a packoff device to make a pressure seal so circulation can be reestablished through the bit to facilitate recovery of the fish.  For a broken bit, a magnet is commonly used to remove all of the broken parts.

===Cracked pipe or collar===
A cracked pipe can lead to a broken string. Extra care is taken when tripping for one so that too much pull does not cause the cracked pipe to snap. Cracked pipes (i.e., washouts) are usually noticed by a sudden drop in pressure. The crew will usually pump "fastline" (small lengths of manila rope taken from unraveled catline) down the drill string to make a temporary plug and time the pressure to see when it rises back to normal. This enables the crew to know how far down to expect the cracked pipe to be within a few stands; also strands of these rope segments may be seen at the point of washout. Most trips for a cracked pipe are not complete trips like a fishing trip or a bit trip. These can be as simple as only going a few stands down, to pulling the drill collars.

==Logging==
[[Well logging|Logging]] of the open hole may take place at various depths while drilling, and almost always at the end of the drilling operation. The drill string will be removed from the wellbore to allow a logging crew to conduct a survey of the well. After the logging is completed at total depth, the crew will run the drill string back into the well and then proceed to lay it down when coming out of the hole prior to installing the final set of casing (the "production casing").

==Setting surface, intermediate and longstring==
These trips are routinely expected by the crew. Setting surface occurs after the wellbore is drilled to the predetermined surface depth (e.g., after drilling below fresh water strata). The crew will remove the entire drill string to allow surface casing to be emplaced. The procedure is similar for setting intermediate, only that it typically involves a much longer drill string to be removed. Setting longstring is usually a one time operation combining both surface and intermediate casing. This saves the time of only having to undertake one pipe trip as opposed to two pipe trips.

In 2015, the '''UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries''' (IOF) is a research unit at the [[University of British Columbia]] that was formed by incorporating members from the former [[UBC Fisheries Centre]], as well as a subset of researchers that are conducting marine related research at UBC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oceans @UBC|url=https://ubcoceans.ubc.ca/|website=Marine Research at UBC|publisher=University of British Columbia|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Members of the IOF are drawn primarily from the Departments of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, Zoology and Botany. The UBC Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries brings together a community of Canadian and international experts in ocean and freshwater species, systems, economics, and issues to provide new insights into how global marine systems function, and the impacts of human activity on those systems. It is working towards a world in which the oceans are healthy and their resources are used sustainably and equitably. IOF is located at The University of British Columbia, and promotes multidisciplinary study of aquatic ecosystems and broad-based collaboration with researchers, educators, maritime communities, government, NGOs, and other partners.

==Research units==
The IOF brings together a broad range of scientists to study both the ocean itself and the lives and livelihoods of coastal populations. Its research groups focus on issues of local significance in Western Canada, including the Salish Sea and Strait of Georgia, as well as broader global concerns such as artisanal fisheries in developing countries. It is constantly developing new research groups in response to emerging issues, trends and awareness.

 [[Image:UV-ontsmetting laminaire-vloeikast.JPG|thumb|right|A low-pressure mercury-vapor discharge tube floods the inside of a [[biosafety cabinet]] with shortwave UV light when not in use, sterilizing microbiological contaminants from irradiated surfaces.]]
'''Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation''' ('''UVGI''') is a [[disinfectant|disinfection]] method that uses short-[[wavelength]] [[ultraviolet]] (UV-C) light to kill or inactivate [[microorganism]]s by destroying [[nucleic acid]]s and disrupting their [[DNA]], leaving them unable to perform vital [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] |date=April 2008 |work=NIOSH eNews |volume=5 |issue=12 |accessdate=4 May 2015 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/enews/pdfs/enewsv5n12.pdf |title=Word of the Month: Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI)}}&lt;/ref&gt; UVGI is used in a variety of applications, such as food, air, and [[water purification]].

UV-C light is weak at the Earth's surface as the [[Earth's atmosphere|ozone layer of the atmosphere]] blocks it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espo.nasa.gov/solveII/implement.html |title=SOLVE II Science Implementation |date=2003 |accessdate=4 May 2015 |publisher=NASA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216074321/http://www.espo.nasa.gov/solveII/implement.html |archivedate=February 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UVGI devices can produce strong enough UV-C light in circulating air or water systems to make them inhospitable environments to microorganisms such as [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, [[mold]]s and other [[pathogen]]s. UVGI can be coupled with a filtration system to sanitize air and water.

The application of UVGI to disinfection has been an accepted practice since the mid-20th century. It has been used primarily in [[medical sanitation]] and sterile work facilities. Increasingly it has been employed to sterilize [[drinking water|drinking]] and [[wastewater]], as the holding facilities are enclosed and can be circulated to ensure a higher exposure to the UV. In recent years UVGI has found renewed application in [[air purifier]]s.

==History==

In 1878, Arthur Downes and Thomas P. Blunt published a paper describing the sterilization of bacteria exposed to short-wavelength light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rspl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/28/190-195/199.full.pdf |title=On the Influence of Light upon Protoplasm |first1=Arthur |last1=Downes |first2=Thomas P. |last2=Blunt |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London |volume=28 |issue=190–195 |date=19 December 1878 |pages=199–212 |doi=10.1098/rspl.1878.0109 |accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UV has been a known [[mutagen]] at the cellular level for over 100 years. The 1903 [[Nobel Prize for Medicine]] was awarded to [[Niels Finsen]] for his use of UV against [[lupus vulgaris]], [[tuberculosis]] of the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1903/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1903 |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |accessdate=2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using UV light for disinfection of drinking water dates back to 1910 in [[Marseille, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phc.amedd.army.mil/PHC%20Resource%20Library/Ultraviolet%20Light%20Disinfection%20in%20the%20Use%20of%20Individual%20Water%20Purification%20Devices.pdf |title=Ultraviolet light disinfection in the use of individual water purification devices |publisher=U.S. Army Public Health Command |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype plant was shut down after a short time due to poor reliability. In 1955, UV [[water treatment]] systems were applied in Austria and Switzerland; by 1985 about 1,500 plants were employed in Europe. In 1998 it was discovered that protozoa such as [[cryptosporidium]] and [[giardia]] were more vulnerable to UV light than previously thought; this opened the way to wide-scale use of UV water treatment in North America.  By 2001, over 6,000 UV water treatment plants were operating in Europe.&lt;ref name="BC08"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ultraviolet Disinfection Handbook|last2=Colton|first2=Christine|publisher=American Water Works Association|year=2008|isbn=978-1-58321-584-5|pages=3–4|first1=James|last1=Bolton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, UV costs have declined as researchers develop and use new UV methods to disinfect water and wastewater. Currently, several countries have developed regulations that allow systems to disinfect their drinking water supplies with UV light.

UV light is [[electromagnetic radiation]] with wavelengths shorter than [[visible light]]. UV can be separated into various ranges, with short-wavelength UV ([[Ultraviolet|UVC]]) considered "germicidal UV". At certain wavelengths, UV is mutagenic to bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms. Particularly at wavelengths around 260&amp;nbsp;nm–270&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meulemans|first=C. C.

This process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.

A UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.

==Effectiveness==
The effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism’s ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.

In many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.

"Sterilization" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term "disinfection" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain log reduction e.g., 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.

The effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.

[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.

Lamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.

Increases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.

One method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yosemite.epa.gov/water/owrccatalog.nsf/9da204a4b4406ef885256ae0007a79c7/a70c70397b28c1bf85256b06007233c1!OpenDocument|title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:

* Flow rate (contact time)
* Transmittance (light reaching the target)
* Turbidity (cloudiness)
* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)
In air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:

[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose] µWs/cm²  = UV intensity µW/cm²  x Exposure time (seconds)

The UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.

To accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.

These calculations actually predict the [http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/ UV fluence] and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.

===Inactivation of microorganisms===
The degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (µW·s/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;!--1 µW·s/cm² =  10 mW·s/m² = 0.01 W·s/m², the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article--&gt;. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&amp;nbsp;µW·s/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&amp;nbsp;µW·s/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.&lt;ref name="epa_lt2"/&gt;{{rp|1–7}}

==Strengths and weaknesses==

===Advantages===
{{Details|Disinfectant}}
UV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favorably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labor, and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labor, and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

=== Disadvantages ===
UV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.&lt;ref&gt;Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.&lt;/ref&gt;

A disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.

==Safety ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}
In UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.

&lt;!-- the next 3 paragraphs are almost an exact copy-paste of the text found here: https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf in the "Potential dangers" section. I don't know enough to say it is a reliable source --&gt;For human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]]{{Citation needed|reason=Current literature indicates UVA and UVB wavelengths cause skin cancer, not UVC.|date=March 2017}}. Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.

Another potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&amp;nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) molecules.

UV-C radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be "UV-resistant" are tested only for UV-B, as UV-C doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.

The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a TLV for UV-C exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&amp;nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6 mJ/cm² over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When TUSS was planned, and until quite recently, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0 mJ/cm² dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2 μW/cm². Thus, 0.2 μW/cm² was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January–February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Air disinfection===
UVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.

ASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in "Ultraviolet Lamp Systems", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers "Ultraviolet air and surface treatment" in Chapter 60.

===Water disinfection===
[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapor discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]

Ultraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher =TrojanUV | year =2012 | title =Introduction to UV disinfection | url =http://www.trojanuv.com/uvdisinfection | accessdate =24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.&lt;ref&gt;Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, UV-oxidation processes can be used to simultaneously destroy trace chemical contaminants and provide high-level disinfection, such as the world's largest indirect potable reuse plant in New York which opened the [[Catskill-Delaware Water Ultraviolet Disinfection Facility]] on 8 October 2013. A total of 56 energy-efficient UV reactors were installed to treat {{convert|2.2|e9USgal|m3}} a day to serve New York City.&lt;ref name="catskill-de"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_catskill_delaware_uv_plant.shtml|title=Catskill-Delaware Water Ultraviolet Disinfection Facility|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It used to be thought that UV disinfection was more effective for bacteria and viruses, which have more-exposed genetic material, than for larger pathogens that have outer coatings or that form cyst states (e.g., Giardia) that shield their DNA from UV light. However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UV-C when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M. W.| publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] | format = PDF | url = http://www.epa.gov/nerl/news/forum2003/water/ware_poster.pdf | accessdate = 2008-12-28 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080227143624/http://www.epa.gov/nerl/news/forum2003/water/ware_poster.pdf |archivedate = 27 February 2008|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that [[protists]] are able to survive high UV-C doses but are sterilized at low doses.

====Developing countries====
A 2006 project at [[University of California, Berkeley]] produced a design for inexpensive water disinfection in resource deprived settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uvtube.berkeley.edu/home|title=Household UV disinfection: A sustainable option - UV-Tube|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was designed to produce an open source design that could be adapted to meet local conditions. In a somewhat similar proposal in 2014, Australian students designed a system using chip packet foil to reflect [[Solar water disinfection|solar UV radiation]] into a glass tube that should disinfect water without power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2014-09-chip-packets-safer-papua-guinea.html|title=Chip packets help make safer water in Papua New Guinea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wastewater treatment===
Ultraviolet in [[sewage treatment]] is commonly replacing chlorination. This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting chlorinated organics and also because of the environmental risks of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], "UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale urban UV wastewater treatment is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.

===Aquarium and pond===
Ultraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.

Aquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.
Many of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}

===Laboratory hygiene===
UVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] ("hoods") between uses.

===Food and beverage protection===
Since the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a [[Sterility assurance level|5-log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].

===Lamps===
[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]
{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}

Germicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&amp;nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="epa_lt2" /&gt;{{rp|2–6}}

Lamps are either amalgam or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1 W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps are a higher-power version of low-pressure lamps. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2–3 W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps have a broad and pronounced peak-line spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30 W/cm³ or greater.

Depending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&amp;nbsp;nm and also at 185&amp;nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&amp;nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.

The UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&amp;nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&amp;nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal=Env. Sci. And Technology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768–773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UV-C LEDs]]

=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===
Recent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UV-C LEDs. UV-C LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&amp;nbsp;nm-280&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor.  The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285 nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2304-6732/3/1/7|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Water treatment systems===
Sizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.&lt;ref name="epa_lt2"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5-2}}

The flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.

Points of interest—such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism—use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are "fired" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are "harvested" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.

When the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40&amp;nbsp;mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; within an envelope of flow and transmittance.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

To validate effectiveness in drinking-water systems, the method described in the EPA UV Guidance Manual is typically used by the U.S., whilst Europe has adopted Germany's DVGW 294 standard. For wastewater systems, the NWRI/AwwaRF Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidelines for Drinking Water and Water Reuse protocols are typically used, especially in wastewater reuse applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Treatment technology report for recycled water |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/treatmenttechnology.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=January 2007  |publisher=State Of California Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management |page={{page needed|date=January 2011}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The VizieR Catalogue Service''' is an [[astronomical catalog]] service provided by [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]].

The origin of the VizieR Catalogue Service dates back to 1993 as the ESA [[European Space Information System]] Catalogue Browser. Initially intended to serve the Space Science community, the ESIS project pre-dates the World Wide Web as a network database allowing uniform access to a heterogeneous set of catalogues and data.

The [[Centre de données astronomiques de Strasbourg]] had for years collected and disseminated astronomical data, so the original ESIS Catalogue Browser was transferred to and stored at CDS. Since its inception in 1996, VizieR has become a reference point for astronomers worldwide engaged in research, who come to access catalogued data regularly published in astronomical journals. The new VizieR service was refurbished in 1997 by the CDS to better serve the community in terms of searching capabilities and data volume. As of March 2012 it contains more than 9800 catalogues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/vizier//index.htx#desc VizieR Description]&lt;/ref&gt;

The VizieR catalog is now a major data source as part of the [[Astrophysical Virtual Observatory]].
