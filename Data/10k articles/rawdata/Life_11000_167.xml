'''Abraham Afewerki''' (30 January 1966 – 7 October 2006) was an [[Eritrea]]n singer, songwriter and music producer. Noted for his unique [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]]-based compositions and lyrics, he was one of the most recognised figures among Eritrean musicians and celebrities.

==Early life==
Abraham Afewerki was born in 1966 in [[Asmara]], [[Eritrea]]. During the [[Eritrean War of Independence]], Afewerki and his family fled the fighting and lived as refugees in [[Sudan]]. He was interested in music from an early age, taking up the [[harmonica]]. Afewerki joined the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF) at the age of 12, as a member of a cultural troupe which toured areas controlled by the EPLF. He began writing his own songs and music regarding the war, performing them from 1979 onwards.{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| p=49}}

Abraham moved to Italy, where he learnt to play the [[krar]] and continued to write songs in the theme of Eritrean nationalism. After several years, he moved to the United States where he studied for a [[bachelor's degree]] with honours.{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| p=49}}

==Music career==
Abraham’s first release,''Wegahta'' (''Sunrise''), was released in 1991. During the following 15 years, Abraham released two more albums which further propelled his popularity among Eritreans. His songs were popular because his lyrics expressed strong and poetic images of Eritrea’s culture. His song "Abzelena Alina" ("Wherever We Are") became greatly popular in Eritrea; his socially conscious words and evocative lyrics talked of the bravery of the nation.{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| p=49}}

In his final release, entitled Semai ("Sky" in Tigrinya), Abraham collaborates with several Eritrean musicians, the result of which was an exquisite sound. Abraham continued to blend his music with [[jazz]], [[R&amp;B]], and [[Reggae]] rhythms at the same time maintaining his music’s originality and authenticity. One song from the album, "Semay Iyu Deretey" ("The Sky Is My Limit"), has become one of the popular songs in Eritrea.{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| p=50}}

==Death==
In 2006, Abraham drowned while swimming in the [[Red Sea]] near [[Massawa]]. He had returned to Eritrea to produce a film musical.{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| p=50}} Posthumously, Abraham continues to be held in high regard by his fellow Eritrean artists, who bear much appreciation and respect. His musical influence has also spread to Ethiopia where his music is reproduced by other musicians singing in a different language other than his native [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]].{{sfn |Akyeampong|Gates| 2012| p=50}}

==Discography==
He released the following albums in Eritrea:
*1991: ''Wegahta'' (Sunrise) 
*1994: ''Tesfa'iya snqey'' (Hope is my supply/kit) 
*1998: ''MsTir fQri'' (Secret of Love) 
*2000: ''Hadera'' (Promise)
*2006: ''Semai'' (Sky)

'''Abraham of Angamaly''' ({{lang-syr|ܐܒܪܗܡ ܡܛܪܢ}}, died c. 1597) (Mar Abraham) was the last in the long line of [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] bishops sent from the [[Church of the East]] to the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] of [[Kerala]]. He was sent by the East Syriac Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb. In spite of the express approbation of the Pope, he was not welcomed by the Portuguese ecclesiastical authorities.&lt;ref name="thehindu.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name=angamalybasilica&gt;http://angamalybasilica.com/template.php?id=35&amp;page=8&amp;catid=72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
The last two East Syriac bishops of Malabar were [[Joseph Sulaqa]] and Mar Abraham; both arrived in Malabar after the arrival of the Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"&gt;Encyclopaedia of sects &amp; religious doctrines, Volume 4 By Charles George Herbermann page 1180,1181&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For details on Mar Jacob, Mar Joseph, and Mar Abraham cf. A. M. Mundadan, "History of St. Thomas Christianity in India", in George Menachery, Ed., The St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Vol. II, Trichur, 1973 pp.46-52, esp. the end notes.Also Joseph Thkkedath, History of Christianity in India,Vol.II, CHAI, Bangalore, 1982, Ch.3 pp.34-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no doubt that Joseph Sulaqa's appointment was canonical, for he, the brother of the first Chaldean patriarch [[Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa]], was appointed by his successor [[Abdisho IV Maron]] and sent out to [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]]. Mar Joseph was sent to India with letters of introduction from the Pope to the Portuguese authorities; he was besides accompanied by Bishop Ambrose, a Dominican and papal commissary to the first patriarch, by his socius Father Anthony, and by Mar Elias Hormaz, Archbishop of Diarbekir. They arrived at [[Goa]] about 1563, and were detained at Goa for eighteen months before being allowed to enter the diocese. Proceeding to Cochin they lost Bishop Ambrose; the others travelled through Malabar for two and a half years on foot, visiting every church and detached settlement.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"/&gt;

By 1567, Latin authorities asked him to make enquiries into the conduct and doctrine of the prelate suspected for propagating "Nestorian error"; in consequence of this the first provincial council was held and Joseph Sulaqa was sent to Portugal in 1568, thence to Rome, where he died shortly after his arrival.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"/&gt;

==Mar Abraham in India==
[[File:Tomb of last East Syrian Metropolitan Mar Abraham at Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church, Angamaly.jpg|thumb|Tomb of last [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] Metropolitan Mar Abraham inside the Madbaha of [[Mar Hormiz Syro-Malabar Church, Angamaly|Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church, Angamaly]]]]

While [[Mar Joseph Sulaqa|Joseph Sulaqa]] was leaving [[India]] there arrived from [[Mesopotamia]] another bishop named Mar Abraham, sent by [[Shemon VII Ishoyahb]] the [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|East Syriac Patriarch]]. He succeeded in entering [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]] undetected  at the appearance of another [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] who proclaimed himself a bishop. The people were greatly delighted and received him with applause; he at once set about holding episcopal functions and conferring holy orders, and quietly established himself in the diocese.&lt;ref name="Gouva, p. col. 2"&gt;Gouva, p. col. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Portuguese captured him and sent him to Portugal, but during the journey he escaped at Mozambique, found his way back to Mesopotamia, and went straight to Mar Abdisho IV Maron, the [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Chaldean Patriarch]], having realized from his Indian experience that, unless he secured a nomination from him, it would be difficult to establish himself in [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]]. He succeeded admirably, obtained nomination, consecration, and a letter from the patriarch to the [[pope]]. With this he proceeded to Rome, and in an audience with the Pope disclosed his position.&lt;ref name="Du Jarric, "&gt;Du Jarric, "Rer. Ind. Thesaur.", tom. III, lib. II, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; The Pope ordered the Bishop of San Severino to give him orders from tonsure to priesthood, and a Brief was sent to the Patriarch of Venice to consecrate him a bishop. The facts are attested, both as to the [[minor orders]] and the episcopal consecration, by the original letters found in the archives of the Church of [[Angamaly]], where he resided and where he died.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"/&gt;

==Metropolitan of Angamaly (1568-1597)==
Abraham succeeded also in obtaining his nomination as Archbishop of [[Angamaly]] from [[Pope Pius IV]], with letters to the Archbishop of Goa and the Bishop of Cochin dated 27 February 1565.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"/&gt;

On arrival at Goa, he was detained in a convent, but escaped and entered Malabar. His arrival was a surprise and a joy to the people. He kept out of the reach of the Portuguese, living among the churches in the hilly parts of the country. In time he was left in peaceful occupation. As is usual in such cases the old tendencies assumed once more their ascendency, and he returned to his teaching and practices, Complaints were made by Jesuits; Rome sent warnings to Abraham to allow Catholic doctrine to be preached and taught to his people. At one time he took the warning seriously to his heart. In 1583 Father Valignano, then Superior of the Jesuit Missions, devised a means of forcing a reform. He persuaded Mar Abraham to assemble a synod, convening the clergy and the chiefs of the laity. He also prepared a profession of faith which was to be made publicly by the bishop and all present. Moreover, urgent reforms were sanctioned and agreed to. A letter was sent by Pope Gregory XIII on 28 November 1578, laying down what Abraham had to do for the improvement of his diocese; after the synod, Abraham sent a long letter to the pope in reply, specifying all that he had been able to do by the aid of the Fathers. This is called the first reconciliation of the Syrians to the Church. It was formal and public, but left no improvement on the general body, the liturgical books were not corrected nor was Catholic teaching introduced in the Church.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="see letter, pp. 97-99, in Giamil"&gt;see letter, pp. 97-99, in Giamil&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabban Hormizd Church, built by Mar Abraham==
[[File:Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church Angamaly.jpg|thumb|[[Rabban Hormizd|Mar Hormizd]] Syro-Malabar Church (Old Cathedral), built by Mar Abraham.]]
[[File:Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church, Angamaly.jpg|thumb|Front view of [[Mar Hormiz Syro-Malabar Catholic Church, Angamaly|Mar Hormizd Syro-Malabar Church]] which houses the tomb of Mar Abraham]]
After his escape from Portuguese detention in Goa, Mar Abraham returned to Angamaly in 1570. In the same year, he built his first cathedral church dedicated to [[Rabban Hormizd]], a seventh century Abbot of the East Syriac Church, as its patron. In 1578, as a response to the requests made by [[Jesuit]] missionaries who had been working in Angamaly and in the other centres of the [[Saint Thomas Christians]], the pope granted plenary [[indulgences]] to the Church of Rabban Hormizd, which the faithful could obtain four times a year for 25 years from the year of the election of Metropolitan Mar Abraham. The indulgences covered two feasts of the Patron Rabban Hormizd that fell on the fifteenth day after Easter (Monday) and on the first of September. On 15 August 1579, as requested by Mar Abraham, the Jesuits laid the foundation stone of a new cathedral namely "Rabban Hormizd" in the same place chosen by the Metropolitan.&lt;ref&gt;"The removal of Patrons and some Historical reflexions/പടിയിറങ്ങുന്ന പ്രതിഷ്ഠകളും ചില ചരിത്രവിചാരങ്ങളും." ''Sathyadeepam Weekly''. 88 (25 March 2015): 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Synod of Diamper]] of the year 1599, prohibited the Christians from commemorating the feast of Rabban Hormizd, since Rabban Hormizd was considered a Nestorian heretic by the Latin missionaries.  Session 3, Canon 14 of the Synod severely condemned Rabban Hormizd. According to the new regulations, the Synod commanded as planned by Archbishop Menezes that the Christians celebrate the feast of St. [[Hormizd, the Martyr]] (according to the Roman Martyrology published from Rome in 1583), a Persian Catholic saint who lived in the fifth century, suppressing the memory of Rabban Hormizd. The Feast was fixed on 8 August according to the Canon 10 of the Session 2 of the Synod of Diamper.&lt;ref&gt;"The removal of Patrons and some Historical reflexions." 5, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodoret, "Historia Ecclesiastica: St. Hormisdas, a Persian martyr." b. 5, c. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=5856&lt;/ref&gt;

The efforts of Archbishop Menezes and the Portuguese missionaries to replace Rabban Hormizd as patron of St. Hormizd church with St. Hormizd the martyr is an instance of sixteenth-century attempts at forced Latinization. It is doubtful whether the Christians immediately accepted this change of patronship. Bishop [[Francis Ros]], the first Latin bishop of the Saint Thomas Christians, attempted to get the decree of the Synod of Diamper accepted with the [[Second Synod of Angamaly]] that he convoked in December 1603.&lt;ref&gt;"Marichaalum Marikkaatha Mar Abraham/Mar Abraham, an Immortal Soul." Sunday Shalome, vol. 16, No. 42, 25 October 2015, 2&lt;/ref&gt;  St. [[Hormizd, the Martyr]] of Persia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/martyrs-christian&lt;/ref&gt; is a historical person who lived in the fifth century in Persia.

==Later years and death==

In 1595, Mar Abraham fell dangerously ill but recovered.&lt;ref name="Du Jarric, tom. I, lib. II, p. 614"&gt;Du Jarric, tom. I, lib. II, p. 614&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1597 he again became dangerously ill. Archbishop Aleixo de Menezes wrote and exhorted him to reform his people, but for answer only got frivolous excuses.&lt;ref name="Gouva, p. 2"&gt;Gouva, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He would not even avail himself of the exhortations of the Fathers who surrounded his bed, nor did he receive the last sacraments. Thus he died in January 1597.&lt;ref&gt;For details of the last days of Mar Abraham cf. Michael Geddes, "History of the Malabar Church &amp;c.", London, 1694, repr. George Menachery, Ed.Indian Church History Classics, Vol.I, Ollur 1998 pp.51-112&lt;/ref&gt; The viceroy made known his death to Archbishop Menezes, then absent on a visitation tour, by letter of 6 Feb. 1597.&lt;ref name="Charles George Herbermann"/&gt; The Archdeacon during the first part of the reign of Mar Abraham was George of Christ, who was on friendly terms with the Latin missionaries and was to be appointed the successor of Mar Abraham as Metropolitan of India. Thus he should have become, according to the plans of Mar Abraham, supported by the Jesuits, the first indigenous Chaldaean Metropolitan of the St Thomas Christians. However, the last letter of Mar Abraham, in which he requests the Pope to confirm George’s ordination as Bishop of Palur and his successor, is dated 13 January 1584, while from another letter of the same Mar Abraham we learn that the consecration of George failed because of the latter’s death.&lt;ref name="Ernst Bremer, Susanne Röhl"&gt;Language of religion, language of the people: medieval Judaism, Christianity, and Islam,Ernst Bremer, Susanne Röhl Page 401&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tomb of Mar Abraham==

The tomb of Mar Abraham was discovered in September 2015, in the sanctuary of St. Hormizd Church in Angamaly on the occasion of the renovation of the church. This church has witnessed many of the revolutions of the Christians of St. Thomas in the past against the new Latin hierarchy imposed upon them after the Synod of Diamper. The Christians used to assemble around the tomb in order to discuss important matters and to adopt resolutions concerning their future proceedings. One of the resolutions at the tomb of Mar Abraham was made by all the Christians, immediately after his death in 1597. The second resolution was made in 1601, by about 200 Christians who withdrew their obedience to [[Francis Ros]], S.J, the first Latin bishop of Angamaly.&lt;ref&gt; "Marichaalum Marikkaatha Mar Abraham/Mar Abraham, an Immortal Soul." ''Sunday Shalome'', vol. 16, No. 42, 25 October 2015, 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://in.sundayshalom.com/?p=1814 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035831/http://in.sundayshalom.com/?p=1814 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee was appointed by Major Archbishop Cardinal George Alencherry, at a meeting of Syro-Malabar Church Historians and Ecclesiastical Dignitaries held at Kochi to decide on the investigation, protection, and preservation of the tomb. The committee consisted of Fr. Kuriakose Mundadan, Vicar and Rector of the Angamaly Basilica, Fr. Ignatius Payyappilly, Fr. Peter Kannampuzha (Executive Director of LRC), Prof. George Menachery, and Dr. Jomon Thachil.

He was a son of Maurice V of Craon and Mathilde Berthout. In 1313, Amaury III became Seneschal of Gascony, holding the position until 1316. He received a charter in 1315 to build a bastide at [[Créon]], with permission of King [[Edward II of England]]. He was appointed as the Seneschal of Gascony from 1320 until 1322. With the creation of Lieutenants-General to protect the borders of the border provinces, King [[Charles IV of France]] in 1323, then [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] in March 1331, buy successively the hereditary positions of Seneschal of Touraine, Anjou and the Maine from Amaury III.

Amaury died on 26 January 1333, and was buried in the Convent of the Cordeliers, [[Angers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5545">[[File:STS-8 flight cover 8912 front.jpg|thumb|This cover was one of thousands flown on space shuttle mission [[STS-8]] and sold to the public after landing. The postmarks reflects the originally planned launch and return dates.]]
[[File:STS-8 flight cover 8912 back.jpg|thumb|The back of each cover was marked with a serial number.]]
'''Astrophilately''' tells the story of the exploration of outer space with stamps and postmarked envelopes. It is the intersection of space and postal history. Covers cancelled on the date and at a post office near the controlling agency are used in postal exhibits to share the development and conquest of the cosmos.
==Scope==
Topics of interest include [[postage stamp]]s, [[Cancellation (mail)|cancellations]], and [[cover (philately)|covers]] connected to various projects. Examples include [[rocket mail]], dating from as early as the 1928, and mail actually carried on space flights, a practice that began with [[Project Apollo]] missions, and has continued since then. Specialists distinguish astrophilately from [[topical collecting]] with a space theme; astrophilatelic items are those with direct connections to space missions, whether or not they include any special pictorial depiction.

The [[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]] has a Section for Astrophilately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-i-p.ch/fip-organisation/commissions-sections |title=FIP Commissions |publisher=[[Fédération Internationale de Philatélie]] |year=2017 |accessdate=2017-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Included are covers and cards cancelled at [[launch site]]s, [[tracking station]]s, [[Mission Control]] facilities, research laboratories, and [[recovery ship]]s. Many, though not all, such items have [[cachet]]s produced for the mission; others are recognizable only with specific knowledge of the postmark location and date corresponding to a launch.

==Collecting==
As with regular [[airmail]], items of mail carried aboard spacecraft are known as "flown covers". They are known from both [[Soviet space program|Soviet-]] and [[NASA|American-flown]] missions. While some types are rare, others, such as space shuttle covers, were carried in large numbers, and are thus relatively common, costing less than US$50.

Perhaps the most common item of astrophilately is the "STS-8 flight cover". In cooperation with the [[United States Postal Service|USPS]], the shuttle flight [[STS-8]] carried several hundred thousand covers, [[franking|franked]] with $9.35 express mail stamps, which were then sold to the public after the shuttle's return. The original plan was to carry 500,000, but the final number was reduced to 261,900, of which 2,523 were damaged during the flight and discarded. The remaining covers were each enclosed in a souvenir folder describing the mission and the cover, and sold for $15.35 each. They were sold out by November 1983, just a few months after the flight.

Much rarer are the "Sieger" covers, carried on [[Apollo 15]]. German stamp dealer [[Hermann Sieger]] had [[Apollo 15 postage stamp scandal|arranged a deal]], in which [[H. Walter Eierman]] convinced the Apollo 15 crew members to carry 100 cacheted covers to the [[moon]] and back, for the sum of US$7000 each, with the understanding that they would not be sold until after the end of the Apollo program. These covers, along with an additional 300 that the crew would keep for themselves, were stuffed in [[David Scott|David Scott's]] spacesuit pocket, and never listed on the manifest. However, Sieger began selling the covers he received soon after the mission's return, reportedly for $1500 each, and when the whole affair came to light, NASA confiscated the astronauts' 298 surviving covers (two had been destroyed pre-flight), and grounded them permanently. In 1983, hearing of the STS-8 plans, astronaut [[Alfred Worden]] sued for the return of the 298 covers, and the crew eventually recovered them. The covers have appeared on the market from time to time since then. In an October 2000 auction, one of the crew covers realized US$14,950.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1818">'''The BioWeb''' is the [[connotation]] for a [[Computer network|network]] of web-enabled biological devices (e.g. [[trees]], [[plants]], and [[flowers]]) which extends [[an internet of things]] to the Internet of Living Things of natural [[Sensory perception|sensory]] devices. The BioWeb devices give insights to real-time ecological data and feedback to changes in the [[Natural environment|environment]]. The [[biodiversity]] of today is one giant ecological [[mesh network]] of [[information exchange]], and a resource [[World population|humanity]] should be able to access for a better understanding of the state of our global ecology.

==Technology==
The BioWeb information technologies emerge from the [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] fields of [[biotechnology]] and [[nanotechnology]]. The devices for reading individual ecological systems can be either [[wireless]] [[transmitters]] implemented into the organic structure of seeds or external inserted network [[Node (networking)|nodes]] with the ability to read information and wirelessly transmit the information to the Internet (or network). For example, the botanicalls system transmits information obtained from the devices to Twitter which then forwards the messages on via text message.

'''Biostasis''' is the ability of an [[organism]] to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called [[diapause]]. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html | title=Tardigrade Facts | author=Karen Lindahl and Susie Balser | date=2 October 1999 | publisher=Illinois Wesleyan University | access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostasis is also used as a synonym for the terms [[Cryopreservation|cryostasis]] or [[cryonics]]. Cryonics is a  medical procedure concept that is a well established trope in [[Suspended animation in fiction|Science Fiction]], that may at some point in the future become a possible option for individuals who are terminally ill. The patients would be frozen in what is known as cryonic suspension. The patients are frozen so that when technology advances both to enable them to be unfrozen and brought back to life but also for their illness to be treated, they can be re-animated and their disease can be cured or treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkle|first=R.C.|date=September 1992|title=The technical feasibility of cryonics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030698779290133W|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=39|pages=6–16|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}}

Biostasis is also synonymous for '''Viable but Nonculturable state'''. In the past when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. It should be noted that VBNC state differs from 'starvation survival state' (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as "starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light" (9). Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include "dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis". (9) Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In E.coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who where in the growth state.

It should be noted that is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. "They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in &lt;u&gt;Legionella Pneumophila&lt;/u&gt; and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &lt;u&gt;Acanthamoeba Castellani&lt;/u&gt;" (9)

'''Fugistasis''' or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (Viable but Nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as "when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture." (10). Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability ect.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current Research ==
On March 1, 2018, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]] in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to "slow life to save life."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-03-01|title=Slowing Biological Time to Extend the Golden Hour for Lifesaving Treatment|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a [[Webinar]] which, along with a [[Broad Agency Announcement]] (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/Biostasis%20Webinar_Full%20Deck_For%20Posting.pdf|title=Rapid Threat Assessment (RTA)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.darpa.mil|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible Approaches ===
In their [[Web conferencing|Webinar]], [[DARPA]] outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into [[diapause]] in [[tardigrade]]s and [[wood frog]]s which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the [[protein]] level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Protein Chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] structures. Under typical conditions, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] facilitate changes in shape ([[conformational change]]) of [[macromolecule]]s in response to changes in environmental factors like [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[voltage]]. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/the-apromiscuousa-protein|title=The 'Promiscuous' Protein|last=University|first=Massey|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible that finding a way to control [[conformational change]] in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intracellular Crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/how-intracellular-crowding-changes-everything/|title=How Intracellular Crowding Changes Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intracellular [[organelle]]s are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable [[Spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] control of biological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brangwynne|first=Clifford P.|last2=Tompa|first2=Peter|last3=Pappu|first3=Rohit V.|date=2015-11-03|title=Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3532|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|volume=11|issue=11|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nphys3532|issn=1745-2473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing these intracellular [[polymer]]s to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered Proteins ====
[[Tardigrade]]s are [[Micro-animal|microscopic animals]] that are able to enter a state of [[diapause]] and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including [[freezing]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has shown that [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boothby|first=Thomas C.|last2=Tapia|first2=Hugo|last3=Brozena|first3=Alexandra H.|last4=Piszkiewicz|first4=Samantha|last5=Smith|first5=Austin E.|last6=Giovannini|first6=Ilaria|last7=Rebecchi|first7=Lorena|last8=Pielak|first8=Gary J.|last9=Koshland|first9=Doug|date=2017|title=Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation|url=https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17)30133-8|journal=Molecular Cell|language=English|volume=65|issue=6|pages=975–984.e5|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018|issn=1097-2765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[peptide]] engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] to the biological systems of larger animal organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of [[tardigrade]]s under extreme biological stress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7127">A "choice-based, marketable, birth license plan" or "birth credits" for [[population control]] has been promoted by [[urban designer]] and [[environmental activist]] [[Michael E. Arth]] since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=birch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/michael_e_arth/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105083809/http://www.corrupt.org/act/interviews/michael_e_arth |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }} Interview with Michael E. Arth by Alex Birch&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous iterations of similar transferable birth licensing schemes can also be traced  to [[economist]] [[Kenneth Boulding]] (1964) and leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] (1991)&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Lawn, ''Toward Sustainable Development'', Lewis Publishers, 2000, {{ISBN|1-56670-411-1}} p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/do-we-need-to-pay-to-have-kids-to-save-the-world] Joseph Cox, ''Will Charging People Money to Have Kids Save the World From Overpopulation'', VICE United Kingdom, 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arth offers birth credits in the place of solutions to human [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] that may take too long (like economic development and traditional [[family planning]]), are impractical (like [[space colonization]]), or cruel (like forced sterility, [[genocide]], [[famine]], [[disease]], and [[war]]).&lt;ref name=birch/&gt;

==Implementation==
Arth's plan, as described in his books ''The Labors of Hercules'' and ''[[Democracy and the Common Wealth]]'', is a way to precisely set human population levels while still preserving choice.  Birth credits would allow any woman to have as many children as she wants, as long as she buys a license for any children beyond an average allotment that would result in [[zero population growth]].

If that allotment was determined to be one child, for example, then the first child would be free, and the market would determine the cost of the license for each additional child. Extra credits would expire after a certain time, so these credits could not be hoarded by speculators. An advantage of the scheme is that the affluent would not buy them because they already limit their family size by choice, as evidenced by an average of 1.1 children per European woman.&lt;ref&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests.'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}, pp. 352-361.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|fertility rate is 1.4-2.1 in almost all European countries|date=September 2012}}

==Incentive and enforcement==
According to Arth, a woman may collect the value of one credit if and when she decides not to have children. If the desired average number of children is one per woman, then a woman can have one for free. If she has additional children, she will be required to buy one birth credit for each child. The incentive to society is the prevention of an overpopulation-related [[tragedy of the commons]], including an immediate reduction in unwanted children. The incentive to individuals is that their economic and educational levels would tend to rise as there is an inverse relationship between net worth and the number of children one has. As with traffic laws, enforcement of birth credits could be through fines, tax levies, or loss of privileges.&lt;ref name=birch/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/do-we-need-to-pay-to-have-kids-to-save-the-world] Joseph Cox, ''Will Charging People Money to Have Kids Save the World From Overpopulation'', VICE United Kingdom, 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Cost==
The scheme would pay for itself by rewarding those who choose not to have children, and charging those that have more than their allotment. The actual cost of the credits to those opting for more than one child would only be a tiny fraction of the actual cost of having and raising a child. Therefore, the credits would serve more as a wake-up call to women who might otherwise produce children without seriously considering the long term consequences to themselves or society.&lt;ref&gt;http://laborsofhercules.org/ The Labors of Hercules Modern Solutions to 12 Herculean Problems-Labor II: Overpopulation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests.'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balancing collective vs individual rights==
The choice-based marketable birth license plan was offered as a way to balance the [[group right|collective right]] to live in a world with a sustainable population against the [[individual right]] to have as many children as one can commit to raising, while also reducing the number of unwanted or irresponsible births. Some previous attempts to limit population growth in India or China, which appear to have this same intention, have in some cases met resistance because they focused on limiting the number of children that each family may have without taking into account the differences between individuals in the number of children desired. During India's state of emergency between 1975 and 1977, under the direction of the son of then-Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] there was reported to be overzealous enforcement of [[vasectomy]] and [[tubal ligation]] programs in order to meet quotas. The resulting backlash made subsequent family planning efforts more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The Indira enigma | date=May 11, 2001 | accessdate=2006-07-28 | publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]] | url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110074114/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1809/18090740.htm | archive-date=2006-11-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Male involvement and contraceptive methods for men |date = September 1996| accessdate=2006-07-28 | publisher=[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]] | url=http://www.malecontraceptives.org/articles/ringheim_article.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in China, under the [[One-Child Policy]] (instituted in 1979 to limit the number of children born to urban dwellers to one child) there were also overzealous officials who were jailed for enforcing sterilization or using forced abortions in order to meet population quotas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=China acts on forced abortion | date=September 20, 2005 | accessdate=2008-07-08 | publisher=[[BBC]] | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4262890.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/do-we-need-to-pay-to-have-kids-to-save-the-world] Joseph Cox, ''Will Charging People Money to Have Kids Save the World From Overpopulation'', VICE United Kingdom, 24 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blanche II of Navarre''' ({{lang-eu|Zuria}}) (9 June 1424 &amp;ndash; 2 December 1464), titular queen of Navarre, was the daughter of [[John II of Aragon]] and [[Blanche I of Navarre]]. She was also [[Princess of Asturias]] by marriage.

==Early life==

=== Birth ===
Blanche was born on 9 June 1424 in Olite, Navarre.

===Heiress of Navarre===
In 1427, she, her brother Charles, and her sister Eleanor, were proclaimed the rightful heirs of the kingdom of Navarre. Blanche was promised to the heir of Castile in the peace treaty between Navarre and Castile in 1436. She married [[Henry IV of Castile]] in 1440. The marriage was reputedly never consummated.

In 1453, after thirteen years, Henry sought the annulment of the marriage. An official examination confirmed the virginity of Blanche. A divorce was granted by the Pope on the grounds that some "[[witchcraft]]" had prevented Henry from consummating the marriage. After this, Blanche was sent home to Navarre, where she was imprisoned by her family: from 1462, she was under the custody of her sister. She remained childless throughout her life.

== Claimant to the throne ==
After the death of her brother in 1461, some Navarrese dissatisfied elements and some of the anti-Aragonese party regarded Blanche as the rightful monarch, as they had regarded Charles. They proclaimed her queen. She would have thus become Blanche II of Navarre, had not her father (who wanted to keep the government of Navarre) already had her incarcerated and thus not capable to act.

John tried to marry her to [[Charles de Valois, Duc de Berry|Charles, Duke of Berry]], and younger brother of [[Louis XI of France]] to make an alliance, but Blanche refused, and her act irritated her father [[John II of Aragon|John]]. In 1464, she came back to Pamplona with the help of its bishop Nicolas de Etchabarri, who was murdered shortly after, in order to attend the [[Estates of Navarre|Courts of Navarre]].&lt;ref name="Orpustan, Jean-Baptiste (2007), p. 3"&gt;Orpustan, Jean-Baptiste (2007), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

She died by poison in [[Orthez]] less than a month later. Both her father and her sister Eleanor are suggested to have been responsible for her death. Upon her death, her rights to Navarre were inherited by her next sister, [[Eleanor of Aragon, Countess of Foix]], who however was their father's ally and supporter, and did not press her own claims until his death in 1479.

'''Castigation''' (from the Latin ''castigatio'') or '''chastisement''' (via the French ''châtiment'') is the infliction of severe (moral or corporal) [[punishment]].  One who administers a castigation is a '''castigator''' or ''chastiser''.  

In earlier times, castigation specifically meant restoring one to a religiously pure state, called [[chastity]].  In ancient Rome, it was also a term for the [[magistrate]] called a [[Censor (ancient Rome)|censor]] (in the original sense, rather than the later politicized evolution), who castigated in the name of the pagan state religion but with the authority of the 'pious' state.

In Christian times, this terminology was adopted but roughly restricted to the physical sphere: chastity became a matter of approved sexual conduct, castigation usually meaning [[physical punishment]], either as a form of [[penance]], as a voluntary pious exercise (see [[mortification of the flesh]]) or as educational or other coercion, while the use for other (e.g. verbal) punishments (and criticism etc.) is now often perceived as metaphorical.

'''Self-castigation''' is applied by the repentant culprit to himself, for moral and/or religious reasons, notably as [[penance]].

==Background==
The Cybathlon is presented by [[ETH Zurich]] and comes out of a collaboration with the Swiss [[Swiss National Science Foundation#Research Programmes and Centres of Competence in Research|National Center of Competence in Robotics Research]], which intends to use the competition to promote the development and widespread use of bionic technology.&lt;ref name=V/&gt; Whereas other international competitions for disabled athletes, such as the [[Paralympics]], only permit competitors to use unpowered assistive technology, the Cybathlon encourages the use of performance-enhancing technology such as [[powered exoskeleton]]s.&lt;ref name=V/&gt; Registration for the Cybathlon opened in October 2014 and is open until 1st May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robohub.org/registration-now-open-for-cybathlon-2016/|title=Registration now open for Cybathlon 2016|publisher=Robohub.org|date=9 October 2014|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A rehearsal event was held in Zurich in July 2015, allowing the participating teams to test and assess their robotic assistive technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_29-7-2015-11-43-51|title=Going for gold: team leap over next hurdle in lead up to bionic Olympics|publisher=[[Imperial College London]]|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The Cybathlon features six disciplines – a [[Functional Electrical Stimulation]] (FES) bicycle race, a Powered Leg Prosthesis Race, a Powered Wheelchair Race, a Powered Exoskeleton Race, a Powered Arm Prosthesis Race, and a computerised race for competitors with paralysis using [[brain-computer interface]]s to compete in a computer game (BCI Race).&lt;ref name=V/&gt; The competitors, known as "pilots", can use both commercially available bionic technology and lab-developed prototypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2591615/Birth-BIONIC-Olympics-New-competition-let-athletes-compete-using-exoskeletons-brainwaves-2016.html|title=Birth of the BIONIC Olympics: Competition will let athletes compete using exoskeletons and even brainwaves in 2016|work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=28 March 2014|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medals are awarded to both the athletes themselves and to the companies or institutions that create their bionics.&lt;ref name=B/&gt;

=== Cybathlon 2016 ===
In 2016, the competition was held in the Swiss city of [[Kloten]], a total of 56 teams from 25 countries took part. Competitions are organized in such a way that the participants can demonstrate not only their own skills, but also the distinctive qualities of bionomic tools. For example, in the category of "hand prostheses", competitors attempted several food-related fine motor tasks and in the category "Neuro" the participants managed avatars in a specially designed computer game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37605984 Cybathlon: Battle of the bionic athletes, BBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] of [[Thailand]] died at the age of 88 on 13 October 2016, after a long illness. A year-long period of mourning was subsequently announced. A [[Thai royal funeral|royal cremation ceremony]] took place over five days at the end of October 2017. The actual cremation, which was not broadcast on television, was held in the late evening of 26 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/thailands-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies/article9215490.ece?homepage=true|title=Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, world's longest-reigning monarch, dies|publisher=Reuters|date=13 October 2016|via=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37643326|title=Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej dead at 88|date=13 October 2016|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following cremation his remains and ashes were taken to the [[Grand Palace]] and were enshrined at the Chakri Maha Phasat Throne Hall (royal remains), the [[Royal Cemetery at Wat Ratchabophit]] and the [[Wat Bowonniwet Vihara]] Royal Temple (royal ashes). Following burial, the mourning period officially ended on midnight of 30 October 2017 and Thais have resumed wearing regular colours, while awaiting the future coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, which will be set at a later date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unofficialroyalty.com/royal-burial-sites/thai-royal-burial-sites/|title=Thai Royal Burial Sites|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness and death==

King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] had been treated at [[Siriraj Hospital]] since 3 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Siriraj Hospital plans statue, museum for the King|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1114521/siriraj-hospital-plans-statue-museum-for-the-king|accessdate=16 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=20 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king had a high fever due to [[sepsis]], which improved following [[antibiotics]] treatment.&lt;ref name="Patpicha"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanakasempipat|first1=Patpicha|last2=Thepgumpanat|first2=Panarat|title=Thai king recovers from infection, fever still high – palace statement|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-thailand-king-idUKKCN0VP1HM|accessdate=16 November 2016|publisher=Reuters|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 28 September 2016, King Bhumibol developed a [[low grade fever]] as a consequence of [[pneumonitis]] and required further treatment with antibiotics. The king subsequently developed organ failure owing to [[hypotension]] and became dependent on [[hemodialysis]] due to kidney failure. King Bhumibol's condition became significantly unstable due to evolving acute [[hepatitis]].&lt;ref name="Paddock"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paddock|first1=Richard C.|title=Worries Over King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s Health Shake Thailand|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/world/asia/thailand-king.html|accessdate=16 November 2016|work=The New York Times|date=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king died at [[Siriraj Hospital]] on 13 October 2016 at 15:52 local time, as announced by the [[Bureau of the Royal Household]] on the same date.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej dies, aged 88|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/thailands-king-bhumibol-adulyadej-dies-aged-88|work=[[The Straits Times]]|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/anxious-prayers-ailing-thai-king-outside-hospital-032122339.html|title=Beloved Thai king dies after long illness: palace|access-date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funeral==

On 14 October 2016, the body of the late king was carried by an [[autocade]] from Siriraj Hospital to the [[Grand Palace]]. His body left Gate 8 of the hospital around 16:30. As the cortege passed [[Arun Ammarin Road]], [[Phra Pin Klao Bridge]], and [[Ratchadamnoen Road]], crowds of Thais, most clad in black and many openly sobbing, paid homage. Led by [[Somdej Phra Vanarata (Chun Brahmagutto)]], the abbot of [[Wat Bowonniwet Vihara]], the autocade entered the palace via [[Thewaphirom Gate]]. Upon arrival at the palace, the body was given the bathing rite, presided over by the late king's son, King [[Vajiralongkorn]]. The event was live broadcast on television by the [[television pool of Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3837760/He-heart-country-Thailand-turns-black-YEAR-mourning-millions-weep-country-s-beloved-king-died-70-year-reign.html | title = Thousands line the streets of Bangkok as a convoy returns Thailand's king to his Grand Palace and the crown prince presides over the bathing of his body in a traditional Buddhist funeral rite | work = [[Daily Mail]] | date = 14 October 2016 | accessdate = 16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1110849/thousands-flock-to-cortege| title = Thousands flock to cortege | work = [[Bangkok Post]] | date = 15 October 2016 | accessdate = 17 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general public were allowed to take part in a symbolic bathing rite in front of the king's portrait at Sahathai Samakhom Pavilion within the Grand Palace later that day.&lt;ref name="Fredrickson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fredrickson|first1=Terry|title=Huge crowds for procession, bathing ceremony (Updated)|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/learning/advanced/1110516/royal-bathing-ceremony-to-be-followed-by-procession|work=Bangkok Post|date=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lying in State===
The king's body lay in state in the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall of the Grand Palace for a period of one year, with daily rites for a period of 100 days. As in the funerals of the king's mother and sister, the king's body was not physically placed in the royal funerary urn (''kot'') as was customary; instead, the coffin which housed the body was placed behind the pedestal displaying the royal urn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=โรม บุนนาค|title=เป็นครั้งแรกที่พระศพ "สมเด็จย่า" และ "พระพี่นาง" ไม่ได้บรรจุลงพระโกศ แต่บรรจุในพระหีบ (๕)|url=http://www.manager.co.th/Home/ViewNews.aspx?NewsID=9590000127555|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=Manager Online|date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Special rites attended by King Vajiralongkorn were held to mark the 7th, 15th, 50th and 100th days since the king's death. After the 15th day, the public were allowed to pay their respects and attend the lying-in-state in the Grand Palace. By the end of the allowed public attendance on 30 September 2017 (later pushed forward to 5 October the same year), over 12 million people had paid their respects in person, a historic record crowd that, including foreign tourists and expats living in Thailand, broke all-time attendance records&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ย้ำ 30 ก.ย.ปิดถวายบังคมพระบรมศพ-ยอดประชาชน 317 วัน มี 10.65 ล้านคน|url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/1072409|accessdate=22 September 2017|work=Thai Rath Online|date=17 September 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left an estimated 890 million [[Thai baht]] in donations for the royal charity activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30328658|title=Huge crowds set to watch Royal processing - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special nationwide services in all Buddhist temples together with a general 100th day memorial service were held to mark the 100 day mark since his death on 20 January 2017 with HM King Vajiralongkorn presiding over the national service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/kingdomgrieves/30304569|title=Events mark 100th day since Rama IX’s passing  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2017, a special Royal Kong Tek (Gongde) ceremony was held, presided by HM King Vajiralongkorn at the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall and was led by monks from the Thai Chinese Buddhist community in the Bangkok area. The service was in keeping with Chinese Buddhist rites and customs regarding the dead. The Kong Tek ceremony was a Buddhist religious ceremony unique to the Chinese wherein the deceased, together with his personal effects and clothing, was transferred ceremonially to the next life, with special prayers and chants sung by monks. The event was unprecedented since it was the first time such a ritual was held for any member of the Thai royal family in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2h-yM50xj8|title=ถ่ายทอดสด สมเด็จพระเจ้าอยู่หัวฯ ในการบำเพ็ญพระราชกุศลพิธี "กงเต็กหลวง"|first=|last=Thaitv6|date=28 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public square [[Sanam Luang]] will be used as the cremation ground, where the construction of an elaborate, temporary crematorium was started in early 2017 and was expected to take more than one year to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kǭthǭmǭ long prap phư̄nthī sanām lūang trīam kānkǭsāng phramērumāt chūang ton pī nā|script-title=กทม. ลงปรับพื้นที่สนามหลวง เตรียมการก่อสร้างพระเมรุมาศช่วงต้นปีหน้า|trans-title=Bangkok Metropolitan Administration visits Sanam Luang for location adjustment in preparation for building of royal crematorium early next year|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016|language=th|location=Bangkok|website=Coconuts Krungthep|url=http://krungthep.coconuts.co/2016/11/03/Construction-of-royal-funeral-pyre|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104075511/http://krungthep.coconuts.co/2016/11/03/Construction-of-royal-funeral-pyre|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government granted one billion baht, deducted from central budget, to cover the construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ครม. อนุมัติ งบกลางปี 60 หนึ่งพันล้านบาท เพื่อพระราชพิธีพระบรมศพ|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2016-11-30|accessdate=2016-11-30|language=th|work=BBC Thailand|url=http://www.bbc.com/thai/thailand-38148140?ocid=socialflow_facebook}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the cremation is over, the crematorium will be torn down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lifestyle.campus-star.com/knowledge/38015.html|title=ความรู้เกี่ยวกับ พระเมรุมาศ ชิ้นส่วนพระเมรุมาศหลังการรื้อถอน|location=Bangkok|website=Campus-star.com|publisher=Campus Star|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designs for the cremation complex were officially unveiled on 28 October 2016, and a special ceremony was held on 19 December for the [[royal funeral chariot]]s to be used at the [[Bangkok National Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2016/11/28/royal-crematorium-design-unveiled-photos/|title=Royal Crematorium Design Unveiled (PHOTOS)|date=28 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1146604/construction-of-funeral-pyre-for-king-set-for-jan-10|title=Bangkok Post|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3iL2J92yM0|title=Renovation begins on royal carriages and palanquins|first=|last=NBT WORLD|date=20 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction work for the complex will officially commence on 27 February 2017 with the building of the central column with a September target completion date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30300859|title=Huge event planned to mark monarch’s birthday on Dec 5  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30301039|title=Royal crematorium to symbolise Mount Sumeru  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crematorium, when built, will be the biggest, largest and tallest yet since the state cremation rites for King Rama V ([[Chulalongkorn]]) in 1911, and unlike past state cremations, will be at the larger northern segment of the Sanam Luang Royal Square instead of the southern segment where cremations were held before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30305132|title=Royal crematorium highest for 100 years  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November the Ministry of Culture's [[Fine Arts Department]] head Anant Chuchote visited Nakhon Pathom, where the royal funeral urns have been manufactured for centuries out of old sandalwood trees. He asked for public support and assistance for the making of the royal urn alongside 150 artisans from the Traditional Arts Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1138893/skilled-folk-allowed-to-help-make-royal-urn|title=Bangkok Post|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department issued a job hiring call in the middle of January 2017 for prospective workers in the Sanam Luang royal crematorium complex and for the needed chariot repair and upgrading works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1182392/volunteer-craftsmen-wanted-for-building-of-royal-pyre|title=Bangkok Post|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 12 February 2017, the government pavilion and the Buddhist chapel were under construction. Concurrently, the [[Royal Thai Army]] began manufacturing a new royal cannon chariot for the state cremation ceremonies, a first after many years, timed to be completed in April 2017 for delivery to the Fine Arts Department of the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30306072|title=Construction of new royal crematorium goes forward   - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of the buildings combine both Thai traditional and modern building design and construction methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1195881/royal-pyre-on-track-for-early-finish|title=Bangkok Post|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction process for the royal crematiorium (Phra Merumas (Golden Crematorium))&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kingrama9.th/EN/Crematorium/Detail/7|title=Royal Crematorium|website=www.kingrama9.th|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; itself commenced with due ceremony on the morning of 27 February 2017 in the Sanam Luang Plaza, in the presence of the [[Prime Minister of Thailand]] Gen (ret) [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]]. At the right moment, the central steel beam of the building was hoisted using a crane towards its spot in the plaza worksite after a Buddhist blessing was bestowed on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRnwISURM0c|title=นายกฯ เป็นประธานในพิธีบวงสรวงการก่อสร้างและยกเสาเอกพระเมรุมาศ|first=|last=Thaitv6|date=27 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1 April, the crematorium complex area had seen construction work faster than the usual practice for royal cremations, with all buildings in the middle of the construction phrase earlier than expected. The FAD had also been tasked to undergo a major design remodeling for the main royal urn to be used in the ceremonies and an October date is expected to be chosen for the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/life/arts/2017/03/31/royal-crematorium-rises-sanam-luang-photos/|title=Royal Crematorium Rises Over Sanam Luang (Photos)|date=31 March 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1220682/late-kings-urn-to-undergo-redesign|title=Bangkok Post|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon chariot which was based on those used in British state and royal funerals was officially finished by the end of the month and delivered to the FAD so that the decoration process can begin in time for their debut in the funeral events later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/kingdomgrieves/30313922|title=Royal funeral chariots transferred to Fine Arts Department  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national cremation in the Sanam Luang Plaza took place on 26 October 2017, 13 days after the 1st anniversary of the King's death. Just as in past state cremations since 1995, a special [[Khon]] performance was held in the plaza grounds, organized by The Foundation of the Promotion of Supplementary Occupations and Related Techniques of Her Majesty Queen Sirikit of Thailand (SUPPORT) and the Bunditphatthanasilpa Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30310393|title=Khon performances to be staged at King Rama IX’s royal cremation ceremony  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the huge importance of such an event, the official practice runs for this began as early as 15–16 May with the RTA Ordnance Division spearheading the runs simulating the funeral procession of the major chariots at Saraburi province, with two military vehicles to serve as simulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pattayamail.com/thailandnews/ordnance-division-begins-marching-rehearsal-chariot-bearing-royal-urn-174585|title=Ordnance Division begins marching rehearsal of chariot bearing royal urn - Pattaya Mail|first=Pattaya|last=Mail|date=16 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the royal puppet show, it was the first ever to feature a woman performer in keeping with the modern age -  Ancharika Noosingha, 43 years old, who was the first lady royal puppeter in history, keeping a historic tradition from the Ayutthaya period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30328660|title= Royal puppet revived for late King’s cremation- The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fine Arts Department Royal Music and Drama Office organized the puppet play and its personnel form part of the cast who will perform on the cremation night.

''The Nation'' reported on 11 May that the funeral crematorium and the monastic pavilion are almost ready for an early completion, the fastest yet for royal funerals in the modern era, and the prefabrication processes for the decorations to be used in the buildings are at the final stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/national/30314925|title=Thailand prepares for farewell to beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the sandalwood corn flowers used for state funerals were made to be used by citizens and foreign attendants attending the services, as the kalamet flowers, protected by law, will only be used in the royal crematorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/life/special/30315753|title=A royal garden grows  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of making flowers from corn leaves, through, was a modern practice which began in 1925 during the state funeral of King [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI).

As of 24 September more than 5,500 people signed up to volunteer to serve during the cremation days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1317399/large-crowds-volunteer-to-help-with-royal-cremation|title=Large crowds volunteer to help with royal cremation|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage greater public participation, several Thai provincial capitals had been building replica crematoriums to serve people who cannot be in Bangkok to pay their last respects on the cremation date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/featured/2017/09/25/provinces-rush-finish-replica-crematoriums-royal-funeral-photos/|title=Provinces Rush to Finish Replica Crematoriums For Royal Funeral (Photos)|date=25 September 2017|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while both the public and tourists joining the events rode the [[MRT (Bangkok)|Bangkok MRT system]] and the [[BTS Skytrain]] lines during the cremation days free of charge, as well as on the public ferries at Khlong Phadung Krung Kasem (Hua Lamphong-Thewarat Market) and Khlong Pasicharoen (Phetchkasem 69-Pratunam Pasicharoen) and the [[Bangkok BRT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30327479|title=Free Bangkok transit rides for Royal cremation period  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Public Health was expected to deploy huge numbers of medical personnel to serve the public and foreign visitors during these days and provide medical assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30327491|title=Medical teams on standby for Royal Funeral  - The Nation|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While social media live reports are prohibited for the TV networks (which broadcast the bilingual coverage of the events via the state Television Pool of Thailand and was aired via satellite and streamed worldwide online in both English and Thai via the official funeral webpage, the RTA Thai Global Network, NBT World and the YouTube channel of Thai PBS, the first time this has ever been done), people will still post live feeds but with difficulty and the national and international press have been given a special media center at the [[Thammasat University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1339578/royal-cremation-live-coverage-by-reporters-banned|title=Royal cremation live coverage by reporters banned -Bangkok Post|publisher=|accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early August, plans were finalized to open the cremation site for public and tourist visitation after the cremation ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1291027/royal-funeral-site-open-to-public-in-november|title=Bangkok Post|first=Bangkok Post Public Company|last=Limited|website=www.bangkokpost.com|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Half mast Bangkok School 2016.jpg|thumb|300px|Thai national flag flown at half mast at Assumption College Bangkok during the mourning of the King Bhumibol]]

The government declared a year-long mourning period for Bhumibol. Citizens were asked to refrain from participating in "joyful events" and entertainment for 30 days following his death; as a result, a number of events, including sports (such as the [[2016 Thai League|Thai League football season]], which ended entirely),&lt;ref name="bkp-thaitleaguecancelled"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kirins bag title as league ties are cancelled|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/1110897/kirins-bag-title-as-league-ties-are-cancelled|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were cancelled or postponed. Entertainment outlets such as cinemas, nightclubs and theatres announced that they would shut down or operate under reduced hours during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WHAT'S CANCELED, CLOSED AND OPEN IN BANGKOK DURING MOURNING PERIOD|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/life/arts/2016/10/14/whats-canceled-closed-open-bangkok-mourning-period/|work=Khaosod English|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloomberg-mourning"&gt;{{cite web|title=Drinking, Partying Off Limits in Thailand as Death of King Hits Tourism|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-14/king-s-death-sees-airlines-tour-agents-brace-for-thai-slowdown|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnews-mourn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai king death: Thousands mourn at royal palace|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37654314|work=BBC News|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mourning period prompted concerns from Thailand's tourism industry, which felt that the mood of the country, as well as the cancelled events, would reduce interest in visiting Thailand.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-mourning"/&gt;


Upon the announcement of his death, all television channels suspended regular programming and simulcast special programmes from the [[television pool of Thailand]], which consisted of monochrome videos and photos of Bhumibol, and coverage of royal events. International channels were also blacked out and replaced by this programming. Following the funeral procession on 14 October 2016, the channels continued to air the pooled tribute content until midnight local time, after which they were allowed to resume regular programming. However, for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period, all broadcasters were forbidden from broadcasting programmes that featured "any element of entertainment, dancing, joy, violence, impoliteness or overly expressed emotion", nor any [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|non-official information, speculation or criticism]] related to the deceased King and [[Vajiralongkorn|his successor]]. Most Thai media outlets and websites switched to greyscale colour schemes as well.&lt;ref name="bangkokpost-alltv"&gt;{{cite web|title=All TV channels carry monochrome broadcasts|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1109869/all-tv-channels-carry-monochrome-broadcasts|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bktimes-notv"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV, radio programmes to resume, with restrictions|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1110680/tv-radio-programmes-to-resume-with-restrictions|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief return to monochrome for the King's 1st death anniversary on 13 October 2017, colour television broadcasts, with the same restrictions are before, resumed on 19 October the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1346031/tv-returns-to-full-colour-to-present-funerals|title=TV returns to full colour to present funeral|work=Bangkok Post|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of respect for the mourning, many Thai malls, including all [[Central Pattana]] and [[The Mall Group]] properties, chose not to install extensive [[Christmas]] displays and decorations for the holiday season. Some installed memorials to Bhumibol instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/business/2016/11/26/not-beginning-look-lot-like-christmas/|title=It’s (Not) Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas|date=26 November 2016|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Since the death of the king, ultra-royalists in Thailand have criticized and harassed those who did not wear mourning black.&lt;ref name = ":0"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2016/10/16/ultra-royalists-guilt-shame-people-dont-wear-mourning-black/ | title = Ultra-Royalists Guilt-Shame People Who Don’t Wear Mourning Black | publisher = Khaosod English | website = [[Khaosod]] | author-first = Teeranai | author-last = Charuvastra | date = 16 October 2016 | accessdate = 16 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also subjected to [[witch-hunt]]s people whom they accused of disrespecting the deceased monarch. On 14 October 2016, angry ultra-royalist groups in [[Phuket Province]] thronged the residence of a man who posted on social media a number of comments which they thought offensive to the late king and violated the [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|''lèse-majesté'' law]], despite the local police having declared that the comments were not in breach of the law. The groups dispersed after the police agreed to prosecute the man for the crime of ''lèse-majesté''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | location = Bangkok | publisher = Matichon | date = 15 October 2016 | accessdate = 15 October 2016 | url = http://www.prachachat.net/news_detail.php?newsid=1476504517 | script-title = ชาวภูเก็ตฮือล้อมบ้านลูกชายร้านเต้าหู้กลางดึกอ้างโพสต์ FB จาบจ้วง แจ้งความ ม. 112 แล้ว | title = Chāo phūket hư̄ lǭm bān lūkchāi rān khāi taohū klāng dưk ‘āng phōs ‘ēfbī čhāpčhūang čhǣngkhwām mǭ nưng nưng sǭng lǣo | language = th | website = Prachachat }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2016/10/15/phuket-man-accused-lese-majeste-his-shop-mobbed-over-social-media-post | location = Bangkok | publisher = Coconuts BKK | date = 15 October 2016 | accessdate = 15 October 2016 | title = Phuket man accused of lese majeste, his shop mobbed over social media post }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar incidents happened on the following day in [[Phang Nga Province]].&lt;ref name = ":0"/&gt;

In November 2016, [[Nangrong School]] in [[Buriram Province]] seized colourful winter jackets from students and required them to wear those in mourning colours only. The students were reportedly distressed to lose their jackets due to the cold weather, and many did not own multiple warm articles of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author-last=Thaitrakulpanich|author-first=Asaree|date=3 November 2016|accessdate=4 November 2016|title=Buriram school seizes students' colorful winter jackets|website=Khao Sod English|location=Bangkok|publisher=[[Khao Sod]]|url=http://www.khaosodenglish.com/news/2016/11/03/buriram-school-seizes-students-colorful-winter-jackets/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 November, the director of a public school in [[Ranong Province]] was removed from office for not wearing mourning black on her first day at work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bangkok.coconuts.co/2016/11/29/new-public-school-director-removed-post-wearing-red-dress|title=New public school director removed from post for wearing red dress|date=2016-11-29|accessdate=2016-11-29|publisher=Coconuts Bangkok|website=Coconuts|location=Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Council for Peace and Order]], the junta ruling Thailand, also announced after the death of Bhumibol that it will hunt down ''lèse-majesté'' fugitives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/kingdomgrieves/30298400 | author-first = Wasamon | author-last = Audjarint | website = [[The Nation (Thailand)|The Nation]] | publisher = Nation Multimedia | location = Bangkok | date = 26 October 2016 | accessdate = 26 October 2016 | title = Hunt for lese majeste fugitives }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liliana Barbarita Cepeda==
{{Spanish name|Cepeda|Casado}}
'''Liliana Barbara "Barbarita" Cepeda Casado''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertadetierra.info/noticias/1997.htm|title=Noticias Puerta de Tierra 1997|website=www.puertadetierra.info|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1990–1997) was a young Puerto Rican girl of African descent.

On April 30, 2013, she was, along with [[Lorenzo Gonzalez Cacho]] and several other children who have disappeared or died violent deaths in Puerto Rico, remembered at Puerto Rico's Capitol, during a ceremony to promote reduction of mistreatment of minors in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/reclamanelcesedelmaltratoinfantil-1501513/|title=Reclaman el cese del maltrato infantil|website=El Nuevo Dia|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case==
Liliana Barbarita Cepeda Casado was with her family enjoying a day at the beach swimming on June 8, 1997, when she first disappeared at [[Escambron Beach]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. People began looking for her all over the beach and under water.

Her body was found on June 9, in the basement of an abandoned building that hosted what was once an Olympic-sized swimming pool used for the [[1979 Pan American Games]] water competitions.

Initially it was said that she had been raped, beaten and murdered. Days after that announcement, however, police recanted, declaring her death as an accidental one.  During a press conference, Police chief [[Pedro Toledo]] discussed that her 11 year old brother allegedly admitted that she had fallen to her death as she was playing with him and that, afraid of the consequences this could bring him, her brother claimed she was kidnapped. Toledo later held another press conference, where he admitted his comments could have been misleading. "At that time, I understood that we had to put an end to the hysteria (surrounding the case)" Toledo told the press that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1997/Girl-s-death-has-enraged-mystified-captivated-public-in-Puerto-Rico/id-11f1f432abeb92d0750bf44169b68ef4|title=Girl's death has enraged, mystified, captivated public in Puerto Rico|website=www.apnewsarchive.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 1998, Jose Luis Ortiz Vega, Barbarita's stepfather&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adendi.com/archivo.asp?num=379921&amp;year=1999&amp;month=1&amp;keyword=&lt;/ref&gt; and Eugenio J. Rodriguez Galindo were arrested and charged with the kidnapping and murder of Cepeda Casado. During a preliminary court hearing on December 16 of that year, it was determined there was probable cause to accuse the two of first degree murder and of kidnapping, in addition to gun law violations. A third man, named Eliezer Santana Baez, testified he had witnessed some of what the other two men had been accused of doing. Santana Baez, however, had also declared that he was not there when Cepeda Casado died and that he had been coerced to lie by authorities.

It was later argued by the two accused men's defense that some of the evidence offered by prosecution had been in the hands of the public ministry and that they had not been handed to defense until the day of a hearing, 15 January 1999, and as such, the accusations should be discarded. These motions were later dismissed by jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexjuris.com/LEXJURIS/Dts99/LEX99150.htm|title=LEX90000|website=www.lexjuris.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six months after being jailed in 1998, both Ortiz Vega and Rodriguez Galindo had to be released due to being jailed without a trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adendi.com/archivo.asp?num=382973&amp;year=1999&amp;month=5&amp;keyword=|title=ADENDI|website=www.adendi.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Santana Baez later alleged that he had lied about the case&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adendi.com/archivo.asp?num=637538&amp;year=2004&amp;month=10&amp;keyword=|title=ADENDI|website=www.adendi.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a judge then found no cause against Rodriguez Galindo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2001/vol5n02/Year2000-en.html|title=PUERTO RICO HERALD: THE YEAR 2000 AT A GLANCE|website=www.puertorico-herald.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Santana Baez was later found guilty of the murder of a Puerto Rican dancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corp.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=A174AD8172EC4303ABF5A53928534436&amp;year=2004&amp;keyword=|title=Archivo Digital de PrimeraHora.com|website=corp.primerahora.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ortiz Vega died of [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome|AIDS]].

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Dementia with Lewy bodies''' ('''DLB''') is a type of [[dementia]] accompanied by changes in [[behavior change (individual)|behavior]], [[cognition]] and [[parkinsonism|movement]].&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Memory loss is not always present early.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt; Dementia [[Progressive disease|steadily worsens over time]]&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt; and the condition is diagnosed when cognitive decline interferes with [[activities of daily living|normal daily functioning]].&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt; A core feature is [[REM sleep behavior disorder]] (RBD), in which individuals lose normal [[atony|muscle paralysis]] during [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]], and act out their dreams.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; RBD may appear years or decades before other symptoms.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt; Other frequent symptoms include [[visual hallucinations]]; marked fluctuations in [[Attentional control|attention]] or alertness; and [[Bradykinesia|slowness of movement]], trouble walking, or [[Hypokinesia#Cogwheel rigidity|rigidity]].&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; The [[dysautonomia|autonomic nervous system is usually affected]], resulting in [[orthostatic hypotension|changes in blood pressure]], [[Cardiac muscle|heart]] and [[Gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] function, with [[constipation]] as a common symptom.&lt;ref name=Palma2018/&gt; Mood changes such as [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[apathy]] are common.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

There is no cure or medication that will modify the progression of the disease.&lt;ref name=NINDS2017/&gt; Treatments aim to relieve some of its symptoms&lt;ref name=NINDS2017/&gt; and reduce the burden on [[caregiver]]s.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt; [[Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors]] (AChEI), such as [[donepezil]] and [[rivastigmine]], are effective at improving cognition and overall functioning, and [[melatonin]] can be used for sleep-related symptoms.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; [[Antipsychotic]]s are usually avoided, even for hallucinations, because people with DLB are sensitive to them,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and their use can result in death.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt; Medications for one symptom may worsen another.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and prognosis --&gt;
DLB is one of the three most common types of dementia, along with Alzheimer's disease and [[vascular dementia]].&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosakav&gt;Kosaka K, ed. (2017), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=CommonDem}} Together with [[Parkinson's disease dementia]], it is one of two dementias classified as the [[Lewy body dementia]]s.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; It typically begins after the age of&amp;nbsp;50, and about 0.4% of people over&amp;nbsp;65 are affected.&lt;ref name= Levin2016/&gt; In the latter stages of the disease, people with DLB may be unable to care for themselves.&lt;ref name=NIH2017Bas/&gt; [[Life expectancy]] following diagnosis is about eight years.&lt;ref name=NINDS2017/&gt; The abnormal deposits of protein that are the underlying mechanism of the disease were discovered in 1912 by [[Frederic Lewy]], and diffuse Lewy body disease was first described by [[Kenji Kosaka (psychiatrist)|Kenji Kosaka]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;

==Classification==
Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a progressive [[neurodegenerative]] [[dementia]].&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt; Together with [[Parkinson's disease dementia]], it is one of the [[Lewy body dementia]]s,&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gomperts SN |title=Lewy body dementias: Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson disease dementia |journal=Continuum (Minneap Minn) |volume=22 |issue=2 Dementia |pages=435–63 |date=April 2016 |pmid=27042903 |pmc=5390937 |doi=10.1212/CON.0000000000000309 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are also classified as [[Parkinson plus syndrome|atypical parkinsonian syndrome]]s.&lt;ref name = Levin2016/&gt; It is one of the [[synucleinopathies]]—neurodegenerative diseases that are due to an abnormal accumulation of [[alpha-synuclein]] protein in the brain—along with [[Parkinson's disease]], [[multiple system atrophy]], and other more rare conditions.&lt;ref name=Goedert2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goedert M, Jakes R, Spillantini MG |title=The synucleinopathies: Twenty years on |journal=J Parkinsons Dis |volume=7 |issue=s1 |pages=S53–S71 |date=2017 |pmid=28282814 |pmc=5345650 |doi=10.3233/JPD-179005 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
The alpha-synuclein protein deposits that cause DLB can damage different regions of the [[nervous system]], including multiple brain regions in the [[central nervous system]], as well as the [[autonomic nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Kosaka111-112&gt;Orimo S, Chapter 9 in Kosaka K, ed. (2017), pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt; This widespread damage can affect several domains of functioning,{{efn|name=fnAreas}} resulting in a disease that is more complex than many other dementias, with widely varying symptoms.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIH2017Bas&gt;{{cite web |title= What is Lewy body dementia? |url= https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/lewy-body-dementia/basics-lewy-body-dementia |website= National Institute on Aging |publisher= US National Institutes of Health |accessdate= April 7, 2018|date= May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms of DLB are divided into essential, core, and supportive features.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;

There is an identifiable [[prodrome|prodromal]] phase in DLB; the earliest signs are constipation and dizziness from [[dysautonomia|autonomic dysfunction]], [[hyposmia|reduced ability to smell]], visual hallucinations, and [[REM sleep behavior disorder]] (RBD).&lt;ref name=Donaghy2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Donaghy PC, O'Brien JT, Thomas AJ | title = Prodromal dementia with Lewy bodies | journal = Psychol Med | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | pages = 259–68 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25066469 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291714000816 | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d1f8/aef04f0bbb7748ff6acb0d17b3b402318a6d.pdf  |type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DLB is distinguishable from AD even in the prodromal phase.&lt;ref name=Donaghy2015/&gt;

===Essential features===
Dementia is present, but does not always appear early on with DLB, and is more likely to present as the condition progresses&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKeith IG, Boeve BF, Dickson DW, ''et al'' |title=Diagnosis and management of dementia with Lewy bodies: Fourth consensus report of the DLB Consortium |journal=Neurology |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=88–100 |date=July 2017 |pmid=28592453 |pmc=5496518 |doi=10.1212/WNL.0000000000004058 |type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt;—typically after age&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  According to the 2017&amp;nbsp;''Fourth Consensus Report of the [[Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium|DLB Consortium]]'', dementia is diagnosed when there is a "progressive cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude to interfere with normal social or occupational functions, or with usual daily activities".&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

Memory loss is not always noticeable in the early stages of DLB.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;  In contrast to AD, where the [[hippocampus]] is among the first brain structures affected and [[episodic memory]] loss related to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding of memories]] is typically the earliest symptom, memory impairment occurs later in DLB.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karant2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karantzoulis S, Galvin JE |title=Distinguishing Alzheimer's disease from other major forms of dementia |journal=Expert Rev Neurother |volume=11 |issue=11 |pages=1579–91 |date=November 2011 |pmid=22014137 |pmc=3225285 |doi=10.1586/ern.11.155 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Memory loss in DLB has a different progression than AD because [[Frontal lobe|frontal]] structures are involved earlier, with later involvement of [[Temporoparietal junction|temporoparietal]] brain structures.&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt;  Deterioration in memory function occurs because new memories may be encoded but not retrieved.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt; [[Verbal memory]] is not as severely affected as in AD.&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt;

===Core features===
While specific symptoms may vary, core features—based on "diagnostic specificity and the volume of good-quality evidence available"&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;—designated by the 2017&amp;nbsp;DLB Consortium are:&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

* one or more of the cardinal features of [[parkinsonism]], not due to medication or stroke; and 
* repeated visual [[hallucination]]s.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

'''Impaired attention, [[executive function]], and [[visuospatial function]]''' are common symptoms and are present early in the course of the disease.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  Karantzoulis and Galvin write that "marked attentional and executive function disturbance is central" and "attentional disturbance may serve as the basis of fluctuating cognition that is characteristic".&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt; Individuals with DLB may be easily distracted, have a hard time focusing on tasks,&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt; or appear to be "delirium-like", "zoning out", or in states of altered consciousness.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;  They may have disorganized speech and their ability to organize their thoughts may change during the day.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; Problems with executive function surface in activities requiring planning and organizing.&lt;ref name= Levin2016/&gt; Deficits can present with impaired job performance, difficulty multitasking, inability to follow conversations or problems driving a car—such as misjudging distances or becoming lost.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; A person with DLB may experience problems of [[wakefulness]] or [[sleep disorder]]s including daytime sleepiness, drowsiness or napping more than two hours a day, [[insomnia]], and [[restless legs syndrome]].&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;

'''REM sleep behavior disorder''' is a [[parasomnia]] in which individuals with RBD lose the [[atony|paralysis of muscles (atonia)]] that is normal during [[rapid eye movement sleep|rapid eye movement (REM) sleep]], and act out their dreams or have other abnormal movements or vocalizations.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt; About 80% of people with DLB have RBD.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt;  Abnormal sleep behaviors may begin before cognitive decline is observed,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and may appear decades before any other symptoms, often as the first clinical indication of DLB and an [[prodrome|early sign]] of a [[synucleinopathy]].&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=St Louis EK, Boeve AR, Boeve BF |title=REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies |journal=Mov Disord |volume=32 |issue=5 |pages=645–58 |date=May 2017 |pmid=28513079 |doi=10.1002/mds.27018|type=Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On autopsy, 94 to 98% of individuals with [[polysomnography]]-confirmed RBD are found to have a synucleinopathy—most commonly DLB or Parkinson's disease,&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boot BP, McDade EM, McGinnis SM, Boeve BF |title=Treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=Curr Treat Options Neurol |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=738–64 |date=December 2013 |pmid=24222315 |pmc=3913181 |doi=10.1007/s11940-013-0261-6 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt; in about equal proportions.&lt;ref name=Arnaldi2017/&gt; Other symptoms of the specific synucleinopathy usually manifest within 15&amp;nbsp;years of the diagnosis of RBD,&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; but may emerge up to 50&amp;nbsp;years after RBD diagnosis.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt; RBD may subside over time.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

'''Parkinsonism''' occurs in more than 85% of people with DLB, who may have one or more of the cardinal features that occur in Parkinson's disease—[[bradykinesia|slowness of movement]], rigidity,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and less commonly, [[tremor]] at rest.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  Motor symptoms may include [[shuffling gait]], problems with balance, [[falls in older adults|fall]]s, blank expression, reduced range of facial expression, and low speech volume or a [[hypophonia|weak voice]].&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;  Presentation of motor symptoms is variable, but they are usually symmetric, presenting on both sides of the body.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  For a DLB diagnosis, only one of the cardinal symptoms of parkinsonism need be present,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and the symptoms may be less severe than in persons with Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;

'''Visual hallucinations''' are defined by {{nowrap|Pezzoli ''et al.''}} as "well-formed images perceived without the presence of real stimuli".&lt;ref name=Pezzoli2017/&gt; Up to 80% of people with DLB have visual hallucinations, typically early in the course of the disease.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burghaus2012/&gt;  They are recurrent and frequent; may be scenic, elaborate and detailed;&lt;ref name=Pezzoli2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pezzoli S, Cagnin A, Bandmann O, Venneri A |title=Structural and functional neuroimaging of visual hallucinations in Lewy body disease: A systematic literature review |journal=Brain Sci |volume=7 |issue=7  |date=July 2017 |pmid=28714891 |pmc=5532597 |doi=10.3390/brainsci7070084 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Burghaus2012&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burghaus L, Eggers C, Timmermann L, Fink GR, Diederich NJ |title=Hallucinations in neurodegenerative diseases |journal=CNS Neurosci Ther |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=149–59 |date=February 2012 |pmid=21592320 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-5949.2011.00247.x |type=Review |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2011.00247.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and usually involve animated perceptions of animals or people, including children and family members.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;

These hallucinations can sometimes provoke fear, although their content is more typically neutral.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; In some cases, the person with DLB may have [[Insight in psychology and psychiatry|insight]] that the hallucinations are not real.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burghaus2012/&gt; Individuals with visual hallucinations and one of the Lewy body dementias generally have more severe cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name=Pezzoli2017/&gt; Among those with more disrupted cognition, the hallucinations can become more complex, and they may be less aware that their hallucinations are not real.&lt;ref name=Pezzoli2017/&gt;

Different than visual ''hallucinations'', but also common in DLB, are visual misperceptions or ''illusions'', explained by {{nowrap|Pezzoli ''et al.''}} as "incorrect perceptions of real stimuli".&lt;ref name=Pezzoli2017/&gt; A person with DLB may have problems with vision (for example, at night) and misinterpret what they see (for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom).&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;

===Supportive features===
According to the DLB Consortium, although "carrying less diagnostic weight, supportive items are often valuable in clinical decision-making, acting as signposts to or adding evidence for a DLB diagnosis".&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Supportive features may persist over time, be present early in the progression of DLB, and are common, but they are not specific to the diagnosis. The supportive features are:&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;
* marked sensitivity to [[antipsychotics]] (neuroleptics);
* marked dysautonomia (autonomic dysfunction) in which the [[autonomic nervous system]] does not work properly;
* hallucinations in senses other than vision ([[auditory hallucination|hearing]], [[Tactile hallucination|touch]], [[Hallucination#Gustatory|taste]] and [[Hallucination#Olfactory|smell]]&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;);
* [[hypersomnia]] (excessive sleepiness);
* [[hyposmia]] (reduced ability to smell);
* false beliefs and [[delusion]]s organized around a common theme;
* [[balance disorder|postural instability]], loss of consciousness and frequent falls;
* [[apathy]], [[anxiety]] or depression.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;

[[File:Haloperidol_(Haldol).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.0|[[Haloperidol]] is an antipsychotic medication with increased risk of morbidity and mortality in DLB.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;]]

'''Marked sensitivity to antipsychotics'''. Antipsychotic treatment of people with DLB results in adverse reactions about half of the time,&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; and this can be fatal after a single dose.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt; The ''Fourth Consensus Report'' continues to caution against the use of antipsychotics (neuroleptics) for people with DLB.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Partly because of [[dopamine]] cell loss, people with DLB may have [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], impairments in cognition or alertness, or irreversible exacerbation of parkinsonism including severe rigidity,&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; and dysautonomia from the use of antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt; Antipsychotic medications with [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2 dopamine receptor]] blocking properties are used only with great caution.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;

'''Dysautonomia''' (autonomic dysfunction) occurs when Lewy pathology affects the peripheral autonomic nervous system or the nerves that serve organs such as the intestines, heart, and urinary tract.&lt;ref name=Kosaka111-112/&gt; The first signs of autonomic dysfunction are often subtle.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt; Symptoms include blood pressure problems such as [[orthostatic hypotension|dizziness after quickly standing up]] and supine [[hypertension]]; constipation, urinary problems, and [[sexual dysfunction]];&lt;ref name=Palma2018/&gt; [[anosmia|loss of sense of smell]] or [[hyposmia|reduced ability to smell]];&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt; and excessive sweating, drooling, or [[Hypersalivation|salivation]] and [[dysphagia|problems swallowing]].&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;

Alpha-synuclein deposits can affect [[myocard|cardiac muscle]] and blood vessels.&lt;ref name=Palma2018/&gt; According to {{nowrap|Yamada ''et al.'',}} {{nowrap|"[d]egeneration}} of the cardiac sympathetic nerves is a neuropathological feature" of the Lewy body dementias.&lt;ref name=Kosaka157&gt;Yamada M ''et al,'' Chapter 12 in Kosaka K, ed.

The exact cause of DLB&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;—indeed the cause of synucleinopathies—is not known,&lt;ref name=Arnaldi2017/&gt; but there are probably many factors&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; including both genetic and environmental influences.&lt;ref name=Arnaldi2017/&gt;  Less than 10% of cases can be accounted for by inheritance of a single gene, while in most cases, genetic and environmental factors mediate other disease processes to cause synucleinopathies;&lt;ref name= Arnaldi2017/&gt;  these other processes include "[[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] or autosomal-lysomal [[autophagy]] system dysfunction, inflammation, [[endoplasmic reticulum]] stress, or even [[prion]]-like infection".&lt;ref name= Arnaldi2017/&gt;

The genetics are not well studied because the large homogeneous DLB populations needed for genetic studies have not been identified.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt; DLB is not usually inherited, but there is a genetic association in a small number of families.&lt;ref name=NINDS2017/&gt; &lt;!--Typically the disease is not seen clustered in families, although having another family member with DLB is a risk factor, suggesting that DLB does not result from simple genetic alterations.--&gt;DLB risk is heightened with inheritance of the ε4&amp;nbsp;[[allele]] of the [[apolipoprotein E]] (APOE) gene,&lt;ref name=Weil2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weil RS, Lashley TL, Bras J, Schrag AE, Schott JM |title=Current concepts and controversies in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=F1000Res |volume=6 |page=1604 |date=2017 |pmid=28928962 |pmc=5580419 |doi=10.12688/f1000research.11725.1 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mutations in the [[PARK11]] and [[GBA (gene)|GBA]] genes are associated with DLB.&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt;  Further, there is genetic overlap among dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; Also, RBD is found more often among individuals who have GBA and [[SNCA (gene)|SNCA]] mutations.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;

Having REM sleep behavior disorder, having another family member with DLB, and age over 50 are risk factors for developing DLB.&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;  Additional risk factors for rapid conversion of RBD to a synucleinopathy are impairments in [[color vision]] or the ability to smell, [[mild cognitive impairment]], and abnormal dopamingeric imaging.&lt;ref name=Arnaldi2017/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

DLB is characterized by the development of abnormal collections of [[alpha-synuclein]] protein within neurons, known as [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]], and [[Lewy neurite]]s in diseased neurons.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; When these clumps of protein form in neurons, those neurons function less optimally and die.&lt;ref name=NIH2017Bas/&gt; Damage in the brain is widespread, and affects many domains of functioning.&lt;ref name=NIH2017Bas/&gt;{{efn|name=fnAreas|Areas of the brain and function affected:&lt;ref name=NIH2017Bas/&gt;

The amount of Lewy body pathology correlates with the extent of dementia in the Lewy body disorders, but [[amyloid]] imaging and autopsy studies indicate that [[tau protein]] pathology and [[amyloid plaque]]s,&lt;ref name=Siderowf2018/&gt; hallmarks of AD,&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Villemagne2018&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Villemagne VL, Doré V, Burnham SC, Masters CL, Rowe CC |title=Imaging tau and amyloid-β proteinopathies in Alzheimer disease and other conditions |journal=Nat Rev Neurol |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=225–36 |date=April 2018 |pmid=29449700 |doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2018.9 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also common.&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; [[Amyloid-beta]] (Aβ) deposits are found in the [[Tauopathy|tauopathies]], neurodegenerative diseases characterized by [[neurofibrillary tangles]] of [[phosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]] tau protein,&lt;ref name=Villemagne2018/&gt; but the mechanism underlying dementia is often mixed, and Aβ is also a factor in DLB.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;

The precise mechanisms contributing to DLB are not well understood, and a matter of some dispute.&lt;ref name= Weil2017/&gt; The role played by the alpha-synuclein deposits is unclear, because individuals with no signs of DLB have been found on autopsy to have advanced alpha-synuclein pathology.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; Weil says that "How Lewy pathology relates to dopamingergic degeneration and later to more widespread cell death has remained contentious."&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt; It is not known if the pathology spreads between cells or follows another pattern.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt; The mechanisms that contribute to cell death, how the disease advances through the brain, and the timing of cognitive decline are all poorly understood; nor is there a model to account for the specific neurons and brain regions that are affected.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;

A proposed [[pathophysiology]] for RBD implicates cells in the [[reticular formation]] that regulate REM sleep. These cells are affected before other brain regions in the Lewy body dementias; this could be a potential explanation for the  appearance of RBD often decades earlier than other symptoms.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Dementia with Lewy bodies can only be definitively diagnosed after death with an autopsy of the brain&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;—diagnosis of the living is referred to as ''probable'' or ''possible''.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;  DLB is often misdiagnosed or confused in its early stages with AD.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tousi B |title=Diagnosis and management of cognitive and behavioral changes in dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=Curr Treat Options Neurol |volume=19 |issue=11 |page=42 |date=October 2017 |pmid=28990131 |doi=10.1007/s11940-017-0478-x |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another complicating factor is that DLB can occur along with Alzheimer's; autopsy may reveal previously undiagnosed Lewy bodies in as many as half of people with AD.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Despite the difficulty in diagnosis, a prompt diagnosis is important because of the serious risks of sensitivity to antipsychotic medications and the need to inform both the person with DLB and the person's caregivers about potentially irreversible side effects of those medications.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  In comparison to many other neurodegenerative diseases, the management of DLB is difficult, so an accurate diagnosis is important.&lt;ref name= Boot2015/&gt;

===Criteria===
The 2017 ''Fourth Consensus Report'' established diagnostic criteria for probable and possible DLB, in recognition of advances in detection and improvements from the earlier ''Third Consensus'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, ''et al'' |title=Diagnosis and management of dementia with Lewy bodies: Third report of the DLB Consortium |journal=Neurology |volume=65 |issue=12 |pages=1863–72 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16237129 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000187889.17253.b1 |url=http://n.neurology.org/content/65/12/1863 |type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; version.  The 2017 criteria are based on essential, core and supportive clinical features, and diagnostic [[biomarker]]s.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

The essential feature is dementia: for a DLB diagnosis, it must be sufficient to interfere with social or occupational functioning.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

The four core clinical features (described in the Signs and symptoms section) are:  fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, REM sleep behavior disorder, and signs of parkinsonism. Supportive clinical features are marked sensitivity to antipsychotics; marked autonomic dysfunction; non-visual hallucinations; hypersomnia; reduced ability to smell; false beliefs and delusions organized around a common theme; postural instability, loss of consciousness and frequent falls; apathy, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;

The diagnostic biomarkers are:&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

'''Indicative'''
* reduced [[dopamine transporter]] uptake in the [[basal ganglia]] shown on [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] or [[Single-photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] imaging;
* low uptake of [[iodine-123|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;iodine]]-[[Iobenguane|metaiodobenzylguanidine]] {{nowrap|(&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-MIBG)}} shown on [[myocardial]] [[scintigraphy]];
* loss of [[atony|atonia]] during REM sleep evidenced on polysomnography; and

'''Supportive''' (from PET, SPECT, [[CT scan|CT]], or [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] brain imaging studies, or [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] monitoring):&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;
* lack of damage to [[Temporal lobe|medial temporal lobe]];
* reduced [[Occipital lobe|occipital]] activity; or
* prominent [[Slow-wave sleep|slow-wave]] activity.

'''Probable DLB''' can be diagnosed when dementia and at least two core features are present, or one core feature with at least one indicative biomarker is present. '''Possible DLB''' can be diagnosed when dementia and only one core feature are present or, if no core features are present, there is at least one indicative biomarker.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

DLB is distinguished from Parkinson's disease dementia by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to Parkinson symptoms. DLB is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin before or at the same time as parkinsonism. Parkinson's disease dementia would be the diagnosis when Parkinson's disease is well established before the dementia occurs; that is, the onset of dementia is more than a year after the onset of parkinsonian symptoms.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

DLB is listed in the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition'' ([[DSM-5]]) as Major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;  The differences between the DSM and DLB Consortium criteria are: 1) the DSM does not include low dopamine transporter uptake as a supportive feature; and 2) there is unclear diagnostic weight assigned to biomarkers in the DSM.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;

=== Clinical history and testing ===
Diagnostic tests can be used to establish some features of the condition and distinguish them from symptoms of other conditions; diagnosis may include the person's [[medical history]], physical exam, assessment of neurological function, testing to rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms, brain imaging, [[neuropsychological test]]ing to assess cognitive function,&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt;&lt;ref name=NIADiagDem2017&gt;{{cite web| title= Diagnosing dementia |url= https://www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers/publication/lewy-body-dementia/diagnosis |website= National Institute on Aging |publisher= US National Institutes of Health |accessdate= April 6, 2018 |date= May 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sleep studies, or myocardial scintigraphy.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Laboratory testing can rule out conditions like depression, abnormal [[Thyroid function tests|thyroid function]], [[syphillis]], [[HIV]] or vitamin deficiencies that may cause symptoms similar to dementia.&lt;ref name=NIADiagDem2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Haider A, Dulebohn SC |title= Dementia, Lewy Body |journal= StatPearls Publishing |date= 2018|pmid=29494048 |url= https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482441/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polysomnography_connections.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Adult connected to wires for [[polysomnography]]]]
If DLB is suspected when parkinsonism and dementia are the only presenting features, PET or SPECT imaging may show reduced dopamine transporter activity. A DLB diagnosis may be warranted if other conditions with reduced dopamine transporter uptake can be ruled out.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;

=== Differential ===
The cognitive and motor symptoms of many neurodegenerative conditions overlap with or can be confused with dementia with Lewy bodies.  The [[differential diagnosis]] includes Alzheimer's disease; such [[synucleinopathies]] as Parkinson's disease dementia, Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy; vascular dementia; and [[progressive supranuclear palsy]], [[corticobasal degeneration]], and [[corticobasal syndrome]].&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;

Lewy pathology affects the peripheral autonomic nervous system; autonomic dysfunction is observed less often in Alzheimer's, frontotemporal, or vascular dementias, so its presence can help differentiate them.&lt;ref name=Kosaka112&gt;Orimo S, Chapter 9 in Kosaka K, ed. (2017), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alzheimer's disease'''. Short-term memory impairment is seen early in AD and is a prominent feature, while fluctuating attention is uncommon; impairment in DLB is more often seen first as fluctuating cognition.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; While 74% of people with autopsy-confirmed DLB had deficits in planning and organization, they show up in only 45% of people with AD.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; In AD, it is unclear if executive function is impacted early.&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt;  Visuospatial processing deficits are present in most individuals with DLB,&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; and they show up earlier and are more pronounced than in AD.&lt;ref name=Karant2011/&gt;  Hallucinations typically occur early in the course of DLB, are less common in early AD, but usually occur later in AD.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Burghaus2012/&gt; AD pathology frequently co-occurs in DLB, so the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] testing for Aβ and tau protein that is often used to detect AD is not useful in differentiating AD and DLB.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;

'''Synucleinopathies'''. Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia are clinically similar after dementia occurs in Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;  Delusions in Parkinson's disease dementia are less common than in DLB,&lt;ref name= Gomperts2016/&gt; and persons with Parkinson's disease are typically less caught up in their visual hallucinations than those with DLB.&lt;ref name=Burghaus2012/&gt; There is a lower incidence of tremor at rest in DLB than in Parkinson's disease, and signs of parkinsonism in DLB are more symmetrical.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt; In [[multiple system atrophy]], autonomic dysfunction appears earlier and is more severe, and is accompanied by uncoordinated movements, while visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition are less common than in DLB.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  Urinary difficulty is one of the earliest symptoms with multiple system atrophy, and is often severe.&lt;ref name=Palma2018/&gt;

'''Vascular dementia'''.

'''Other'''. The symptoms of DLB are easily confused with delirium,&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; or more rarely as psychosis.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;  Mismanagement of delirium is a particular concern because of the risks to people with DLB associated with antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt;  Dopamine transporter imaging can help distinguish DLB from delirium.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt;

== Management ==

Only [[palliative care]] can be offered,&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt; as there are no medications which will modify the course of the disease.&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; No medications for DLB are approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] {{as of|2017|lc=y}},&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt; although [[donepezil]] is licensed in Japan for the treatment of DLB.&lt;ref name=Kosaka7&gt;Kosaka K, Chapter 1 in Kosaka K, ed. (2017), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Management can be challenging because of the need to balance treatment of cognitive dysfunction, neuropsychiatric features, impairments related to the [[Extrapyramidal system|motor system]],&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt; and other nonmotor symptoms.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; A multidisciplinary approach, going beyond early and accurate diagnosis to include educating and supporting the caregivers, is favored by the 2017&amp;nbsp;DLB Consortium.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

Pharmacological management of DLB is complex because of adverse effects to medications&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; and the wide range of symptoms to be treated (cognitive, motor, neuropsychiatric, autonomic, and sleep).&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt; [[Anticholinergic]] and [[dopaminergic]] agents can have adverse effects or result in psychosis in individuals with DLB,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and a medication that addresses one feature might worsen another.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;  For example, [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor]]s (AChEIs) for cognitive symptoms can lead to complications in dysautonomia features; treatment of movement symptoms with dopaminergic agents may worsen neuropsychiatric symptoms; and treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen other symptoms or lead to a potentially fatal reaction.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt;

Extreme caution is required in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; According to Boot (2013), "electing not to use neuroleptics is often the best course of action".&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt; People with Lewy body dementias who take neuroleptics are at risk for [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]], a life-threatening illness.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  There is little evidence to support the use of antipsychotics to treat the Lewy body dementias, and they carry the additional risk of stroke when used in the elderly with dementia.&lt;ref name= Walker2015/&gt;

'''Cognitive symptoms'''.  There is strong evidence for the use of AChEIs to treat cognitive problems.&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Velayudhan L, Ffytche D, Ballard C, Aarsland D |title=New therapeutic strategies for Lewy body dementias |journal=Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep |volume=17 |issue=9 |page=68 |date=September 2017 |pmid=28741230 |doi=10.1007/s11910-017-0778-2 |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Donepezil]] (Aricept)  was licensed in 2014 in Japan for the treatment of DLB,&lt;ref name=Kosaka7/&gt; and [[rivastigmine]] (Exelon) has a strong evidence base for treating cognitive symptoms.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt; Even if the AChEIs do not lead to improvement in cognitive symptoms, people taking them may have less deterioration,&lt;ref name= McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;  although there may be adverse gastrointestinal effects.&lt;ref name= Walker2015/&gt; The AChEIs are initiated carefully as they may aggravate autonomic dysfunction or sleep behaviors.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt; DLB may be more responsive than AD to donepezil.&lt;ref name=Neef2006&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors= Neef D, Walling AD |title= Dementia with Lewy bodies: an emerging disease|date= 2006|journal= Am Fam Physician |volume= 73|issue= 7|pages= 1223–29|url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0401/p1223.html|pmid= 16623209|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606010854/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/0401/p1223.html|archivedate= June 6, 2011|type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is less evidence for the efficacy of [[memantine]] in DLB, but it may be used alone or with an AChEI because of its low side effect profile.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Anticholinergic drugs are avoided because they worsen cognitive symptoms.&lt;ref name= Walker2015/&gt;

To improve daytime alertness, there is mixed evidence for the use of stimulants such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[dextroamphetamine]]; although worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms is not common, they can increase the risk of psychosis.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Boot BP |title=Comprehensive treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=Alzheimers Res Ther |volume=7 |issue=1 |page=45 |date=2015 |pmid=26029267 |pmc=4448151 |doi=10.1186/s13195-015-0128-z |type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[modafinil]] and [[armodafinil]] are not always covered by insurance, but may be effective for daytime sleepiness.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt;

'''Motor symptoms''' appear to respond in DLB somewhat less to the medications used to treat Parkinson's disease, like [[levodopa]], and neuropsychiatric symptoms can be increased.&lt;ref name= McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;  If such medications are needed for motor symptoms, cautious introduction with slow increases to the lowest possible dose may help avoid psychosis.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

'''Neuropsychiatric symptoms'''. The first line of defense in reducing visual hallucinations is to reduce the use of dopaminergic drugs, which can worsen hallucinations.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;  Although it has been shown effective in Parkinson's disease, there is limited evidence for the use of [[clozapine]] to treat visual hallucinations in DLB, and its use requires regular blood monitoring.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;  [[Quetiapine]] is relatively safe&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and well-tolerated for psychosis and agitation in DLB, but there is little evidence for its efficacy.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;

Apathy may be treated with AChEIs, and they may also reduce hallucinations and delusions; reduction in anxiety and agitation may be a secondary effect.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;  [[Mirtazapine]] and [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]]s can be used to treat depression, depending on how well they are tolerated, and guided by general advice for the use of antidepressants in dementia.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; Antidepressants can worsen RBD,&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt; and antidepressants with anticholinergic properties may worsen hallucinations and delusions.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; People with [[Capgras syndrome]] may not tolerate AChEIs.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;

'''Sleep disorders'''. Injurious dream enactment behaviors are a treatment priority.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt; RBD may be treated with [[melatonin]] or [[clonazepam]].&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=St Louis EK, Boeve BF |title=REM sleep behavior disorder: Diagnosis, clinical implications, and future directions |journal=Mayo Clin Proc |volume=92 |issue=11 |pages=1723–36 |date=November 2017 |pmid=29101940 |doi=10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.09.007 |type=Review |url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(17)30688-2/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Melatonin may be more helpful in preventing injuries,&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt; and it offers a safer alternative, because clonazepam can produce deteriorating cognition,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt; and worsen sleep apnea.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt; For some people, memantine or AChEIs are useful.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; No trials support its use in DLB, but [[modafinil]] may be used for hypersomnia.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; Mirtazapine can be used for hypersomnia, but it can exacerbate RBD.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; Antidepressants (SSRIs, [[Serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|SSNRI]]s,  [[Tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic]]s, and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAOI]]s), AChEIs, [[beta blocker]]s, [[caffeine]], and [[tramadol]] may worsen RBD.&lt;ref name=StLouisMay2017/&gt;

'''Autonomic symptoms'''. Decreasing the dosage of dopaminergic or [[atypical antipsychotic]] drugs may be needed with [[orthostatic hypotension]], and [[Antihypertensive drug|high blood pressure drugs]] can sometimes be stopped.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; When non-pharmacological treatments for orthostatic hypotension have been exhausted, [[fludrocortisone]], [[droxidopa]], [[midodrine]] or [[atomoxetine]] are options.&lt;ref name=Palma2018/&gt;

=== Non-pharmaceutical ===
There is no high-quality evidence for non-pharmacological management of DLB,&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; but some interventions have been shown effective for addressing similar symptoms that occur in other dementias.&lt;ref name= Connors2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Connors MH, Quinto L, McKeith I, et al |title= Non-pharmacological interventions for Lewy body dementia: a systematic review |journal= Psychol Med |pages=1–10 |date= November 2017 |pmid= 29143692 |doi= 10.1017/S0033291717003257 |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/nonpharmacological-interventions-for-lewy-body-dementia-a-systematic-review/1FD0DAA2FBFA2E6468EA2A0B8232796E/core-reader|type= Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organized activities, [[music therapy]], physical activity and [[occupational therapy]] may help with psychosis or agitation, while exercise and [[gait training]] can help with motor symptoms.&lt;ref name=Connors2017/&gt; [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] can be tried for depression or hallucinations, although there is no evidence for its use in DLB.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; The frequency and severity of RBD may be lessened by treating sleep apnea, if it is present.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt;  Cues can be used to help with memory retrieval.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;

=== Caregiving ===
{{further|Caring for people with dementia}}
Because of the neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with DLB, the demands placed on [[caregiver]]s are higher than in AD,&lt;ref name=Mueller2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mueller C, Ballard C, Corbett A, Aarsland D |title=The prognosis of dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=Lancet Neurol |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=390–98 |date=May 2017 |pmid=28342649 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(17)30074-1|type=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; but education for caregivers has not been studied as thoroughly as in AD.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; Contributing factors to the caregiver burden in DLB are psychosis, aggression, agitation, and night-time behaviors such as [[parasomnia]]s,&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; that lead to a loss of independence earlier than in AD.&lt;ref name=VannJones2014/&gt; Caregivers may experience depression, exhaustion, and be in need of support.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; Other family members who are not present in the [[Home care|daily caregiving]] may not observe the fluctuating behaviors or recognize the stress on the caregiver, and conflict can result when family members are not supportive.&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt; Caregiver education reduces not only distress for the caregiver, but symptoms for the individual with dementia.&lt;ref name= Connors2017/&gt;

With the increased risk of antipsychotics for people with DLB, educated caregivers are able to act as advocates for the person with DLB.&lt;ref name=LBDACareMeds&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/sites/default/files/2016caregivingbrief_medications.pdf |title= Caregiving brief: Medications in Lewy body dementia | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia Association]] | date= 2015 | accessdate= April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; If evaluation or treatment in an emergency room is needed, the caregiver may be able to explain that, in the words of Gomperts "patients with DLB are essentially 'allergic' to haloperidol and other neuroleptics".&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;  Caregiver training, [[watchful waiting]], identifying sources of pain, and increasing social interaction can help minimize agitation.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt;  Individuals with dementia may not be able to communicate that they are in pain, and pain is a common trigger of agitation.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;  Medical alert bracelets or notices about medication sensitivity are available and can save lives.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;

When RBD is present, individuals and their caregivers need counselling about the need to improve bedroom safety.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt; Sleep-related injuries from falling or jumping out of bed can be avoided by placing a mattress next to the bed to soften the impact of a fall, and removing sharp objects from around the bed.&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; Sharp surfaces near the bed can be padded, bed alarm systems may help with sleepwalking, and bed partners may find it safer to sleep in another room.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt; According to St Louis and Boeve, firearms should be locked away, out of the bedroom.&lt;ref name=StLouisNov2017/&gt;

Driving ability may be impaired early in DLB because of visual hallucinations, movement issues related to parkinsonism, and fluctuations in cognitive ability, and at some point it becomes unsafe for the person to drive.&lt;ref name=LBDAEarlyCare/&gt; Driving ability is assessed as part of management and family members generally determine when driving privileges are removed.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=LBDAEarlyCare&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lbda.org/go/early-stage-lbd-caregiving |title= Early stage LBD caregiving | publisher= [[Lewy Body Dementia Association]] | accessdate= April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[home safety]] assessment can be done when there is risk of falling;&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;  handrails and shower chairs can help avoid falls.&lt;ref name=Boot2013/&gt;

==Prognosis==
The [[prognosis]] for DLB has not been well studied; early studies had methodological limitations, such as small [[Sample size determination|sample size]] and [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; DLB generally leads to higher disability, lower [[life expectancy]] and a reduced [[quality of life]], with increased costs of care.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=VannJones2014/&gt; Depression, apathy, and visual hallucinations contribute to the reduced quality of life.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; Decline may be more rapid when severe visuospatial deficits show up early in the course of the Lewy body dementias,&lt;ref name=Walker2015/&gt; when the [[Apolipoprotein |APOE gene]] is present, or when Alzheimer's or its [[biomarker]]s is also present.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; The severity of orthostatic hypotension also predicts a worse prognosis.&lt;ref name=Boot2015/&gt;

Compared to AD, which is better studied, memory is retained longer, while verbal fluency may be lost faster.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; There are more neuropsychiatric symptoms in DLB than AD, and they may emerge earlier, so according to Mueller, those with DLB "might have a less favourable prognosis, with accelerated cognitive decline, shorter lifespan, and increased admission to residential care".&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; The difference in admissions to hospital and time in nursing care may be explained by the presence of hallucinations.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; Increased mortality relative to AD may be attributed to a higher risk of injury from falls.&lt;ref name=VannJones2014/&gt;

Life expectancy is difficult to predict, and limited study data are available.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; Survival may be defined from the point of disease onset, or from the (possibly delayed) point of diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt;  A 2017 review found survival from disease onset between 5.5 and 7.7&amp;nbsp;years, survival from diagnosis between 1.9 and 6.3&amp;nbsp;years, and a poorer survival rate than in Alzheimer's.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; The US [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] writes that people with DLB typically live 8&amp;nbsp;years following diagnosis, about the same as AD,&lt;ref name=NINDS2017/&gt; though some people with Lewy body dementias live for 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=NINDS2017Book/&gt; Shorter life expectancy is more likely when visual hallucinations, abnormal gait, and variable cognition are present early on.&lt;ref name=Mueller2017/&gt; In the late part of the disease, people may be unable to care for themselves.&lt;ref name=NIH2017Bas/&gt;   [[Aspiration pneumonia]], a complication of [[Dysphasia|difficulty in swallowing]] that results from dysautonomia, commonly causes death among people with synucleinopathies.&lt;ref name=Palma2018/&gt;

[[Frederic Lewy]] (1885–1950) was the first to discover the abnormal protein deposits (later called "Lewy body inclusions") in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=Gomperts2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kosaka2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kosaka K |title=Lewy body disease and dementia with Lewy bodies |journal=Proc Jpn Acad Ser B Phys Biol Sci |volume=90 |issue=8 |pages=301–6 |date=2014 |pmid=25311140 |pmc=4275567 |doi=10.2183/pjab.90.301 |type=Historical Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, studying Parkinson's disease (''paralysis agitans''),&lt;ref name=Engelhardt2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engelhardt E |title=Lafora and Trétiakoff: the naming of the inclusion bodies discovered by Lewy |journal=Arq Neuropsiquiatr |volume=75 |issue=10 |pages=751–53 |date=October 2017 |pmid=29166468 |doi=10.1590/0004-282X20170116 |type= Historical article |url= http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0004-282X2017001000751&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; he described findings of these inclusions in the [[vagus nerve]], the [[nucleus basalis of Meynert]] and other brain regions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewy F (1912).

(2017), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Japanese, UK, and US researchers finding in the 1990s that DLB was a common dementia, there were nonetheless no diagnostic guidelines, and each group was using different terminology.&lt;ref name=Kosaka63&gt;McKeith IG, Chapter 5 in Kosaka K, ed. (2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; The different groups of researchers began to realize that a collaborative approach was needed if research was to advance.&lt;ref name=McKeith2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McKeith IG |title=Consensus guidelines for the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB): report of the Consortium on DLB International Workshop |journal=J Alzheimers Dis |volume=9 |issue=3 Suppl |pages=417–23 |date=2006 |pmid=16914880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DLB Consortium]] was established, and in 1996, the term ''dementia with Lewy bodies'' was agreed upon&lt;ref name=McKeith2006/&gt; and the first criteria for diagnosing DLB were elaborated.&lt;ref name=Tousi2017/&gt;

Two 1997 discoveries highlighted the importance of Lewy body inclusions in neurodegenerative processes:  a mutation in the SNCA gene that encodes the alpha-synuclein protein was found in kindreds with Parkinson's disease, and Lewy bodies and neurites were found to be [[Immunoassay|immunoreactive]] for alpha-synuclein.&lt;ref name=Goedert2013&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goedert M, Spillantini MG, Del Tredici K, Braak H |title=100 years of Lewy pathology |journal=Nat Rev Neurol |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=13–24 |date=January 2013 |pmid=23183883 |doi=10.1038/nrneurol.2012.242 |type= Practice guideline }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, alpha-synuclein aggregation as the primary building block of the synucleinopathies was established.&lt;ref name=Goedert2013/&gt;

Between 1995 and 2005, the DLB Consortium issued three Consensus Reports on DLB.&lt;ref name=Kosaka64-67&gt;McKeith IG, Chapter 5 in Kosaka K, ed. (2017), pp. 64–67.&lt;/ref&gt; DLB was included in the fourth text revision of the DSM ([[DSM-IV-TR]], published in 2000) under "Dementia due to other general medical conditions”.  In the 2010s, the possibility of a genetic basis began to emerge.&lt;ref name=Weil2017/&gt;  The Fourth Consensus Report was issued in 2017, giving increased diagnostic weighting to RBD and {{nowrap|&lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-MIBG}} myocardial scintigraphy.&lt;ref name=McKeithConsensus2017/&gt;

==Research directions==
[[Cognitive training]], [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[transcranial direct-current stimulation]] have been studied more in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease than they have in dementia with Lewy bodies, and all are potential therapies for DLB.&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; Medications that alter the underlying process of alpha-synuclein deposits are yet to be identified.&lt;ref name=Kosaka215&gt;Ikeda M, Chapter 16 in Kosaka K, ed.

Future strategies involve interventions to modify the course of the disease using [[immunotherapy]], [[gene therapy]], [[stem cell therapy]], and reducing [[amyloid beta]] accumulation.&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt;  Identification of biomarkers for DLB will enable treatments to begin sooner&lt;ref name=Velayudhan2017/&gt; and improve the ability to select subjects and measure efficacy in clinical trials.&lt;ref name=Siderowf2018/&gt;  {{As of|2018}} there are no well-validated neuroimaging modalities to measure alpha-synuclein in the brains of living people, but this is an active area of research.&lt;ref name=Siderowf2018/&gt;

These "trees of lamentation or grief" were usually growing in prominent positions or at busy thoroughfares, particularly at crossroads, so that justice could be seen to have been done and as a salutary warning to others. Place names such as Gallows-Hill, Gallows-See, Gallows-Fey and Hill of the Gallows (Tom Nan Croiche) record the site of such places of execution.&lt;ref&gt;Train, Joseph (1844).

==Origins of the name==
In [[Scots language|Scots]], dule or duill, also dole, dowle; dwle, dul, dull, duyl, duile, doile, doill, dewle, deull, and duel. In [[Middle English]], dule, duyl, dulle, deul, dewle and variants of doole, dole, and dool. All these words mean sorrow, grief, or mental distress.

==History==
The ''furca'' and ''fossa'', or the "pit and gallows", refers to the "high justice" including the capital penalty. The ''furca'' was a device for hanging slaves in ancient Rome and refers to the gallows for hanging men; the ''fossa'' was a ditch filled with water for the drowning of women. With the introduction to Scotland of the feudal system in the 12th-century, pre-feudal, or Celtic tenures, were transformed into holding from the Crown and a number of these were held directly or in chief of the Crown and were held ''in liberam baroniam,'' in free barony, with high justice (i.e., with pit and gallows). In Scotland trees were often used as gallows. These dule trees were also known as the 'Grief Tree', the 'Gallows Tree', the 'Justice Tree' and the 'Tree'. It is said that King Malcolm Canmore legislated in 1057 that every barony was to have a tree for hanging convicted men and a [[Drowning-pit|pit of water]] for the execution of convicted women.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Dane (2009). Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore : Tradition. Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-9518128-6-0}}; p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Law Mount Castleton Farm.jpg|thumb|180px|The Moot Hill, or Law Mount, above the [[River Annick]] near Castleton Farm, [[Stewarton]], Ayrshire.]]
These baronies belonged to the same order as earls and these earls and barons together formed the order of the three ''estaits'' of the Scots Parliament known as the Baronage of Scotland. The barons sat in the Scots Parliament until 1587, when they were relieved from attendance, which was burdensome and costly. The right of pit and gallows was removed in 1747 by the [[Heritable Jurisdictions (Scotland) Act 1746]], lesser powers continued to the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Innes"&gt;[http://www.scotsgenealogy.com/online/peers_and_heirs.htm PEERS AND HEIRS by Sir Malcolm Innes of Edingight, KCVO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912082500/http://www.scotsgenealogy.com/online/peers_and_heirs.htm |date=September 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dule trees were also used by Highland chieftains, who would hang their enemies or any deserter, murderer, etc. from them. Highland clan chiefs also therefore had the power of 'life or death' over their clansmen in times gone by. The high ground on which these trees grew often became known as "gallows hills".

It is not clear whether the [[Moot hill|Moot]] or Justice hills were also the site of the gallows. Some of the place names suggest that they could have been and many were certainly in a prominent position for the display of a corpse to warn others of the consequences of wrongdoing.

P. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; is taken by the idea that dule-trees were places where a clan met to bewail any misfortune that befell the community. He cites an example where the friends and adherents of David, first [[Earl of Cassilis]], met at the Cassilis dule-tree to lament, for several days, his loss at the disastrous [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513. Lawson also gives these details and states that the retainers used to assemble under the tree to make lamentation upon the death of their chief, implying it was an old custom and not a 'one off.'&lt;ref name="Lawson3"&gt;Lawson, Rev.

====The dule trees of Johnnie Armstrong and his men====
[[James V]] upon becoming king decided to restore order throughout the kingdom and its borders. With an army of 12,000 men he required all earls, lords, barons, freeholders, and gentlemen to meet at Edinburgh with a month's supplies, and then to proceed to [[Teviotdale]] and [[Annandale]]. James offered safe conduct to [[Johnnie Armstrong]], the laird of Gilnockie, for a meeting in either in Scotland or in England. Johnnie Armstrong commanded powerful forces and from the Scots border to Newcastle of England most estates were obliged to pay tribute to him.

When Johnnie came into the King's presence, there was no trial, just a hanging of Johnnie and his men in the trees of [[Caerlanrig]] churchyard. The trees are said to have withered and died 'for shame' and that the same has happened to any trees planted since. Johnnie is said to have shouted to James, "I have asked grace at a graceless face." This peremptory execution weakened rather than strengthened James's authority in the borders.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;[http://www.nwlink.com/~scotlass/border.htm Johnnie Armstrong] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126155155/http://www.nwlink.com/~scotlass/border.htm |date=January 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These trees were often close to the residence of the lord or clan chief and one of the best known dule trees stands within the grounds of [[Leith Hall]], near [[Huntly, Aberdeenshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, Donald, Stokes, Jon, et. al (2006).

The Forestry Commission &amp; The Tree Council. {{ISBN|0-904853-06-3}} p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; This tree, a sycamore (''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]''), was used as a natural gibbet and a means for publicly carrying out feudal justice. The strong timber, not prone to snapping, made this a favoured species for this purpose.  Leith Hall dates from about 1650 and the tree was possibly planted shortly after this. A rather gaunt and heavily branched tree, the trunk measures 116&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.&lt;ref name="Leith"&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/489962 The Leith Hall Dule tree.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The dule tree at [[Earl_of_Cassilis#Earls_of_Cassilis_.281509.29|Cassillis]] Castle in [[South Ayrshire]] was blown down in a great storm during the winter of 1939-40 and when the rings on its trunk were counted, it was found to be about 200 years old. A new dule tree, grown from a cutting taken from the old one, a plane tree or [[sycamore maple]]&lt;ref name="Lawson3"/&gt; now stands on the original site. John or Johnny Faa, [[King of the Gypsies]] is said to have been hanged from the Cassillis Dule Tree, together with some of his supporters.&lt;ref name="Robertson2"&gt;Robertson, Wiliam (1908).

The author Joseph Train records however that at the last ''shire-mote'' ever held in Carrick by the Earl of Cassillis, the MacKillups of Craingenreach were hanged on the dule tree of Cassillis circa 1746, having murdered a neighbour and thrown his remains into "the common murder hole of the Bailiery at Craigenreach".&lt;ref&gt;Train, Joseph (1844).

[[Kilkerran House]] in South Ayrshire has a dule tree in its grounds.

The ancient sycamore that stands in the shadow of [[Blairquhan Castle]], near [[Straiton]], [[South Ayrshire]] is thought to be  a dule tree, planted early in the 16th century during the reign of King James V of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Rodger, Donald, Stokes, Jon, et. al (2006).

The Forestry Commission &amp; The Tree Council. {{ISBN|0-904853-06-3}}. p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The moss-covered trunk has a girth of 5.6 metres (18 feet 4&amp;nbsp;inches), and is completely hollow, with only a very thin outer shell of sound wood supporting the tree.  The once spreading crown was heavily pruned in 1997 in an effort to preserve the fragile shell and prevent the much-weakened trunk from total collapse.  Vigorous new growth is now establishing a new, smaller crown.

Near the village of [[Logierait]] in [[Perthshire]] is the hollow ` ash tree of the Boat of Logierait,  which, 63 feet in height and 40 in girth at 3 feet from the ground, is said to have been ` ''the dool tree of the district, on which caitiffs and robbers were formerly executed, and their bodies left hanging till they dropped and lay around unburied.'' '&lt;ref name="Logierait"&gt;[http://www.any-village.co.uk/main.asp?SiteID=AVUK&amp;SpecID=Logierait The Logierait Dule-tree.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example may still exist at Bargany in South Ayrshire where a [[European ash]] (''Fraxinus excelsior''), served the role of the baronial dule tree.

An example is said to survive at Douglas Castle, located around 1&amp;nbsp;km north-east of the village of [[Douglas, South Lanarkshire]] aka [[Castle Dangerous]] of Sir Walter Scott's novel of that name.

Smith records in 1895 that the stump of the dule tree at [[Newark Castle, Port Glasgow|Newark Castle]] was carefully preserved.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, John (1895) Prehistoric man in Ayrshire. Pub. Elliot Stock. London. P. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hangman's Elm]], or simply the "hanging tree", is an English [[elm]] located in New York City, over 300 years old. Traitors are said to have been hanged at this location during the American Revolutionary War. Later, the Marquis de Lafayette is said to have witnessed the 'festive' hanging of 20 highwaymen here in 1824.

== Previous sites of old dule trees ==
In the 1830s, a gallows-tree still stood in the Edinburgh grass-market, surrounded by the actual scaffold with a ladder leaning against the structure for the ascent.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Heath]]'s ''Picturesque Annual'' for 1835. ''Scott &amp; Scotland''. London : Longman, Bees, Orme, Brown, Green and Longman. p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Auchendrane castle also (Auchindraine) in South Ayrshire sits on the banks of the [[River Doon]] and had a famous dule tree, long ago blown down in furious gale.  This tree was an ash and stood in front of the castle; described as being one of the finest trees in the district. The last Mure of Auchendrane was arrested for non-payment of a small debt and the bailiff, out of compassion,  offered to settle the debt in exchange for the dule tree. The Laird of Auchendrane replied that he would rather rot to death in the worst dungeon than sell the dule tree of Auchendrane.&lt;ref name="Robertson1"&gt;Robertson, William (1908). Ayrshire. Its History and Historic Families. Pub. Dunlop and Drennan. Kilmarnock. Vol.I. P. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paterson"&gt;Paterson, James (1864). ''History of the Counties of Ayrs and Wigton.'' Pub. James Stillie. Edinburgh. Vol.II. P.388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunterston castle near [[West Kilbride]] had a dule known as the 'hanging tree' or 'resting tree'. It was an ash and stood near to the gardens on the line of the old road between [[Fairlie]] and West Kilbride. An oak tree was planted to replace it. A legend of a beautiful lady fairy is also associated with this dule tree.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Dane (2009). ''Legendary Ayrshire. Custom : Folklore : Tradition''. Auchinleck : Carn Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-9518128-6-0}}. p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

Newark Castle near the River Doon in South Ayrshire (old Carrick) had a dule-tree near its grand stair. It was an ash measuring about 15 feet circumference and it had five principal branches.&lt;ref name="Paterson2"&gt;Paterson, James (1864). ''History of the Counties of Ayrs and Wigton.'' Pub. James Stillie. Edinburgh. Vol.II. P. 387 - 388.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evelix Farmhouse [[regality]] Court-House and gallows tree in the parish of [[Dornoch]]. According to the farmer at Evelix the gallows tree stood until recently in a niche in a wall nearby.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"&gt;[http://www.rcahms.gov.uk/ RCAHMS Canmore archaeology site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Victoria Bridge, [[Crathie]] and [[Braemar]] in Aberdeenshire has an old Scots pine tree that stands on the south side of the road leading to Mar Lodge, and to the west of the bridge. This was traditionally the gallows tree for the barony.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"/&gt;

Tushielaw Tower gallows tree, parish of [[Ettrick, Scotland|Ettrick]] in the Scottish borders. The tree was an ash tree in the ruins of Tushielaw Tower on which Adam Scott, the 'King of the Thieves', was hanged on the orders of James V.&lt;ref name="RCAHMS"/&gt;

Lynstock near [[Abernethy, Perth and Kinross]]. An ancient fir still stood in the 20th-century when it was thought to be over 300 years old. At a height of 12 feet from the ground it had a strong projecting bough, and it is said that it was from it that the noose cord or wuddie was hung. There were marks of graves at the foot of the tree, tradition says of two brothers, as stated by the reverend, Grant, and therefore the tree is sometimes called the "tree of the brothers."&lt;ref name="Bailies"&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/cairngorm/16.htm  ''In the Days of the Baron Bailies.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallowshill across the main road from Rossdhu House, home of the chiefs of the [[Clan Colquhoun]], marks the site of their "dule-tree."&lt;ref name="Rossdhu"&gt;[http://www.turningwood.fsnet.co.uk/rossdhuhouse.html Rhossdhu House.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205032742/http://www.turningwood.fsnet.co.uk/rossdhuhouse.html |date=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Nan Croiche (Hill of the Gallows) lies above the village of Dalmally in Glenorchy, Argyll and Bute. A tree still marks the spot and its is recorded that the condemned men sometimes had to carry their own gibbet or gallows up the hill and the hole where the post was placed still exists. A tree on the site was sometimes used. Unusually a hangman's house once stood near the spot.&lt;ref&gt;''Dalmally, Places of Historical Interest.'' Dalmally Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;


== Local history ==
Place names are usually a fairly reliable source of information about past events and activities, as with names such as Gallowayford at Kennox House in [[North Ayrshire]] near [[Chapeltoun]]. It is known that a gallows was situated here; however, it cannot be proved that a dule tree was involved. Law Mount is a common name for small earth mounds, frequently in prominent positions, such as the example near [[Lambroughton]], Stewarton in North Ayrshire. Public hangings took place on these 'laws' or 'moot hills', some of which are or were wooded. Gallows-Knowe in [[Kilmarnock]], [[East Ayrshire]] was the site of the gallows for the baronial court of the Boyds of [[Dean Castle]]. Gallow Law is a hill overlooking Newmilns in East Ayrshire.

==Dule trees in literature==
[[Sir Walter Scott]]'s Waverley novel ''[[Guy Mannering]]'' features a "Justice Tree" at the Castle of Ellangowan. The corpses of murderers were gibbeted and eventually buried at crossroads so that their spirits would be "bound" there. The living took pains to prevent the dead from wandering the land as lost souls – or even as animated corpses, for the belief in [[revenant (folklore)|revenant]]s was widespread in mediæval Europe.

''[[Weir of Hermiston]]'', an unfinished novel by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], makes reference to a dule-tree.

"The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral", a ghost story by [[M.R. James]], tells what became of the wood of a dule tree in the fictional town of Barchester, the tree having been known as 'the Hanging Oak'.

A Scottish ballad, "The Wronged Mason," tells of one Lambert Lamkin who is hanged on the dule-tree of Balwearie Castle in Fife.&lt;ref name="Lamkin"&gt;[http://cfmb.icaap.org/content/36.1/BV36.1art10.pdf The Ballad of the Wronged Mason.]&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Dule Tree" was published in 2004 by Finavon Print in association with the Elphinstone Institute, to mark the end of [[Sheena Blackhall]]'s residency as Creative Writer in Scots at the University of Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="Sheena"&gt;[http://screivins.blogspot.com/2006/05/poems-dule-tree.html The Dule Tree poem by Sheena Blackhall.]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Black Douglas'' (1899) by  [[S. R. Crockett]] (1859–1914) has the line ''and let that wight remember that the Douglas does not keep a dule tree up there by the Gallows Slock for nothing.&lt;ref name="Crockett"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/edwindrood.geo/BDougXAB.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+21:40:10 The Black Douglas by S.R.Crockett.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Girvan]] was the site of the "Hairy Tree." According to legend, the Hairy Tree was planted by [[Sawney Bean]]'s eldest daughter in the town's Dalrymple Street. The daughter was implicated with the rest of the family in their incestuous and cannibalistic activities and was hanged by locals from the bough of the tree she herself planted. According to local legend, one can hear the sound of a swinging corpse while standing beneath its boughs.

The 1844 edition of the ''Ayrshire Wreath'' contains the story of the Dule Tree of Cassillis and its last victims.&lt;ref&gt;Train, Joseph (1844). ''The Dule Tree of Cassillis.'' ''The Ayrshire Wreath MDCCCXLIV.'' Kilmarnock : R. Crawford &amp; Son. pp. 40-46&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emaciation''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˌ|m|eɪ|ʃ|iː|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ən}} or {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˌ|m|eɪ|s|iː|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ən}}) is defined as extreme weight loss and unnatural thinness due to a loss of [[Subcutaneous tissue#Subcutaneous fat|subcutaneous fat]] (the fatty, or [[adipose tissue]] beneath the skin) and muscle throughout the body.&lt;ref name=edef/&gt; It affects human beings and animals; one who is emaciated could be described as "wasting away" or being "gaunt." Emaciation is caused by severe malnourishment and [[starvation]].  Emaciation is a predominant symptom of malnourishment, a basic component of poverty and [[famine]] that also occurs with diseases that interfere with the [[digestive system]] and appetite, other systems, and [[eating disorder]]s.&lt;ref name=bmd/&gt;&lt;ref name=ebb/&gt;&lt;ref name=shr/&gt; These include [[nutrition disorder|nutrient deficiency disorders]], diseases with prolonged fever and infection, [[malignant]] diseases, [[human parasite|parasitic]] infections that can result from contamination, [[anorexia nervosa]] and other conditions. The malnourishment associated with emaciation has been referred to as "[[wikt:inanition|inanition]]", while infection by parasites has been described as "[[wikt:adulteration|adulteration]]".&lt;ref name=ebbp194/&gt; Treatment of emaciation includes gradual renourishment with a slow increase of daily caloric intake to help rebuild tissues and regain weight. Rest, and emotional and psychological therapy and support may be included.&lt;ref name=egh/&gt;

==Characteristics==
In humans, the overall physical appearance of emaciation includes a thinning of the limbs, upper body and buttocks to an almost skeletal-seeming state with an apparent absence of fat and [[muscle tone]]. The skin is thin, dry and translucent in some areas of the body, to the point that veins beneath the skin are somewhat visible. The face is thin and drawn with a hopeless, vacant and distressed demeanor; the eye sockets are sunken, giving the eyes a bulging appearance. The scalp is bony with dry, withering hair that is lacking. On the torso, the [[clavicle|collar bone]], [[sternum|chest bone]] and ribs are quite pronounced; the stomach is bloated, which indicates gastrointestinal distress associated with nutritional depletion. The mouth and tongue may be excessively dry, or moist with the tongue thickly coated; there is usually strong [[halitosis]], or foul breath.&lt;ref name=ebb/&gt;

There is great fatigue, inability and lack of physical effort in the emaciated. Mental efficiency, problem solving and reasoning are somewhat impaired. The emotional state of an emaciated individual is often poor; feelings of depression, hopelessness, fear, anxiety and worthlessness may prevail. A person who is emaciated is usually submissive, both mentally and physically, to the will of others. Behavior is generally passive.&lt;ref name=ebb/&gt;&lt;ref name=egh/&gt;

The underlying starvation, malnourishment, and usually dehydration, associated with emaciation, affect and are harmful to [[organ system]]s throughout the body. The emaciated individual experiences disturbances of the blood, [[circulatory system|circulatory]], and [[urinary system]]s; these include [[hyponatremia]] and/or [[hypokalemia]] (low [[sodium]] and/or [[potassium]] in the blood, respectively), [[anemia]] (low [[hemoglobin]]), improper function of [[lymph]] ([[immune system]]-related [[leukocyte|white blood]] matter) and the [[lymphatic system]], and [[pleurisy]] (fluid in the [[pleural cavity]] surrounding the lungs) and [[edema]] (swelling in general) caused by poor or improper function of the kidneys to eliminate wastes from the blood.&lt;ref name=ebb/&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:Buchenwald survivor.jpg|thumb|An emaciated [[Sh'erit ha-Pletah|holocaust survivor]] drinking from a metal bowl in front of barracks at [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] (April 11, 1945 - June 1945).]]
[[File:Buchenwald-J-Rouard-12.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Buchenwald]] inmates, 16 April 1945 when camp was liberated]]
In most of [[Africa]], poverty, malnutrition and disease are common. Among [[third world country|third world countries]], India is one of the leading countries plagued by malnutrition, with more than 200 million people affected. Emaciation in India is referred to as "shosha roga", which means "exploitative disease".&lt;ref name=shr/&gt; Diseases such as these are [[nutrition disorder|nutrient deficiency disorders]] that can cause varying degrees of emaciation based on the type of nutrient(s) chronically and persistently lacking or absent from the diet of an individual.

Emaciation was also a major cause of death in [[Nazi concentration camps]] during [[World War II]]. It was largely the result of a [[starvation]] diet imposed on the inmates. It became endemic during the last stages of the war when rations were restricted even further. 

Reduced food intake, while hunger is held on to, may also be responsible for significant weight loss. Restrictive diets can lead to significant weight loss, as can psychological problems, depression and social problems and issues; Anorexia nervosa is the psychological disease of a denial of weight loss and thinness while maintaining the same physical activity; Certain digestive diseases or ENT (discomfort food) can induce weight loss. Weight loss can also occur with a normal or even sometimes reduced food intake. An infectious disease that is accompanied by fever, tuberculosis, HIV infection, endocarditis or chronic inflammatory disease with febrile vasculitis, [[Behcet's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Behcet's disease - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/behcets-disease/basics/definition/con-20027549|website = mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; connective, [[Adult-onset Still's disease|Still's disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emaciation Or Underweight|url = http://chestofbooks.com/health/nutrition/Diet-Encyclopedia/Emaciation-Or-Underweight.html#.VZ8vr5NVikp|website = chestofbooks.com|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sarcoidosis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sarcoidosis - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sarcoidosis/basics/definition/con-20022569|website = mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; certain cancers or blood diseases; a chronic disease without fever, cancer, metabolic diseases, respiratory insufficiency, hepatic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hepatic|url = http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=3704|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or digestive diseases associated with signs of deficiency. Some neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Parkinson's disease - Mayo Clinic|url = http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/basics/definition/con-20028488|website = mayoclinic.org|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; may also be the cause of significant weight loss. Poisoning such as chronic alcoholism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = chronic alcoholism|url = http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/chronic+alcoholism|accessdate = 2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; drug addiction or taking drugs by mistake are also common causes. Taking too much medication is a major cause of weight loss in the elderly and weak, if the medication suppresses appetite.

Famine and third world conditions are usually involved. Severe emaciation can be caused by [[marasmus]], a disorder that is seen in children who are deprived of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Both weight and growth are affected. A similar disorder, seen in very young malnourished children, is [[kwashiorkor]]. With emaciation mostly confined to the upper body, kwashiorkor often occurs after a child has been [[weaning|weaned]] and thus deprived of protein it was getting from its mother's milk. Slight emaciation is seen with nutrition disorders such as [[beriberi]], caused by a lack of [[thiamine]] (vitamin B1), and [[pellagra]], caused by insufficient intake of [[niacin]] (vitamin B3). The former is mainly characterized by mental impairment, and the latter is more serious, often leading to death.&lt;ref name="shr" /&gt;

Other diseases and disorders associated with emaciation include [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], [[tuberculosis]] and other infectious diseases with prolonged fever, [[human parasite|parasitic infections]], many forms of [[cancer]] and their [[chemotherapy|treatments]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[eating disorder]]s like [[anorexia nervosa]].&lt;ref name=ebb/&gt;&lt;ref name=shr/&gt;&lt;ref name=egh/&gt;

==Treatment==
Other than treating, curing or remedying the underlying cause of emaciation, it as a symptom is treated by regaining the weight and restoring the tissues. This is done through renourishment, or reintroducing nourishing liquids and foods to the body while increasing the intake of food energy. The process, usually begun in an individual deprived of food for a period of time, must be done slowly to avoid complications such as [[regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitation]] and [[vomiting]]. It begins with spoonfuls of water and salted broth, advancing to increased amounts of clear liquids including broth, [[tea]] and fruit juices. This soon is advanced to full liquid diet such as milk (if no [[lactose intolerance]] is present) and cream-based soups. Once solid food is introduced, an emaciated individual is usually given up to eight small meals per day, at two-hour intervals. Meals may consist of a small milkshake to minor portions of meat with a starchy side item. For the purposes of weight gain and tissue rebuilding, the diet will be focused on proteins, fats and carbohydrates that are rich in vitamins and minerals, and relatively high in energy. Oily foods and high-fiber foods like grains and certain vegetables are discouraged because they are difficult to digest, and filling while lower in energy. Treatment of emaciation also includes much [[sleep]], rest and relaxation, and counseling.&lt;ref name=ebb/&gt;&lt;ref name=egh/&gt;

==In animals==
[[File:Gong Kai, Emaciated Horse.jpg|thumb|Illustration of an emaciated horse, by Chinese artist [[Gong Kai]]]]

The appearance and effects of emaciation in animals, both wild and domestic, is like that of humans&amp;ndash;severe thinness, loss of fat and muscle, extremely pronounced and protruding bones, and weakness. Starvation and regularly dehydration, brought on by neglect and cruelty from humans, or as a result of illness are the usual causes of emaciation in domestic animals like dogs, cats and horses; in wild animals, starvation with emaciation is caused by unavailable sources of food, loss or changes of habitat, or neglect in captivity. The rehabilitation of emaciated animals, through treating their starvation and dehydration with slow renourishment, can be challenging. The unique and specific physiological and dietary needs of animals, be they [[mammal]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[carnivore]]s, [[herbivore]]s, etc. are carefully considered to avoid causing harm.&lt;ref name=eneg/&gt;&lt;ref name=erep/&gt;

'''Enterprise cognitive systems''' ('''ECS''') are part of a broader shift in computing, from a programmatic to a probabilistic approach, called [[cognitive computing]]. An Enterprise Cognitive System makes a new class of complex [[decision support]] problems computable, where the business context is ambiguous, multi-faceted, and fast-evolving, and what to do in such a situation is usually assessed today by the business user. An ECS is designed to synthesize a business context and link it to the desired outcome. It recommends evidence-based actions to help the [[end-user]] achieve the desired outcome. It does so by finding past situations similar to the current situation, and extracting the repeated actions that best influence the desired outcome.

While general-purpose cognitive systems can be used for different outputs, prescriptive, suggestive, instructive, or simply entertaining, an enterprise cognitive system is focused on action, not insight, to help in assessing what to do in a complex situation.

==Key characteristics==
ECS have to be:
# '''Adaptive''': They must learn as information changes, and as goals and [[requirement]]s evolve. They must resolve [[ambiguity]] and tolerate unpredictability. They must be engineered to feed on dynamic data in [[Real-time (computing)|real time]], or near real time. In the Enterprise, near-real time learning from data requires an agile information federation approach to ingest incremental data updates as they occur, and an unsupervised learning approach to ensure that new best practice is leveraged across the organization in a timely manner. 
# '''Interactive''': They must interact easily with users so that those users can define their needs comfortably. They may also interact with other processors, devices, and Cloud services, as well as with people. In the Enterprise, interactions are controlled via existing workflows and UIs. Therefore, embedding best practices directly into these existing interfaces, in the context of a specific step, is critical to ensure maximum end-user adoption. 
# '''Iterative and [[stateful]]''': They must aid in defining a problem by asking questions or finding additional source input if a problem statement is ambiguous or incomplete. They must “remember” previous interactions in a process and return information that is suitable for the specific application at that point in time. In the Enterprise, business context is often structured by a [[business process]], and therefore sufficiently data-rich to make relevant recommendations without significant iterations from the end-user. A stateful memory of overall interactions across communication channels is critical for understanding of context, as a static profile will not capture intent and outcome potential the way behavior does. 
# '''Contextual''': They must understand, identify, and extract contextual elements such as meaning, syntax, time, location, appropriate [[knowledge domain|domain]], regulations, [[user profile|user’s profile]], process, task and goal. They may draw on multiple sources of information, including both structured and [[unstructured information|unstructured digital information]], as well as sensory inputs (visual, gestural, auditory, or sensor-provided). In the Enterprise, Context is fragmented and must be aggregated across [[data type]]s, sources, and locations. In most business environments, such data is captured in existing [[enterprise information system]]s, and the effort is linked to quickly source and unify such information. It is rare to have to directly process sensor, audio or visual data in real-time as direct input into the enterprise cognitive system. Instead, these data types are captured by Enterprise Applications and pre-processed into a binary or [[Formatted text|text format]] prior to consumption by the System.

The genus '''''Epiophlebia''''' is the sole member of the family '''Epiophlebiidae''', which is itself the sole living representative of the [[Epiprocta]]n infraorder [[Epiophlebioptera]], and it contains only four species. The first two species were historically placed in their own suborder '''Anisozygoptera''', considered intermediate between [[dragonflies]] and [[damselflies]], mainly because the hind wings are very similar in size and shape to the forewings and held back over the body at rest, as in damselflies. It has more recently been recognized that the genus ''Epiophlebia'' shares a more recent ancestor with dragonflies (having become separated from these in and around the uplifting of the Himalayas&lt;ref name=rim&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tillyard R J |year=1921| title=On an Anisozygopterous Larva from the Himalayas (Order Odonata)|pages= 93–107|volume=22|issue= 2|journal= Records of the Indian Museum|url=https://archive.org/stream/recordsofindianm22indi#page/93/mode/1up/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fbi&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/FraserOdonata2/odonata2#page/n174/mode/1up/search/Epiophlebia|page=151|title=Fauna of British India.

'''Hans Paul Bernhard Gierke''' (19 August 1847 – 8 May 1886) was a German anatomist who was a native of [[Stettin]].

==Biography==
Gierke studied medicine in Berlin, Vienna, Leipzig, Würzburg, Breslau and Munich, graduating in Würzburg, where he obtained his doctorate in 1872. In 1874 he became [[prosector]] at Würzburg, where his teacher was [[Albert von Kölliker]]. In 1876 he was appointed professor of anatomy at the [[Imperial University of Tokyo]]. For health reasons he had to give up his academic career and return to Germany. In 1881 he became an assistant in the Physiological Institute in Breslau and in 1882 attained the title of professor extraordinarius. In 1883 he visited the [[Stazione Zoologica|Zoological Station in Naples]]. His health deteriorated rapidly. Soon, he died in the psychiatric hospital in [[Schöneberg]] near [[Berlin]], at the age of 39.&lt;ref&gt;Nekrolog. Deutsche Kolonialzeitung 3, s. 338 (1886)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He is best remembered for his research on staining methods in neurohistology and the localization of the [[respiratory center]]. The [[solitary tract]] in the [[brain stem]] is sometimes called the "[[Gierke respiratory bundle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Susan L. Bartolucci, Thomas Lathrop Stedman, Pat Forbis: Stedman's medical eponyms.

[[File:Fractal Art Swirl.JPG|thumb|A [[fractal]] is close to the idea of ''holon'', as it is a part that represents a whole at the same time.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Do seeds contain trees or do trees contain seeds?

A '''holon''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ὅλον, ''holon'' neuter form of ὅλος, ''holos'' "whole") is something that is simultaneously a whole and a part. The word was used by [[Arthur Koestler]] in his book ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]'' (1967, p. 48) and the phrase ''to hólon'' is a greek translation from the latin word ''universum'', in the sense of ''totality, a whole''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gómez de Silva |first1=Guido |title=Breve diccionario etimológico de la lengua española |date=1993 |publisher=Colegio de México |location=México |isbn=9681628128 |page=703 |edition=2a |accessdate=1 December 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Koestler was influenced by two observations in proposing the notion of the holon. The first observation was influenced by [[Herbert A. Simon]]'s [[parable]] of the two watchmakers—in which Simon concludes that complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly when there are stable intermediate forms present in the evolutionary process than if they are not present.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Herbert A. (1969). The Sciences of the Artificial. Boston: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second observation was made by Koestler himself in his analysis of hierarchies and stable intermediate forms in non-living matter (atomic and molecular structure), living organisms, and social organizations. He concluded that, although it is easy to identify sub-wholes or parts, wholes and parts in an absolute sense do not exist anywhere. Koestler proposed the word holon to describe the hybrid nature of sub-wholes and parts within in vivo systems. From this perspective, holons exist simultaneously as self-contained wholes in relation to their sub-ordinate parts, and as dependent parts when considered from the inverse direction. 

Koestler also says that holons are self-reliant units that possess a degree of independence and can handle contingencies without asking higher authorities for instructions. I.e. they have a degree of autonomy. These holons are also simultaneously subject to control from one or more of these higher authorities. The first property ensures that holons are stable forms that are able to withstand disturbances, while the latter property signifies that they are intermediate forms, providing a context for the proper functionality for the larger whole. 

Finally, Koestler defines a holarchy as a hierarchy of self-regulating holons that function first as autonomous wholes in supra-ordination to their parts, secondly as dependent parts in sub-ordination to controls on higher levels, and thirdly in coordination with their local environment.

==General definition==
A '''holon''' is a [[system]] (or [[phenomenon]]) that is an [[evolution|evolving]] [[autopoesis|self-organizing]] [[dissipative structure|dissipative]]{{Citation_needed|date=June 2017}} [[structure]], composed of other holons, whose structures exist at a balance point between [[wikt:chaos|chaos]] and order. It is sometimes discussed in the context of '''self-organizing holarchic open systems''' (or, '''SOHO''' systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Application of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and Le Chatelier's Principle to the Developing Ecosystem|quote= ''As systems move away from equilibrium, they use all available avenues to counter the applied gradients ''... Le Chatelier's principle is an example of this equilibrium seeking principle. |origyear= 1999 |first= J. J.|last= Kay  |title= Handbook of Ecosystem Theories and Management |series= Environmental &amp; Ecological (Math) Modeling |editor1-first= F. |editor1-last= Muller |publisher= CRC Press |date=February 2000 |isbn= 978-1-56670-253-9 }}&lt;br/&gt;'''''For full details, see''''': {{cite paper | citeseerx = 10.1.1.11.856 | title = Ecosystems as Self-organizing Holarchic Open Systems: Narratives and the Second Law of Thermodynamics | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A holon is maintained by the throughput of [[matter]]–[[energy]] and [[information]]–[[entropy]] connected to other holons and is simultaneously a whole in itself and at the same time is nested within another holon and so is a part of something much larger than itself.  Holons range in size from the smallest [[subatomic particles]] and [[string theory|strings]], all the way up to the [[multiverse]], comprising many [[universes]].  Individual [[human]]s, their [[society|societies]] and their [[culture]]s are intermediate level holons, created by the interaction of forces working upon us both [[:wikt:top-down|top-down]] and [[:wikt:bottom-up|bottom-up]]. On a non-physical level, words, ideas, sounds, emotions—everything that can be identified—is simultaneously part of something, and can be viewed as having parts of its own, similar to [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] in regard of [[semiotic]]s. In 2013 Australian academic JT Velikovsky proposed the holon as the structure of the meme, the unit of culture,&lt;ref name="StoryAlity"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holonic Structure of the Meme - The Unit of Culture|url=http://storyality.wordpress.com/2013/12/12/storyality-100-the-holonic-structure-of-the-meme-the-unit-of-culture/|work=StoryAlity academic weblog, JT Velikovsky|accessdate=2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; synthesizing the major theories on memes of [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]], [[E. O. Wilson]], [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]] and [[Arthur Koestler]].  Defined in this way, holons are related to the concept of [[autopoiesis]], especially as it was developed in the application of [[Stafford Beer]] to [[second-order cybernetics]] and the [[viable system model]], but also [[Niklas Luhmann]] in his social [[systems theory]].

Since a holon is embedded in larger wholes, it is influenced by and influences these larger wholes. And since a holon also contains subsystems, or parts, it is similarly influenced by and influences these parts. Information flows bidirectionally between smaller and larger systems as well as rhizomatic [[Infectious disease|contagion]]. When this bidirectionality of [[information flow (information theory)|information flow]] and understanding of role is compromised, for whatever reason, the system begins to break down: wholes no longer recognize their dependence on their [[subsidiary]] parts, and parts no longer recognize the organizing authority of the wholes. [[Cancer]] may be understood as such a breakdown in the biological [[realm]].

A [[hierarchy]] of holons is called a [[holarchy]]. The holarchic model can be seen as an attempt to modify and modernise perceptions of natural hierarchy.

[[Ken Wilber]] comments that the test of holon hierarchy (''holarchy'') is that if all instances of a given type of holon cease to exist, then all the holons they were part of must cease to exist too. Thus an atom is of a lower standing in the hierarchy than a molecule, because if you removed all molecules, atoms could still exist, whereas if you removed all atoms, molecules, in a strict sense would cease to exist. Wilber's concept is known as the doctrine of the '''fundamental''' and the '''significant'''. A hydrogen atom is more fundamental than an ant, but an ant is more significant.

The doctrine of the fundamental and the significant is contrasted by the [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]] oriented [[pragmatism|pragmatics]] of [[Deleuze]] and [[Guattari]], and other [[continental philosophy]].

A significant feature of Koestler's concept of holarchy is that it is open ended both in the macrocosmic as well as in the microcosmic dimensions. This aspect of his theory has several important implications. For example, if we take string theory to be legitimate, the holarchic system does not begin with strings or end with the multiverse. Those are just the present limits of the reach of the human mind in the two dimensions. Humans will cross those limits eventually, because they do not encompass the whole of reality. Karl Popper (''Objective Knowledge'', 1972) teaches that what the human mind knows and can ever know of truth at a given point of time and space is verisimilitude—something like truth—and that the human mind will continue to get closer to reality but never reach it. In other words, the human quest for knowledge is an unending journey with innumerable  grand sights ahead but with no possibility of reaching the journey's end. The work of modern physicists designed to discover the theory of everything (TOE) is reaching deep into the microcosm under the assumption that the macrocosm is eventually made of the  microcosm. This approach falls short on two counts: the first is that the fundamental is not the same as significant and the second is that this approach does not take into account that the microcosmic dimension is open ended. It follows that the search for TOE will discover phenomena more microcosmic than strings or the more comprehensive M theory. It is also the case that  many laws of nature that apply to systems relatively low in the hierarchy cease to apply at higher levels. M theory might have predictive power at the sub-atomic level but it will inform but little about reality at higher levels. The work of the particle physicists is indeed laudable but possibly they should give the theory they are looking for another name. This is not to claim that the concept of holarchy is already the theory of everything.{{Citation needed|date = August 2015|reason = how much of this para is from Popper and how much unsourced editorial musing?}}

==Types==
===Individual holon===
An individual holon possesses a dominant monad; that is, it possesses a definable "I-ness". An individual holon is discrete, self-contained, and also demonstrates the quality of agency, or self-directed behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, K. (2007). The integral vision. Shambhala Publications: Boston&lt;/ref&gt; The individual holon, although a discrete and self-contained whole, is made up of parts; in the case of a human, examples of these parts would include the heart, lungs, liver, brain, spleen, etc. When a human exercises agency, taking a step to the left, for example, the entire holon, including the constituent parts, moves together as one unit.

===Social holon===
A social holon does not possess a dominant monad; it possesses only a definable "we-ness", as it is a collective made up of individual holons.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. (1995). Social systems. Stanford University Press: California&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, rather than possessing discrete agency, a social holon possesses what is defined as nexus agency. An illustration of nexus agency is best described by a flock of geese. Each goose is an individual holon, the flock makes up a social holon. Although the flock moves as one unit when flying, and it is "directed" by the choices of the lead goose, the flock itself is not mandated to follow that lead goose. Another way to consider this would be collective activity that has the potential for independent internal activity at any given moment.

===Artifacts===
American philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] includes Artifacts in his theory of holons. Artifacts are anything (e.g. a statue or a piece of music) that is created by either an individual holon or a social holon. While lacking any of the defining structural characteristics - agency; self-maintenance; I-ness; Self Transcendence - of the previous two holons, Artifacts are useful to include in a comprehensive scheme due to their potential to replicate aspects of and profoundly affect (via, say interpretation) the previously described holons. Artifacts are made up of individual or social holons (e.g. a statue is made up of atoms).

The development of [[Artificial Intelligence]] may force one to question where the line should be drawn between the individual holon and the artifact.

===Heaps===
Heaps are defined as random collections of holons that lack any sort of organisational significance. A pile of leaves would be an example of a heap. Note, one could question whether a pile of leaves could be an "artifact" of an ecosystem "social holon". This raises a problem of intentionality: in short, if social holons create artifacts but lack intentionality (the domain of individual holons) how can we distinguish between heaps and artifacts? Further, if an artist (individual holon) paints a picture (artifact) in a deliberately chaotic and unstructured way does it become a heap?

== In multiagent systems ==

[[Multiagent system]]s are systems composed of autonomous software entities. They are able to simulate a system or solve problems. A holon, just like an agent, is an intelligent entity able to interact with the environment and to make decisions to solve a specific problem. A Holon has the noteworthy property of playing the role of a whole and a part at the same time. This reflects at the organizational level: Holarchy functions first as autonomous wholes in supra-ordination to their parts, secondly as dependent parts in sub-ordination to controls on higher levels, and thirdly in coordination with their local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Calabrese, M. |year=2011 |url=http://air.unimi.it/bitstream/2434/155499/2/phd_unimi_R07647.pdf |title=Hierarchical-Granularity Holonic Modelling |work=Doctoral Thesis |publisher=University of Milan, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[SARL language|SARL]] agent-oriented programming language is a language with native support for the concept of holon. The associated run-time environment [http://www.janusproject.io Janus] enables running the implemented holons.

'''John Granville Cornwallis Eliot, 6th Earl of St Germans''', [[Military Cross|MC]] was born on 11 June 1890 at 13 [[Grosvenor Gardens, London|Grosvenor Gardens]], London to [[Henry Eliot, 5th Earl of St Germans|Henry Cornwallis Eliot, 5th Earl of St Germans]] (11 February 1835 – 24 September 1911) and his wife Emily Harriett Labouchere (24 June 1844 – 18 October 1933).

He was educated at a college in St Peter Intra, [[Broadstairs]], [[Kent]] and at the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst]]. He subsequently became a Captain in the 2nd Dragoons of the [[Scots Greys]], and fought in the [[World War I|First World War]], being awarded the Military Cross.

==Family==
He married Lady '''[[Blanche Scott Douglas|Blanche Linnie Somerset]]''' (15 April 1897 – 30 August 1968), the eldest daughter of the [[Henry Adelbert Wellington Fitzroy Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort|9th Duke of Beaufort]], on 11 June 1918 in London and they had two daughters:
#Lady '''Rosemary Alexandra Eliot''' (26 February 1919 – 20 April 1963) who was thrice married; firstly 2 September 1939 Edward Christian Frederick Nutting (9 Sep 1917-k.a.Middle East Jan 1943), by whom she had one daughter Davina (1940–1976); m.2nd 24 Feb 1945 (annulled 1949) David Frederick Hew Dunn (b. 1917); m.3rd 22 Dec 1949 Ralph Alexander Rubens (died 1995) by whom she had one daughter Alexandra (b. 1950). Her elder daughter died in a car crash with her son, leaving issue one daughter Frederica Samantha Mary Cope, now Mrs David Arthur Thomas (born 1963).  Her younger daughter is now Mrs Alexandra Peyronel.  Both women, co-heiresses to one-half each of the [[Baron Botetourt|barony of Botetourt]] have issue.&lt;ref&gt;Theroff (2007). [http://www.angelfire.com/realm/gotha/Part_h11.htm "Descendants of Henry VII" - Part 11] include the 6th Earl and his offspring. This list was last updated in September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''[[Lady Cathleen Hudson|Lady Cathleen Blanche Lily Eliot]]''' (29 July 1921 - 1994); her elder son is [[David Seyfried Herbert, 19th Baron Herbert]] (born 1952). He has descendants.

John died on 22 March 1922 from the effects of an accident sustained during a [[Point to point (steeplechase)|point-to-point]] race at Wrangton nr [[Totnes]], [[Devon]]. As the youngest son with no sons to inherit, his title passed to his first cousin [[Granville Eliot, 7th Earl of St Germans|Granville John Eliot, 7th Earl of St Germans]] (22 September 1867 – 20 November 1942).

'''John Calvin Fleming Jr.''' (born July 5, 1951) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]], [[physician]], [[military veteran]], and [[business]]man who was appointed in March 2017, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Information Technology Reform in the [[Donald Trump]] administration.&lt;ref name=tohhs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-herald.com/former-rep-john-fleming-to-join-hhs-under-trump/|title=Former Rep.

From January 3, 2009, to January 3, 2017, Fleming was the representative for [[Louisiana's 4th congressional district]]. He resides in the city of [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in [[Webster Parish, Louisiana|Webster Parish]] in northwestern [[Louisiana]]. A second cousin (five generations removed) to the former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Henry Clay]] of [[Kentucky]], Fleming is a member of [[Sons of the American Revolution]] and [[Jamestowne Society]]. He is only the second Republican to hold his House seat since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the first was his predecessor, [[Jim McCrery]].
 		 	
The former congressman said that he "plans to advocate policies that would encourage physicians to use technology in their medical practice. He hopes to remove barriers to [[data]] transfer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amdt|first1=Rachel|title=Former Louisiana Rep.

==Early life, education and family==
Fleming was born in [[Meridian, Mississippi|Meridian]] in [[Lauderdale County, Mississippi|Lauderdale County]] in eastern [[Mississippi]]. He was reared in a working class home. While he was still young, his mother became disabled and could no longer work. Just prior to Fleming's high school graduation, Fleming's father died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. This forced him to finance his education with odd jobs and loans.&lt;ref name="houmatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sentell|first1=Will|title=Candidate profile: U.S. Senate candidate John Fleming of Louisiana|url=http://www.houmatoday.com/elections/20161019/candidate-profile-us-senate-candidate-john-fleming-of-louisiana|website=houmatoday.com|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming attended the [[University of Mississippi]] at [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he was a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta Fraternity]]. He graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in 1973. He later attended medical school at the [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] campus of the same university, earning an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rep.

Subsequently, Fleming stayed in the Navy another three years, serving until 1982 when he moved his family to and set up a private family medicine practice in [[Minden, Louisiana]]. He has served as a deacon, Sunday school teacher, and Sunday school department director at First Baptist of Minden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rep.

The couple has four children.&lt;ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627/&gt;

==Medical career==
Fleming was chief resident in [[family medicine]] at the Naval Regional Medical Center in [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]], California. He also trained at the drug and alcohol treatment unit at the Navy Regional Medical Center in [[Long Beach, California]].&lt;ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=November 22, 2008|url=http://www.meridianstar.com/local/local_story_178002646.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128161504/http://www.meridianstar.com/local/local_story_178002646.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 28, 2013|date=June 27, 2007|title=Meridian native named Family Doctor of Year|first=Ida |last=Brown |work=The Meridian Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serving in the Navy after his residency, Fleming practiced family medicine on the island of [[Guam]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', November 18, 1982, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; From 1979 to 1981, he was the director of drug and alcohol treatment and chairman of the Navy Family Advocacy Committee. He subsequently performed similar duties in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627/&gt;

After leaving the Navy, Fleming established a practice in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in August 1982. His first clinic was on Pearl Street across from the [[United States Post Office]]. He chose Minden for his city of residence because, in his words, it "has small-town charm, warm essence of life, long, lazy summer days with watermelon cuts and family reunions."&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press-Herald'', August 10, 1982, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; To attract patients to his new practice, Fleming announced evening and Saturday morning hours to accommodate working people and students.&lt;ref&gt;''Minden Press-Herald'', September 2, 1982, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming is [[board certified]] by the [[American Board of Family Medicine]]&lt;ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627/&gt; He joined the staff of the Minden Medical Center.&lt;ref name=MindenHospital_Staff&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 23, 2008|url=http://www.mindenmedicalcenter.com/news/?page_id=18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302135059/http://www.mindenmedicalcenter.com/news/?page_id=18|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 2, 2009|title=Physicians |publisher=Minden Medical Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming is also a member of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP) and the Louisiana Academy of Family Physicians (LAFP). In 2007, he was chosen as the LAFP "Louisiana Family Practice Physician of the Year."&lt;ref name="MeridianStar_Brown_20070627"/&gt;

Fleming previously worked with chemically dependent persons through the program called "New Beginnings" at the Minden Medical Center.&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Fleming will help chemical dependents", ''Minden Press-Herald'', October 18, 1987, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'' revealed Dr. Fleming's call "to end violence and drug addiction. I link these two together because I believe most of the violence we see is caused by addiction to, or buying and selling of drugs."&lt;ref&gt;Fannie Moore, "Citizens list top priorities for 1994", ''Minden Press-Herald'', January 6, 1994, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Fleming wrote ''Preventing Addiction: What Parents Must Know to Immunize Their Kids Against Drug And Alcohol Addiction.'' In the book, Fleming argues that alcohol, among other addicting substances, can serve as a gateway for broader and more problematic drug use, and that the immature brain development of children make them vulnerable to drug addiction later in life. Therefore, delaying the use of alcohol and other addicting substances until later adolescence or adulthood can sharply reduce the risk of later addiction according to scientific studies initiated by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] and others.&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;Fleming, John C.

====2008====
Fleming entered the race for the District 4 House seat after the 21-year Republican incumbent Jim McCrery announced his retirement from the House.

Fleming was unopposed by a Democratic candidate in his 2012 re-election bid in his district that is 2 to 1 Democratic registration but had a Cook PVI of R +11.

====2014====
On April 4, 2013, Fleming announced that he would not in 2014 seek the [[United States Senate]] held since 1997 by the Democratic [[Mary Landrieu]]. Instead his colleague, U.S. Representative [[Bill Cassidy]] of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], had announced on April 3 that he would challenge Landrieu.

Vitter lost the gubernatorial runoff election on November 21, 2015, to the Democrat [[John Bel Edwards]].

===Legislation authored===

====Federal Duck Stamp====
Fleming served on the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|Committee on Natural Resources]] and chaired the [[United States House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs|Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans and Insular Affairs]]. As such he introduced legislation to raise the price of the [[Federal Duck Stamp]] by $10 to $25, bringing the stamp in line with inflation as an increase had not occurred for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Masson|first1=Todd|title=House passes bill to jack up price of duck stamp|url=http://www.nola.com/outdoors/index.ssf/2014/11/house_passes_bill_to_jack_up_p.html |accessdate=May 22, 2017|agency=The Times-Picayune|date=November 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the legislation was to preserve habitat in critical migratory waterfowl flyways to allow duck populations to grow. The legislation was supported by hunting groups, including [[Ducks Unlimited]], the [[National Rifle Association]], and the [[Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Before the House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans, and Insular Affairs Concerning: H.R. 5069, The Federal Duck Stamp Act of 2014|url=http://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/schmidttestimony7-23-14.pdf|website=Congress.gov|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fleming Duck Stamp bill passed the House and Senate by voice vote and was signed into law by [[President Obama]] on December 18, 2014, as it had broad bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.5069 - Federal Duck Stamp Act of 2014|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5069/actions|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunters and conservationists liked it as it generated more revenue to preserve habitat for waterfowl.

====Conscience Protection Act of 2016====
On March 22, 2016, Fleming introduced the Conscience Protection Act of 2016 which "amends the Public Health Service Act to codify the prohibition against the federal government and state and local governments that receive federal financial assistance for health-related activities penalizing or discriminating against a health care provider based on the provider's refusal to be involved in, or provide coverage for, abortion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Conscience Protection Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4828|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If enacted it would give access to courts (heretofore unavailable) by healthcare providers who feel they have been discriminated against because of their refusal (based on conscience) to provide abortion services.

====The Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA)====
By federal law, federal funding is required to be withheld from states who do not enforce the Weldon Amendment that prevents discrimination against healthcare providers if they refuse to provide abortion services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/conscience-protections/factsheet/index.html|website=HHS.GOV |title=Overview of Federal Statutory Health Care Provider Conscience Protections |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, California began enforcing a 1975 state law requiring all insurance companies to charge and cover all [[subscribers]] for abortion services, even if they object based on [[religious]] or [[conscience]] beliefs.

====Seniors' Tax Simplification Act of 2015====
With each congressional session, Fleming introduced this bill designed to improve convenience and lower tax-filing costs to seniors. Though a senior's income may be limited to only [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, the [[IRS]] requires all [[senior citizens]] to use the long [[form 1040]] to file taxes. This act was designed to reduce the senior taxpayer filing to one simple page saving time, complexity and cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.1397 - Seniors' Tax Simplification Act of 2015|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1397|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ATR Supports Tax Simplification for Seniors|url=https://www.atr.org/atr-supports-tax-simplification-seniors|website=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====H. Res. 615 of 2009====
During the debate over healthcare reform in Congress in 2009, Congressman Fleming recognized that members of Congress were likely to be exempted from the mandates and higher premiums expected from the [[Affordable Care Act]], also known as [[Obamacare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Overwhelming Evidence That Obamacare Caused Premiums To Increase Substantially|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/07/28/overwhelming-evidence-that-obamacare-caused-premiums-to-increase-substantially/#5bc6d0ab15be|accessdate=June 2, 2017|date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 13, 2009, he introduced H. Res. 615, "expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that members who vote in favor of the establishment of a public, federal government-run health insurance option are urged to forgo their right to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and agree to enroll under that public option."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.Res.615|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-resolution/615|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution created a public outcry, after an interview of Fleming by Fox News' Meghan Kelly, demanding that members of Congress should also be subject to [[Obamacare]]. Consequently, language was placed in the [[Affordable Care Act]] requiring members of Congress and their staff to leave the more affordable [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] with much lower premiums and deductibles, and obtain healthcare insurance through the [[DC Health Link|DC Exchange]], a product of the [[Affordable Care Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What Happens To A Congressman's Health Insurance If Obamacare Goes Down?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/12/523335954/what-happens-to-a-congressmans-health-insurance-if-obamacare-goes-down|accessdate=June 2, 2017|agency=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Livingston |first1=Shelby|title=Insurance premiums have doubled since 2013, but policies are more generous |url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170524/NEWS/170529951|accessdate=June 2, 2017 |date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Meghan|title=Congressman Fleming Discusses H Res 615 with Meghan Kelly on Fox News|agency=Fox News|date=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Health Care Reform Act of 2013====
The [[Affordable Care Act]] ([[Obamacare]]) was signed into law in 2010. Dr. Fleming was vociferously opposed to, and voted against the health care law. He and his House Republican colleagues voted at full strength over fifty times to repeal the unpopular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Americans Disapprove Than Approve of Health Care Law|url=http://www.people-press.org/2016/04/27/more-americans-disapprove-than-approve-of-health-care-law/|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; law prior to 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berenson |first1=Tessa|title=Reminder: The House Voted to Repeal Obamacare More Than 50 Times prior to 2017.|url=http://time.com/4712725/ahca-house-repeal-votes-obamacare/|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the over eighteen new taxes, mandates on employers and individuals, and the newly mandated set of [[essential health benefits]]; Fleming emphasized how [[Obamacare]] would damage the economy and reduce access to affordable healthcare for many and fail to provide promised coverage for more Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Full List of Obamacare Tax Hikes|url=https://www.atr.org/grover-norquist-educates-science-guy-bill-nye-about-real-costs-paris-climate-deal|website=ATR|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1310/27/sotu.01.html|website=cnn.com |title=State of the Union with Candy Crowley |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also called [[Obamacare]] "the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed by Congress." When asked about fixing the healthcare law instead of repealing it, he said it was "not fixable or repairable."&lt;ref name="Alpert"&gt;Bruce Alpert, [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/10/rep_fleming_gets_attention_for.html Rep. Fleming gets attention for calling Obamacare 'most dangerous law ever passed by Congress'], ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' (October 28, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; He believed, instead, in a market-based healthcare system through which competition can reduce costs and waste, and improve quality and effectiveness of the nation's healthcare system.&lt;ref name="National Journal"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/republican-alternative-to-obamacare-relies-on-repeal-20130922|title=Republican Alternative to Obamacare Relies on Repeal|work=National Journal|date=September 22, 2013 |accessdate=November 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donachie|first1=Robert|title=Ezekiel Emanuel: Obamacare 'Absolutely' Needs To Be Fixed|url=http://dailycaller.com/2017/06/05/ezekiel-emanuel-obamacare-absolutely-needs-to-be-fixed-watch/|accessdate=June 6, 2017|agency=The Daily Caller|date=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, Congressman Fleming helped write, cosponsored and introduced the [[Republican Study Committee]]'s [[American Health Care Reform Act of 2013]] and again in 2015, which would repeal the soon-to-be-implemented [[Affordable Care Act]]. Instead of raising taxes, adding mandates and creating massive amounts of regulations to the healthcare system, the [[American Health Care Reform Act of 2013]] was designed to increase competition among providers by taking down state line barriers for health insurance, creating price transparency, tax equity between individual and employer plans, and liberalizing [[health savings account]]s. It would create large [[purchasing cooperative|buying co-ops]] for small businesses, and form strong [[risk pool|high risk pools]] among other mechanisms to deal with [[Pre-existing condition|pre-existing illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R.3121 - American Health Care Reform Act of 2013|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3121|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Affordable Care Act|ACA]] sharply restricted the use of [[health savings account]]s, though they had been popular since their inception in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ramthun|first1=Roy|title=Why Is Obamacare Regulating Health Savings Accounts Out of Existence? |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433639/health-savings-accounts-obamacare-affordable-care-act-killing-hsa|accessdate=June 2, 2017|date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)|url=http://www.afcm.org/hsahistory.html|website=Americans for Free Choice in Medicine|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Congressman Fleming introduced Helping Save Americans' Health Care Choices Act, an expansion of [[health savings account]]s in healthcare policy. [[Health savings account]]s function to allow pre-taxed savings to be used to bridge the cost of deductible and co-payment gaps in healthcare purchasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is an HSA |url=http://www.hsacenter.com/what-is-an-hsa/|website=hsacenter.com|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of it was incorporated into the [[American Health Care Reform Act of 2013]]. It was introduced again in 2015 by the title of HSA Health Care Choices Act of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helping Save Americans' Health Care Choices Act of 2015|url=https://projects.propublica.org/represent/bills/114/hr3006|website=ProPublica |accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tax cuts and increases ====
The [[Bush tax cuts]] enacted in 2001 and 2003 could not be made permanent because they were passed under [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|Budget Reconciliation]]. They expired in 2010 but were renewed temporarily for two years through the bipartisan compromise [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]. This led to the eventual passage of the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|President Obama's Proposed Plan to Increase Taxes]] which kept taxes low on lower income earners but raised taxes above the [[Bush Tax Cuts]] rate on [[small businesses]] and higher earners. Congressman Fleming was outspoken on the subject supporting tax cuts for all Americans. He agreed with many economists who said tax increases would damage the economy and jobs, and that federal taxes and spending should be cut to achieve a faster American [[economic growth]] rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effects of Income Tax Changes on Economic Growth MORE|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/effects-of-income-tax-changes-on-economic-growth/|website=Brookings.edu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club for Growth PAC Congratulates Rep.

In a September 19, 2011, interview on [[MSNBC]] in which Fleming was critical of President Obama's proposed plan to increase taxes, he was questioned about the reported $6.3 million of gross [[revenues]] his private restaurant company received the previous year. Fleming responded to host [[Chris Jansing]] by saying, "that's before you pay 500 employees, you pay rent, you pay equipment, and food" [[Overhead (business)|(business overhead)]]; "the actual net income was a mere fraction of that...It is more like $600,000 of that $6.3 million...So by the time I feed my family I have, maybe $400,000 left over to invest in new locations, upgrade my locations, buy more equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Seitz-Wald|first1=Alex|title=Multi-Millionaire Rep.

You know in this country, most people feel that being successful in their business is a virtue, not a vice, and once we begin to identify it as a vice, this country is going down."&lt;ref name="alpert"&gt;Alpert, Bruce.

Fleming's remarks were widely reported and resulted in considerable commentary. Bruce Alpert, of Louisiana newspaper ''[[The Times-Picayune]],'' reported that "on liberal blogs, Fleming was portrayed as insensitive to millions of working Americans who are struggling to meet expenses in the face of high unemployment and stagnant wages."&lt;ref name="alpert"/&gt; Conservative sources including [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and the [[Drudge Report]] defended Fleming's remarks. Josh Beavers, publisher of the ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'' in Fleming's hometown, wrote an editorial which stated, "[Fleming's] sentiment was only that the more taxes he pays the fewer people he can employ.

===Activities in Congress led by Fleming===

====Co-founder of the [[Freedom Caucus|House Freedom Caucus]]====
Fleming, and his fellow [[congressional]] Republicans, began the [[111th Congress]] in 2009 with Democrats attaining a [[supermajority]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], and the [[President of the United States|Presidency]]. In reaction to a series of [[Progressivism|progressive]] bills enacted into law including the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|Stimulus bill]], the [[Affordable Care Act]], and the [[Dodd-Frank Act]]; [[Conservatism|conservatives]] across America created a number of local activist groups, collectively called the [[Tea Party Movement]]. Republicans in the House and their supporters became determined to regain the House to stop the sudden progressive shift in federal government policy. Republican House members, led by then [[House Minority Leader]] [[John Boehner]], created the [[Pledge to America]] that outlined a [[Party platform|platform]] to reverse the growth in government spending as well as to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other items. During the 2010 elections, many House Republican candidates ran on the [[Pledge to America]] platform with enthusiastic support from the [[Tea Party Movement]]. The 2010 election year ended with Republicans taking the majority by winning 63 seats from Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peoples|first1=Steve|title=Final House Race Decided; GOP Net Gain: 63 Seats|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-201279-1.html|accessdate=June 8, 2017 |agency=Roll Call|date=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Tom|title=5 years later, here's how the tea party changed politics |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/politics/tea-party-greatest-hits/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=CNN Politics|date=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Michael|title=Tea Party movement|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tea-Party-movement|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high expectations of conservative constituents of Republican House members, generally, and Speaker [[John Boehner]], particularly; led to conflict and division among House members. A number of conservative members from within the House [[Republican Study Committee]], began to resist initiatives led by Speaker Boehner when he appeared to be overly cooperative (in the view of conservatives) with House Democrats and [[President Obama]] on issues like taxes, the [[Affordable Care Act]] and [[illegal immigration]] and appeared to be not committed to the [[Pledge to America]]. When Speaker Boehner was reluctantly forced by conservative members to lead a [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|shutdown]] of the federal government over the implementation and funding of the [[Affordable Care Act]], [[John Boehner]] began to retaliate against individual Republican members who were critical of Boehner and the rest of the House leadership for not adequately (in the view of conservatives) resisting the progressive policies of [[President Obama]] and congressional Democrats. Retaliations ranged from removing House members from [[congressional committees]] and positions of committee leadership, to supporting Republican primary candidates to oppose them. Also, the [[Republican Study Committee]], through its open policy to all Republican members (growing to over 170 members), transitioned from a smaller conservative group to one that aligned itself with the more [[The Establishment|establishment]]-oriented policies of Speaker Boehner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Buck|first1=Ken|title=Freedom Caucus member reveals GOP's 'vindictive retaliation'|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/08/freedom-caucus-member-exposes-gops-vindictive-retaliation/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=New York Post|date=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Scott|title=Boehner defends retaliation against unruly Republican members|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/245958-boehner-defends-retaliation-against-unruly-members|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=The Hill|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martosko|first1=David|title=The speaker's revenge: John Boehner punishes conservative Republicans who 'p***ed him off' by trying to oust him by removing high-profile committee posts |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2899963/Welcome-new-USSR-Conservative-Republicans-lose-committee-assignments-retaliation-voting-against-Speaker-John-Boehner-contentious-leadership-election.html |accessdate=June 8, 2017 |agency=Daily Mail |date=January 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Lauren|title=Conservatives split off from Republican Study Committee|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/conservatives-split-off-from-republican-study-committee-114222|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=Politico|date=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, feeling that the [[Republican Study Committee]] had become too [[The Establishment|establishment]]-aligned and insufficiently conservative, and citing Speaker Boehner's continued political battle against conservative members; nine House members came together in a series of meetings to consider and ultimately create a more nimble, consistently conservative group consisting of approximately 40 conservative House members. They formed an official congressional caucus and named it the [[Freedom Caucus|House Freedom Caucus]]. Congressman Fleming of Louisiana was among the nine founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Lauren|title=9 Republicans launch House Freedom Caucus|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/house-freedom-caucus-conservative-legislation-114593|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=Politico|date=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once fully organized, the [[Freedom Caucus|House Freedom Caucus]] began to oppose Boehner policies leading to continued divisions and conflicts within the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|Republican House Conference]]. In July 2015, Freedom Caucus member, [[Mark Meadows (North Carolina politician)|Mark Meadows]] of [[North Carolina]], without warning; submitted a written [[motion to vacate]] the chair (of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]). Though rarely done, it is a [[privileged motion]] meaning that any member can submit and trigger a series of [[parliamentary procedure]]s culminating in a new vote for Speaker of the House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bialik|first1=Carl|title=The Hard-Line Republicans Who Pushed John Boehner Out|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-hard-line-republicans-who-pushed-john-boehner-out/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=FiveThirtyEight|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Tim|title=Meet the Right-Wing Rebels Who Overthrew John Boehner|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/meet-the-right-wing-rebels-who-overthrew-john-boehner-20151006|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=The Rolling Stone|date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion accelerated the pressure on Boehner, whose popularity had declined considerably, nationally and among House Republicans in general.

====Attempt to impeach the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]]====
Soon after the [[Tea Party Movement]] began in 2009, local and national Tea Party organizations began to complain that the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] would not approve their applications for [[Tax exemption|tax exempt status]], a certification necessary for the [[wikt:viability|viability]] of [[nonprofit organization]]s. In 2013, [[Lois Lerner]], a high level IRS employee, disclosed as  Director of Rulings and Agreements in the Exempt Organizations, that the [[conservatism|conservative]] Tea Party organizations were targeted by the IRS to be denied tax exempt status while [[liberalism|liberal]] groups were given the appropriate certifications. This created the appearance that Lerner was using her power in the IRS for political and ideological benefit. Because of the [[IRS targeting controversy]], Lerner was forced to retire and [[John Koskinen]] was appointed to replace the acting Commissioner to restore integrity of the IRS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rep. Fleming: Impeach the IRS commissioner|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/14/impeach-irs-commissioner-john-koskinen-john-fleming-editorials-debates/90333680/|accessdate=June 10, 2017|agency=USA Today|date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations into the [[IRS targeting controversy]] were held by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight Committee]], chaired by [[Jason Chaffetz]]. Koskinen was instructed to protect and turn over all records relating to the controversy. However, under Koskinen, the vast amount of documentation, including computer backup tapes, were destroyed. Chaffetz issued a document to begin [[impeachment]] proceedings against Koskinen saying, "he failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=House Republicans introduce measure to impeach IRS Commissioner Koskinen|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/27/house-republicans-introduce-measure-to-impeach-irs-commissioner-koskinen.html|accessdate=June 10, 2017|agency=Fox News Politics|date=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Republican House leadership did not bring the impeachment to the floor for a vote.&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=IRS boss Koskinen takes heat at impeachment hearing for faulty testimony|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/21/irs-boss-koskinen-admits-failings-at-impeachment-hearing.html|accessdate=June 10, 2017|agency=Fox News Politics|date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of the House [[Freedom Caucus]], Fleming utilized a rarely-used [[parliamentary procedure]] called a [[privileged motion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert's Rules|url=http://www.rulesonline.com/rror-03.htm|website=RulesOnline.com|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to force a vote on impeachment of Koskinen.

Koskinen returned, voluntarily, on September 21, 2016, to face an impeachment hearing during which he admitted to his "failings" in getting to the bottom of the [[IRS targeting controversy]].&lt;ref name="foxnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rainey, [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/09/louisiana_rep_john_fleming_cal.html Louisiana Rep.

==== Social media to connect with constituents ====
As Fleming entered Congress in 2009, use of [[social media]] such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] emerged as methods for members to connect directly with their constituents.  In 2010 the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] created the "New Media Challenge" to spur Republican members to acquire more followers. Fleming was awarded first place in both 2010 ad 2011 by his Republican peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moire|first1=Jennifer|title=Who's Winning The Facebook War On Capitol Hill?|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/whos-winning-the-facebook-war-on-capitol-hill/ |agency=Adweek |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Work on religion in the military====
Beginning about 2005, critics claimed that Christians in the military caught [[proselytism|proselytizing]] should be [[court-martial]]ed. Subsequently, military members came forward claiming they were being punished by their military superiors for what they viewed as reasonable religious expression, a violation of the [[First Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowers|first1=Becky|title=Bloggers say Pentagon may court-martial Christian soldiers|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/06/blog-posting/bloggers-say-pentagon-may-court-martial-christian-/|website=Politifact|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yu|first1=Annie|title=Christians under siege push for more freedom of expression in military|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/17/proponents-of-religion-push-for-more-freedom-of-ex/|accessdate=June 20, 2017|agency=Washington Times|date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, Fleming sponsored an amendment to the 2014 [[National Defense Authorization Act]] requiring the military "to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, actions and speech, reflecting the conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member." The amendment drew objections from the White House, with a spokesman saying that commanders need discretion to, "address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units" and that the measure would "have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale and mission accomplishment." The amendment passed with a bipartisan vote by the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]]. A similar measure passed the Senate and compromise language was adopted into the final [[National Defense Authorization Act|NDAA]] signed into law.&lt;ref name=www.NOLA.com&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/fleming_proposal_to_require_fr.html/|title=Fleming proposal to require free religious expression in military draws White House objections|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=June 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cmrlink.org"/&gt;

The Army [[Chaplain]] Corps was implemented July 29, 1775, by George Washington, then the general of the [[Continental Army]]. Of chaplains Washington said, "Common decency, Sir, in a camp calls for the services of a divine, and which ought not to be dispensed with, altho' the world should be so uncharitable as to think us void of religion, and incapable of good instructions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=George Washington on Chaplain's Importance Thereof|url=http://www.ministers-best-friend.com/George-Washington-on-CHAPLAINS-IMPORTANCE-Thereof.html|website=Ministers-best-friend.com|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By definition a [[chaplain]] is a religious minister assigned to a secular institution.

Fleming said, "The notion of an atheist chaplain is nonsensical; it's an oxymoron." Democratic Congressman [[Rob Andrews]] of New Jersey said that it was "wrong" to tell an [[Irreligion|irreligious]] service member that they "must go to a mental health professional in order to receive counseling, rather than someone who comes from their philosophical faith or tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/07/house_passes_fleming_measure_t.html|title=House passes Rep.

====Long Range Strike Caucus====
In 2009 Fleming stood up and co-chaired this bipartisan congressional caucus to "sustain both the land- and sea-based long range strike capabilities."&lt;ref name="afgsc.af.mil"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tasista|first1=Michelle|title=Global Strike commander talks long-range strike|url=http://www.afgsc.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/455138/global-strike-commander-talks-long-range-strike/|agency=Air Force Global Strike Command|date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Congressional [[Addiction, Treatment and Recovery Caucus]]====
Fleming, based on his training, experience and interest, was the Republican co-chair of this bipartisan congressional caucus that promotes addiction treatment and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Slaton|first1=Hunter|title=Two Congressmen Talk Addiction With The Fix|url=https://www.thefix.com/content/congressional-addiction-treatment-recovery-caucus-interview00416?page=all|accessdate=31 August 2017|agency=The Fix|date=May 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[United States House of Representatives|House]] Values Action Team (VAT)====

====2012 abortion post ====
In 2012, Fleming attracted attention for sharing an article from the satirical news source ''[[The Onion]]'' (titled "Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex") with his Facebook followers with the apparently sincere message, "More on Planned Parenthood, abortion by wholesale". He deleted the post after commenters highlighted the article's satirical nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/02/rep-fleming-skinned-by-the-onion-072507|title=Congressman links to Onion story|work=Politico|accessdate=March 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theonion.com/article/planned-parenthood-opens-8-billion-abortionplex-20476|title=Planned Parenthood Opens $8 Billion Abortionplex|date=May 18, 2011 |accessdate=March 23, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/02/congressman-falls-months-old-onion-story-about-planned-parenthood-abortionplex/332189/|title=Congressman Falls for The Onion's Planned Parenthood 'Abortionplex' Story|last=Grandoni|first=Dino|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=March 23, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/john-fleming-onion-real-politican-posts-link-fake-news-planned-parenthood-facebook-article-1.1018018|title=Oops!

====[[Budget Control Act of 2011]] and [[United States budget sequestration in 2013|budget sequestration of 2013]]====
After Republicans took control of the [[United States House of Representatives]] In 2011, a debate emerged over how to bring deficit spending under control after it ballooned to over $1.3 trillion annually from 2009-2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Rugy|first1=Veronique|title=Debt and Deficit under Obama Administration|url=https://www.mercatus.org/publications/debt-and-deficit-under-obama-administration|website=George Mason University|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A compromise deal was struck, called the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], between Republican [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] and [[President Obama]] that would create a [[bipartisan]] and [[bicameral]] [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|"super committee"]] in Congress to decide how to equitably lower [[discretionary spending]]. According to the act, automatic and substantial cuts would be made to both national defense and non-defense [[discretionary spending]] in the federal budget if the committee did not come to an agreement to specific and targeted budget cuts. The [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|"super committee"]] could not come to an agreement leading to the automatic cuts to national defense and domestic spending. Fleming opposed and voted against the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] as he feared it would ultimately lead to devastating cuts to national defense, which it did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bash|first1=Dana|title=House approves budget deal aimed at averting shutdown|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/12/12/politics/congress-budget/index.html|accessdate=June 7, 2017|agency=CNN.com|date=December 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Congressman Fleming opposes Pentagon proposal to make further cuts to US Military|url=http://louisianaradionetwork.com/blogs/john-fleming-opposes-more-cuts-to-US-military-under-pentagon-proposal#.WTdS-xPys0o|accessdate=June 7, 2017|date=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Military warns cuts would create 'hollow force' akin to 1970s|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/10/military-warns-cuts-would-create-hollow-force-akin/|accessdate=June 7, 2017|agency=Washington Times|date=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Zachary|title=Desperate for planes, military turns to the 'boneyard'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/13/politics/military-aircraft-boneyard/index.html|accessdate=June 7, 2017|agency=CNN Politics|issue=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The U.S. Military Is Suffering A Crisis Of Strategy, Not Just One Of Readiness|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-us-military-suffering-crisis-strategy-not-just-one-20918|website=The Natural Interest|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming was quoted in ''[[Forbes]]'' as saying: "Republicans in general, we desperately want a reduction in spending to get government back into balance.

Fleming voted against the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]],&lt;ref&gt;{{USHVote|2011|690}}&lt;/ref&gt; that caused the automatic budget sequestration in March 2013.
On November 21, 2011, Fleming criticized the Budget Control Act because of what he called "devastating cuts to military spending."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fleming.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=270058 Fleming Responds to Failure of Debt Reduction Committee | Congressman John Fleming&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216110444/http://fleming.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=270058 |date=February 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political positions===

====Abortion====
Fleming was a staunch advocate in protecting unborn human life. He voted against taxpayer funding of abortion through the [[Affordable Care Act]], [[Planned Parenthood]] and other programs that fund abortion through federal tax dollars. He opposed the use of abortion to choose sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent.&lt;ref name="Fleming on Abortion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fleming on Abortion|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/John_Fleming_Abortion.htm|website=On the Issues|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Religious liberty====
In support of religious liberty and right of conscience, Fleming supported the company, [[Hobby Lobby]], in its position to refuse to fund, through its healthcare insurance program, abortion or [[abortifacients]] for its employees under the [[Affordable Care Act]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ultimately ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby. He also opposed military sanctions against its members for openly expressing religious views.&lt;ref name="Fleming on Abortion"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-rodda/rep-fleming-ndaa-religiou_b_4461318.html|title=Rep.

====Opposition to same-sex marriage====
In 2012, before the ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' Supreme Court decision, Fleming condemned a marriage-like ceremony that took place at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]], between an enlisted woman and civilian woman. (Fort Polk, a [[U.S. Army base]], lies within Fleming's congressional district.) Fleming said that the ceremony "should not have occurred at Fort Polk, especially since the people of Louisiana have made it abundantly clear that our state does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions" and characterized the event as part of a "liberal social experiment with our military."&lt;ref&gt;Alan Duke, [http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/07/us/army-same-sex-ceremony/ Same-sex ceremony on Army post draws fire], CNN (June 7, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming condemned the Supreme Court's 2015 decision of ''Obergefell v. Hodges'', which found a constitutional right to [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. Fleming stated that he was "greatly disappointed" and disagreed with the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Alpert, [http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/06/louisiana_gop_congressional_me.html Louisiana GOP congressional members condemn ruling for gay marriage, Democrats say it advances freedom], ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' (June 26, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Fleming was also a co-sponsor of The [[First Amendment Defense Act]], a bill designed to protect religious institutions from being forced to perform marriage or other ceremonies that violate their teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Bruch Alpert|title=Supporters of bill to protect rights of same-sex marriage foes open to compromise|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/07/supporters_of_bill_to_protects.html|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|date=July 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and Human Services tenure==
After completing four terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]], Dr. Fleming was appointed Deputy Secretary of Health Technology Reform in [[Health and Human Services]] on March 23, 2017, by [[President Donald Trump]]. On being appointed, Fleming said, "I just want to be a part of taking down the barriers that are preventing innovation (in healthcare)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=Richard|title=Former Louisiana Rep.

He implemented his first system in 1997 and said his practice was fully [[paperless office|paperless]] by 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership Bios|url=https://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/john-fleming-md|website=HealthIT.gov|accessdate=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was assigned, primarily, to the [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology|Office of the National Coordinator]], an agency within HHS. Fleming noted that for years after implementing his EHR, adoption rates of EHRs among his healthcare colleagues remained low until the implementation of the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]] in 2009 in which around $30 billion in cash incentives were used to encourage [[health professionals]] to purchase EHRs. He reported that by 2017 adoption rates among hospitals was over 95% and over 85% among physician offices.&lt;ref name="healthcare-informatics.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leventhal|first1=Rajiv|title=HHS' New Health IT Lead Speaks Out on EHR Usability, Interoperability|url=https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/interoperability/hhs-new-health-it-lead-speaks-out-ehr-usability-interoperability|accessdate=May 29, 2017|date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleming has been a strong advocate of technology [[innovation]] and believes "the future of healthcare technology is tied to two core goals: improving the [[usability]] of health IT systems and [[interoperability]]." He also stated that [[interoperability]] "would be sparked by every American having a single, unified health record that resides in the cloud." He lamented the problems with the current [[fractionated]] nature of EHRs being disbursed among a myriad of healthcare providers tends to defeat the purpose of [[information technology]] to improve access to medical information and [[healthcare]] in general.&lt;ref name="healthcare-informatics.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Rep. Fleming Named to HHS Health Technology Post |url=https://ehrintelligence.com/news/former-rep.-fleming-named-to-hhs-health-technology-post |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to technology, Fleming advocated (ACOs) [[accountable care organization]]s as a method to streamline healthcare purchasing instead of the traditional [[fee for service]] system still mostly used today. Of [[fee for service]] Fleming said, "If you're paying for service, you'll get service, whether the outcomes are good or not." He has supported the need to produce and use data to improve the quality and [[cost effectiveness]] of healthcare as evidenced by the statement, "how do you pay for outcomes without good data? We need better methods for getting data into the system and delivering it to you, and we're working on doing that. There is a good marriage between [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay-for-value]] and data".&lt;ref name="healthcare-informatics.com"/&gt;

'''Kurt Walter Bachstitz''' (4 October 1882 – 1949 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[art dealer]]. He died shortly before his naturalization to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="libmma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Bachstitz_records_b18041048.pdf|title=Bachstitz, Inc. records, 1923-1937|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.2|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==

===Until Emigration 1938===
Bachstitz was born as the child of the Jewish couple Liber Jacob Bachstitz and Mathilde Markowitz. His place of birth is arguable. All contemporary sources mention the formerly German [[Breslau]] (the present-day Polish [[Wrocław]]) as his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189; Central Bureau for Genealogy, The Hague, Calmery archive, Bachstitz file&lt;/ref&gt; But Bachstitz requested for himself the Austrian village Raipoltenbach as his place of birth when he claimed at the U.S. Department of Labor for an extension of his temporary stay in 1931.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt; He studied architecture in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Vienna]] where he finished his studies with a diploma. On the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was called up for military service and served between 1914 and 1918 as an officer, lastly in the rank of a troop captain. He served actively in the field until 1916, when he was severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elfriede Pesé (died in 1918) with whom he had two children – a son Walter Werner Michael who died in 1943 by tuberculosis in [[Switzerland]] and a daughter, Margit Martha&lt;ref&gt;File RC 1.78, estate inventory (via Ministry of Finance, inheritance tax returns)&lt;/ref&gt; who died in [[South Africa]] in 1982. On 19 December 1918 he married his second wife Elisa ("Lilly") Emma Hofer. Lilly was a [[Protestant]]. Because of her Bachstitz converted to the evangelic faith.&lt;ref&gt;NA, SNK 178, Bachstitz file, draft letter from Bogisch to Weyma, undated&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he apparently lived and traded in Munich. In his diary [[Thomas Mann]] wrote about a meeting in Bachstitz' Munich apartment, where Mann bought a work from Bachstitz. He described him quite prerogatively as a "blond-Jewish" example of an "international culture-capitalistic profiteer".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann Tagebücher, 1918–1921, herausgegeben von Peter de Mendelssohn, Frankfurt/M. 1979, {{ISBN|978-3-10-048192-4}}, S. 143 – 145 '"Der Mensch, blond-jüdisch und elegant, Mitte dreißig, mit Monokel und fetten, weißen, manikürten Händen, in gesteppter Hausjacke und Lackhausschuhen, wunderbar als Typus des international-kultur-kapitalistischen Schiebertums."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he established an art dealership in the Hague named Kunsthandel K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Gallery N.V.). Surinamestraat 11, He lived in Vienna and in [[Berlin]] and he created an internationally known company with art galleries in The Hague, [[New York City]] and Berlin. Lilly was the sister of art dealer [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]] who had managed the Gallery in The Hague for a while and subsequently became an art buyer for [[Hermann Göring]].

In 1937 Bachstitz waived his Austrian citizenship. In 1938 the couple moved to The Hague.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;

===World War II===

Between the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 and 1941 Bachstitz sold a number of paintings to the "[[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sondernauftrag Linz]]" that was run by [[Hitler]]'s Special Representative of the planned '[[Führermuseum]]' in Linz,&lt;ref&gt;Looted Art Commission.

Among the works sold to the Sonderauftrag were the following:

The correspondence between Bachstitz and Posse concerning these works is preserved. Posse achieved high price reductions.&lt;ref&gt;

In February 1941 Bachstitz officially resigned as supervisory director of the Bachstitz Gallery and his wife became the managing director. Together with his wife, he continued to provide a clandestine management role. In this way, they avoided having the Gallery placed under the forced administration for the duration of the war. According to the documents in the file concerning his successful application to become a Dutchman after the war&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, ministerie van justitie (1915–1955), inv. No. 13533 (1646)&lt;/ref&gt; the couple provided undercover protection for Jews trying to escape the authorities.

In 1942 Bachstitz was summoned by the occupation authority (the "Wirtschaftsamt") as he had failed to register the gallery as "non-Aryan property". Proceedings were commenced against him and he was arrested by the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in July 1943 and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague. Due to an intervention of Göring initiated by Bachstitz' brother-in-law Hofer, he was released from prison. He was then also exempted from wearing the Star of David. Furthermore, the couple had their marriage dissolved in September 1943 to prevent the confiscation of the gallery by the occupying authority.

Between 1942 und 1944 Bachstitz sold a number of works to the museums that were run by [[Kurt Martin]], the head of the Museums of the Upper Rhine (Alsace and Baden) under [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/SucheMeldungDetail.html?resourceId=4348&amp;input_=4340&amp;pageLocale=de&amp;person=&amp;titelbesch=&amp;datierung=&amp;objektart=-1&amp;objektart.GROUP=1&amp;mattech=&amp;provsamml=kurt+martin&amp;institution=&amp;ort=&amp;id=&amp;type=DetailVerlust&amp;type.GROUP=1&amp;suche_typ=MeldungDetail&amp;suche_typ.HASH=01c6e21bb090266af660&amp;suchen=Suchen  10 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Bachstitz managed to obtain permission to leave the Netherlands and he emigrated to Switzerland, again with the help of Andreas Hofer.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.6|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a bribe for the exit visa Bachstitz had to hand over art to Hermann Göring, namely a painting with the Samson and Delilah motive by [[Jan Steen]],&lt;ref&gt;US-NARA, RG 260, M1946. Roll 127. Restitution Research Records. Göring, Hermann: Notes on Purchases. Page 65.&lt;/ref&gt; as well two antique necklaces.&lt;ref name="lootedart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lootedart.com/aliu-long_print;Y|title=Post-War Reports: Art Looting Intelligence Unit (ALIU) Reports 1945-1946 and ALIU Red Flag Names List and Index|publisher=lootedart.com|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After The War - Successful and Unsuccessful Restitution Efforts===

After the war the Allies returned most of the art that the gallery had sold to German authorities to the Netherlands. The Netherlands restituted the painting by Jan Steen&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK), 2.08.42.&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected an application for the restitution of the other works. They became part of the Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK). Kurt Walter Bachsitz and Lilly Bachstitz-Hofer were again registered as officially married. Kurt Walter Bachstitz died in 1949. In 1951 his widow liquidated the Bachstitz Gallery N.V. with a high deficit.&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA 2.09.16, Nederlands Beheers Instituut NBI, inv.no. 2168, Note Kesselaar NBI 16 December 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery's art library was auctioned off.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/artlibrary00inte|title=Art library of the late K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Galleries), The Hague. : Internationaal Antiquariaat (Menno Hertzberger) : Free Download &amp;amp; Streaming : Internet Archive|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Dutch government restituted the painting "Roman Capriccio" by [[Pietro Capelli]] from the stock of the SNK to Kurt Walter Bachstitz' grandchildren.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.18|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Restitution Committee of the Netherlands denied though a restitution claim concerning a number of other works, among them the works sold to Hitler (Sonderauftrag Linz). In view of most of these works the Committee argued that these sales had not been made under duress because Kurt Walter Bachstitz had been left "undisturbed" in 1940 and 1941.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.5|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grandchildren applied in 2013 for the re-opening of the case in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Act RC 4.138&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the Prussian Heritage Foundation restituted a Tyrolean gothic wall-mounted writing slate (c. 1500) and a large 16th-century Italian bronze mortar.&lt;ref name="preussischer-kulturbesitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussischer-kulturbesitz.de/pressemitteilung/news/2013/07/09/berliner-kunstgewerbemuseum-restituiert-zwei-werke-an-die-erben-des-kunsthaendlers-bachstitz.html|title=Berliner Kunstgewerbemuseum restituiert zwei Werke an die Erben des Kunsthändlers Bachstitz - Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz|publisher=preussischer-kulturbesitz.de|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kurt Walter Bachstitz' grandchildren are still searching for many works of art that were lost due to National-Socialist persecution&lt;ref name="lostart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/SucheSimpelErgebnis.html?cms_param=SUCHE_ID%3D1970107 |title=Lost Art Internet Database  -  Einfache Suche |accessdate=2015-06-11 |df= }}{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/MeldungVerlust.html?cms_param=menu%3Dobjgrp%26INST_ID%3D12215#id83554  48 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Auli Kyllikki Saari''' (December 6, 1935 – May 17, 1953) was a 17-year-old Finnish girl whose [[murder]] in 1953 is one of the most infamous cases of [[homicide]] ever in [[Finland]]. Her murder in [[Isojoki]] remains unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tiede.fi/arkisto/artikkeli.php?id%3D146%26vl%3D2000 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185628/http://www.tiede.fi/arkisto/artikkeli.php?id=146&amp;vl=2000 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background information==
Saari was last seen alive on May 17, 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://imgur.com/gallery/Bnqql|title=Unsolved murders: The Bog Grave|work=Imgur|access-date=2017-09-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was [[bicycle|cycling]] home from a [[prayer meeting]] when, it is believed, she was [[assault|attacked]] by an unidentified person. The authorities speculated that the murderer may have had a [[sexual crime|sexual motive]], but no evidence has been produced to support this theory. Although the crime received notable [[mass media|media]] attention, the murderer has never been identified. Saari's remains were found on October 11, 1953 in a [[bog]]. Her bicycle was discovered in a marshy area later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE8 |title=Helsingin Sanomat |publisher=.hs.fi |date= |accessdate=2016-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606012624/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE8 |archivedate=2016-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Funeral service]]s were held at Isojoki Church on October 25, 1953; an estimated 25,000 people attended.

==Suspects==
===Kauko Kanervo===
Initially, the [[prime suspect]] in the case was [[:fi:Kauko Kanervo|Kauko Kanervo]], a [[parish priest]] who remained under investigation for several years. Kanervo had moved to [[Merikarvia]] three weeks before the murder, and had been reported as having been in the area on the evening of Saari's disappearance. An investigation determined Kanervo had been dean of the party and spent the late night hours in the [[parsonage]]. With all but 20 minutes of his time accounted for, the authorities deduced the priest could not have had enough time to go to Isojoki (60 kilometres away from Merikarvia), as he did not have a drivers license or a car.

===Hans Assmann===
{{Main|Hans Assmann}}
Assmann's wife reported that her husband and his driver were near Isojoki at the time of the murder. Assmann also owned a light-brown [[Opel]], the same type of car several [[witness]]es had seen near the murder scene. In 1997, Assmann reportedly confessed his involvement in the crime to a former [[police officer]], Matti Paloaro, and claimed responsibility for the death of Kyllikki Saari. Assmann's story to the officer claimed the death was caused by an [[automobile accident]] when his car, driven by his chauffeur, collided with Saari; to conceal the [[evidence]] of the driver's involvement, the two men staged the case as a murder. According to Paloaro, Assmann said on his deathbed, "One thing however, I can tell you right away ... because it is the oldest one, and in a way it was an accident, that had to be covered up. Otherwise, our trip would have been revealed. Even though my friend was a good driver, the accident was unavoidable. I assume you know what I mean."

Assmann's wife also reported that one of her husband's socks was missing and his shoes were wet when he returned home the evening of the murder. There were also dents in the car. According to Mrs. Assmann, a few days later, Assmann and his driver left again, but this time they had a shovel with them. Later investigators determined that Kyllikki's murderer must have been left-handed, which Assmann was.

Assmann is also alleged to have been the perpetrator of the [[Lake Bodom murders]], which occurred in 1960.

===Vihtori Lehmusviita===
Vihtori Lehmusviita was in a [[mental hospital]] for long periods, and died in 1967, following which his case was set aside. The man police generally held as a [[murderer]] was, at the time, a 38-year-old local inhabitant. He was living within a 1–2&amp;nbsp;km radius of the site. In the 1940s, Lehmusviita was found guilty of a [[sexual offense]], and had a [[mental illness]]. The police suspected that the murderer got help and cover-up from the 37-year-old brother-in-law of Lehmusviita, who had a [[criminal record|criminal background]]. The suspect's mother and sister gave him an [[alibi]] for the evening of the murder, saying that he was in bed by 19:00 after drinking heavily.

When Lehmusviita was interrogated, he said that Kyllikki was no longer alive, and her body would never be found. Subsequently, he withdrew his statement, claiming that he had been misunderstood. The suspect and his brother-in-law alleged [[accomplice]] were questioned in the autumn of 1953. Shortly after this incident, the brother-in-law moved to [[Central Ostrobothnia]], and then to Sweden. Lehmusviita was questioned twice. He was in a mental hospital for treatment, and when the provincial criminal police came there to question him, the interrogation was made to stop because Lehmusviita's behavior became so strange and confused that his doctor ordered that he could not be questioned in his state.

Both Lehmusviita and his alleged accomplice knew the terrain very well, as they had a common working field located 50 meters from where Kyllikki was found. There was a shovel in the field that was used to dig the [[grave]].

'''Lena Mary Calhoun Horne''' (June 30, 1917 – May 9, 2010) was an American singer, dancer, actress, and [[civil rights]] [[activist]]. Horne's career spanned over 70 years appearing in film, television, and theater. Horne joined the chorus of the [[Cotton Club]] at the age of 16 and became a [[nightclub performer]] before moving to Hollywood, where she had small parts in numerous movies, and more substantial parts in the 1943 films ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' and ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]''. Because of the [[McCarthyism|Red Scare]] and her political activism, Horne found herself [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklist]]ed and unable to get work in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="pbs1"&gt;{{cite episode |url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/lena-horne/about-the-performer/487/ |episode=Lena Horne: In Her Own Words| title=About the Performer| series=[[American Masters]] |date=May 14, 2010 |network=[[PBS]] |accessdate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning to her roots as a nightclub performer, Horne took part in the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] in August 1963 and continued to work as a performer, both in nightclubs and on television while releasing well-received record albums. She announced her retirement in March 1980, but the next year starred in a one-woman show, ''[[Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music]]'', which ran for more than three hundred performances on Broadway. She then toured the country in the show, earning numerous awards and accolades. Horne continued recording and performing sporadically into the 1990s, disappearing from the public eye in 2000. Horne died of congestive heart failure on May 9, 2010, at the age of 92.

== Early life ==
Lena Horne was born in [[Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="pbs1"/&gt; She was reportedly descended from the [[John C. Calhoun]] family, and both sides of her family were a mixture of [[African-American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and [[European American]] descent and belonged to the upper stratum of middle-class, well-educated people.&lt;ref name="horne"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.answers.com/topic/lena-horne| title=Artist: Lena Horne Biography| author=William Ruhlmann| accessdate=August 10, 2008| year=2008| work=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jck1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16160124?story_id=16160124| title=Lena Horne, entertainer, died on May 9th, aged 92| work=[[The Economist]]| accessdate=June 30, 2017| date=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Edwin Fletcher "Teddy" Horne Jr. (1893–1970),&lt;ref name="Vh1"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/horne_lena/bio.jhtml| title=Lena Horne Bio – Lena Horne Career| work=MTV Artists}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAT"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-horne-20100510,0,1501683,full.story| title=Lena Horne dies at 92; singer and civil rights activist who broke barriers| date=May 10, 2010| accessdate=May 10, 2010| work=Los Angeles Times| first1=Dennis| last1=McLellan| first2=Valerie J.| last2=Nelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; a numbers kingpin in the gambling trade, left the family when she was three and moved to an [[African-American upper class|upper-middle-class black community]] in the [[Hill District]] community of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="kdka"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2010/05/11/Lena-Horne-came-to-Pittsburgh-then-left-to-find-stardom/stories/201005110302| work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]| title=Lena Horne came to Pittsburgh, then left to find stardom| date=May 11, 2010| first=Sally| last=Kalson| accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pittsburghjazz"&gt;{{cite book| last=Brewer| first=John M.| title=Pittsburgh Jazz| publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]]| year=2007| page=14| isbn=978-0-7385-4980-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, Edna Louise Scottron (1894–1976), was a granddaughter of inventor [[Samuel R. Scottron]]; she was an actress with a black theatre troupe and traveled extensively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150710060305/http://familyforest.com/ebook/Family%20Forest%20Hourglass%20of%20Lena%20Horne.pdf "Ancestors &amp; Descendants of Lena Mary Calhoun Horne"].

When Horne was five, she was sent to live in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name="TonightShow"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvcuwCNIJVE| title=Lena Horne on Tonight Show 1982 – Part 1| year=1982| publisher=NBC/YouTube| accessdate=May 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years, she traveled with her mother.&lt;ref name="GAencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1691| title=Lena Horne| publisher=New Georgia Encyclopedia| first=Caroline| last=Cason| date=November 15, 2013| accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1927 to 1929, she lived with her uncle, Frank S. Horne, dean of students at Fort Valley Junior Industrial Institute (now part of [[Fort Valley State University]]) in [[Fort Valley, Georgia]],&lt;ref name="GAencyclopedia"/&gt; who later served as an adviser to President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview| subject=Augustus F.

Aged 18, she moved to her father's home in Pittsburgh, staying in the city's [[Hill District (Pittsburgh)|Little Harlem]] for almost five years and learning from native Pittsburghers [[Billy Strayhorn]] and [[Billy Eckstine]], among others.&lt;ref name="kdka"/&gt;

== Career ==
=== Road to Hollywood ===
In the fall of 1933, Horne joined the chorus line of the [[Cotton Club]] in New York City. In the spring of 1934, she had a featured role in the Cotton Club Parade starring [[Adelaide Hall]], who took Lena under her wing. A few years later, Horne joined [[Noble Sissle]]'s Orchestra, with which she toured and with whom she made her first records, issued by [[Decca Records|Decca]]. After she separated from her first husband, Horne toured with bandleader [[Charlie Barnet]] in 1940–41, but disliked the travel and left the band to work at the [[Café Society|Cafe Society]] in New York. She replaced [[Dinah Shore]] as the featured vocalist on NBC's popular jazz series ''[[The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street]]''. The show's resident maestros, Henry Levine and Paul Laval, recorded with Horne in June 1941 for [[RCA Victor]]. Horne left the show after only six months when she was hired by former Cafe [[Trocadero (Los Angeles)]] manager Felix Young to perform in a Cotton Club-style revue on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book| last=Gavin| first=James| title=Stormy Weather: The Life of Lena Horne| isbn=978-0743271431| publisher=Altria Books| date=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by actress Betty Keene of the Keene sisters. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[File:Lenahorne.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Lena Horne photographed by [[Carl Van Vechten]], 1941]]
Horne already had two low-budget movies to her credit: a 1938 musical feature called ''[[The Duke is Tops]]'' (later reissued with Horne's name above the title as ''The Bronze Venus''); and a 1941 two-reel short subject, ''Boogie Woogie Dream'', featuring pianists [[Pete Johnson]] and [[Albert Ammons]]. Horne's songs from ''Boogie Woogie Dream'' were later released individually as [[soundies]]. Horne made her Hollywood nightclub debut at Felix Young's Little Troc on the [[Sunset Strip]] in January 1942.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; A few weeks later, she was signed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. In November 1944, she was featured in an episode of the popular radio series ''[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]'', as a fictional nightclub singer, with a large speaking role along with her singing.  In 1945 and 1946, she sang with [[Billy Eckstine]]'s Orchestra.

She made her debut at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in ''[[Panama Hattie]]'' (1942) and performed the [[Stormy Weather (song)|title song]] of ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'' based loosely on the life of [[Adelaide Hall]], (1943), which she made at [[20th Century Fox]], on loan from MGM. She appeared in a number of MGM [[musical film|musicals]], most notably ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'' (1943), but was never featured in a leading role because of her race and the fact that her films had to be re-edited for showing in cities where theaters would not show films with black performers. As a result, most of Horne's film appearances were stand-alone sequences that had no bearing on the rest of the film, so editing caused no disruption to the storyline. A notable exception was the all-black musical ''Cabin in the Sky'', although one number from that film was cut before release because it was considered too suggestive by the censors: Horne singing "Ain't It the Truth" while taking a bubble bath. This scene and song are featured in the film ''[[That's Entertainment! III]]'' (1994) which also featured commentary from Horne on why the scene was deleted prior to the film's release. Lena Horne was the first African-American elected to serve on the Screen Actors Guild board of directors.
[[File:Lena Horne in Till the Clouds Roll By 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Horne singing "[[Why Was I Born?]]" in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'' (1946)]]
In ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]]'' (1946), she performed "Love" by [[Hugh Martin]] and [[Ralph Blane]]. Horne lobbied for the role of Julie LaVerne in MGM's 1951 version of ''[[Show Boat]]'' (having already played the role when a segment of ''Show Boat'' was performed in ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]'', 1946) but lost the part to [[Ava Gardner]], a personal friend in real life. Horne claimed this was due to the [[Production Code]]'s ban on [[interracial relationship]]s in films, but MGM sources state she was never considered for the role in the first place. In the documentary ''That's Entertainment! III,'' Horne stated that MGM executives required Gardner to practice her singing using Horne's recordings, which offended both actresses.  Ultimately, Gardner's voice was [[dubbing (music)|overdubbed]] by actress Annette Warren (Smith) for the theatrical release.

=== Changes of direction ===
By the mid-1950s, Horne was disenchanted with Hollywood and increasingly focused on her nightclub career. She made only two major appearances for MGM during the 1950s: ''[[Duchess of Idaho]]'' (which was also [[Eleanor Powell]]'s final film); and the 1956 musical ''[[Meet Me in Las Vegas]]''. She was [[blacklist]]ed during the 1950s for her affiliations in the 1940s with [[communist]]-backed groups.  She would subsequently disavow communism.&lt;ref name="pbs1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=John| last=Meroney| title=The Red-Baiting of Lena Horne| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/the-red-baiting-of-lena-horne/398291/| work=[[The Atlantic]]| date=August 27, 2015| accessdate=August 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned to the screen three more times, playing chanteuse Claire Quintana in the 1969 film ''[[Death of a Gunfighter]]'', [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] in ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' (1978), which was directed by her then son-in-law [[Sidney Lumet]], and co-hosting the MGM retrospective ''That's Entertainment! III'' (1994), in which she was candid about her unkind treatment by the studio.

After leaving Hollywood, Horne established herself as one of the premier [[nightclub]] performers of the post-war era. She headlined at clubs and hotels throughout the U.S., Canada, and Europe, including the [[Sands Hotel]] in Las Vegas, the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cocoanut Grove]] in Los Angeles, and the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in New York. In 1957, a live album entitled, ''[[Lena Horne at the Waldorf Astoria|Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria]],'' became the biggest-selling record by a female artist in the history of the [[RCA Victor]] label at that time. In 1958, Horne became the first African-American woman to be nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for "Best Actress in a Musical" (for her part in the "[[Calypso music|Calypso]]" musical ''[[Jamaica (musical)|Jamaica]]'') which, at Lena's request featured her longtime friend [[Adelaide Hall]].
[[File:Lena horne 1964.JPG|thumb|upright|Horne performing on ''The Bell Telephone Hour'', 1965]]
From the late 1950s through to the 1960s, Horne was a staple of TV variety shows, appearing multiple times on Perry Como's ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'', ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', and ''[[The Bell Telephone Hour]]''. Other programs she appeared on included ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]'', ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', and ''[[The Andy Williams Show]]''. Besides two television specials for the [[BBC]] (later syndicated in the U.S.), Horne starred in her own U.S. television special in 1969, ''Monsanto Night Presents Lena Horne''. During this decade, the artist Pete Hawley painted her portrait for RCA Victor, capturing the mood of her performance style.

In 1970, she co-starred with [[Harry Belafonte]] in the hour-long ''Harry &amp; Lena'' special for ABC; in 1973, she co-starred with [[Tony Bennett]] in ''Tony and Lena''. Horne and Bennett subsequently toured the U.S. and U.K. in a show together. In the 1976 program ''America Salutes Richard Rodgers'', she sang a lengthy medley of Rodgers songs with [[Peggy Lee]] and [[Vic Damone]]. Horne also made several appearances on ''[[The Flip Wilson Show]]''. Additionally, Horne played herself on television programs such as ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' in the 1970s, as well as a 1985 performance on ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and a 1993 appearance on ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''. In the summer of 1980, Horne, 63 years old and intent on retiring from show business, embarked on a two-month series of benefit concerts sponsored by the sorority [[Delta Sigma Theta]]. These concerts were represented as Horne's farewell tour, yet her retirement lasted less than a year.

On April 13, 1980, Horne, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and host [[Gene Kelly]] were all scheduled to appear at a Gala performance at the Metropolitan Opera House to salute the NY City Center's [[Joffrey Ballet Company]]. However, Pavarotti's plane was diverted over the Atlantic and he was unable to appear. James Nederlander was an invited Honored Guest and noted that only three people at the sold-out Metropolitan Opera House asked for their money back. He asked to be introduced to Lena following her performance. In May 1981, The [[Nederlander Organization]], Michael Frazier, and Fred Walker went on to book Horne for a four-week engagement at the newly named [[Nederlander Theatre]] on West 41st Street in New York City. The show was an instant success and was extended to a full year run, garnering Horne a special Tony award, and two [[Grammy Awards]] for the cast recording of her show ''[[Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music]]''. The 333-performance Broadway run closed on Horne's 65th birthday, June 30, 1982. Later that same week, she performed the entire show again to record it for television broadcast and home video release. Horne began a tour a few days later at Tanglewood (Massachusetts) during the weekend of July 4, 1982. ''The Lady and Her Music'' toured 41 cities in the U.S. and Canada until June 17, 1984. It played in London for a month in August and ended its run in [[Stockholm, Sweden]], September 14, 1984. In 1981, she received a Special Tony Award for the show, which also played to acclaim at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] in London in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Lena Horne, Singer and Actress, Dies at 92| url=http://www.playbill.com/article/lena-horne-singer-and-actress-dies-at-92-com-167741| date=May 10, 2010| last=Simonson| first=Robert|authorlink1=Robert Simonson| work=[[Playbill]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the show's considerable success (Horne still holds the record for the longest-running solo performance in Broadway history), she did not capitalize on the renewed interest in her career by undertaking many new musical projects. A proposed 1983 joint recording project between Horne and [[Frank Sinatra]] (to be produced by [[Quincy Jones]]) was ultimately abandoned, and her sole studio recording of the decade was 1988's ''[[The Men in My Life]]'', featuring duets with [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] and [[Joe Williams (jazz singer)|Joe Williams]]. In 1989, she received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

The 1990s found Horne considerably more active in the recording studio. Following her 1993 performance at a tribute to the musical legacy of her good friend [[Billy Strayhorn]] ([[Duke Ellington]]'s longtime collaborator), she decided to record an album composed largely of Strayhorn's and Ellington's songs the following year, ''[[We'll Be Together Again (album)|We'll Be Together Again]]''. To coincide with the release of the album, Horne made what would be her final concert performances at New York's Supper Club and [[Carnegie Hall]]. That same year, Horne also lent her vocals to a recording of "[[Embraceable You]]" on Sinatra's ''[[Duets II (Frank Sinatra album)|Duets II]]'' album. Though the album was largely derided by critics, the Sinatra-Horne pairing was generally regarded as its highlight. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In 1995, a "live" album capturing her Supper Club performance was released (subsequently winning a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Album). In 1998, Horne released another studio album, entitled ''[[Being Myself (Lena Horne album)|Being Myself]]''. Thereafter, Horne retired from performing and largely retreated from public view, though she did return to the recording studio in 2000 to contribute vocal tracks on [[Simon Rattle]]'s ''Classic Ellington'' album.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news| title=Lena Horne Obituary| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/10/lena-horne-obituary| last=Fordham| first=John| date=May 10, 2010| work=[[The Guardian]]| location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civil rights activism ==
Horne was long involved with the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In 1941, she sang at [[Cafe Society]] and worked with [[Paul Robeson]]. During [[World War II]], when entertaining the troops for the USO, she refused to perform "for [[racial segregation|segregated]] audiences or for groups in which German [[POW]]s were seated in front of African American servicemen", according to her [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] biography.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;{{cite web| title=Lena Horne: Biography| url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/artist/A3743| publisher=The Kennedy Center| accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the U.S. Army refused to allow integrated audiences, she staged her show for a mixed audience of black U.S. soldiers and white German POWs. Seeing the black soldiers had been forced to sit in the back seats, she walked off the stage to the first row where the black troops were seated and performed with the Germans behind her. She was at an [[NAACP]] rally with [[Medgar Evers]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], the weekend before Evers was assassinated. She also met President [[John F. Kennedy]] at the [[White House]] two days before he was assassinated. She was at the [[March on Washington]] and spoke and performed on behalf of the NAACP, [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], and the [[National Council of Negro Women]]. She also worked with [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to pass anti-[[Lynching in the United States|lynching]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ho-Jo/Horne-Lena.html| title=Lena Horne Biography| publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biographies| accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Lehrer]] mentions her in his song "National Brotherhood Week" in the line "Lena Horne and Sheriff Clark are dancing cheek to cheek" referring (wryly) to her and to Sheriff [[Jim Clark (sheriff)|Jim Clark]], of [[Selma, Alabama]], who was responsible for a violent attack on civil rights marchers in 1965. In 1983, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] awarded her the [[Spingarn Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners |title=Spingarn Medal Winners: 1915 to Today |publisher=NAACP |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PLj9XvLc?url=http://www.naacp.org/pages/spingarn-medal-winners |archivedate=May 5, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horne was a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and on November 20, 1963, she, along with Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman [[John Moran Bailey|John Bailey]], [[Carol Lawrence]], [[Richard Adler]], [[Sidney Salomon]], Vice-Chairwoman of the DNC [[Margaret B. Price]], and Secretary of the DNC [[Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush]], visited [[John F. Kennedy]] at [[The White House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/Archives/JFKWHP-1963-11-20-E.aspx |title=Visit of Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman John Bailey, Lena Horne, Carol Lawrence, Richard Adler, Sidney Salomon, Vice-Chairwoman of the DNC Margaret B.

== Personal life ==
Horne married Louis Jordan Jones, a political operative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/pittsburghmusichistory/pittsburgh-music-story/jazz/jazz---early-years/lena-horne|title=Lena Horne - Found Romance and Children In Pittsburgh on Her Way to Super Stardom|author=|date=|website=Pittsburgh Music History|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bowiestate.edu/academics-research/colleges/college-arts-sciences/departments/communications/the-spectrum/details/black-history-month-tribute-to-lena-horne-the-actress-and-activist/|title=Black History Month Tribute to Lena Horne: The Actress and Activist|author=Imani Davy|date= 26 February 2015 |website=The Spectrum Student Newspaper · Bowie State University|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in January 1937 in [[Pittsburgh]]. On December 21, 1937, their daughter, Gail (later known as Gail Lumet Buckley, a writer) was born.  They had a son, Edwin Jones (February 7, 1940 – September 12, 1970) who died of [[kidney disease]].&lt;ref name="LAT" /&gt; Horne and Jones separated in 1940 and divorced in 1944. Horne's second marriage was to [[Lennie Hayton]], who was Music Director and one of the premier musical conductors and arrangers at MGM, in December 1947 in Paris. They separated in the early 1960s, but never divorced; he died in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Lena Horne Obituary| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/7706158/Lena-Horne.html| work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=May 10, 2010|  accessdate= June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her as-told-to autobiography ''Lena'' by [[Richard Schickel]], Horne recounts the enormous pressures she and her husband faced as an [[interracial marriage|interracial]] couple. She later admitted in an interview in ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' (May 1980) that she had married Hayton to advance her career and cross the "color-line" in show business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=https://books.google.com/?id=NDbcot0HasEC&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Ebony%201980%20Lena%20Horne&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Ebony Interview: Lena Horne| work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]| pages=38–50| date=May 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horne had affairs with [[Artie Shaw]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Vincente Minnelli]], and the boxer [[Joe Louis]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Horne also had a long and close relationship with [[Billy Strayhorn]], whom she said she would have married if he had been heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book| first=David| last=Hajdu| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=snKKy0SnkzcC&amp;q=lena+horne+marry#v=snippet&amp;q=lena%20horne%20marry&amp;f=false| date=June 26, 1997| title=Lush Life: A Biography of Billy Strayhorn| location=New York| publisher=North Point Press| page=95| isbn=978-0865475120}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an important professional mentor to her. Screenwriter [[Jenny Lumet]], known for her award-winning screenplay ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'', is Horne's granddaughter, the daughter of filmmaker [[Sidney Lumet]] and Horne's daughter Gail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Ella unenchanted goes to a wedding – Demme explores concept of family| work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| date=October 10, 2008| last=Ebert| first=Roger| author-link=Roger Ebert| page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her other grandchildren include Gail's other daughter, Amy Lumet, and her son's four children, Thomas, William, Samadhi, and Lena. Her great-grandchildren include [[Jake Cannavale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/heavy-metal-rocker-and-broadways-new-fish-get-to-know-bobby-cannavales-teenage-son-jake-342144| title=Heavy Metal Rocker and Broadway's New Fish: Get to Know Bobby Cannavale's Teenage Son, Jake| work=Playbill| date=February 20, 2015| last=Gioia| first=Michael| accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1946 to 1962, Horne resided in a [[St. Albans, Queens]], New York, enclave of prosperous African Americans, where she counted among her neighbors, [[Fats Waller]], [[Count Basie]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], and other jazz luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prrac.org/newsletters/janfebmar2017.pdf "This Green and Pleasant Land"] by Bryan Greene, in Poverty and Race, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Horne died on May 9, 2010.  Her funeral took place at St. Ignatius Loyola Church on Park Avenue in New York. Thousands gathered and attendees included [[Leontyne Price]], [[Dionne Warwick]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jessye Norman]], [[Chita Rivera]], [[Cicely Tyson]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Lauren Bacall]], [[Robert Osborne]], [[Audra McDonald]], and [[Vanessa L. Williams|Vanessa Williams]].  After the service, her remains were cremated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=James| last=Barron| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/nyregion/15horne.html| title=Lena Horne, Who Moved Barriers and Emotions, Is Remembered| work=The New York Times|| date=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2003, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] announced that [[Janet Jackson]] would star as Horne in a television biographical film. In the weeks following Jackson's "[[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction]]" debacle during the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII|2004 Super Bowl]], however, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that Horne had demanded Jackson be dropped from the project. "ABC executives resisted Horne's demand", according to the [[Associated Press]] report, "but Jackson representatives told the trade newspaper that she left willingly after Horne and her daughter, Gail Lumet Buckley, asked that she not take part." [[Oprah Winfrey]] stated to [[Alicia Keys]] during a 2005 interview on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' that she might possibly consider producing the biopic herself, casting Keys as Horne.&lt;ref name=BET&gt;{{cite news| title=Where Is the Lena Horne Biopic?| last=Cane| first=Clay| url=http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/movie-reviews/what-the-flick-blog-reviews/2012/2/where-is-the-lena-horne-biopic.html| publisher=BET News| date=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, [[Blue Note Records]], her label for more than a decade, announced that "the finishing touches have been put on a collection of rare and unreleased recordings by the legendary Horne made during her time on Blue Note." Remixed by her longtime producer Rodney Jones, the recordings featured Horne with a remarkably secure voice for a woman of her years, and include versions of such signature songs as "[[Something to Live For (Billy Strayhorn song)|Something to Live For]]", "[[Chelsea Bridge (Billy Strayhorn song)|Chelsea Bridge]]", and "[[Stormy Weather (song)|Stormy Weather]]". The album, originally titled ''Soul'' but renamed ''Seasons of a Life'', was released on January 24, 2006. In 2007, Horne was portrayed by [[Leslie Uggams]] as the older Lena and Nikki Crawford as the younger Lena in the stage musical ''Stormy Weather'' staged at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]] in California (January to March 2009). In 2011, Horne was also portrayed by actress Ryan Jillian in a one-woman show titled ''Notes from A Horne'' staged at the Susan Batson studio in New York City, from November 2011 to February 2012. The [[83rd Academy Awards]] presented a tribute to Horne by actress [[Halle Berry]] at the ceremony held February 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Halle Berry Pays Tribute to Lena Horne at Oscars| url=http://www.essence.com/2011/02/28/lena-horne-tribute-oscars-halle-berry| work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]| date=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a [[Forever stamp]] depicting Horne began to be issued; this made Horne the 41st honoree in the Black Heritage stamp series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillytrib.com/entertainment/lena-horne-honored-with-postage-stamp/article_01417d19-4ec5-5b84-a691-77211cfcc89b.html |title=Lena Horne honored with postage stamp &amp;#124; Entertainment |publisher=phillytrib.com |date=1917-06-30 |accessdate=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article lists [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British police]] officers killed in the line of duty since 1900.

Thousands of police officers in Britain are believed to have died during the course of their duties, but this article includes only those who were killed as a direct result of a [[crime]] or while attempting to prevent, stop or solve a specific criminal act. The list omits those who died in more regular circumstances such as [[traffic collision]]s, and the many killed by [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raids during the Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.policememorial.org.uk/index.php?page=roll-of-honour Roll of Honour], Policememorial.org.uk; accessed 1 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The list also omits the more than 300 officers of the former [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalulsterconstabulary.org/deceased_c.htm|title=Royal Ulster Constabulary|website=Royalulsterconstabulary.org|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and current [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] who were killed during [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland.

==List==
&lt;!-- Please note that some police services, such as the Metropolitan Police Service, have different historical names (in MPS's case, just "Metropolitan Police" before 1989) --&gt;

[[File:Singapore Police Heritage Centre 1.jpg|right|thumb|On display at the Police Heritage Centre, are the names of all Singaporean police officers killed in the line of duty since 1900 mounted on a board on the wall behind the statue.]]

This is a '''list of police officers from the [[Singapore Police Force]] who were killed in the line of duty''', based on official records from the year 1900 to date. Line of duty deaths refers to any police officer who has died while carrying out duty which he is obligated and/or authorised to carry out. This would include officers who respond to incidents while off-duty as obligated by the [[Police Force Act]], as well as those commuting to and from their place of duty or training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/non_version/cgi-bin/cgi_retrieve.pl?&amp;actno=Reved-235&amp;date=latest&amp;method=part Police Force Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Singapore establishment generally avoids personalising or glorifying acts of personal sacrifice in contemporary Singaporean society, and this applies to the police force as well. There has been no public memorial or monument dedicated to police officer deaths until the opening of the Police Heritage Centre in the Police Headquarters at [[New Phoenix Park]] on 15 August 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spf.gov.sg/prints/plm/2007/aug07_pg03.htm Police Life Monthly&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; where a Commemorative Gallery features a wall inscribed with the names of all fallen officers. Although open to the public, access to the centre is restricted via an appointment-only policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporeedu.gov.sg/htm/cor/cor04g.htm Singapore Education : Corporate Training Programmes : The Police Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415222011/http://www.singaporeedu.gov.sg/htm/cor/cor04g.htm |date=15 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are otherwise no readily accessible published lists of all fallen officers' names whether in print or electronically.

Fallen officers are, however, honoured and commemorated through ceremonies or functions, such as a one-minute silence observed during the annual Police Day Parade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/280058/1/.html Channelnewsasia.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Police funerals featuring a flag draped casket, a [[3-volley salute|three-volley salute]], and a procession, amongst other elements, may be organised depending on the circumstance of death. Most funerals in recent years are much simpler affairs, partly as many of these deaths are attributed to accidents, but many of these ceremonies still receive local media coverage. Other ways of commemoration may include posthumous promotions and the awarding of [[Singaporean orders and decorations|state medals]]; there has been seven posthumous promotions and two posthumous [[Pingat Keberanian Polis|Police Medal of Valour]] awardees since the 1990s.

===Victims' Profile===
The average age of slain police officers is 29.3 years of age, excluding 62 officers whose age were not reported. The highest number of casualties were in the 21–25 age band, making up 31.7% amongst officers whose age were reported, followed closely by those in the 26–30 age band, who make up 28.3%. While relative inexperience may be a factor, the generally young profile of police officers in Singapore and their greater probability of facing operational danger as frontline officers may also contribute to their premature deaths.

The ethnic profile of police officers has been traditionally disproportionate compared to the national ethnic profile, with a significantly higher proportion of ethnic Malays especially in the earlier decades. However, the number of casualties involving ethnic Chinese police officers are statistically higher overall due in part to the high mortality rates involving the ethnic Chinese community during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore]] in the 1940s, and they make up 60.7% of total deaths.

Tshele was the first of the four to be shot at a water supply protest on 13 January 2014 in Mothutlung, South Africa. Hyde Mophoso, a police officer, opened fire using banned SSG ammunition on the crowd of protesters, where Tshele was photographing broken water pipes.&lt;ref name=9news24&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.news24.com/news24/SouthAfrica/News/cop-guilty-of-murdering-protesters-20160121|title=Cop guilty of murdering protesters|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tshele was not armed and according to a fellow, surviving protester, "the only threat he posed was that his camera was recording evidence of what the police were doing." He was insulted and assaulted by police who confiscated his cellphone and camera, deleting the pictures.&lt;ref name=enca&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.enca.com/south-africa/sanef-demands-justice-mothotlung-death|title=Sanef demands justice for Mothotlung death|author=eNCA|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial accounts suggest that Tschele's hands were raised high when the officer shot him. He died from injuries a few days later.&lt;ref name="southafricatoday"/&gt;&lt;ref name=afronline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afronline.org/?tag=mike-tshele|title=Mike Tshele «  Afronline – The Voice Of Africa|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warrant Officer Mophosho was convicted two years later for three of the murders and for two other attempted murders.&lt;ref name="9news24"/&gt;

== Context ==
Tshele was killed after the [[apartheid]] era, which was a period of racial segregation in [[South Africa]]. During the time of the water supply protest where Tshele was killed, three local water pumps were broken down.&lt;ref name=3news24&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Still-no-water-in-some-Mothutlung-households-20140117|title=Still no water in some Mothutlung households|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of angry citizens gathered around the pumps to protest the issue, where it soon turned violent when police fired on the protesters.&lt;ref name=suspect&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Cop-appears-for-protest-killings-in-Pretoria-20150521|title=Cop appears for protest killings in Pretoria|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
Although shy, Tshele was an active member of his community and led several organizations, including the Matabele Burial Society, his local United Christian Democratic Party and his local [[Moroka Swallows]] fan club. He was a survivor of the abuse of the apartheid era.&lt;ref name="citypress"/&gt;

== Reactions ==
Tshele's death, along the three others, was a "'symptom' of increasing police brutality and growing attacks on the right to protest," according to the [[Right2Know]] campaign.&lt;ref name=7news24&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/R2K-Mothutlung-a-symptom-of-police-brutality-20140120|title=R2K: Mothutlung a symptom of police brutality|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day he was buried at a local cemetery hundreds of residents, many who were also at the protest, were present. As he was being buried they broke out into song and dance to pay their respects.&lt;ref name=mg /&gt;&lt;ref name=4news24&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/Archives/City-Press/Its-not-really-about-water-20150429|title=It's not really about water|work=News24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De La Torre''' (born 6 October 1958) is a professor of [[Social Ethics]] and [[Latinx Studies]] at [[Iliff School of Theology]], a scholar-activist, author, and an ordained [[Southern Baptist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miguel A.

==Biography==

Born in [[Cuba]] months before the [[Cuban Revolution|Castro Revolution]], De La Torre and his family [[Cuban immigration to the United States|migrated to the United States]] as [[refugees]] when he was an [[infant]]. For a while the [[U.S. government]] considered him and his family as "[[illegal aliens]]". On 6 June 1960, De La Torre received an order from [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to "[[self-deport]]." He attended [[Blessed Sacrament School (Queens, New York)|Blessed Sacrament]], a Catholic elementary school in [[Queens, New York]], and was [[Baptism (Catholic Church)|baptized]] and [[confirmed]] by the [[Catholic Church]]. Simultaneously, his parents were [[Santería|priest/priestess]] of the religion [[Santería]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Miguel A. De La Torre, author of ''Santería''|url=http://ww.bibleintro.com/Interviews/delatorreinterview.htm|website=ww.bibleintro.com|publisher=[[Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|accessdate=26 December 2017|date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to himself as a "Southern Baptist, Roman Catholic child of [[Ellegúa]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=De La Torre|first1=Miguel|title=I’m a Southern Baptist, Roman Catholic Child of Elegguá – Deal with It|url=https://cubacounterpoints.com/archives/2633|website=[[Cuba Counterpoints]]|accessdate=26 December 2017|date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left Queens, moving to [[Miami, Florida]] in his teens.

At nineteen years of age he began a real estate company in Miami called Championship Realty, [[Century 21 Real Estate|Century 21]]; becoming at the time the youngest [[real estate broker]] in the State of Florida. The office grew to over 100 sales agents. During this time he obtained a [[Master's degree|Masters]] in [[Public Administration]] from [[American University]] in [[Washington, DC]]. Eventually he was elected president of the [[Miami Board of Realtors]]. He was also active in local politics, becoming the founding president of the West [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade]] Young [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]. In 1988 he was a candidate for the [[Florida House of Representatives]], District 115, but lost to [[Mario Díaz-Balart]].

In his early twenties he became a "[[born-again]]" Christian, joining [[University Baptist Church (Coral Gables, Florida)|University Baptist Church]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. In 1992, De La Torre dissolved the thirteen-year-old real estate company to attend [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in order to obtain a [[Master of Divinity]] and enter the ministry. During his [[seminary]] training he served as [[pastor]] at a rural congregation, [[Goshen Baptist Church]] in [[Glen Dean, Kentucky]]. While doing pastoral work in rural Kentucky, De La Torre had experiences that caused him to begin exploring the church's power structures and what the dominant European American culture could learn from the [[Latino/a]] margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De La Torre|first1=Miguel A.|editor1-last=Kujawa-Holbrook|editor1-first=Sheryl A.|editor2-last=Montagno|editor2-first=Karen Brown|title=Injustice and the Care of Souls: Taking Oppression Seriously in Pastoral Care|date=2009|publisher=[[Fortress Press]]|isbn=0800662350|pages=59–72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKzZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 December 2017|chapter=Pastoral Care from the Latina/o Margins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

De La Torre continued his theological training and obtained a [[doctorate]] from [[Temple University]] in social ethics in 1999. According to the books he published, he focuses on ethics within contemporary U.S. thought, specifically how [[religion]] affects [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[Social class|class]], and [[Oppression#Gender oppression|gender oppression]]. His works 1) applies a [[social scientific]] approach to Latino/a religiosity within this country;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A guide to Hispanics and religion in the U.S.|url=http://www.religionlink.com/source-guides/a-guide-to-hispanics-and-religion-in-the-u-s/|website=[[ReligionLink]]|accessdate=26 December 2017|date=4 December 2006|quote=Updated on 19 June 2014.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2) studies [[Liberation theologies]] in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]] (specifically in Cuba);&lt;ref name="Henken2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ted Henken|title=Cuba: A Global Studies Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv7anQoCbzgC&amp;pg=PA535|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-984-9|page=535}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 3) engages in [[postmodern]]/[[postcolonial]] [[social theory]]. De La Torre is considered to be the most published Latinx in the field of religious studies with over thirty books and hundreds of articles.

In 1999 he was hired to teach [[Christian Ethics]] at [[Hope College]] in [[Holland, Michigan]]. In 2005 he wrote a column for the local newspaper, ''[[The Holland Sentinel]]'', titled "When the [[Bible]] is Used for Hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=De La Torre|first1=Miguel|title=When the Bible Is Used For Hate|url=http://www.ethicsdaily.com/news.php?viewStory=5314|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=[[EthicsDaily.com]]|date=2 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was a satirical piece commenting on [[Focus on the Family]]'s [[James Dobson]] outing of [[SpongeBob SquarePants]]. Dobson responded to the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dobson|first1=James|title=Political Bias Distorted Facts|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=HSHH%7C&amp;p_product=HSHH&amp;p_theme=gatehouse&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Political%20bias%20distorted%20facts%20AND%20date(1/16/2005%20to%203/2/2005)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/16/2005%20to%203/2/2005)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Political%20bias%20distorted%20facts)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=[[Holland Sentinel]]|date=11 February 2005|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy over these articles ensued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversy on Campus|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_multi=HSHH%7c&amp;p_product=HSHH&amp;p_theme=gatehouse&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Controversy%20on%20campus%20AND%20date(1/1/2006%20to%201/3/2006)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1/1/2006%20to%201/3/2006)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Controversy%20on%20campus)|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=Holland Sentinel|date=2 January 2006|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months afterwards, De La Torre was forced to resign his tenure and took the position of associate professor for social ethics at [[Iliff School of Theology]] in [[Denver, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jaschik|first1=Scott|title=Did SpongeBob Article Cost Professor a Job?|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/04/28/hope|accessdate=26 December 2017|work=[[Inside Higher Ed]]|date=28 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He became a full professor in 2010.

The '''Mountain Meadows Massacre''' was a series of attacks on the [[Baker–Fancher party|Baker–Fancher]] emigrant [[wagon train]], at [[Mountain Meadows, Utah|Mountain Meadows]] in Utah. The attacks began on September 7, 1857, and culminated on September 11, 1857, resulting in the mass slaughter of the emigrant party by members of the [[Nauvoo Legion#In Utah|Utah Territorial Militia]] from the [[Iron County, Utah|Iron County]] district. The militia, officially called the [[Nauvoo Legion]], was composed of southern Utah's [[Mormon]] settlers (members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], or the LDS Church). 

The wagon train, mostly families from [[Arkansas]], was bound for [[California]] on a route that passed through the [[Utah Territory]], during a conflict later known as the [[Utah War]]. While the emigrants were camped at the meadow, nearby militia leaders organized an attack on the wagon train.

Intending to give the appearance of Native American aggression, the militia's plan was to arm some [[Southern Paiute]]s and persuade them to join with a larger party of their own militiamen—disguised as Native Americans—in an attack. The extent to which the Paiutes participated in the massacre is disputed, with some early reports — since discredited — placing much of the blame for the massacre to the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-aftermath-of-mountain-meadows-110735627/&lt;/ref&gt; During the militia's first assault on the wagon train the emigrants fought back, and a five-day siege ensued. Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men and had likely discovered the identity of their attackers. As a result militia commander [[William H. Dame]] ordered his forces to kill the emigrants—about 120 men, women, and children in total. Seventeen children, all younger than seven, were spared.

Following the [[massacre]], the perpetrators hastily buried the victims. Local families took in the surviving children, and many of the victims' possessions were sold by auction.  Investigations, after interruption by the [[American Civil War]], resulted in nine indictments during 1874.  Of the men indicted, only [[John D. Lee]] was tried in a court of law.  After two trials in the Utah Territory, Lee was convicted by a jury, sentenced to death, and executed by a [[Capital punishment in Utah#Method|firing squad]] on March 23, 1877.

Today, historians attribute the massacre to a combination of factors, including [[War hysteria preceding the Mountain Meadows massacre|war hysteria]] about possible invasion of Mormon territory and hyperbolic [[Mountain Meadows massacre and Mormon theology|Mormon teachings]] against outsiders, which were part of the excesses of the [[Mormon Reformation]] period. 

==History==
===Baker–Fancher party===
{{main|Baker–Fancher party}}
In early 1857, the several groups of emigrants from the northwestern [[Arkansas]] region started their trek to [[California]], when they later joined all together to form a group known as the [[Baker–Fancher party]]. The groups were mostly from [[Marion County, Arkansas|Marion]], [[Crawford County, Arkansas|Crawford]], [[Carroll County, Arkansas|Carroll]], and [[Johnson County, Arkansas|Johnson]] counties in Arkansas, and had assembled into a [[wagon train]] at Beller's Stand, south of [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], to emigrate to southern California. This group was initially referred to as both the Baker train and the Perkins train, but after being joined by other Arkansas trains and making its way west, was soon called the Baker–Fancher train (or party). It was named for "Colonel" Alexander Fancher who, having already made the journey to California twice before, had become its main leader.&lt;ref&gt;Bagley (2002), pp. 55–68; Finck (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; By contemporary standards the Baker–Fancher party was prosperous, carefully organized, and well-equipped for the journey.&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft (1889) p. 545; Linn (1902) Chap. XVI, 4th full paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined along the way by families and individuals from other states, including [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;Bancroft (1889) p. 544; Gibbs (1910) p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This group was relatively wealthy and planned to restock its supplies in [[Salt Lake City]], as did most wagon trains at the time. The party reached Salt Lake City with about 120 members.

===Interactions with Mormon settlers===
{{See also|War hysteria preceding the Mountain Meadows massacre}}
At the time of the Fanchers' arrival, the [[Utah Territory]] was organized as a [[theodemocracy|theocratic democracy]] under the lead of [[Brigham Young]], who had established colonies along the [[California Trail]] and [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]]. President [[James Buchanan]] had recently issued an order to send troops to Utah. Rumors spread in the territory about the motives for the federal troop movement. Young issued various orders, urging the local population to prepare for the arrival of the troops. Eventually Young issued a declaration of [[martial law]].&lt;ref name="Shirts, 1994 Paragraph 2"&gt;Shirts, (1994) Paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baker–Fancher party  were refused stocks in Salt Lake City and chose to leave there and take the Old Spanish Trail, which passed through southern Utah. In August 1857, the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Mormon apostle]] [[George A. Smith]], of [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]], traveled throughout southern Utah, instructing the settlers to stockpile grain. While on his return trip to Salt Lake City, Smith camped near the Baker–Fancher party on August 25 at Corn Creek, (near present-day [[Kanosh, Utah|Kanosh]]) {{convert|70|mi|km}} north of Parowan. They had traveled the {{convert|165|mi|km}} south from Salt Lake City, and [[Jacob Hamblin]] suggested that the wagon train continue on the trail and rest their cattle at Mountain Meadows, which had good pasture and was adjacent to his homestead.
[[File:Christopher Fancher.jpg|thumb|Christopher Kit Fancher (survivor of the Mountain Meadows Massacre)]]

While many witnesses said that the Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about aggressive and threatening behavior and other misdeeds. Brevet Major [[James Henry Carleton]] led the first federal investigation of the murders, published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin's account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek; this resulted in the deaths of 18 head of cattle and two or three people who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father of a child who allegedly died from this poisoned spring, and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth.&lt;ref name="Carleton 1859"&gt;{{Harvnb|Carleton|1859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracy and siege===
{{main|Conspiracy and siege of the Mountain Meadows massacre}}
The Baker–Fancher party left Corn Creek and continued the {{convert|125|mi|km}} to Mountain Meadows, passing Parowan, and [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]]; southern Utah communities led respectively by [[Stake President]]s [[William H. Dame]] and [[Isaac C. Haight]]. Haight and Dame were, in addition, the senior regional military leaders of the [[Nauvoo Legion|Mormon militia]]. As the Baker–Fancher party approached, several meetings were held in Cedar City and nearby Parowan by the local [[Latter Day Saint]] (LDS) leaders pondering how to implement Young's declaration of martial law.&lt;ref&gt;Shirts (1994), Paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon of Sunday, September 6, Haight held his weekly Stake [[High council (Latter Day Saints)|High Council]] meeting after church services, and brought up the issue of what to do with the emigrants.&lt;ref name="Morrill 1876"&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrill|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan for a Native American massacre was discussed, but not all the Council members agreed it was the right approach.&lt;ref name="Morrill 1876"/&gt; The Council resolved to take no action until Haight sent a rider, James Haslam, out the next day to carry an express to Salt Lake City (a six-day round trip on horseback) for Brigham Young's advice, as Utah did not yet have a [[telegraph]] system.&lt;ref name="Morrill 1876"/&gt; Following the Council, Isaac C. Haight decided to send a messenger south to John D. Lee.&lt;ref name="Morrill 1876"/&gt; What Haight told Lee remains a mystery, but considering the timing it may have had something to do with Council's decision to wait for advice from Brigham Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Walker |first= Ronald W., Richard E. Turley, JR., Glen M. Leonard |title= Massacre at Mountain Meadows |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2008 | page= 157 |isbn= 0-19-516034-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The somewhat dispirited Baker–Fancher party found water and fresh grazing for its livestock after reaching grassy, mountain-ringed Mountain Meadows, a widely known stopover on the old Spanish Trail, in early September. They anticipated several days of rest and recuperation there before the next {{convert|40|mi|km}} would take them out of Utah. But, on September 7, the party was attacked by Mormon militiamen dressed as Native Americans and some Native American [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]]s.&lt;ref name="Shirts, 1994 Paragraph 8"&gt;Shirts, (1994) Paragraph 8&lt;/ref&gt; The Baker–Fancher party defended itself by encircling and lowering their wagons, wheels chained together, along with digging shallow trenches and throwing dirt both below and into the wagons, which made a strong barrier. Seven emigrants were killed during the opening attack and were buried somewhere within the wagon encirclement. Sixteen more were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Penrose|1885|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brigham Young 1986 p. 257"&gt;Brigham Young: American Moses, Leonard J. Arrington, University of Illinois Press, (1986), p. 257&lt;/ref&gt; The attack continued for five days, during which the besieged families had little or no access to fresh water or game food and their ammunition was depleted.&lt;ref name="Shirts, 1994 Paragraph 8"/&gt; Meanwhile, organization among the local Mormon leadership reportedly broke down.&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, (1994) Paragraph 6&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually fear spread among the militia's leaders that some emigrants had caught sight of white men, and had probably discovered who their attackers really were. This resulted in an order to kill all the emigrants, with the exception of small children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Massacre at Mountain Meadows |last1=Walker |first1=Ronald W. |last2=Turley |first2=Richard E. |last3=Leonard |first3=Glen M. |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-516034-5 |pages=174, 178–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killings and aftermath of the massacre===
{{Main|Killings and aftermath of the Mountain Meadows massacre}}

On Friday, September 11, 1857, two militiamen approached the Baker–Fancher party wagons with a white flag and were soon followed by [[Indian Agent]] and militia officer [[John D. Lee]]. Lee told the battle-weary emigrants that he had negotiated a truce with the Paiutes, whereby they could be escorted safely the {{convert|36|mi|km}} back to Cedar City under Mormon protection in exchange for turning all of their livestock and supplies over to the Native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Shirts, (1994) Paragraph 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Accepting this, the emigrants were led out of their fortification. The adult men were separated from the women and children. The men were paired with a militia escort. When a signal was given, the militiamen turned and shot the male members of the Baker–Fancher party standing by their side. The women and children were then ambushed and killed by more militia that were hiding in nearby bushes and ravines. Members of the militia were sworn to secrecy. A plan was set to blame the massacre on the Native Americans. The militia did not kill at least seventeen children who were under the age of 7 and deemed too young to relate the story. These children were taken in by local Mormon families; seventeen of the children were later reclaimed through the efforts of the U.S. Army and returned to relatives in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 1950, pp. 101–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the property of the dead was reportedly taken by the Native Americans involved, while large amounts of their valuables and cattle were taken by the Mormons in southern Utah, including John D. Lee. Some of the cattle were taken to Salt Lake City and sold or traded. The remaining personal property of the Baker–Fancher party was taken to the tithing house at Cedar City and auctioned off to local Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, 1950.

===Investigations and prosecutions===
{{Main|Investigations and prosecutions relating to the Mountain Meadows massacre}}
An early investigation was conducted by Brigham Young,&lt;ref name="Brigham Young 1986 p. 257"/&gt; who interviewed John D. Lee on September 29, 1857. In 1858, Young sent a report to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs stating that the massacre was the work of Native Americans. The [[Utah War]] delayed any investigation by the U.S. federal government until 1859, when Jacob Forney,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forney|1859|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. Army [[Brevet (military)|Brevet]] Major [[James Henry Carleton]] conducted investigations. In Carleton's investigation, at Mountain Meadows he found women's hair tangled in sage brush and the bones of children still in their mothers' arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fisher|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carleton later said it was "a sight which can never be forgotten." After gathering up the skulls and bones of those who had died, Carleton's troops buried them and erected a [[cairn]] and cross.

Carleton interviewed a few local Mormon settlers and Paiute Native American chiefs, and concluded that there was Mormon involvement in the massacre.  He issued a report in May 1859, addressed to the U.S. Assistant Adjutant-General, setting forth his findings.  Jacob Forney, Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Utah, also conducted an investigation that included visiting the region in the summer of 1859 and retrieved many of the surviving children of massacre victims who had been housed with Mormon families, and gathered them in preparation of transporting them to their relatives in Arkansas.  Forney concluded that the Paiutes did not act alone and the massacre would not have occurred without the white settlers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Forney|1859|p=1}};&lt;/ref&gt; while Carleton's report to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] called the mass killings a "heinous crime",&lt;ref name="Carleton 1859"/&gt; blaming both local and senior church leaders for the massacre.

A federal judge brought into the territory after the Utah War, Judge [[John Cradlebaugh]], in March 1859 convened a grand jury in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] concerning the massacre, but the jury declined any indictments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cradlebaugh|1859|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Carrington|1859|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Cradlebaugh conducted a tour of the Mountain Meadows area with a military escort.&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Bagley|2004|p=225"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bagley|2004|p=225}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cradlebaugh attempted to arrest John D. Lee, Isaac Haight, and John Higbee, but these men fled before they could be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bagley|2004|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cradlebaugh publicly charged Brigham Young as an instigator to the massacre and therefore an "accessory before the fact."&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Bagley|2004|p=225"/&gt;  Possibly as a protective measure against the mistrusted federal court system, Mormon territorial probate court judge Elias Smith arrested Young under a territorial warrant, perhaps hoping to divert any trial of Young into a friendly Mormon territorial court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bagley|2004|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When no federal charges ensued, Young was apparently released.&lt;ref name="Harvtxt|Bagley|2004|p=225"/&gt;

Further investigations, cut short by the [[American Civil War]] in 1861,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brooks|1950|p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; again proceeded in 1871 when prosecutors obtained the affidavit of militia member Philip Klingensmith. Klingensmith had been a [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop]] and blacksmith from Cedar City; by the 1870s, however, he had [[ex-Mormon|left the church]] and moved to [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|2006|p=315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1870s Lee,&lt;ref&gt;Lee was arrested on November 7, 1874. "John D. Lee Arrested", ''Deseret News'', November 18, 1874, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Dame, Philip Klingensmith and two others (Ellott Willden and George Adair, Jr.) were indicted and arrested while warrants were obtained to pursue the arrests of four others (Haight, Higbee,  William C. Stewart and Samuel Jukes) who had gone into hiding. Klingensmith escaped prosecution by agreeing to testify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html Tragedy at Mountain Meadows Massacre: Toward a Consensus Account and Time Line] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726075143/http://library.dixie.edu/info/Collections/Brooks/TragedyatMountainMeadowsMassacre.html |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigham Young [[excommunication|removed]] some participants including Haight and Lee from the LDS Church in 1870. The U.S. posted bounties of $500 ({{inflation|US|500|1870|fmt=eq}}) each for the capture of Haight, Higbee and Stewart, while prosecutors chose not to pursue their cases against Dame, Willden and Adair.

Lee's first trial began on July 23, 1875, in [[Beaver, Utah|Beaver]], before a jury of eight Mormons and four non-Mormons.&lt;ref&gt;"The Lee Trial", ''Deseret News'', July 28, 1875, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  This trial led to a [[hung jury]] on August 5, 1875.  Lee's second trial began September 13, 1876, before an all-Mormon jury. The prosecution called Daniel Wells, Laban Morrill, Joel White, Samuel Knight, Samuel McMurdy, Nephi Johnson, and [[Jacob Hamblin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1877|pp=317–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee also stipulated, against advice of counsel, that the prosecution be allowed to re-use the depositions of Young and Smith from the previous trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1877|pp=302–03}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee called no witnesses in his defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1877|p=378}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This time, Lee was convicted.

At Lee's sentencing, as required by Utah Territory statute, he was given the option of being hanged, shot, or beheaded, and he chose to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;"Territorial Dispatches: the Sentence of Lee", ''Deseret News'', October 18, 1876, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1877, before being executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 23, 1877, Lee professed that he was a [[scapegoat]] for others involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1877|pp=225–226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Brigham Young stated that Lee's fate was just, but not a sufficient [[blood atonement]], given the enormity of the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|1877|p=242}} (Young was asked after Lee's execution if he believed in [[blood atonement]]. Young replied, "I do, and I believe that Lee has not half atoned for his great crime".)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and analysis of the massacre==
===Media coverage about the event===
{{Main|Mountain Meadows massacre and the media|Mountain Meadows massacre and Mormon public relations}}
[[Image:MMM-Harpersw8-13-1859.jpg|right|thumb|The cover of the August 13, 1859, issue of ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'' illustrating the killing field as described by Brevet Major Carleton  "one too horrible and sickening for language to describe. Human skeletons, disjointed bones, ghastly skulls and the hair of women were scattered in frightful profusion over a distance of two miles." "the remains were not buried at all until after they had been dismembered by the wolves and the flesh stripped from the bones, and then only such bones were buried as lay scattered along nearest the road".]]

The first published report on the incident was made in 1859 by Carleton, who had been tasked by the U.S. Army to investigate the incident and bury the still exposed corpses at Mountain Meadows.&lt;ref&gt;Brevet Major J.H. Carleton's Report to his commanding officer. (1859)&lt;/ref&gt; Although the massacre was covered to some extent in the media during the 1850s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyman|2004| p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first period of intense nation-wide publicity about the massacre began around 1872, after investigators obtained Klingensmith's confession. In 1867 C.V. Waite published "An Authentic History Of Brigham Young" which described the events. In 1872, [[Mark Twain]] commented on the massacre through the lens of contemporary American public opinion in an appendix to his semi-autobiographical travel book ''[[Roughing It]]''. In 1873, the massacre was a prominent feature of a history by [[T. B. H. Stenhouse]], ''[[The Rocky Mountain Saints]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stenhouse|1873}}.&lt;/ref&gt; National newspapers covered the Lee trials closely from 1874 to 1876, and his execution in 1877 was widely covered.

===Historians===
The massacre has been treated extensively by several historical works, beginning with Lee's own ''Confession'' in 1877, expressing his opinion that [[George A. Smith]] was sent to southern Utah by Brigham Young to direct the massacre and stating that the local church and city leaders had prayed together in a circle and told him it was their duty to kill the emigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lee|1877|pp=234–235}} "The men then in council, I must here state, now knelt down in a prayer circle and prayed, invoking the Spirit of God to direct them how to act in the matter. After prayer, Major Higbee said, "Here are the orders," and handed me a paper from Haight [the Stake President]. It was in substance that it was the orders of Haight to decoy the emigrants from their position, and kill all of them that could talk. The substance of the orders were that the emigrants should be decoyed from their strong-hold, and all exterminated, so that no one would be left to tell the tale, and then the authorities could say it was done by the Indians. ... Charles Hopkins, a man that I had great confidence in, came to me from the Council, and tried to comfort me by saying that he believed it was all right, for the brethren in the Priesthood were all united in the thing, and it would not be well for me to oppose them. ...At the earnest solicitation of Brother Hopkins, I returned with him to the Council. When I got back, the Council again prayed for aid. The Council was called, The City Counselors, the Church or High Counselors; and all in authority, together with the private citizens, then formed a circle, and kneeling down, so that elbows would touch each other, several of the brethren prayed for Divine instructions. After prayer, Major Higbee said, 'I have the evidence of God's approval of our mission. It is God's will that we carry out our instructions to the letter.' ... The meeting was then addressed by some one in authority, I do not remember who it was. He spoke in about this language: 'Brethren, we have been sent here to perform a duty. It is a duty that we owe to God, and to our Church and people. The orders of those in authority are that all the emigrants must die. Our leaders speak with inspired tongues, and their orders come from the God of Heaven. We have no right to question what they have commanded us to do; it is our duty to obey.'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Confessions and Statement of John D. Lee|url=http://law2.umkc.edu:80/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/leeconfession.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208034549/http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mountainmeadows/leeconfession.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 8, 2016|website=umkc.edu|publisher=The University of Missouri - Kansas City|accessdate=15 September 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, the massacre was the subject of a short book by Josiah F. Gibbs, who also attributed responsibility for the massacre to Young and Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gibbs|1910}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, the massacre was described in [[Jack London]]'s novel "[[The Star Rover]]" from the point of view of a young boy, Jesse, son of Captain Fancher.  The first detailed and comprehensive work using modern historical methods was ''[[The Mountain Meadows Massacre (book)|The Mountain Meadows Massacre]]'' in 1950 by [[Juanita Brooks]], a Mormon scholar who lived near the area in southern Utah. Brooks found no evidence of direct involvement by Brigham Young, but charged him with obstructing the investigation and provoking the attack through his rhetoric.  The book uncovered inaccuracies in the LDS church's official history.&lt;ref&gt;[https://religionnews.com/2018/04/25/why-we-need-mormon-dissenters/ Why we need Mormon dissenters]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church reaction===
Initially, the LDS Church denied any involvement by Mormons, and was relatively silent on the issue. In 1872, it excommunicated some of the participants for their role in the massacre,&lt;ref name=Bagley2002&gt;{{Citation | last = Bagley | first = Will | year = 2002 | title = Blood of the prophets : Brigham Young and the massacre at Mountain Meadows | pages = 273 | isbn = 0-8061-3639-1 | publisher = University of Oklahoma Press | location = Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from that point the LDS Church has condemned the massacre and acknowledged involvement by local Mormon leaders.

Church officials discouraged historian Juanita Brooks from investigating the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Levi S. |last= Peterson |authorlink= Levi S.

===Historical theories explaining the massacre===
Historians have ascribed the massacre to a number of factors, including strident Mormon teachings in the years prior to the massacre, war hysteria, and alleged involvement of Brigham Young. According to author Sally Denton, the involvement of Young and other LDS Church leaders is further complicated by the LDS Church's reluctance to assume responsibility for the massacre, which, Denton argues, is because it would risk "calling into question Brigham Young's divinity and the Mormon belief that they are God's chosen people."&lt;ref name="DentonNYT"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Denton|first1=Sally|title=A Utah Massacre And Mormon Memory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/24/opinion/a-utah-massacre-and-mormon-memory.html|accessdate=11 September 2017|agency=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strident Mormon teachings====
{{Main|Mountain Meadows massacre and Mormon theology}}

For the decade prior to the Baker–Fancher party's arrival there, Utah Territory existed as a [[theodemocracy]] led by Brigham Young. During the mid-1850s, Young instituted a [[Mormon Reformation]], intending to "lay the axe at the root of the tree of sin and iniquity".&lt;ref&gt;In 1856, Young said "the government of God, as administered here" may to some seem "despotic" because "[i]t lays the axe at the root of the tree of sin and iniquity; judgment is dealt out against the transgression of the law of God"; however, "does not [it] give every person his rights?" {{Harvnb|Young|1856|p=256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mormon teachings during this era were dramatic and strident.

In addition, during the prior decades, the religion had undergone a period of intense [[religious persecution|persecution]] in the American Midwest, and faithful Mormons moved west to escape persecution in midwestern towns. In particular, they were [[Missouri Executive Order 44|officially expelled]] from the state of [[Missouri]] during the [[Mormon War (1838)|1838 Mormon War]], during which prominent [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon apostle]] [[David W. Patten]] was killed in battle. After Mormons moved to [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois, the religion's founder [[Joseph Smith]] and his brother [[Hyrum Smith]] were [[Death of Joseph Smith|killed in 1844]]. Just months before the Mountain Meadows Massacre, Mormons received word that yet another apostle had been killed: in April 1857, apostle [[Parley P. Pratt]] was shot in Arkansas by Hector McLean, the estranged husband of one of Pratt's [[plural marriage|plural wives]], Eleanor McLean Pratt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pratt|1975|pp=6, 24 n.26}} (Parley and Eleanor entered a [[Celestial marriage]] under the theocratic law of the Utah Territory), but Hector had refused Eleanor a divorce.  "When she left San Francisco she left Hector, and later she was to state in a court of law that she had left him as a wife the night he drove her from their home. Whatever the legal situation, she thought of herself as an unmarried woman."(p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  Mormon leaders immediately proclaimed Pratt as another [[martyr]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/MStar,2651 "Murder of Parley P. Pratt, One of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611202908/http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?%2FMStar%2C2651 |date=June 11, 2011 }}, JD 19(27):417 (July 4, 1857) ("Another Martyr has fallen – another faithful servant of God has sealed his pure and heavenly testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon with his blood."); {{Harvnb|Pratt|1975|p=16}}; "Reminiscences of Mrs. A.

In 1857, Mormon leaders taught that the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus was imminent,&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Young|Kimball|Hyde|Pratt|1845|p=5}} ("[t]here are those now living upon the earth who will live to see the consummation"). Based on a somewhat ambiguous statement by Joseph Smith, some Mormons believed that Jesus would return in 1891 {{Harvnb|Erickson|1996|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and that God would soon exact punishment against the United States for persecuting Mormons and martyring Joseph Smith, Hyrum Smith, Patten and Pratt.&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1854|p=148}} "[I]t is a stern fact that the people of the United States have shed the blood of the Prophets, driven out the Saints of God,… [c]onsequently I look for the Lord to use His whip on the refractory son called 'Uncle Sam'."&lt;/ref&gt;  In their [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|Endowment ceremony]], faithful early Latter-day Saints took an [[Oath of vengeance|oath]] to pray that God would take vengeance against the murderers.&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Heber C. Kimball]] (December 21, 1845); {{Harvnb|Beadle|1970|pp=496–97}} (describing the oath prior to 1970 as requiring a "private, immediate duty to avenge the death of the Prophet and Martyr, Joseph Smith"); [[George Q. Cannon]] (Daily Journal of Abraham H. Cannon, December 6, 1889, p. 205). In 1904, several witnesses said that the oath as it then existed was that participants would never cease to pray that God would avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation", and that they would teach this practice to their posterity "unto the 3rd and 4th generation" {{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|p=134}}. The oath was deleted from the ceremony in the early 20th century.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this oath, several Mormon apostles and other leaders considered it their religious duty to kill the prophets' murderers if they ever came across them.&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diary of [[Heber C. Kimball]] (December 21, 1845) (saying that in the temple he had "covenanted, and will never rest…until those men who killed Joseph &amp; Hyrum have been wiped out of the earth"); [[George Q. Cannon]] (Daily Journal of Abraham H. Cannon, December 6, 1889, p. 205) (stating that he understood that his Endowment in Nauvoo included "an oath against the murders of the Prophet Joseph as well as other prophets, and if he had ever met any of those who had taken a hand in that massacre he would undoubtedly have attempted to avenge the blood of the Martyrs").&lt;/ref&gt;

The sermons, blessings, and private counsel by Mormon leaders just before the Mountain Meadows Massacre can be understood as encouraging private individuals to execute God's judgment against the wicked.&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Daniel Davis, July 8, 1849, the LDS archives, as quoted in {{Harvnb|Quinn|1997|p=247}} (A Mormon who listened to a sermon by Young in 1849 recorded that Young said "if any one was catched stealing to shoot them dead on the spot and they should not be hurt for it."); {{Harvnb|Young|1856b|p=247}} (stating that a man would be justified in putting a javelin through his plural wife caught in the act of adultery, but anyone intending to "execute judgment…has got to have clean hands and a pure heart,…else they had better let the matter alone"); {{Harvnb|Young|1857|p=219}} ("[I]f [your neighbor] needs help, help him; and if he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in order that he may be saved, spill it"); {{Harvnb|Young|1857|p=311}} ("[I]n regard to those who have persecuted this people and driven them to the mountains, I intend to meet them on their own grounds.…I will tell you how it could be done, we could take the same law they have taken, viz., mobocracy, and if any miserable scounderels come here, cut their throats. (All the people said, Amen)."); {{Harvnb|Quinn|1997|p=260}} ("LDS leaders publicly and privately encouraged Mormons to consider it their right to kill antagonistic outsiders, common criminals, LDS apostates, and even faithful Mormons who committed sins "worthy of death.").&lt;/ref&gt;  In Cedar City, the teachings of church leaders were particularly strident.&lt;ref&gt;Mormons in Cedar City were taught that members should ignore dead bodies and go about their business. See Letter from Mary L. Campbell to [[Andrew Jenson]], January 24, 1892, LDS archives, in Moorman &amp; Sessions, ''Camp Floyd and the Mormons'', p. 142.  Col. William H. Dame, the ranking officer in southern Utah who ordered the Mountain Meadows Massacre, received a [[patriarchal blessing]] in 1854 that he would "be called to act at the head of a portion of thy Brethren and of the [[Lamanites]] (Native Americans) in the redemption of Zion and the avenging of the blood of the prophets upon them that dwell on the earth".  See Patriarchal blessing of William H. Dame, February 20, 1854, in Harold W. Pease, "The Life and Works of William Horne Dame", M.A. thesis, BYU, 1971, pp. 64–66.  In June 1857, Philip Klingensmith, another participant, was similarly blessed that he would participate in "avenging the blood of Brother Joseph". See Patriarchal blessing of Philip Klingensmith, Anna Jean Backus, ''Mountain Meadows Witness: The Life and Times of Bishop Philip Klingensmith'' (Spokane: Arthur H. Clark Co., 1995), pp. 118, 124; [http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/trappers,_traders,_and_explorers/thesaltlakecutoffandthecaliforniatrail.html  Salt Lake Cutoff and the California Trail]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018060135/http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/trappers%2C_traders%2C_and_explorers/thesaltlakecutoffandthecaliforniatrail.html |date=October 18, 2016 }};  [http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/trappers,_traders,_and_explorers/thespanishtrailcutapaththroughutah.html Spanish Trail Cut a Roundabout Path Through Utah]; {{Harvnb|Scott|1877}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, historians argue that southern Utah Mormons would have been particularly affected by an unsubstantiated rumor that the Baker–Fancher wagon train had been joined by a group of eleven miners and plainsmen who called themselves "Missouri Wildcats",&lt;ref&gt;if the Missouri Wildcats existed, it is unknown if the group stayed with the slow-moving Baker–Fancher party after leaving Salt Lake City.  See Brooks 1991, page xxi; Bagley (2002), p. 280 (referring to the "Missouri Wildcats" story as "Utah mythology").&lt;/ref&gt; some of whom reportedly taunted, vandalized and "caused trouble" for Mormons along the route. Various rumors asserted that the Wildcats had bragged of killing Mormons at [[Haun's Mill Massacre]];&lt;ref name="DentonPage155"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Denton|first1=Sally|title=American Massacre: The Tragedy at Mountain Meadows, September 1857|date=2007|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YPyDmKq0t34C&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2016|quote=Haight had used his pulpit to begin a defamation campaign against the Fancher Train.

====War hysteria====
[[Image:GeorgeAlbertSmith.jpg|thumb|left|[[George A. Smith]] [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] who met the Baker–Fancher party before touring [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]] and neighboring settlements before the massacre]]
{{Main|War hysteria preceding the Mountain Meadows massacre}}
The Mountain Meadows Massacre was caused in part by events relating to the [[Utah War]], an 1857 deployment toward the Utah Territory of the [[United States Army]], whose arrival was peaceful. In the summer of 1857, however, the Mormons expected an all-out invasion of [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] significance. From July to September 1857, Mormon leaders and their followers prepared for a siege.  Mormons were required to stockpile grain, and were enjoined against selling grain to emigrants for use as cattle feed. As far-off Mormon colonies retreated, [[Parowan, Utah|Parowan]] and Cedar City became isolated and vulnerable outposts. It has been reported that Brigham Young sought to enlist the help of Native American tribes in fighting the "Americans", encouraging them to steal cattle from emigrant trains, and to join Mormons in fighting the approaching army.&lt;ref name = "Lyman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyman|first1=Edward Leo|title=The Overland Journey from Utah to California: Wagon Travel from the City of Saints to the City of Angels|date=2008|publisher=[[University of Nevada Press]]|pages=128–129, 137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XAqxeKcaKu4C&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=March 12, 2018 | isbn=0874177529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have asserted that [[George A. Smith]]'s tour of southern Utah influenced the decision to attack and destroy the Fancher–Baker emigrant train near Mountain Meadows, Utah. He met with many of the eventual participants in the massacre, including W. H. Dame, Isaac Haight, John D. Lee and Chief Jackson, leader of a band of Paiutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Martineau|1857|}}&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that the militia was organized and ready to fight, and that some of them were eager to "fight and take vengeance for the cruelties that had been inflicted upon us in the States."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyman|2004| p=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among Smith's party were a number of Paiute Native American chiefs from the Mountain Meadows area. When Smith returned to Salt Lake, Brigham Young met with these leaders on September 1, 1857, and encouraged them to fight against the Americans in the anticipated clash with the U.S. Army. They were also offered all of the livestock then on the road to California, which included that belonging to the Baker–Fancher party.&lt;ref name = "Lyman"/&gt; The Native American chiefs were reluctant, and at least one objected they had previously been told not to steal, and declined the offer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtn-meadows-assoc.com/DepoJournals/Dimick/Dimick-2.htm Dimick B. Huntington Journal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425071112/http://www.mtn-meadows-assoc.com/DepoJournals/Dimick/Dimick-2.htm |date=April 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lyman"/&gt;

====Brigham Young====
{{Main|Brigham Young and the Mountain Meadows massacre}}
[[Image:Brigham Young.jpg|thumb|Historians debate the role of [[Brigham Young]] in the massacre.  Young was [[theodemocracy|theocratic]] leader of the Utah Territory at the time of the massacre.]]
There is a consensus among historians that Brigham Young played a role in provoking the massacre, at least unwittingly, and in concealing its evidence after the fact; however, they debate whether Young knew about the planned massacre ahead of time and whether he initially condoned it before later taking a strong public stand against it. Young's use of inflammatory and violent language&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacKinnon|2007|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the Federal expedition added to the tense atmosphere at the time of the attack. Following the massacre, Young stated in public forums that God had taken vengeance on the Baker–Fancher party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bagley|2002|p=247}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether Young held this view because he believed that this specific group posed an actual threat to colonists or because he believed that the group was directly responsible for past crimes against Mormons. However, in Young's only known correspondence prior to the massacre, he told the Church leaders in Cedar City:

{{quote|In regard to emigration trains passing through our settlements, we must not interfere with them until they are first notified to keep away. You must not meddle with them. The Indians we expect will do as they please but you should try and preserve good feelings with them. There are no other trains going south that I know of[.] [I]f those who are there will leave let them go in peace.&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young to Isaac C. Haight, 10 September 1857, Letterpress Copybook 3:827–28, Brigham Young Office Files, LDS Church Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to historian MacKinnon, "After the [Utah] war, U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] implied that face-to-face communications with Brigham Young might have averted the conflict, and Young argued that a north-south telegraph line in Utah could have prevented the Mountain Meadows Massacre."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacKinnon|2007|p=endnote 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon suggests that hostilities could have been avoided if Young had traveled east to Washington D.C. to resolve governmental problems instead of taking a five-week trip north on the eve of the Utah War for church related reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacKinnon|2007| p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern forensic assessment of a key affidavit, purportedly given by a elderly man named William Edwards in 1924, stating that when he was 15 years old he was ordered by Mormon leadership to assist the Indians in the attack, has complicated  the debate on complicity of senior Mormon leadership in the Mountain Meadows Massacre. Analysis indicates that Edwards's signature may have been traced and that the typeset belonged to a typewriter manufactured in the 1950s.  The Utah State Historical Society, who maintains the document in its archives, acknowledges a possible connection to [[Mark Hofmann]], a convicted forger and extortionist, via go-between Lyn Jacobs who provided the society with the document.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50203408-76/affidavit-lee-hofmann-massacre.html.csp |title= Mountain Meadows affidavit Hofmann forgery? |author= Smart, Christopher.  |date= September 10, 2010 |work=Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.utah.gov/events_and_news/press_room/forgery.html |title=Probable Hofmann Forgery Uncovered |author=The Utah Division of State History |accessdate=2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150432/http://history.utah.gov/events_and_news/press_room/forgery.html |archivedate=April 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a letter supposedly written by John D.

==Remembrances==
{{Main|Remembrances of the Mountain Meadows massacre}}
The first monument for the victims was built two years after the massacre, by Major Carleton and the U.S. Army. This monument was a simple [[cairn]] built over the gravesite of 34 victims, and was topped by a large cedar [[Christian cross|cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Carleton |first= James H.|title= Special Report of the Mountain Meadows Massacre |publisher= [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] |year= 1902 | page= 15 |isbn= 0-87062-249-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was found destroyed and the structure was replaced by the U.S. Army in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newspapers.lib.utah.edu/details?id=21197521&amp; Daily Union Vedette, June 8, 1864]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By some reports, the monument was destroyed in 1861, when Young brought an entourage to Mountain Meadows.

Starting in 1988, the [[Remembrances of the Mountain Meadows massacre#Mountain Meadows Association|Mountain Meadows Association]], composed of descendants of both the Baker–Fancher party victims and the Mormon participants, designed a new monument in the meadows; this monument was completed in 1990 and is maintained by the [[Utah State Parks|Utah State Division of Parks and Recreation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.mtn-meadows-assoc.com/Monuments/1990Monument/monument.htm |title = Mountain Meadows Association – 1990 MONUMENT |publisher = Mountain Meadows Association |accessdate = May 16, 2010 |quote =  |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071220011019/http://www.mtn-meadows-assoc.com/Monuments/1990Monument/monument.htm |archivedate = December 20, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints replaced the U.S. Army's cairn and the 1932 memorial wall with a second monument, which it now maintains.&lt;ref&gt;Utah History To Go.

In 1955, to memorialize the victims of the massacre, a monument was installed in the town square of [[Harrison, Arkansas|Harrison]], Arkansas. On one side of this monument is a map and short summary of the massacre, while the opposite side contains a list of the victims. In 2005 a replica of the U.S. Army's original 1859 cairn was built in [[Carrollton, Arkansas|Carrollton]], Arkansas; it is maintained by the  Mountain Meadows Monument Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;Flickr.

Retrieved March 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the 150th anniversary of the massacre was remembered by a ceremony held in the meadows. Approximately 400 people, including many descendants of those slain at Mountain Meadows and Elder [[Henry B. Eyring]] of the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles attended this ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/237239/ Eyring expresses regret for pioneer massacre]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravitz, Jessica, [http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6862682 LDS Church Apologizes for Mountain Meadows Massacre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104171210/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6862682 |date=November 4, 2014 }}, ''Salt Lake Tribune''; September 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the site was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] after joint efforts by descendants of those killed and the LDS Church.&lt;ref name=stack1&gt;{{cite news|last=Stack|first=Peggy Fletcher|title=Mountain Meadows now a national historic landmark|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52107971-78/site-meadows-mountain-church.html.csp|accessdate=July 4, 2011|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, California archaeologist Everett Bassett, after an examination of U.S. Army records and a site visit, concluded that two mass graves of the massacre victims, which had been thought to be at the site of the memorial erected by the LDS Church, were actually on private land nearby.  The Mountain Meadows Association is trying to come to an agreement with the land owner for conservation of the sites via [[National Monument (United States)|National Monument]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nichole |last=Osinski|title=Archaeologist: Mountain Meadows Massacre graves found|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/20/mountain-meadows-massacre-site/72525842/|date=September 20, 2015|newspaper=The (St. George, Utah) Spectrum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4807">In [[quality management]], a '''nonconformity''' (sometimes referred to as a '''defect''') is a deviation from a [[Specification (technical standard)|specification]], a [[Technical standard|standard]], or an [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]]. Nonconformities can be classified in seriousness multiple ways, though a typical classification scheme may have three to four levels, including critical, serious, major, and minor.&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWNWdBisJcoC&amp;pg=PA691 |chapter=36.

While some situations allow "nonconformity" and "defect" to be used synonymously, some industries distinguish between the two; a nonconformity represents a failure to meet an intended state and specification, while a defect represents a failure to meet fitness for use/normal usage requirements.&lt;ref name="BergerTheCert07" /&gt; This can be seen in the international software engineering standard ISO/IEC 25010 (formerly [[ISO/IEC 9126]]), which defines a nonconformity as the nonfulfillment of a requirement and a [[Product defect|defect]] as the nonfulfillment of intended usage requirements.&lt;ref name="ISO25010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iso.org/standard/35733.html |title=ISO/IEC 25010:2011 Systems and software engineering -- Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) -- System and software quality models |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |date=March 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifying nonconformity==
When ensuring [[Quality (business)|quality]] of a product or a service, classification of a nonconformity is important, as it provides an opportunity to better reduce nonconformity.&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt; Many quality management practices will do this using a relatively simple three- or four-level classification system.&lt;ref name="BergerTheCert07" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MitraFundamentals16" /&gt;For example, U.S. federal agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration have used a simple three-tier system for quality requirements of government-acquired supplies and services: minor, major, and critical nonconformance.&lt;ref name="GSAFAR05"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.acquisition.gov/sites/default/files/current/far/pdf/FAR.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Acquisition Regulation |volume=1 |publisher=General Services Administration |page=46.103 |date=March 2005 |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some industries may develop their own, custom ranking systems. An example from the [[automotive industry]] uses a 10-point system for finer granularity, where, for example, a one represents "none" (no effect), a six "moderate" (vehicle or item operable, but comfort or convenience items inoperable), and a 10 "hazardous without warning" (when a potential failure mode affects safe vehicle operation without warning).&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt; Regardless of size, these classification schemes exist to help drive discovery and correction of nonconformities (and defects).&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MitraFundamentals16" /&gt;

==Sources of nonconformity==
The causes of nonconformities aren't unlimited and therefore determinable. Common causes for deficiencies to arise include&lt;ref name="HoyleISO09" /&gt;:

* poor communication (or miscommunication)
* poor documentation (or lack of documentation)
* poor or limited training of personnel
* poor motivation of personnel
* poor quality materials (or lack of appropriate materials)
* poor quality tools and equipment (or lack of appropriate tools and equipment)
* poor or dysfunctional operating environment

'''''One More Kiss''''' is a Scottish [[Romance film|romantic]] [[drama]] directed by award-winning film maker [[Vadim Jean]] ([[Leon the Pig Farmer]], [[Beyond Bedlam]], [[Clockwork Mice]]) and starring [[Valerie Edmond]], [[Gerard Butler]] and [[James Cosmo]] in the main roles. The film’s tragic story revolves around a cancer-diagnosed woman who decides to live her remaining life to the full, which includes throwing herself into a triangle romance with an old flame.

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}
When Sarah Hopson ([[Valerie Edmond]]) discovers she has a [[brain tumour]], she leaves her successful high-rise lifestyle in [[New York City]] and returns to her hometown in the [[Scottish Borders]], where she left her widower father Frank ([[James Cosmo]]) and her childhood sweetheart Sam ([[Gerard Butler]]) to pursue a career in the [[United States]] seven years ago. Upon arriving Sarah finds out that Sam, a restaurant owner, is now happily married to Charlotte (Valerie Gogan). This, however, does not stop her from asking the couple a last favour – which is to let Sarah spend her remaining time in the company of the only man she has ever loved.

==Cast==
Director [[Vadim Jean]] decided on an all-Scottish cast with the following three actors starring in the main roles:

*[[Valerie Edmond]] (born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] in 1969) had her first leading role with the character of Ashley in the Scottish television series ''[[The Crow Road]]'' (1996), which also brought her a nomination for Best Actress at the [[BAFTA]] Scotland Awards in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[Valerie Edmond]]&lt;/ref&gt; For ''One More Kiss'' Edmond was the director's first choice to play the leading character Sarah Hopson – a successful [[New York City]] literary agent, who returns to her home town in the Borders after going through a life-changing experience.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.gerardbutler.net/news/news_main.php?Action=Full&amp;NewsID=232 Gerard Butler dot Net - Press Room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gerard Butler]] (born in [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Scotland]] in 1969) plays Sarah’s long-lost love Sam, who sees his otherwise happy marriage plunged into chaos by his ex-girlfriend's return. Butler had his breakthrough performances with his first leading roles in 2000, when he played [[Attila the Hun]] in the American TV miniseries ''[[Attila]]'' and [[Count Dracula]] in [[Wes Craven]]’s ''[[Dracula 2000]]''. 
*[[James Cosmo]] (born in [[Clydebank]], [[Scotland]] in 1948) was best known for his performances as tough, violent characters in films such as ''[[Braveheart]]'' (1995) and ''[[Roughnecks (TV series)|Roughnecks]]'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0181920/bio James Cosmo - Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''In One More Kiss'', however, Cosmo is cast in the part of Sarah's doting father Frank, whose life has come to a standstill since the departure of his daughter.

[[File:Schweinebauch-2.jpg|thumb|[[Pork belly]] cut, shows layers of muscle and fats.]]
[[File:Roast Pig 1.JPG|thumb|Slow-roasting pig on a [[rotisserie]].]]
'''Pork''' is the [[culinary name]] for [[meat]] from a [[domestic pig]] (''Sus scrofa domesticus''). It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide,&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/en/meat/backgr_sources.html |title=Sources of Meat |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) |date=25 November 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with evidence of pig [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] dating back to 5000 BCE.

Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved. [[Curing (food preservation)|Curing]] extends the [[shelf life]] of the pork products. [[Ham]], [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked pork]], [[Gammon (meat)|gammon]], [[bacon]] and [[sausage]] are examples of preserved pork. [[Charcuterie]] is the branch of [[cooking]] devoted to prepared [[meat]] products, many from pork.

Pork is the most popular meat in [[East Asia|Eastern]] and [[Southeast Asia|Southeastern Asia]], and is also very common in the [[Western world]], especially in [[Central Europe]]. It is highly prized in [[Asian cuisine]]s for its fat content and pleasant texture. Consumption of pork is forbidden by [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Rastafarian]] dietary law, for religious reasons, with several suggested possible causes. The sale of pork is limited in [[Israel]] and illegal in certain Muslim countries.

== History ==
{{See also|Charcuterie}}
[[File:1850 le depecage de porc par Louis Humbert de Molard 1847 1898.jpg|thumb|Pig being prepared in [[France]] during the mid-19th century.]]
[[Charcuterie]] is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products such as [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[sausage]], ''[[Terrine (food)|terrines]]'', ''[[galantine]]s'', ''[[pâtés]]'', and ''[[confit]]'', primarily from pig.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlman, 18.; [[The Culinary Institute of America]], 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as a way to preserve meats before the advent of refrigeration, these preparations are prepared today for the flavours that are derived from the preservation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlman, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In 15th century France, local [[guild]]s regulated tradesmen in the food production industry in each city. The guilds that produced ''charcuterie'' were those of the ''charcutiers''. The members of this guild produced a traditional range of cooked or salted and dried meats, which varied, sometimes distinctively, from region to region. The only "raw" meat the ''charcutiers'' were allowed to sell was [[rendering (food processing)|unrendered]] [[lard]]. The ''charcutier'' prepared numerous items, including ''pâtés'', ''[[rillettes]]'', [[sausage]]s, [[bacon]], [[Pig's trotters|trotters]], and [[head cheese]].

Before the mass production and re-engineering of pigs in the 20th century, pork in Europe and North America was traditionally an autumn dish—pigs and other livestock coming to the slaughter in the autumn after growing in the spring and fattening during the summer. Due to the seasonal nature of the meat in Western culinary history, [[apple]]s (harvested in late summer and autumn) have been a staple pairing to fresh pork. The year-round availability of meat and fruits has not diminished the popularity of this combination on Western plates.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Michael D., “‘Everything but the Squeal’: Pork as Culture in Eastern North Carolina,” North Carolina Historical Review, 82 (Oct. 2005), 464–98. Heavily illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumption patterns ==
[[File:Pork .JPG|thumb|A traditional [[Austria]]n pork dish, served with potato [[croquette]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[mushroom]]s and [[gravy]].]]
[[File:Vindalho.jpg|thumb|''[[Vindaloo|Pork vindaloo]]'', spicy pork curry from [[India]].]]
Pigs are the most widely eaten animal in the world, accounting for about 38% of meat production worldwide. Consumption varies widely from place to place. The meat is taboo to eat in the [[Middle East]] and most of the [[Muslim world]] because of Jewish [[kosher]] and Islamic [[Halal]] dietary restrictions. But, pork is widely consumed in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]]. As the result, large numbers of [[List of pork dishes|pork recipes]] are developed throughout the world. [[Jamón]] is the most famous Spanish inlay, which is made with the front legs of a pork. ''[[Feijoada]]'' for example, the national dish of [[Brazil]] (also served in Portugal), is traditionally prepared with pork trimmings: ears, tail and feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazilbrazil.com/feijoada.html Brazilbrazil.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821052423/http://www.brazilbrazil.com/feijoada.html |date=21 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[USDA]]'s [[Foreign Agricultural Service]], nearly 100 million metric tons of pork were consumed worldwide in 2006 (preliminary data). Increasing urbanization and disposable income has led to a rapid rise in pork consumption in China, where 2006 consumption was 20% higher than in 2002, and a further 5% increase projected in 2007.&lt;ref name="fas2006"&gt;[http://www.fas.usda.gov/dlp/circular/2006/2006%20Annual/Livestock&amp;Poultry.pdf "Livestock and Poultry: World Markets and Trade."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928055301/http://www.fas.usda.gov/dlp/circular/2006/2006%20Annual/Livestock%26Poultry.pdf |date=28 September 2007 }} Circular Series DL&amp;P 2-06, Foreign Agricultural Service, United States Department of Agriculture, October 2006. Retrieved on 15 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 recorded total 109.905 million metric tons of pork were consumed worldwide.&lt;ref name="USDA 2016" /&gt;{{rp|18}} By 2017, half the world's pork was consumed in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China launches a pork-price index to smooth the “pig cycle”|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/04/daily-chart-16|accessdate=23 April 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asian pork consumption ===
[[File:HK Sheung Wan Cafe de Coral lunch rice red barbecue pork meat green vegetable 10-Aug-2012.JPG|thumb|Red-colored ''[[charsiu]]'' is one of the popular ways to prepare pork in [[Chinese cuisine|Southern China]].]]
Pork is popular throughout eastern Asia and the Pacific, where whole roast pig is a popular item in Pacific Island cuisine. It is consumed in a great many ways and highly esteemed in [[Chinese cuisine]].&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Asian Food |last=Solomon |first=Charmaine |year=1996 |publisher=William Heinemann Australia |location=Melbourne |isbn=0-85561-688-1|page=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently [[China]] is the world's largest pork consumer, with pork consumption expected to total 53 million tons in 2012, which accounts for more than half of global pork consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=14 Facts About The Staggeringly Huge Chinese Pork Industry | author=Mamta Badkar | date=May 29, 2013 | publisher=Business Insider | accessdate=31 July 2014 | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chinese-pork-industry-facts-2013-5?IR=T&amp; }}&lt;/ref&gt; In China, pork is preferred over [[beef]] for economic and aesthetic reasons; the pig is easy to feed and is not used for labour. The colours of the meat and the fat of pork are regarded as more appetizing, while the taste and smell are described as sweeter and cleaner. It is also considered easier to digest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking |last=Tropp |first=Barbara|year=1982 |publisher=Hearst Books |location=New York |isbn=0-688-14611-2|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rural tradition, pork is shared to celebrate important occasions and to form bonding.

In the [[Philippines]], due to 300 years of Spanish colonization and influence, [[lechon]], which is an entire roasted suckling pig, is the national delicacy.

== Pork products ==
[[File:Smoked country style pork ribs.jpg|thumb|Smoked [[pork ribs]].]]
Pork may be cooked from fresh meat or cured over time. Cured meat products include [[ham]] and [[bacon]]. The carcass may be used in many different ways for fresh [[meat cuts]], with the popularity of certain cuts and certain carcass proportions varying worldwide.

=== Fresh meat ===
Most of the carcass can be used to produce fresh meat and in the case of a [[suckling pig]], the whole body of a young pig ranging in age from two to six weeks is roasted. Danish roast pork or ''[[flæskesteg]]'', prepared with crispy [[Pork rind|crackling]] is a national favourite as the traditional Christmas dinner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wonderful-denmark.com/danish-christmas-dinner.html "Danish Christmas dinner"], ''Wonderful Denmark''. Retrieved 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Processed pork ===

[[File:Pork loin ham 2.jpg|thumb|[[Ham]] is a popular pork product.]]
Pork is particularly common as an ingredient in [[sausage]]s. Many traditional European sausages are made with pork, including [[chorizo]], [[fuet]], [[Cumberland sausage]] and [[salami]]. Many brands of American [[hot dogs]] and most breakfast sausages are made from pork.  Processing of pork into sausages and other products in France is described as [[charcuterie]].

[[Ham]] and [[bacon]] are made from fresh pork by curing with salt ([[pickling]]) or [[smoking (food)|smoking]]. Shoulders and legs are most commonly [[curing (food preservation)|cured]] in this manner for Picnic shoulder and [[ham]], whereas streaky and round bacon come from the side (round from the loin and streaky from the belly).&lt;ref&gt;Ruhlman, Michael and Polcyn, Brian. Charcuterie: The Craft of Salting, Smoking and Curing. New York: W.W Norton &amp; Company, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-393-05829-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ham and bacon are popular foods in the west, and their consumption has increased with industrialisation. Non-western cuisines also use preserved meat products. For example, salted preserved pork or red roasted pork is used in Chinese and Asian cuisine.

Bacon is defined as any of certain [[Primal cut|cuts]] of [[meat]] taken from the sides, belly or back that have been cured or smoked. In continental Europe, it is used primarily in cubes ([[lardon]]s) as a cooking ingredient valued both as a source of [[fat]] and for its flavour. In [[Italy]], besides being used in cooking, bacon (''[[pancetta]]'') is also served uncooked and thinly sliced as part of an ''[[antipasto]]''. Bacon is also used for [[Bacon#Bacon fat|barding]] roasts, especially game birds. Bacon is often smoked with various wood fuels for up to ten hours. Bacon is eaten fried, baked, or grilled.

A side of unsliced bacon is a "flitch" or "slab bacon", while an individual slice of bacon is a "rasher" (Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom) or simply a "slice" or "strip" (North America). Slices of bacon are also known as "[[collops]]". Traditionally, the skin is left on the cut and is known as "bacon rind". Rindless bacon, however, is quite common. In both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], bacon comes in a wide variety of cuts and flavours, and is predominantly known as "streaky bacon", or "streaky rashers". Bacon made from the meat on the back of the pig is referred to as "back bacon" and is part of traditional [[full breakfast]] commonly eaten in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. In the United States, back bacon may also be referred to as "Canadian-style Bacon" or "Canadian Bacon".&lt;ref name="urmis"&gt;Cattleman's Beef Board &amp; National Cattlemen's Beef Association. [http://www.beefretail.org/uDocs/urmis/contents/pork.pdf Uniform Retail Meat Identity Standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327021901/http://www.beefretail.org/uDocs/urmis/contents/pork.pdf |date=27 March 2009 }}. Retrieved 11 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[USDA]] defines bacon as "the cured belly of a swine carcass", while other cuts and characteristics must be separately qualified (e.g. "smoked pork loin bacon").&lt;ref name=fsis&gt;United States Department of Agriculture, Food Safety and Inspection Service. [http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Help/glossary-B/index.asp USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service: Glossery B] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503200749/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/help/glossary-B/index.asp |date=3 May 2009 }}. Retrieved 9 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "USDA Certified" bacon means that it has been treated for ''[[Trichinella]]''.

The canned meat [[Spam (food)|Spam]] is made of chopped pork shoulder meat and ham.

== Industrial raw material ==
Due to the fact that pigs can eat unused food originally meant for humans, and due to high availability of such food in many industrialized countries, pork and other products from pigs have become securely sourced and low-priced commodities. This makes pig products very popular as raw material in many industrially produced products. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1217794/From-bullets-bread-beer-tambourines-toothpaste--plus-180-things-pig.html From bullets bread beer tambourines toothpaste -plus 180 things pig&lt;/ref&gt;

		&lt;/ref&gt; Pork with its fat trimmed is leaner than the meat of most domesticated animals, but is high in [[cholesterol]] and [[saturated fat]].

In 1987 the U.S. [[National Pork Board]] began an advertising campaign to position pork as "[[Pork. The Other White Meat|the other white meat]]"—due to a public perception of chicken and turkey (white meat) as healthier than red meat. The campaign was highly successful and resulted in 87% of consumers identifying pork with the slogan. The board retired the slogan on 4 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Pork board swaps 'White Meat' for 'Be Inspired' |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5j_5ktljcQ9IyC4LPOSggUSPNIJ1Q |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher= |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious restrictions ==
{{Main article|Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork}}
Eating of pork is prohibited by orthodox [[Jewish dietary laws]] and [[Islamic dietary laws]], and is also avoided by mainstream [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Rastafarian]]s, and members of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].  There is also a theory that pork was [[Scottish pork taboo|taboo in Scotland until roughly 1800]].

=== Judaism ===
Pork is a well-known example of a [[kosher foods|non-kosher food]]. This prohibition is based on [[Leviticus]] chapter 11 and [[Deuteronomy]] chapter 14:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These are the creatures that you may eat from among all the animals that are upon the land. Everything that possesses a split hoof, which is fully cloven, and that brings up its cud—this you may eat. But this is what you shall not eat from what brings up its cud or possesses split hooves—the camel, because it brings up its cud but does not possess split hooves...and the pig, because it has split hooves that are completely cloven, but it does not bring up its cud—it is impure to you and from its flesh you may not eat.
:—Leviticus 11:2–4, 7–8&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;And the pig, because it possesses split hooves and does not bring up its cud—from its flesh you may not eat.
:—Deuteronomy 14:8&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As indicated by the Torah verses, pork is non-kosher because Jews may not consume an animal that possesses one trait but not the other of cloven hooves and regurgitating [[cud]]. Hogs, which are not [[ruminant]]s, do not chew cud as [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] do. Practising Jews suffice on the biblical explanation of the swine as 'unclean'. According to one rabbinic commentary anyone who has seen the swine's filthy habits will not inquire into why it is prohibited. Maimonides shared this view in classifying the swine as an unclean creature in both its habit and diet.&lt;ref name="CarterMeyers1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvzkoJHe2h0C&amp;pg=PA135|title=Community, Identity, and Ideology: Social Science Approaches to the Hebrew Bible|author=Marvin Harris|publisher=Eisenbrauns|others=Carol L. Meyers|year=1996|isbn=978-1-57506-005-7|editor=Charles Edward Carter|pages=135–|chapter=The Abominable Pig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prohibition of swine eating in Ancient Israel, according to Douglas, was because the pig was raised by non-Israelites, ate carrion and did not fit into the classification of ungulates. Harris disagrees and points out that Egyptians and Sumerians also restricted pigs and that goats also ate corpses, yet were not declared unclean in Ancient Israel. Harris offers an explanation based on environmental and economic factors instead.&lt;ref name="Study1991"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmE65d-QduAC&amp;pg=PA33|title=The World of Ancient Israel: Sociological, Anthropological and Political Perspectives|author=Society for Old Testament Study|date=21 November 1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42392-2|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pork is prohibited by the [[Islamic dietary laws]]. Throughout the [[Islamic world]] many countries severely restrict the importation or consumption of pork products.

The [[Qur'an]]ic basis for the Islamic prohibition of pork can be found in surah 2:173, 5:3, 5:60, 6:145 and 16:115.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|2|173|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|5|3|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|5|60|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|6|145|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|16|115|style=nosup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He has forbidden you only the [[carrion]], blood, and  the flesh of swine, and that which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for others than God. But if one is forced by necessity, without wilful disobedience, nor transgressing due limits, then there is no sin on him. Truly, Allah is Oft-forgiving Most Merciful.
:—Chapter (Sura) 2 – Verse (Ayat) 173 Al-Baqara (The Cow) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;Blockquote&gt;Forbidden for you for food are [[carrion]], blood, flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than God, and animals killed by strangling or by a violent blow or by a head-long fall or by the goring of horns, and those from which a wild animal has eaten, except what you [are able to] slaughter [before its death], and those which are sacrificed on stone altars, and [prohibited is] that you seek decision through divining arrows. That is grave disobedience. This day those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion; so fear them not, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion. But whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin – then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
:—Chapter (Sura) 5 – Verse (Ayat) 3 Al-Maidah (The Table Spread) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Christianity ===
Some sects of Christianity abstain from the consumption of pork. The prohibition is based on [[Leviticus]] chapter 11, [[Deuteronomy]] chapter 14, and [[Isaiah]] chapters 65 and 66. Some denominations that forbid pork consumption are:

* [[Ethiopian Orthodox]]
* [[Hebrew Roots]]
* [[Messianic Jews]]
* [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]]
* [[United Church of God]]
* [[Sacred Name]]

In contrast, many members of the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] consider the consumption of pork an important tradition, symbolizing the survival of their ancestors' Christian identity during the times of [[Ottoman Empire|Muslim Ottoman]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Natalie |last=O'Brien |coauthors= |title=Liverpool Council upsets Orthodox community by leaving pork off the menu for interfaith lunch |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/liverpool-council-upsets-orthodox-community-by-leaving-pork-off-the-menu-for-interfaith-lunch-20150725-gijyyi |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=25 July 2015 |accessdate=26 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disease in pork ==
[[File:Pork.jpg|thumb|[[Vacuum packing|Vacuum packed]] pork loin fillets.]]
Pork is known to carry some diseases such as [[pork tapeworm]] and [[trichinosis]] and [[pigbel]], thus uncooked or undercooked pork can be dangerous to consume, although [[Mett|raw pork]] is commonly eaten in parts of Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/press_information/2007/11/risk_of_trichinosis_from_locally_produced_raw_sausages_from_eastern_europe-9626.html|title=Risk of trichinosis from locally produced raw sausages from Eastern Europe – BfR|work=bund.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undercooked or untreated pork may harbour pathogens, or can be recontaminated after cooking if left exposed for a long period of time. In one instance, the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) detected ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'' in 460&amp;nbsp;lbs of Polidori brand fully cooked pork sausage crumbles, although no one was made ill from consumption of the product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/2010/05/articles/foodborne-illness-outbreaks/more-meat-recalls-pork-sausage-due-to-listeria-contamination/| title=More meat recalls: pork sausage due to listeria contamination| date=1 May 2010| accessdate = 29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSIS has previously stated that ''listeria'' and other microorganisms must be "...destroyed by proper handling and thorough cooking to an internal temperature of {{convert|160|°F|°C}}," and that other microorganisms, such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' can be found in inadequately cooked pork, poultry, and other meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://origin-www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Pork_From_Farm_to_Table/index.asp| title=Safety of Fresh Pork...from Farm to Table| accessdate=29 June 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709033648/http://origin-www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/Pork_From_Farm_to_Table/index.asp| archivedate=9 July 2010| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSIS, a part of the USDA, currently recommends cooking [[ground meat|ground pork]] to {{convert|160|°F|°C}} and whole cuts to {{convert|145|°F|°C}} followed by a 3-minute rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/meat-preparation/fresh-pork-from-farm-to-table/ct_index |title=Fresh Pork...from Farm to Table| accessdate = 19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs can be carriers of various [[helminths]], such as [[roundworm]]s, [[pinworm]]s, [[hookworm]]s. One of the more common is ''[[Taenia solium]]'', a type of [[tapeworm]], which may transplant to the intestines of humans after consuming undercooked meat.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Although not a common cause of illness, ''[[Yersinia enterocolitica]]''—which causes gastroenteritis—is present in various foods, but is most frequently caused by eating uncooked or undercooked pork and can grow in refrigerated conditions. The bacteria can be killed by heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/food-technology/bacterial-food-poisoning/ |title=Bacterial Food Poisoning | accessdate= 29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all outbreaks in the US have been traced to pork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol5no5/mead.htm | title=Food-Related Illness and Death in the United States |accessdate= 29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pork may be the reservoir responsible for sporadic, locally acquired cases of acute [[hepatitis E]] (HEV) reported in regions with relatively mild climates. It has been found to transmit between swine and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1746-6148/3/9|title=BMC Veterinary Research – Full text – Transmission dynamics of hepatitis E among swine: Potential impact upon human infection|work=biomedcentral.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trichinosis]], also called trichinellosis, or trichiniasis, is a [[parasitic disease]] caused by eating raw or undercooked pork infected with the [[larva]]e of a species of [[roundworm]] ''[[Trichinella spiralis]]'', commonly called the trichina worm. Infection was once very common, but is now rare in the [[First World|developed world]]. From 2002 to 2007, an annual average of 11 cases per year were reported in the United States; the majority were from consuming wild game or the source was unknown. The number of cases has decreased because of legislation prohibiting the feeding of raw meat garbage to hogs, increased commercial and home freezing of pork, and the public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked pork or wild game products.&lt;ref name=cdc&gt;{{cite web

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Postpartum depression''' ('''PPD'''), also called '''postnatal depression''', is a type of [[mood disorder]] associated with [[childbirth]], which can affect both sexes.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paul2010/&gt; Symptoms may include extreme sadness, [[Fatigue (medical)|low energy]], [[anxiety]], crying episodes, irritability, and changes in sleeping or eating patterns.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Postpartum Depression Facts|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml|website=NIMH|accessdate=11 June 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621200731/https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/postpartum-depression-facts/index.shtml|archivedate=21 June 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onset is typically between one week and one month following childbirth.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; PPD can also negatively affect the newborn child.&lt;ref name=Pea2009/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
While the exact cause of PPD is unclear, the cause is believed to be a combination of physical and emotional factors.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; These may include factors such as hormonal changes and [[sleep deprivation]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Risk factors include prior episodes of postpartum depression, [[bipolar disorder]], a family history of [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[psychological stress]], [[complications of childbirth]], lack of support, or a [[drug use disorder]].&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt; Diagnosis is based on a person's symptoms.&lt;ref name=Pea2009/&gt; While most women experience a brief period of worry or unhappiness after delivery, postpartum depression should be suspected when symptoms are severe and last over two weeks.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Among those at risk, providing psychosocial support may be protective in preventing PPD.&lt;ref name=AHRQ&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Health Care Research and Quality |title=Perinatal Depression: Prevalence, Screening Accuracy, and Screening Outcomes |url=http://archive.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/peridepsum.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111225343/http://archive.ahrq.gov/clinic/epcsums/peridepsum.htm |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment for PPD may include [[psychotherapy|counseling]] or medications.&lt;ref name=Pea2009/&gt; Types of counseling that have been found to be effective include [[interpersonal psychotherapy]] (IPT), [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and [[psychodynamic therapy]].&lt;ref name=Pea2009/&gt; Tentative evidence supports the use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs).&lt;ref name=Pea2009/&gt;

=== Onset and duration===
Postpartum depression onset usually begins between two weeks to a month after delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umm.edu/pregnancy/000118.htm Postpartum Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225024657/http://www.umm.edu/pregnancy/000118.htm |date=2012-02-25 }} from Pregnancy Guide, by Peter J. Chen, at Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Reviewed last on: 10/22/2008&lt;/ref&gt; A study done at an inner-city mental health clinic has shown that 50% of postpartum depressive episodes there began prior to delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yonkers|first1=KA|last2=Ramin|first2=SM|last3=Rush|first3=AJ|last4=Navarrete|first4=CA|last5=Carmody|first5=T|last6=March|first6=D|last7=Heartwell|first7=SF|last8=Leveno|first8=KJ|title=Onset and persistence of postpartum depression in an inner-city maternal health clinic system.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=November 2001|volume=158|issue=11|pages=1856–63|pmid=11691692|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.11.1856}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the DSM-5 postpartum depression is diagnosed under "depressive disorder with peripartum onset", in which "peripartum onset" is defined as anytime either during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. PPD may last several months or even a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmha.ca/bins/content_page.asp?cid=3-86-87-88 Canadian Mental Health Association &gt; Post Partum Depression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021133909/http://cmha.ca/bins/content_page.asp?cid=3-86-87-88 |date=2010-10-21 }} Retrieved on June 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Postpartum depression can also occur in women who have suffered a miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Miller-2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Miller LJ |title=Postpartum depression |journal=JAMA |volume=287 |issue=6 |pages=762–5 |date=February 2002 |pmid=11851544 |doi=10.1001/jama.287.6.762}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For fathers, several studies show that men experience the highest levels of postpartum depression between 3–6 months postpartum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paulson|first=J.F.|date=2010|title=Prenatal and postpartum depression in fathers and its association with maternal depression: A metaanalysis|url=|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|volume=303|pages=1961–1969|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parent-infant relationship===
Postpartum depression can interfere with normal [[Maternal bonding|maternal-infant bonding]] and adversely affect acute and longterm child development. Postpartum depression may lead mothers to be inconsistent with [[childcare]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Field, T |title= Postpartum depression effects on early interactions, parenting, and safety practices: A review|journal= Infant Behavior and Development |date=Feb 2010|volume=33 |doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2009.10.005 |pages=1–6|pmc=2819576}}&lt;/ref&gt; These childcare inconsistencies may include feeding routines, sleep routines, and health maintenance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In rare cases, or about 1 to 2 per 1,000, the postpartum depression appears as [[postpartum psychosis]].&lt;ref name=Sey2003/&gt; In these, or among women with a history of previous psychiatric hospital admissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laursen|first1=TM|last2=Munk-Olsen|first2=T|last3=Mortensen|first3=PB|last4=Abel|first4=KM|last5=Appleby|first5=L|last6=Webb|first6=RT|title=Filicide in offspring of parents with severe psychiatric disorders: a population-based cohort study of child homicide.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=May 2011|volume=72|issue=5|pages=698–703|pmid=21034682|doi=10.4088/jcp.09m05508gre}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[infanticide]] may occur. In the United States, postpartum depression is one of the leading causes of annual reported infanticide incidence rate of about 8 per 100,000 births.&lt;ref name=Pea2009/&gt;

==Causes==
The cause of PPD is not well understood. Hormonal changes, genetics, and major life events have been hypothesized as potential causes.

Evidence suggests that hormonal changes may play a role. Hormones which have been studied include [[estrogen]], [[progesterone]], [[thyroid hormone]], [[testosterone]], [[corticotropin releasing hormone]], and [[cortisol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soares CN, Zitek B |title=Reproductive hormone sensitivity and risk for depression across the female life cycle: a continuum of vulnerability? |journal=J Psychiatry Neurosci |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=331–43 |date=July 2008 |pmid=18592034 |pmc=2440795 |url=http://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticContent/HTML/N0/l2/jpn/vol-33/issue-4/pdf/pg331.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317074137/https://www.cma.ca/multimedia/staticcontent/html/n0/l2/jpn/vol-33/issue-4/pdf/pg331.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fathers, who are not undergoing profound hormonal changes, can also have postpartum depression.&lt;ref name=-2004&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodman JH |title=Paternal postpartum depression, its relationship to maternal postpartum depression, and implications for family health |journal=J Adv Nurs |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=26–35 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14675298 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2648.2003.02857.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause may be distinct in males.

Profound [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] changes that are brought about by caring for the [[infant]] are also frequently hypothesized to cause PPD. However, little evidence supports this hypothesis. Mothers who have had several previous children without suffering PPD can nonetheless suffer it with their latest child.&lt;ref name=-2000&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nielsen Forman D, Videbech P, Hedegaard M, Dalby Salvig J, Secher NJ |title=Postpartum depression: identification of women at risk |journal=BJOG |volume=107 |issue=10 |pages=1210–7 |date=October 2000 |pmid=11028570 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb11609.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the biological and psychosocial changes that may accompany pregnancy and the postpartum period, most women are not diagnosed with PPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paschetta|first=Elena|last2=Berrisford|first2=Giles|last3=Coccia|first3=Floriana|last4=Whitmore|first4=Jennifer|last5=Wood|first5=Amanda G.|last6=Pretlove|first6=Sam|last7=Ismail|first7=Khaled M.K.|year=2014|title=Perinatal psychiatric disorders: an overview|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0002937813010478|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=210|issue=6|pages=501–509.e6|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2013.10.009|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Louise M|last2=Molyneaux|first2=Emma|last3=Dennis|first3=Cindy-Lee|last4=Rochat|first4=Tamsen|last5=Stein|first5=Alan|last6=Milgrom|first6=Jeannette|year=2014|title=Non-psychotic mental disorders in the perinatal period|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673614612769|journal=The Lancet|volume=384|issue=9956|pages=1775–1788|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61276-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Risk factors ===
While the causes of PPD are not understood, a number of factors have been suggested to increase the risk:

* Prenatal depression or anxiety&lt;ref name=Beck-200109 /&gt; 
* A personal or family history of depression&lt;ref name="McCoy-200604" /&gt;
* Moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stuart-Parrigon|first1=K|last2=Stuart|first2=S|title=Perinatal depression: an update and overview.|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=September 2014|volume=16|issue=9|pages=468|pmid=25034859|doi=10.1007/s11920-014-0468-6|pmc=4920261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Unintended pregnancy|Unplanned/unwanted pregnancy]]&lt;ref name=Beck-200109 /&gt;
* Elevated [[prolactin]] levels
* [[Oxytocin]] depletion

Of these risk factors, formula-feeding, a history of depression, and cigarette smoking have been shown to have additive effects.&lt;ref name=McCoy-200604 /&gt; Some studies have found a link with low levels of DHA in the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2002-05-01|title=Seafood consumption, the DHA content of mothers’ milk and prevalence rates of postpartum depression: a cross-national, ecological analysis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032701003743|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|language=en|volume=69|issue=1-3|pages=15–29|doi=10.1016/S0165-0327(01)00374-3|issn=0165-0327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These above factors are known to [[correlation|correlate]] with PPD. This correlation does not mean these factors are causal. Rather, they might both be caused by some third factor. Contrastingly, some factors almost certainly attribute to the cause of postpartum depression, such as lack of social support.&lt;ref&gt;The causal role of lack of social support in PPD is strongly suggested by several studies, including O'Hara 1985, Field et al. 1985; and Gotlib et al. 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not surprisingly, women with fewer resources indicate a higher level of postpartum depression and stress than those women with more resources, such as financial. Rates of PPD have been shown to decrease as income increases.&lt;ref name="Segre"/&gt;  Women with fewer resources may be more likely to have an unintended or unwanted pregnancy, increasing risk of PPD. Women with fewer resources may also include single mothers of low income. Single mothers of low income may have more limited access to resources while transitioning into motherhood.

Studies have also shown a correlation between a mother's [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and postpartum depression. African American mothers have been shown to have the highest risk of PPD at 25%, while Asian mothers had the lowest at 11.5%, after controlling for social factors such as age, income, education, marital status, and baby's health. The PPD rates for First Nations, Caucasian and Hispanic women fell in between.&lt;ref name="Segre"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02646830600643908 |title=Race/ethnicity and perinatal depressed mood |year=2006 |last1=Segre |first1=Lisa S. |last2=O'Hara |first2=Michael W. |last3=Losch |first3=Mary E. |journal=Journal of Reproductive and Infant Psychology |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=99–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the strongest predictors of paternal PPD is having a partner who has PPD, with fathers developing PPD 50% of the time when their female partner has PPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singley|first=Daniel|date=2015|title=Men's Perinatal Mental Health in the Transition to Fatherhood|url=|journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|volume=46|pages=309–319|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]]&lt;ref name="Ross2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ross LE, Steele L, Goldfinger C, Strike C |title=Perinatal depressive symptomatology among lesbian and bisexual women |journal=Arch Womens Ment Health |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=53–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17262172 |doi=10.1007/s00737-007-0168-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; has also been studied as a risk factor for PPD. In a 2007 study conducted by Ross and colleagues, lesbian and bisexual mothers were tested for PPD and then compared with a heterosexual sample group. It was found that lesbian and bisexual biological mothers had significantly higher Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores than did the heterosexual women in the sample.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt; These higher rates of PPD in lesbian/bisexual mothers may reflect less social support, particularly from their families of origin and additional stress due to homophobic discrimination in society.&lt;ref name="Ross3"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ross LE |title=Perinatal mental health in lesbian mothers: a review of potential risk and protective factors |journal=Women Health |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=113–28 |year=2005 |pmid=15970579 |doi=10.1300/J013v41n03_07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A correlation between postpartum thyroiditis and postpartum depression has been proposed but remains controversial. There may also be a link between postpartum depression and anti-thyroid antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Williams Obstetrics|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780071793278|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis reviewing research on the association of violence and postpartum depression showed that violence against women increases the incidence of postpartum depression.&lt;ref name=Wu&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Qian|last2=Chen|first2=Hong-Lin|last3=Xu|first3=Xu-Juan|title=Violence as a Risk Factor for Postpartum Depression in Mothers: A Meta-Analysis|journal=Archives of Women's Mental Health|date=2014-04-01|volume=15|issue=2|pages=107–114|doi=10.1007/s00737-011-0248-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; About one-third of women throughout the world will experience physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives.&lt;ref name=Western&gt;{{cite book|last1=Western|first1=Deborah|title=A Conceptual and Contextual Background for Gender-Based Violence and Depression in Women|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Springer New York|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-7531-6|pages=13–22|doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7532-3_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence against women occurs in conflict, post-conflict, and non-conflict areas.&lt;ref name=Western /&gt; It is important to note that the research reviewed only looked at violence experienced by women from male perpetrators, but did not consider violence inflicted on men or women by women. Further, violence against women was defined as "any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or psychological harm or suffering to women".&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt; Psychological and cultural factors associated with increased incidence of postpartum depression include family history of depression, stressful life events during early puberty or pregnancy, anxiety or depression during pregnancy, and low social support.&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Lori E.|last2=Dennis|first2=Cindy-Lee|title=The Prevalence of Postpartum Depression among Women with Substance Use, an Abuse History, or Chronic Illness: A Systematic Review|journal=Journal of Women's Health|date=2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=475–486|doi=10.1089/jwh.2008.0953}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt; Violence against women is a chronic stressor, so depression may occur when someone is no longer able to respond to the violence.&lt;ref name=Wu /&gt;

==Diagnosis==

===Criteria===
Postpartum depression in the DSM-5 is known as "depressive disorder with peripartum onset". Peripartum onset is defined as starting anytime during pregnancy or within the four weeks following delivery. There is no longer a distinction made between depressive episodes that occur during pregnancy or those that occur after delivery.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association"&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association.|location=Arlington, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the majority of experts continue to diagnose postpartum depression as depression with onset anytime within the first year after delivery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The criteria required for the diagnosis of postpartum depression are the same as those required to make a diagnosis of non-childbirth related [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] or [[minor depressive disorder|minor depression]]. The criteria include at least five of the following nine symptoms, within a two-week period:&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association"/&gt;
* Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness, nearly every day, for most of the day or the observation of a depressed mood made by others
* Loss of interest or pleasure in activities
* Weight loss or decreased appetite
* Changes in sleep patterns
* Feelings of restlessness
* Loss of energy
* Feelings of worthlessness or guilt
* Loss of concentration or increased indecisiveness
* Recurrent thoughts of death, with or without plans of suicide

===Differential diagnosis===

====Postpartum blues====
{{Main|Postpartum blues}}
Postpartum blues, commonly known as "baby blues," is a transient postpartum mood disorder characterized by milder depressive symptoms than postpartum depression. This type of depression can occur in up to 80% of all mothers following delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/understanding-postpartum-depression-basics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415013254/http://www.webmd.com/depression/postpartum-depression/understanding-postpartum-depression-basics |archivedate=2015-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms typically resolve within two weeks. Symptoms lasting longer than two weeks are a sign of a more serious type of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wisner|first1=KL|last2=Parry|first2=BL|last3=Piontek|first3=CM|title=Clinical practice. Postpartum depression.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 July 2002|volume=347|issue=3|pages=194–9|pmid=12124409|doi=10.1056/NEJMcp011542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who experience "baby blues" may have a higher risk of experiencing a more serious episode of depression later on.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;

====Psychosis====
[[Postpartum psychosis]] is not a formal diagnosis, but is widely used to describe a [[Emergency psychiatry|psychiatric emergency]] that appears to occur in about 1 in a 1000 pregnancies, in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts ([[mania]]), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions begin suddenly in the first two weeks after delivery; the symptoms vary and can change quickly.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=I|last2=Chandra|first2=PS|last3=Dazzan|first3=P|last4=Howard|first4=LM|title=Bipolar disorder, affective psychosis, and schizophrenia in pregnancy and the post-partum period.|journal=Lancet|date=15 November 2014|volume=384|issue=9956|pages=1789–99|pmid=25455249|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61278-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is different from postpartum depression and from [[maternity blues]].&lt;ref name=RoyColl2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Postpartum Psychosis|url=http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/postpartumpsychosis.aspx|publisher=Royal College of Psychiatrists|accessdate=27 October 2016|date=2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024152200/http://www.rcpsych.ac.uk/healthadvice/problemsdisorders/postpartumpsychosis.aspx|archivedate=24 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It may be a form of [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name=WesselooRev2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wesseloo|first1=R|last2=Kamperman|first2=AM|last3=Munk-Olsen|first3=T|last4=Pop|first4=VJ|last5=Kushner|first5=SA|last6=Bergink|first6=V|title=Risk of Postpartum Relapse in Bipolar Disorder and Postpartum Psychosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=1 February 2016|volume=173|issue=2|pages=117–27|pmid=26514657|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2015.15010124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important not to confuse psychosis with other symptoms that may occur after delivery, such as delirium. Delirium typically includes a loss of awareness or inability to pay attention.&lt;ref name="DSM5" /&gt;

About half of women who experience postpartum psychosis have no risk factors; but a prior history of mental illness, especially bipolar disorder, a history of prior episodes of postpartum psychosis, or a family history put some at a higher risk.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

Postpartum psychosis often requires hospitalization, where treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medications, [[mood stabilizer]]s, and in cases of strong risk for suicide, [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt;

The most severe symptoms last from 2 to 12 weeks, and recovery takes 6 months to a year.&lt;ref name=LancetRev2014/&gt; Women who have been hospitalized for a psychiatric condition immediately after delivery are at a much higher risk of suicide during the first year after delivery.&lt;ref name=OrsoliniRev2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orsolini|first1=L, et al.|title=Suicide during Perinatal Period: Epidemiology, Risk Factors, and Clinical Correlates.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=12 August 2016|volume=7|pages=138|pmid=27570512|pmc=4981602|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Screening==
In the US, the [[American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] suggests healthcare providers consider depression screening for perinatal women.&lt;ref name="ahrq2011"&gt;{{cite journal| title =Screening for Depression During and After Pregnancy| url =http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Screening-for-Depression-During-and-After-Pregnancy| journal =American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Committee Opinion| date =February 2010| page =| publisher =| issue =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141102112919/http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Obstetric-Practice/Screening-for-Depression-During-and-After-Pregnancy| archivedate =2014-11-02| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends pediatricians screen mothers for PPD at 1-month, 2-month and 4-month visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Earls|first1=MF|last2=Committee on Psychosocial Aspects of Child and Family Health American Academy of|first2=Pediatrics|title=Incorporating recognition and management of perinatal and postpartum depression into pediatric practice.|journal=Pediatrics|date=November 2010|volume=126|issue=5|pages=1032–9|pmid=20974776|doi=10.1542/peds.2010-2348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many providers do not consistently provide screening and appropriate follow-up.&lt;ref name=ahrq2011 /&gt; For example, in Canada, Alberta is the only province with universal PPD screening. This screening is carried out by Public Health nurses with the baby's immunization schedule.

The [[Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale]], a standardized self-reported [[questionnaire]], may be used to identify women who have postpartum depression.&lt;ref name=pmid3651732&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cox JL, Holden JM, Sagovsky R |title=Detection of postnatal depression.

==Prevention==
A 2013 Cochrane review found evidence that psychosocial or psychological intervention after childbirth helped reduce the risk of postnatal depression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dennis CL, Dowswell T |title=Psychosocial and psychological interventions for preventing postpartum depression |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=2 |issue= |pages=CD001134 |year=2013 |pmid=23450532|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001134.pub3 |editor1-last=Dennis |editor1-first=Cindy-Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pubmed2013&gt;{{cite web|last=PubMed Health|title=Preventing postnatal depression|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/featuredreviews/2013-03-postnatal-depression/|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|accessdate=30 May 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623071639/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/featuredreviews/2013-03-postnatal-depression/|archivedate=23 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interventions included home visits, telephone-based peer support, and interpersonal psychotherapy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Support is an important aspect of prevention, as depressed mothers commonly state that their feelings of depression were brought on by "lack of support" and "feeling isolated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=C.-L.|last2=Hodnett|first2=E.|last3=Kenton|first3=L.|last4=Weston|first4=J.|last5=Zupancic|first5=J.|last6=Stewart|first6=D.

In couples, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis of 2015, emotional closeness and global support by the partner protect against both perinatal depression and anxiety. Further factors such as communication between the couple and relationship satisfaction have a protective effect against anxiety alone.&lt;ref name="pmid25837550"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pilkington PD, Milne LC, Cairns KE, Lewis J, Whelan TA |title=Modifiable partner factors associated with perinatal depression and anxiety: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=178 |issue= |pages=165–80 |year=2015 |pmid=25837550 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2015.02.023 |type=Systematic review and meta-analysis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major part of prevention is being informed about the risk factors. The medical community can play a key role in identifying and treating postpartum depression. Women should be screened by their physician to determine their risk for acquiring postpartum depression. Also, proper exercise and nutrition appear to play a role in preventing postpartum depression and [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]] in general.

In 2018, 24% of areas in the UK have no access to perinatal mental health specialist services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Most of UK doesn’t provide vital perinatal mental healthcare |url=https://www.onmedica.com/NewsArticle.aspx?id=1fdf2d69-9ffa-41ef-9cf9-edd3819294b4 |accessdate=17 June 2018 |publisher=OnMedica |date=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Treatment for mild to moderate PPD includes psychological interventions or antidepressants. Women with moderate to severe PPD would likely experience a greater benefit with a combination of psychological and medical interventions.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langan|first=Robert C.|last2=Goodbred|first2=Andrew J.|date=2016-05-15|title=Identification and Management of Peripartum Depression|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2016/0515/p852.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=93|issue=10|issn=0002-838X|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132458/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2016/0515/p852.html|archivedate=2017-10-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise has been found to be useful for mild and moderate cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCurdy|first1=AP|last2=Boulé|first2=NG|last3=Sivak|first3=A|last4=Davenport|first4=MH|title=Effects of Exercise on Mild-to-Moderate Depressive Symptoms in the Postpartum Period: A Meta-analysis.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=June 2017|volume=129|issue=6|pages=1087–1097|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000002053|pmid=28486363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pritchett|first1=RV|last2=Daley|first2=AJ|last3=Jolly|first3=K|title=Does aerobic exercise reduce postpartum depressive symptoms? a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners|date=October 2017|volume=67|issue=663|pages=e684-e691|doi=10.3399/bjgp17X692525|pmid=28855163|pmc=5604832}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Therapy===
Both individual social and psychological interventions appear equally effective in the treatment of PPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dennis|first1=CL|last2=Hodnett|first2=E|title=Psychosocial and psychological interventions for treating postpartum depression.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Oct 17, 2007|issue=4|pages=CD006116|pmid=17943888|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006116.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social interventions include individual counseling and peer support, while psychological interventions include [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and [[interpersonal therapy]] (IPT).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitelson|first=Elizabeth|last2=Kim|first2=Sarah|last3=Baker|first3=Allison Scott|last4=Leight|first4=Kristin|date=2010-12-30|title=Treatment of postpartum depression: clinical, psychological and pharmacological options|journal=International Journal of Women's Health|volume=3|pages=1–14|doi=10.2147/IJWH.S6938|issn=1179-1411|pmid=21339932|pmc=3039003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of therapy, such as group therapy and home visits, are also effective treatments.&lt;ref name="OBOS" /&gt;

Internet-based [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (iCBT) has shown promising results with lower negative parenting behavior scores and lower rates of anxiety, stress, and depression. iCBT may be beneficial for mothers who have limitations in accessing in person CBT. However, the long term benefits have not been determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Ying|last2=Htun|first2=Tha Pyai|last3=Wong|first3=Suei Nee|last4=Tam|first4=Wai San Wilson|last5=Klainin-Yobas|first5=Piyanee|date=2017-04-28|title=Therapist-Supported Internet-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Stress, Anxiety, and Depressive Symptoms Among Postpartum Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis|journal=Journal of Medical Internet Research|volume=19|issue=4|doi=10.2196/jmir.6712|issn=1439-4456|pmid=28455276|pmc=5429436|page=e138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
There have been a few studies of medications for treating PPD, however, the sample sizes were small, thus evidence is generally weak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some evidence suggests that mothers with PPD will respond similarly to people with [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is evidence which suggests that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) are effective treatment for PPD.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Molyneaux|first1=E|last2=Howard|first2=LM|last3=McGeown|first3=HR|last4=Karia|first4=AM|last5=Trevillion|first5=K|date=Sep 11, 2014|title=Antidepressant treatment for postnatal depression.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=9|pages=CD002018|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002018.pub2|pmid=25211400}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent study has found that adding [[sertraline]], an SSRI, to psychotherapy does not appear to confer any additional benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDonagh|first1=MS|last2=Matthews|first2=A|last3=Phillipi|first3=C|last4=Romm|first4=J|last5=Peterson|first5=K|last6=Thakurta|first6=S|last7=Guise|first7=JM|title=Depression drug treatment outcomes in pregnancy and the postpartum period: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Obstetrics and gynecology|date=September 2014|volume=124|issue=3|pages=526–34|pmid=25004304|doi=10.1097/aog.0000000000000410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is not completely clear which antidepressants, if any, are most effective for treatment of PPD, and for whom antidepressants would be a better option than non-pharmacotherapy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Some studies show that [[hormone therapy]] may be effective in women with PPD, supported by the idea that the drop in estrogen and progesterone levels post-delivery contribute to depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there is some controversy with this form of treatment because estrogen should not be given to people who are at higher risk of [[Venous thrombosis|blood clots]], which include women up to 12 weeks after delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823218|title=Medscape Log In|website=www.medscape.com|access-date=2017-10-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206205347/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/823218|archivedate=2017-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, none of the existing studies included women who were breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Breastfeeding ===
There are currently no antidepressants that are FDA approved for use during lactation. Most antidepressants are excreted in breast milk. However, there are limited studies showing the effects and safety of these antidepressants on breastfed babies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Elizabeth|last2=Rossom|first2=Rebecca C.|last3=Henninger|first3=Michelle|last4=Groom|first4=Holly C.|last5=Burda|first5=Brittany U.|last6=Henderson|first6=Jillian T.|last7=Bigler|first7=Keshia D.|last8=Whitlock|first8=Evelyn P.|date=January 2016|title=FDA Antidepressant Drug Labels for Pregnant and Postpartum Women|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0085176/|journal=PubMed Health|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105195610/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0085176/|archivedate=2017-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has shown efficacy in women with severe PPD that have either failed multiple trials of medication-based treatment or cannot tolerate the available antidepressants.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

As of 2013 it is unclear if [[acupuncture]], massage, bright lights, or taking [[omega-3 fatty acids]] are useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dennis|first1=CL|last2=Dowswell|first2=T|title=Interventions (other than pharmacological, psychosocial or psychological) for treating antenatal depression.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Jul 31, 2013|volume=7|pages=CD006795|pmid=23904069|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006795.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malay culture]] holds a belief in Hantu Meroyan; a spirit that resides in the placenta and amniotic fluid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laderman|first1=Carol|title=Wives and midwives : childbirth and nutrition in rural Malaysia|date=1987|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520060364|page=202|edition=1st pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this spirit is unsatisfied and venting resentment, it causes the mother to experience frequent crying, loss of appetite, and trouble sleeping, known collectively as "sakit meroyan". The mother can be cured with the help of a [[shaman]], who performs a [[séance]] to force the spirits to leave.&lt;ref name=-2009&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Ann |editor1-last=McElroy |editor2-first=Patricia K. |editor2-last=Townsend |year=2009 |chapter=Culture, Ecology, and Reproduction |pages=217–66 |title=Medical Anthropology in Ecological Perspective |isbn=978-0-7867-2740-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cultures believe that the symptoms of postpartum depression or similar illnesses can be avoided through protective rituals in the period after birth. Chinese women [[Postpartum confinement|participate in a ritual]] that is known as "doing the month" (confinement) in which they spend the first 30 days after giving birth resting in bed, while the mother or mother-in-law takes care of domestic duties and childcare.

The '''renin–angiotensin system''' ('''RAS''') or the '''renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system''' ('''RAAS''') is a [[endocrine system|hormone system]] that regulates [[blood pressure]] and [[fluid balance]].

When [[Kidney#Blood supply|renal blood flow]] is reduced, [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s in the kidneys convert the precursor prorenin (already present in the blood) into [[renin]] and secrete it directly into [[circulatory system|circulation]]. Plasma renin then carries out the conversion of [[angiotensinogen]], released by the liver, to [[angiotensin I]].&lt;ref name="Robbins and Cotran"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pathologic Basis of Disease|year=2010|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4160-3121-5|page=493|last=Kumar |first=Abbas |last2=Fausto |first2=Aster|edition=8th|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to [[angiotensin II]] by the [[angiotensin-converting enzyme]] (ACE) found on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, predominantly those of the lungs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Golan |first1=David |last2=Tashjian |first2=Armen |last3=Armstrong |first3=Ehrin |last4=Armstrong |first4=April |title=PRINCIPLES of PHARMACOLOGY – THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC BASIS OF DRUG THERAPY |publisher=LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS &amp; WILKINS, a WOLTERS KLUWER business |isbn=978-1-60831-270-2 |pages=335|date=2011-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Angiotensin II is a potent [[vasoconstriction|vasoconstrictive]] peptide that causes blood vessels to narrow, resulting in increased blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Yee2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yee AH, Burns JD, Wijdicks EF |title=Cerebral salt wasting: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment|journal=Neurosurg Clin N Am|volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=339–52|date=April 2010|pmid=20380974|doi=10.1016/j.nec.2009.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of the hormone [[aldosterone]]&lt;ref name="Yee2010"/&gt; from the [[adrenal cortex]]. Aldosterone causes the [[Distal convoluted tubule|renal tubules]] to increase the reabsorption of [[sodium in biology|sodium]] and water into the blood, while at the same time causing the excretion of [[potassium]] (to maintain [[electrolyte]] balance). This increases the volume of [[extracellular fluid]] in the body, which also increases blood pressure.

If the RAS is abnormally active, blood pressure will be too high. There are many drugs that interrupt different steps in this system to lower blood pressure. These drugs are one of the primary ways to control [[hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[heart failure]], [[kidney failure]], and harmful effects of [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec03/ch022/ch022a.html |title=High Blood Pressure: Heart and Blood Vessel Disorders |work=Merck Manual Home Edition }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Activation==

The system can be activated when there is a loss of [[blood volume]] or a drop in [[blood pressure]] (such as in [[hemorrhage]] or [[dehydration]]). This loss of pressure is interpreted by [[baroreceptor]]s in the [[carotid sinus]]. It can also be activated by a decrease in the filtrate [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) concentration or a decreased filtrate flow rate that will stimulate the [[macula densa]] to signal the [[juxtaglomerular cell]]s to release renin.

# If the perfusion of the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus]] in the kidney's [[macula densa]] decreases, then the juxtaglomerular cells (granular cells, modified pericytes in the glomerular capillary) release the [[enzyme]] [[renin]].

# Angiotensin II is the major bioactive product of the renin–angiotensin system, binding to receptors on [[intraglomerular mesangial cells]], causing these cells to contract along with the blood vessels surrounding them and causing the release of [[aldosterone]] from the [[zona glomerulosa]] in the [[adrenal cortex]]. Angiotensin II acts as an [[endocrine system|endocrine]], [[autocrine signalling|autocrine]]/[[paracrine signalling|paracrine]], and [[intracrine]] hormone.

==Cardiovascular effects==

It is believed that angiotensin I may have some minor activity, but angiotensin II is the major bio-active product. Angiotensin II has a variety of effects on the body:
*Throughout the body, angiotensin II is a potent [[vasoconstrictor]] of [[arterioles]].
*In the kidneys, angiotensin II constricts [[Glomerulus (kidney)|glomerular]] arterioles, having a greater effect on [[efferent arterioles]] than afferent. As with most other capillary beds in the body, the constriction of [[afferent arterioles]] increases the arteriolar resistance, raising [[systemic circulation|systemic]] [[arterial blood pressure]] and decreasing the blood flow. However, the kidneys must continue to filter enough blood despite this drop in blood flow, necessitating mechanisms to keep glomerular blood pressure up. To do this, angiotensin II constricts efferent arterioles, which forces blood to build up in the glomerulus, increasing glomerular pressure. The [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR) is thus maintained, and blood filtration can continue despite lowered overall kidney blood flow. Because the filtration fraction has increased, there is less plasma fluid in the downstream peritubular capillaries. This in turn leads to a decreased hydrostatic pressure and increased oncotic pressure (due to unfiltered plasma proteins) in the peritubular capillaries. The effect of decreased hydrostatic pressure and increased oncotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries will facilitate increased reabsorption of tubular fluid.
*Angiotensin II decreases medullary blood flow through the vasa recta. This decreases the washout of NaCl and urea in the kidney medullary space. Thus, higher concentrations of NaCl and urea in the medulla facilitate increased absorption of tubular fluid. Furthermore, increased reabsorption of fluid into the medulla will increase passive reabsorption of sodium along the thick ascending limb of the [[Loop of Henle]].
* Angiotensin II stimulates {{chem|Na|+}}/{{chem|H|+}} exchangers located on the apical membranes (faces the tubular lumen) of cells in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in addition to {{chem|Na|+}} channels in the collecting ducts. This will ultimately lead to increased sodium reabsorption.
* Angiotensin II stimulates the hypertrophy of renal tubule cells, leading to further sodium reabsorption.
*In the [[adrenal cortex]], angiotensin II acts to cause the release of [[aldosterone]]. Aldosterone acts on the tubules (e.g., the [[distal convoluted tubule]]s and the [[renal cortex|cortical]] [[collecting duct]]s) in the kidneys, causing them to reabsorb more [[sodium]] and water from the urine. This increases blood volume and, therefore, increases blood pressure. In exchange for the reabsorbing of sodium to blood, [[potassium]] is secreted into the tubules, becomes part of urine and is excreted.
*Angiotensin II causes the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH),&lt;ref name="Yee2010"/&gt; also called [[vasopressin]] – ADH is made in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior [[pituitary gland]]. As its name suggests, it also exhibits vaso-constrictive properties, but its main course of action is to stimulate reabsorption of water in the kidneys. ADH also acts on the [[central nervous system]] to increase an individual's appetite for salt, and to stimulate the sensation of [[thirst]].

These effects directly act together to increase blood pressure and are opposed by [[atrial natriuretic peptide]] (ANP).

==Local renin–angiotensin systems==
Locally expressed renin–angiotensin systems have been found in a number of tissues, including the [[kidney]]s, [[adrenal gland]]s, the [[heart]], [[vasculature]] and [[nervous system]], and have a variety of functions, including local cardiovascular regulation, in association or independently of the systemic renin–angiotensin system, as well as non-cardiovascular functions.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kobori|first=H.|author2=Nangaku, M. |author3=Navar, L.

Medications aimed at the systemic system may affect the expression of those local systems, beneficially or adversely.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt;

==Fetal renin–angiotensin system==
In the [[fetus]], the renin–angiotensin system is predominantly a sodium-losing system,{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} as angiotensin II has little or no effect on aldosterone levels. Renin levels are high in the fetus, while angiotensin II levels are significantly lower; this is due to the limited pulmonary blood flow, preventing ACE (found predominantly in the pulmonary circulation) from having its maximum effect.

==Clinical significance==
[[File:Renin angiotensin aldosterone system.png|thumb|Right|400px|Flowchart showing the clinical effects of RAAS activity and the sites of action of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.]]
* [[ACE inhibitor]]s–inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme are often used to reduce the formation of the more potent angiotensin II. [[Captopril]] is an example of an ACE inhibitor. ACE cleaves a number of other peptides, and in this capacity is an important regulator of the [[kinin–kallikrein system]], as such blocking ACE can lead to side effects.
* [[Angiotensin II receptor antagonist]]s, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers, can be used to prevent angiotensin II from acting on its [[Angiotensin II receptor|receptors]].

It includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in the offspring.&lt;ref name="CLP"&gt;Annex I, section 3.7, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:353:0001:1355:EN:PDF Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'', L353, 31.12.2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–1355, at pp.&amp;nbsp;107–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GHS"&gt;{{GHS|part=3|chapter=3.7|pages=175–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IPCS"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Principles For Evaluating Health Risks To Reproduction Associated With Exposure To Chemicals | journal = Environmental Health Criteria | volume = 225 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc225.htm | location = Geneva | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | year = 2001 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

One well known group of substances which are toxic for reproduction are [[teratogen]]s – substances which cause birth defects – of which [[Thalidomide|(''S'')-thalidomide]] is possibly the most notorious. Another group of substances which have received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly toxic for reproduction are the so-called [[endocrine disruptor]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{Cite document | title = Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disruptors | author = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | publisher = [[World Health Organization]] | location = Geneva | url = http://www.who.int/ipcs/publications/new_issues/endocrine_disruptors/en/ | year = 2002 | id = WHO/PCS/EDC/02.2 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many substances which are toxic for reproduction do not fall into either of these groups: [[lead]] compounds, for example, are considered to be toxic for reproduction&lt;ref name="Annex1"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:152:0001:0311:EN:PDF Commission Directive 2004/73/EC of 29 August 2004 adapting to technical progress for the 29th time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L152, 30.04.2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–311 (index no. 082-001-00-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CLPlead"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:353:0001:1355:EN:PDF Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, amending and repealing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, and amending Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.] ''[[Official Journal of the European Communities|OJEC]]'' L353, 31.12.2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–1355 at p.&amp;nbsp;444 (index no. 082-001-00-6).&lt;/ref&gt; given their adverse effects on the normal intellectual and psychomotor development of human babies and children.

Many drugs have effects on the [[human reproductive system]]: these may be desired ([[hormonal contraception]]), a minor unwanted side effect (many [[antidepressant]]s) or a major public health problem (thalidomide). However, most studies of reproductive toxicity has focused on occupational or environmental exposure to chemicals and their effects on reproduction. It may be noted that both consumption of alcohol and tobacco smoking are known to be "toxic for reproduction" in the sense that the term is used here.

Bisphenol A (BPA) is an example of an endocrine disruptor which negatively affects reproductive development. BPA is a known as estrogen mimicker (Xenoestrogen) and a likely androgen mimicker, which is used in the production of various plastic products. BPA exposure in fetal female rats lead to mammary gland morphogenesis, increased formation of ovarian tumors, and increased risk of developing mammary gland neoplasia in adult life. Additionally, BPA affects male fertility by resulting in lower sperm quality and sex function. The toxicological impact of BPA is better understood and studied in females than in males.&lt;ref&gt;Jones BA, Wagner LS, Watson NV (March 2016). “The Effects of Bisphenol A Exposure at Different Developmental Time Points in an Androgen-Sensitive Neuromuscular System in Male Rats”.

Reproductive Toxicology. 42: 132–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead is a heavy metal that not only has been associated with mental deficits, but male infertility and male reproductive issues. Lead is believed to predominantly affect male reproduction via disruption of hormones. Through this hormonal disruption, the process of sperm production in the seminiferous tubules is reduced. Another proposed mechanism of poor semen quality due to lead exposure has been attributed to lead’s ability to cause increases in reactive oxygen species due to lipid peroxidation, leading to cellular damage.&lt;ref&gt;Vigeh M, Smith DR, Hsu P-C. How does lead induce male fertility? Iranian Journal of Reproductive Medicine. 2011; 9(1):1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorostghoal, M., Seyyednejad, S.M., Jabari, A. (2014). Protective effects of Fumaria parviflora L. on lead-induced testicular toxicity in male rates. Andrologia, 46(4), 437-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reproductive toxins such as Thalidomide were once prescribed and used for therapeutic effects. In the 1950s and early 1960s, Thalidomide was widely used in Europe as an anti-nausea medication to alleviate morning sickness in pregnant women. It wasn't until the 1960s  was found that Thalidomide altered embryo development and led to limb deformities such as thumb absence, under development of entire limbs, or phocomelia. The teratogenic effects of Thalidomide have been proposed to affect more that ten thousand babies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Kim JH, Scialli AR.

The thalidomide experience: review of its effects 50 years later. 2012 Jun 2;139(1):25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diethylstilbestrol (DES), a synthetic estrogen known to be another reproductive toxin, was used from 1938 to 1971 to prevent spontaneous abortions from occurring in women. DES causes carcinogenic and mutagenic effects via the production of highly reactive metabolites, furthermore resulting in the formation of DNA adducts. Individuals exposed to DES in utero suffer atypical reproductive tract formation. Specifically, females exposed, in utero, to DES during the first trimester have an increased risk of developing clear cell vaginal carcinoma, and males an increased risk of hypospadias.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Klip, MPH, Janneke Verloop, MSc, Jan D van Gool, MD, Marlies ETA Koster, MSc, Prof Curt W Burger, MD, Prof Flora E van Leeuwen, MD, for the OMEGA project group.(2002, March 30) Hypospadias in sons of women exposed to diethylstilbestrol in utero: a cohort study.

'''Richard II''' (6 January 1367&amp;nbsp;– c. 14 February 1400), also known as '''Richard of Bordeaux''', was [[List of English monarchs|King of England]] from 1377 until he was [[Deposition (politics)|deposed]] in 1399. Richard, a son of [[Edward the Black Prince]], was born in [[Bordeaux]] during the reign of his grandfather, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].  His father was Prince of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]]. Richard was the younger brother of [[Edward of Angoulême]], upon whose death Richard, at three years of age, became second in line to the throne after his father. Upon the death of Richard's father prior to the death of Edward III, Richard, by [[primogeniture]], became the [[heir apparent]] to the throne. With Edward III's death the following year, Richard succeeded to the throne at the age of ten.

During Richard's first years as king, government was in the hands of a series of councils. Most of the [[History of the British peerage#Feudal origins|aristocracy]] preferred this to a [[regent|regency]] led by the king's uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], yet Gaunt remained highly influential. At the onset of Richard's accession, and then for much of his reign, [[Kingdom of England|England]] faced various problems, which included the [[Hundred Years' War|ongoing war against France]] (which was [[Hundred Years' War (1369–89)|not going well for the English]]), border conflicts with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and economic difficulties related to the [[Black Death]]. A major challenge of the reign was the [[Peasants' Revolt]] in 1381, and the young king played a central part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the [[Lords Appellant]]. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.

In 1397, Richard took his revenge on the appellants, many of whom were executed or exiled. The next two years have been described by historians as Richard's "tyranny". In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, the king disinherited Gaunt's son, [[Henry of Bolingbroke]], who had previously been exiled. Henry invaded England in June 1399 with a small force that quickly grew in numbers. Although he initially claimed that his goal was only to reclaim his patrimony, it soon became clear that Henry intended to claim the throne for himself. Meeting little resistance, Bolingbroke deposed Richard and had himself crowned as [[Henry IV of England|King Henry IV]]. Richard died in captivity in February 1400; he is thought to have been starved to death, although questions remain regarding his final fate.

Richard was said to have been tall, good-looking and intelligent. Less warlike than either his father or grandfather, he sought to bring an end to the [[Hundred Years' War]] that Edward III had started. He was a firm believer in the [[royal prerogative]], which led him to restrain the power of the aristocracy, and to rely on a private [[retinue]] for military protection instead; in contrast to the fraternal, martial court of his grandfather, he cultivated a refined atmosphere at his court, in which the king was an elevated figure, with art and culture at its centre.

Richard's posthumous reputation has been shaped to a large extent by [[William Shakespeare]], whose play ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century [[Wars of the Roses]]. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a [[personality disorder]], particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unrealistic or even entirely unprecedented, the way in which he carried them out was unacceptable to the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.

Richard of Bordeaux was the younger son of [[Edward, the Black Prince]], and [[Joan of Kent]]. Edward, [[heir apparent]] to the throne of England, had distinguished himself as a military commander in the early phases of the [[Hundred Years' War]], particularly in the [[Battle of Poitiers]] in 1356. After further military adventures, however, he contracted [[dysentery]] in Spain in 1370. He never fully recovered and had to return to England the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barber|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Barber|title=Edward, prince of Wales and of Aquitaine (1330–1376)|encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/8523}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Joan of Kent had been at the centre of a marriage dispute between [[Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent|Thomas Holland, Earl of Kent]], and [[William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury]], from which Holland emerged victorious. Less than a year after Holland's death in 1360, Joan married Prince Edward. Since Joan was a granddaughter of [[King Edward I]] and a first cousin of her father-in-law, King Edward III, the marriage required [[Dispensation (canon law)#Matrimonial dispensation|papal approval]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Barber|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Barber|title=Joan, suo jure countess of Kent, and princess of Wales and of Aquitaine &lt;nowiki&gt;[called the Fair Maid of Kent]&lt;/nowiki&gt; (c. 1328&amp;nbsp;– 1385)|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2004|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/14823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard was born at the Archbishop's Palace, [[Bordeaux]], in the English principality of [[Duchy of Aquitaine#Hundred Years' War|Aquitaine]], on 6 January 1367. According to contemporary sources, three kings{{spaced ndash}}"the King of [[Crown of Castile|Castille]], the King of [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]"{{spaced ndash}}were present at his birth.&lt;ref name="Tuck"&gt;Tuck (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; This anecdote, and the fact that his birth fell on the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], was later used in the religious imagery of the [[Wilton Diptych]], where Richard is one of three kings paying homage to the [[Virgin and Child]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nLbAoxCCt8YC&amp;pg=PA266&amp;dq=Wilton+Diptych+Epiphany&amp;sig=ACfU3U3LS79tMWmk13QHWga0pDPkxuoCkQ Gillespie and Goodman (1998), p. 266].&lt;/ref&gt; His elder brother Edward of Angoulême died near his sixth birthday in 1371, and Richard became his father's heir.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Prince finally succumbed to his long illness in June 1376. The [[House of Commons of England|Commons]] in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] genuinely feared that Richard's uncle, [[John of Gaunt]], would [[usurp]] the throne.{{Ref label|A|a|none}} For this reason, the prince was quickly invested with the [[princedom of Wales]] and his father's other titles.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 June the next year, Richard's grandfather [[Edward III]], who was for some years frail and decrepit, also died, after 50 years as England's monarch. This resulted in the 10-year-old Richard succeeding to the throne, being [[Coronation of the British monarch|crowned king]] on 16 July 1377.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, fears of John of Gaunt's ambitions influenced political decisions, and a regency led by the King's uncles was avoided.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 399–400.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the king was nominally to exercise kingship with the help of a series of "continual councils", from which John of Gaunt was excluded.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; Gaunt, together with his younger brother [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham]], still held great informal influence over the business of government, but the king's councillors and friends, particularly Sir [[Simon de Burley]] and [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland]], increasingly gained control of royal affairs. In a matter of three years, these councillors earned the mistrust of the Commons to the point that the councils were discontinued in 1380.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; Contributing to discontent was an increasingly heavy burden of [[Taxation in medieval England|taxation]] levied through three [[tax per head|poll taxes]] between 1377 and 1381 that were spent on unsuccessful military expeditions on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), pp. 445–6.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1381, there was a deep-felt resentment against the governing classes in the lower levels of English society.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), pp. 229–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Peasants' Revolt ==
[[File:Peasants' Revolt (death of Wat Tyler).jpg|thumb|right|Wat Tyler's death (left to right: Sir William Walworth, Mayor of London (wielding sword); Wat Tyler; King Richard II; and Sir John Cavendish, esquire to the King (bearing lance) [[Jean Froissart|Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'']]

Whereas the poll tax of 1381 was the spark of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], the root of the conflict lay in tensions between peasants and landowners precipitated by the economic and demographic consequences of the [[Black Death in England|Black Death]] and [[Second plague pandemic|subsequent outbreaks]] of the plague.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; The rebellion started in [[Kent]] and [[Essex]] in late May, and on 12 June, bands of peasants gathered at [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] near London under the leaders [[Wat Tyler]], [[John Ball (priest)|John Ball]], and [[Jack Straw (rebel leader)|Jack Straw]]. John of Gaunt's [[Savoy Palace]] was burnt down. The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Simon Sudbury]], who was also [[Lord Chancellor]], and the king's [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Hales]], were both killed by the rebels,&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2006), pp. 230–1.&lt;/ref&gt; who were demanding the complete abolition of [[serfdom]].&lt;ref name="H231"&gt;Harriss (2006), p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The king, sheltered within the [[Tower of London]] with his councillors, agreed that the Crown did not have the forces to disperse the rebels and that the only feasible option was to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Death of Wat Tyler Froissart.jpg|thumb|right|Richard II watches [[Wat Tyler]]'s death and addresses the peasants in the background: taken from the [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|Gruuthuse manuscript]] of [[Jean Froissart|Froissart]]'s ''Chroniques'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1475).]]
It is unclear how much Richard, who was still only fourteen years old, was involved in these deliberations, although historians have suggested that he was among the proponents of negotiations.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; The king set out by the [[River Thames]] on 13 June, but the large number of people thronging the banks at [[Greenwich]] made it impossible for him to land, forcing him to return to the Tower.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Friday, 14 June, he set out by horse and met the rebels at [[Mile End]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The king agreed to the rebels' demands, but this move only emboldened them; they continued their looting and killings.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 68–70.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard met Wat Tyler again the next day at [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] and reiterated that the demands would be met, but the rebel leader was not convinced of the king's sincerity. The king's men grew restive, an altercation broke out, and [[William Walworth]], the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London|mayor of London]], pulled Tyler down from his horse and killed him.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 70–1.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation became tense once the rebels realised what had happened, but the king acted with calm resolve and, saying "I am your captain, follow me!", he led the mob away from the scene.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} Walworth meanwhile gathered a force to surround the peasant army, but the king granted clemency and allowed the rebels to disperse and return to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 413–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king soon revoked the charters of freedom and pardon that he had granted, and as disturbances continued in other parts of the country, he personally went into Essex to suppress the rebellion. On 28 June at [[Billericay]], he defeated the last rebels in a small skirmish and effectively ended the Peasants' Revolt.&lt;ref name="H231"/&gt; Despite his young age, Richard had shown great courage and determination in his handling of the rebellion. It is likely, though, that the events impressed upon him the dangers of disobedience and threats to royal authority, and helped shape the [[absolute monarchy|absolutist]] attitudes to kingship that would later prove fatal to his reign.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;

== Coming of age ==
[[File:Richard2 Anna.jpg|thumb|Anne and Richard's coronation in the ''[[Liber Regalis]]''.]]

It is only with the Peasants' Revolt that Richard starts to emerge clearly in the [[chronicle|annals]].&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry [[Anne of Bohemia]], daughter of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] ([[King of Bohemia]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]) and his wife [[Elisabeth of Pomerania]], on 20 January 1382.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 90. The marriage had been agreed upon as of 2 May 1381; Saul (1997), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage had diplomatic significance; in the division of Europe caused by the [[Western Schism]], Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] in the ongoing [[Hundred Years' War]].{{Ref label|C|c|none}} Nonetheless, the marriage was not popular in England. Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire, the political alliance never resulted in any military victories.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 94–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the marriage was childless. Anne died from plague in 1394, greatly mourned by her husband.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael de la Pole, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Michael de la Pole]] had been instrumental in the marriage negotiations;&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 117–20.&lt;/ref&gt; De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family.&lt;ref&gt;A complaint in parliament claimed that he had been "raised from low estate to the rank of earl"; Saul (1997), p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; When Richard made him [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]] in 1383, and created him [[Earl of Suffolk]] two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Another member of the close circle around the king was [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland|Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford]], who in this period emerged as the king's [[favourite]].&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of [[Duke of Ireland]] in 1386.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 425, 442–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Thomas Walsingham]] suggested the relationship between the king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions came to a head over the approach to the war in France. While the court party preferred negotiations, Gaunt and Buckingham urged a large-scale campaign to protect English possessions.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; Instead, a so-called [[crusade]] led by [[Henry le Despenser]], [[Bishop of Norwich]], was dispatched, which failed miserably.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; Faced with this setback on the continent, Richard turned his attention instead towards France's ally, [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]]. In 1385, the king himself led a [[English invasion of Scotland (1385)|punitive expedition to the north]],&lt;ref&gt;Muster of the 1385 army [https://books.google.com/books?id=vVFIAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=archaeologia+1829&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Ellis, Nicolas, Nicolas Harris, 'Richard II's army for Scotland, 1385', in ''Archaeologia'', vol. 22, (1829), 13–19]&lt;/ref&gt; but the effort came to nothing, and the army had to return without ever engaging the Scots in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 142–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, only an uprising in [[Ghent]] prevented a French invasion of southern England.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 145–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Richard and his uncle John of Gaunt deteriorated further with military failure, and John of Gaunt left England to pursue his claim to the throne of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] in 1386 amid rumours of a plot against his person.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; With Gaunt gone, the unofficial leadership of the growing dissent against the king and his courtiers passed to Buckingham{{spaced ndash}}who had by now been created Duke of Gloucester{{spaced ndash}}and [[Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel|Richard Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;

== First crisis of 1386–88 ==
[[File:Robert de Vere fleeing Radcot Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland|Robert de Vere]] fleeing [[Battle of Radcot Bridge|Radcot Bridge]] (Froissart)]]
The threat of a French invasion did not subside, but instead grew stronger into 1386.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; At the parliament of October that year, Michael de la Pole{{spaced ndash}}in his capacity of chancellor{{spaced ndash}}requested taxation of an unprecedented level for the defence of the realm.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than consenting, the parliament responded by refusing to consider any request until the chancellor was removed.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament (later known as the [[Wonderful Parliament]]) was presumably working with the support of Gloucester and Arundel.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The king famously responded that he would not dismiss as much as a [[scullery maid|scullion]] from his kitchen at parliament's request.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 157–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Only when threatened with deposition was Richard forced to give in and let de la Pole go.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A commission was set up to review and control royal finances for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 459.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard was deeply perturbed by this affront to his royal prerogative, and from February to November 1387 went on a "gyration" (tour) of the country to muster support for his cause.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; By installing de Vere as [[Justice of Chester]], he began the work of creating a loyal military power base in [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1971), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He also secured a legal ruling from [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Chief Justice]] [[Robert Tresilian]] that parliament's conduct had been unlawful and treasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chrimes|first=S. B.|year=1956|title=Richard II's questions to the judges|journal=[[Law Quarterly Review]]|volume=lxxii|pages=365–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to London, the king was confronted by Thomas of Woodstock (now Duke of Gloucester), Arundel and [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick|Thomas de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick]], who brought an appeal{{Ref label|D|d|none}} of treason against de la Pole, de Vere, Tresilian, and two other loyalists: the mayor of London, [[Nicholas Brembre]], and [[Alexander Neville]], the [[Archbishop of York]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1971), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard stalled the negotiations to gain time, as he was expecting de Vere to arrive from Cheshire with military reinforcements.&lt;ref name="S187"&gt;Saul (1997), p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; The three earls then joined forces with [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby]] (Gaunt's son, later King [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]]), and [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham]]{{spaced ndash}}the group known to history as the [[Lords Appellant]]. On 20 December 1387 they intercepted de Vere at [[Battle of Radcot Bridge|Radcot Bridge]], where he and his forces were routed and he was obliged to flee the country.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman (1971), pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard now had no choice but to comply with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were condemned and executed, while de Vere and de la Pole{{spaced ndash}}who had by now also left the country&lt;ref name="S187"/&gt;{{spaced ndash}}were sentenced to death ''in absentia'' at the [[Merciless Parliament]] in February 1388.&lt;ref&gt;Neville, as a man of the clergy, was deprived of his [[temporalities]], also ''in absentia''; Saul (1997), pp. 192–3.&lt;/ref&gt; The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 458.&lt;/ref&gt; The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;

== A fragile peace ==
[[File:Coat of Arms of Richard II of England (1377-1399).svg|thumb|Coat of arms of King Richard II]]
Richard gradually re-established royal authority in the months after the deliberations of the Merciless Parliament. The aggressive foreign policy of the Lords Appellant failed when their efforts to build a wide, anti-French coalition came to nothing, and the north of England fell victim to a [[Battle of Otterburn|Scottish incursion]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard was now over twenty-one years old and could with confidence claim the right to govern in his own name.&lt;ref name="S203-4"&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 203–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, John of Gaunt returned to England in 1389 and settled his differences with the king, after which the old statesman acted as a moderating influence on English politics.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard assumed full control of the government on 3 May 1389, claiming that the difficulties of the past years had been due solely to bad councillors. He outlined a foreign policy that reversed the actions of the appellants by seeking peace and reconciliation with France, and promised to lessen the burden of taxation on the people significantly.&lt;ref name="S203-4"/&gt; Richard ruled peacefully for the next eight years, having reconciled with his former adversaries.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; Still, later events would show that he had not forgotten the indignities he perceived.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 468.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the execution of his former teacher Sir Simon de Burley was an insult not easily forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Isabela richard2.jpg|thumb|left|Richard and Isabella on their wedding day]]

With national stability secured, Richard began negotiating a permanent peace with France. A proposal put forward in 1393 would have greatly expanded the territory of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] possessed by the English crown. However, the plan failed because it included a requirement that the English king pay [[homage (medieval)|homage]] to the King of France{{spaced ndash}}a condition that proved unacceptable to the English public.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 215–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in 1396, a truce was agreed to, which was to last 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the truce, Richard agreed to marry [[Isabella of Valois|Isabella]], daughter of [[Charles VI of France]], when she came of age. There were some misgivings about the betrothal, in particular because the princess was then only six years old, and thus would not be able to produce an heir to the throne of England for many years.&lt;ref&gt;(As it turned out, she never did produce an heir: just four years later, Richard was dead.) McKisack (1959), p. 476.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Silver halfpenny of (Richard II YORYM 1980 1578) obverse.jpg|thumb|Silver half penny of Richard II, [[York Museums Trust]]]]
Although Richard sought peace with France, he took a different approach to the situation in Ireland. The English [[Lordship of Ireland|lordships in Ireland]] were in danger of being overrun, and the [[Hiberno-Norman|Anglo-Irish]] lords were pleading for the king to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 279–81.&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the most successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;

== Second crisis of 1397–99 ==
The period that historians refer to as the "tyranny" of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The king had Gloucester, Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397. The timing of these arrests and Richard's motivation are not entirely clear. Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king, there is no evidence that this was the case.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 371–5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386–88 and eliminate them as threats to his power.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt; Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial, at the parliament of September 1397. After a heated quarrel with the king, he was condemned and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial. As the time for the trial drew near, Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead. It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 378–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick was also condemned to death, but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment. Arundel's brother [[Thomas Arundel]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, was exiled for life.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities. While recruiting [[retinue|retainers]] for himself in various counties, he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants. The fines levied on these men brought great revenues to the crown, although contemporary chroniclers raised questions about the legality of the proceedings.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;

[[File:Johnofgaunt.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] had been at the centre of English politics for over thirty years, and his death in 1399 led to insecurity.]]
These actions were made possible primarily through the collusion of John of Gaunt, but with the support of a large group of other magnates, many of whom were rewarded with new titles, who were disparagingly referred to as Richard's "duketti".&lt;ref name="Saul (2005), p. 63."&gt;Saul (2005), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; These included the former Appellants [[Henry IV of England|Henry Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby]], who was made [[Duke of Hereford]], and [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Thomas de Mowbray, Earl of Nottingham]], who was created [[Duke of Norfolk]]. Also among them were [[John Holland, 1st Duke of Exeter|John]] and [[Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey|Thomas Holland]], the king's half-brother and nephew, who were promoted from earls of [[Earl of Huntingdon|Huntingdon]] and [[Earl of Kent|Kent]] to dukes of [[Duke of Exeter|Exeter]] and [[Duke of Surrey|Surrey]] respectively; the Duke of York's son [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Earl of Rutland]], who received Gloucester's French title of [[Duke of Aumale]]; Gaunt's son [[John Beaufort, 1st Earl of Somerset|John Beaufort, Earl of Somerset]], who was made [[Marquess of Somerset]] and [[Marquess of Dorset]]; [[John Montacute, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|John Montacute, Earl of Salisbury]]; and [[Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester|Lord Thomas le Despenser]], who became [[Earl of Gloucester]].{{Ref label|E|e|none}} With the forfeited lands of the convicted appellants, the king could reward these men with lands suited to their new ranks.&lt;ref name="M483-4"&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 483–4&lt;/ref&gt;

A threat to Richard's authority still existed, however, in the form of the [[House of Lancaster]], represented by John of Gaunt and his son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford. The House of Lancaster not only possessed greater wealth than any other family in England, they were of royal descent and, as such, likely candidates to succeed the childless Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 196–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Discord broke out in the inner circles of court in December 1397, when Bolingbroke &lt;ref name="M483-4"/&gt; and [[Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk|Mowbray]] became embroiled in a quarrel. According to Bolingbroke, Mowbray had claimed that the two, as former Lords Appellant, were next in line for royal retribution. Mowbray vehemently denied these charges, as such a claim would have amounted to treason.&lt;ref name="Saul (2005), p. 63."/&gt; A parliamentary committee decided that the two should settle the matter by battle, but at the last moment Richard exiled the two dukes instead: Mowbray for life, Bolingbroke for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 482.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 February 1399, John of Gaunt died. Rather than allowing Bolingbroke to succeed, Richard extended the term of his exile to life and expropriated his properties.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 403–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The king felt safe from Bolingbroke, who was residing in Paris, since the French had little interest in any challenge to Richard and his peace policy.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (2005), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard left the country in May for another expedition in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1398 Richard summoned a packed Parliament to Shrewsbury—known as the Parliament of Shrewsbury—which declared all the acts of the Merciless Parliament to be null and void, and announced that no restraint could legally be put on the king. It delegated all parliamentary power to a committee of twelve lords and six commoners chosen from the king's friends, making Richard an absolute ruler unbound by the necessity of gathering a Parliament again.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Samuel R.

== Overthrow and death ==
[[File:Richard II arrest.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richard being taken into custody by the [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] (Froissart)]]
In June 1399, [[Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans|Louis, Duke of Orléans]], gained control of the court of the insane [[Charles VI of France]]. The policy of ''rapprochement'' with the English crown did not suit Louis's political ambitions, and for this reason he found it opportune to allow Henry to leave for England.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 406–7.&lt;/ref&gt; With a small group of followers, Bolingbroke landed at [[Ravenspur]] in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt; Men from all over the country soon rallied around the duke. Meeting with [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland|Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland]], who had his own misgivings about the king, Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony. Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 408–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland, so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south. [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Edmund of Langley, Duke of York]], who was acting as Keeper of the Realm, had little choice but to side with Bolingbroke.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), pp. 486–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Richard was delayed in his return from Ireland and did not land in Wales until 24 July.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt; He made his way to [[Conwy Castle|Conwy]], where on 12 August he met with the Earl of Northumberland for negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 412–3.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 August, Richard II surrendered to Henry at [[Flint Castle]], promising to abdicate if his life were spared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/richard2.htm|title=Richard II, King of England (1367–1400)|publisher=Luminarium.org|accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men then returned to London, the indignant king riding all the way behind Henry. On arrival, he was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] on 1 September.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bolingbroke-richard-flint-castle-harley-ms-1319.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Richard's surrender to Henry at [[Flint Castle]].]]
Henry was by now fully determined to take the throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king.&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 494–5.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Henry was not next in line to the throne; the heir presumptive was [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March]], who was descended from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s third son, the second to survive to adulthood, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]]. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 419–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct ''male'' line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.{{Ref label|F|f|none}}

According to the official record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of [[House of Lords#History|lords]] and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the ''Traison et Mort Chronicle'' suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his [[Isabella of Valois|wife]] and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Jones|title=The Plantagenets: The Kings Who Made England|chapter=Richard Alone|publisher=[[HarperPress]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-00-721392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When parliament met to discuss Richard's fate, the [[John Trevor (died 1410)|bishop of St Asaph]] read thirty-three articles of deposition that were unanimously accepted by lords and commons. On 1 October 1399, Richard II was formally deposed and on 13 October, the feast day of [[Edward the Confessor]], Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster, was crowned [[Henry IV of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Dan|last=Jones|title=The Plantagenets: The Kings Who Made England|chapter=Richard Alone|publisher=HarperPress|year=2012|isbn=978-0-00-721392-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Henry agreed to let him live but only for one condition. To give up His claim to the throne. Richard agreed. This all changed when it was revealed that the earls of Huntingdon, Kent and Salisbury and Lord Despenser, and possibly also the Earl of Rutland{{spaced ndash}}all now demoted from the ranks they had been given by Richard{{spaced ndash}}were planning to murder the new king and restore Richard in the [[Epiphany Rising]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 424–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although averted, the plot highlighted the danger of allowing Richard to live. He is thought to have starved to death in captivity on or around 14 February 1400, although there is some question over the date and manner of his death.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; His body was taken south from Pontefract and displayed in the [[old St Paul's Cathedral]] on 17 February before burial in [[King's Langley Priory]] on 6 March.

Rumours that Richard was still alive persisted, but never gained much credence in England;&lt;ref&gt;Tuck (1985), p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; in Scotland, however, a man identified as Richard came into the hands of [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany|Regent Albany]], lodged in [[Stirling Castle]], and serving as the notional{{spaced ndash}}and perhaps reluctant{{spaced ndash}}figurehead of various anti-Lancastrian and [[Lollard]] intrigues in England. Henry IV's government dismissed him as an impostor, and several sources from both sides of the Border suggest the man had a mental illness, one also describing him as a "beggar" by the time of his death in 1419, but he was buried as a king in the local [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friary in Stirling. Meanwhile, in 1413, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]{{spaced ndash}}in an effort both to atone for his father's act of murder and to silence the rumours of Richard's survival{{spaced ndash}}had decided to have the body at King's Langley moved to its final resting place in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Here Richard himself had prepared an elaborate tomb, where the remains of his wife Anne were already entombed.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 428–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In the last years of Richard's reign, and particularly in the months after the suppression of the appellants in 1397, the king enjoyed a virtual monopoly on power in the country, a relatively uncommon situation in medieval England.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 331–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period a particular court culture was allowed to emerge, one that differed sharply from that of earlier times. A new form of address developed; where the king previously had been addressed simply as "[[highness]]", now "royal [[majesty]]", or "high majesty" were often used. It was said that on solemn festivals Richard would sit on his throne in the royal hall for hours without speaking, and anyone on whom his eyes fell had to bow his knees to the king.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 340–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration for this new sumptuousness and emphasis on dignity came from the courts on the continent, not only the French and Bohemian courts that had been the homes of Richard's two wives, but also the court that the Black Prince had maintained while residing in Aquitaine.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 344–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]], the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth, when his authority was challenged first by the [[Peasants' Revolt]]s and then by the [[Lords Appellant]].&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2005), pp. 489–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard rejected the approach his grandfather, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], had taken to the nobility. Edward's court had been a martial one, based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2005), pp. 490–1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Richard's view, this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage. To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment, he pursued a policy of peace towards France.&lt;ref name="S439"&gt;Saul (1997), p. 439.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he developed his own private military retinue, larger than that of any English king before him, and gave them [[livery]] [[heraldic badge|badges]] with his [[White Hart]],&lt;ref&gt;Harris (2005), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych (right). He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant, venerated figure, and art and culture, rather than warfare, were at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 332, 346.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patronage and the arts ==
As part of Richard's programme of asserting his authority, he also tried to cultivate the royal image. Unlike any other English king before him, he had himself portrayed in [[panel painting]]s of elevated majesty,&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; of which two survive: the over life-size [[Westminster Abbey]] portrait of the king (c.&amp;nbsp;1390, see top of page), and the [[Wilton Diptych]] (1394–99), a portable work probably intended to accompany Richard on his Irish campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander and Binski, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135. See also Levey, pp.&amp;nbsp;20–24.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the few surviving English examples of the courtly [[International Gothic]] style of painting that was developed in the courts of the Continent, especially Prague and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's expenditure on jewellery, rich textiles and metalwork was far higher than on paintings, but as with his [[illuminated manuscript]]s, there are hardly any surviving works that can be connected with him, except for a crown, "one of the finest achievements of the Gothic goldsmith", that probably belonged to Anne.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander and Binski, pp.&amp;nbsp;202–3 and 506. It is documented in the royal collection from 1399 and accompanied Blanche, daughter of Henry IV, to her Bavarian marriage. It is still in Munich.

Fifteen life-size statues of kings were placed in niches on the walls, and the [[hammer-beam]] roof by the royal carpenter [[Hugh Herland]], "the greatest creation of medieval timber architecture", allowed the original three [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] aisles to be replaced with a single huge open space, with a dais at the end for Richard to sit in solitary state.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander and Binski, pp.&amp;nbsp;506–7 and 515. Only six of the statues remain, rather damaged, and the dais has been remodelled, but otherwise the hall remains largely as Richard and his architect [[Henry Yevele]] left it.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebuilding had been begun by [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] in 1245, but had by Richard's time been dormant for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court's patronage of literature is especially important, because this was the period in which the English language took shape as a [[Middle English literature#Late period|literary language]].&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; There is little evidence to tie Richard directly to patronage of [[English poetry#The Anglo-Norman period and the Later Middle Ages|poetry]], but it was nevertheless within his court that this culture was allowed to thrive.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 361–4.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest poet of the age, [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], served the king as a diplomat, a customs official and a clerk of [[Office of Works|The King's Works]] while producing some of his best-known work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Benson|editor-first=Larry D.|title=The Riverside Chaucer|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1988|edition=3rd|pages=xi–xxii|isbn=0-19-282109-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKisack (1959), pp. 529–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer was also in the service of John of Gaunt, and wrote ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' as a eulogy to Gaunt's wife [[Blanche of Lancaster|Blanche]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson (1988), p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Chaucer's colleague and friend [[John Gower]] wrote his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' on a direct commission from Richard, although he later grew disenchanted with the king.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 362, 437.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Character and assessment ==
Contemporary writers, even those less sympathetic to the king, agreed that Richard was a "most beautiful king", though with a "face which was white, rounded and feminine", implying he lacked manliness.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (2005), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; He was athletic and tall; when his tomb was opened in 1871 he was found to be six feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 451–2, quoting [[John Gower]] and ''Historia vitae et regni Ricardi II''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also intelligent and well read, and when agitated he had a tendency to stammer.&lt;ref&gt;Harriss (2005), p. 489.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Westminster Abbey portrait probably shows a good similarity of the king, the Wilton Diptych portrays the king as significantly younger than he was at the time; it must be assumed that he had a beard by this point.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 450–1.&lt;/ref&gt; Religiously, he was orthodox, and particularly towards the end of his reign he became a strong opponent of the [[Lollardy|Lollard]] heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 297–303.&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly devoted to the cult of Edward the Confessor, and around 1395 he had his own [[coat of arms]] [[impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] with the [[attributed arms|mythical arms]] of the Confessor.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; Though not a warrior king like his grandfather, Richard nevertheless enjoyed [[tournament (medieval)|tournaments]], as well as hunting.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 452–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King Richard II from NPG (2).jpg|thumb|Anonymous artist's impression of Richard II in the 16th century.]]

The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play about the king, ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]''. Shakespeare's Richard was a cruel, vindictive and irresponsible king, who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing a work of fiction, however, Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions. Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as [[Edward Hall]] and [[Samuel Daniel]], who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as [[Thomas Walsingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall and Daniel were part of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] historiography, which was highly unsympathetic to Richard.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (2005), pp. 11–2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tudor orthodoxy, reinforced by Shakespeare, saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard's misrule that did not end until [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]'s accession in 1485.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret|last=Aston|title=Lollards and Reformers: Images and Literacy in Late Medieval Religion|chapter=Richard II and the Wars of the Roses|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|year=1984|pages=273–312|isbn=0-907628-18-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that Richard was to blame for the later-15th century [[Wars of the Roses]] was prevalent as late as the 19th century, but came to be challenged in the 20th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.J.|last=Pollard|authorlink=A. J. Pollard|title=The Wars of the Roses|edition=|publisher=[[Macmillan Education]]|location=Basingstoke|year=1988|page=12|isbn=0-333-40603-6|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent historians prefer to look at the Wars of the Roses in isolation from the reign of Richard II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Christine|title=The Wars of the Roses: Politics and the Constitution in England, c. 1437–1509|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|year=1997|page=20|isbn=0-521-31874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard's mental state has been a major issue of historical debate since the first academic historians started treating the subject in the 19th century. One of the first modern historians to deal with Richard II as a king and as a person was Bishop [[William Stubbs|Stubbs]]. Stubbs argued that towards the end of his reign, Richard's mind "was losing its balance altogether".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stubbs|first=William|authorlink=William Stubbs|title=The Constitutional History of England|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|location=Oxford|year=1875|volume=vol. ii|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Anthony Steel (historian)|Anthony Steel]], who wrote a full-scale biography of the king in 1941, took a psychiatric approach to the issue, and concluded that the king had [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Steel (1941), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; This was challenged by [[Vivian Hunter Galbraith|V. H. Galbraith]], who argued that there was no historical basis for such a diagnosis,&lt;ref name="Galbraith"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Galbraith|first=V. H.|authorlink=Vivian Hunter Galbraith|year=1942|title=A new life of Richard II|journal=[[History (journal)|History]]|volume=xxvi|pages=223–39|doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1942.tb00807.x|issue=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; a line that has also been followed by later historians of the period, such as [[Anthony Goodman (historian)|Anthony Goodman]] and [[Anthony Tuck]].&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt; [[Nigel Saul]], who wrote the most recent academic biography on Richard II, concedes that{{spaced ndash}}even though there is no basis for assuming the king had a mental illness{{spaced ndash}}he showed clear signs of a [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic personality]], and towards the end of his reign "Richard's grasp on reality was becoming weaker".&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 460–4&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the primary historiographical questions surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda and the reasons for its failure. His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern [[absolute monarchy]] as exemplified by the [[Tudor dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Simon|last=Walker|editor=Rowena E. Archer|editor2=G. L. Harriss|editor3=Simon Walker|chapter=Richard IIs Views on Kingship|title=Rulers and Ruled in Late Medieval England|page=49|location=London|publisher=[[Hambledon Press]]|year=1995|isbn=1-85285-133-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Richard's concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents, and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy that he was able to achieve as much as he did.&lt;ref name="Tuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="W63"&gt;Walker (1995), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet his actions were too extreme, and too abrupt. For one, the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation, and so help Richard's popularity with the Commons in parliament. However, this promise was never fulfilled, as the cost of the royal retinue, the opulence of court and Richard's lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been, without offering commensurate benefits.&lt;ref name="S439"/&gt; As for his policy of military retaining, this was later emulated by [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], but Richard's exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 440, 444–5&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Simon Walker (historian)|Simon Walker]] concludes: "What he sought was, in contemporary terms, neither unjustified nor unattainable; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him."&lt;ref name="W63"/&gt;

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}}This "appeal"{{spaced ndash}}which would give its name to the [[Lords Appellant]]{{spaced ndash}}was not an appeal in the modern sense of an application to a higher authority.

'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}}Beaufort was the oldest of John of Gaunt's children with [[Katherine Swynford]]; illegitimate children whom Richard had given legitimate status in 1390. He was made [[Marquess of Dorset]]; [[marquess]] being a relatively new title in England up until this point. Rutland, heir to the [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|Duke of York]], was created [[Counts and Dukes of Aumale|Duke of Aumale]]. Montacute had succeeded [[William Montacute, 2nd Earl of Salisbury|his uncle]] as [[Earl of Salisbury]] earlier the same year. Despenser, the great-grandson of [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]]'s favourite who was executed for treason in 1326, was given the forfeited [[Earl of Gloucester|earldom of Gloucester]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul (1997), pp. 381–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}}Though it had become established tradition for earldoms to descend in the male line, there was no such tradition for royal [[Succession to the British throne|succession in England]].

'''Richard Roberts''' (1803–1841) was an Irish sea captain. He entered the [[Royal Navy]] in his youth and served with them until he gained the rank of Lieutenant, and was given command of the [[SS Sirius (1837)|SS ''Sirius'']]. With Roberts at the helm, the ''Sirius'' became the first steamship to travel across the Atlantic to America, in April 1838. Shortly afterward, he was transferred to the [[SS President|SS ''President'']], which was lost at sea in March 1841. Roberts is presumed to have gone down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Windele |first=J. |year=1846 |url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/history/windelescork/Windele_ed.pdf |title=Historical And Descriptive Notices Of The City Of Cork And Its Vicinity; Gougaun-Barra, Glengariff, And Killarney |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts loved the sea so, that he's quoted as saying "..I'd go to sea in a bath tub[washing-tub]".&lt;ref&gt;Great Ocean Liners, PBS television, c.1993&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of transmission ==

Rodent borne disease can be transmitted through different forms of contact such as rodent bites, scratches, urine, saliva, etc.&lt;ref&gt;"Rodents"., CDC-Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Page last reviewed 2010 July 29. Content SourceL Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Division of High- Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. Website: https://www.cdc.gov/rodents/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Potential sites of contact with rodents include habitats such as barns, outbuildings, sheds, and dense urban areas. Transmission of disease through rodents can be spread to humans through direct handling and contact, or indirectly through rodents carrying the disease spread to ticks, mites, fleas (arboborne).&lt;ref&gt;[[Arbovirus]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}}

=== Diseases transmitted by rodents ===

==== Viral cause ====
One example of a robovirus is [[hantavirus]], which causes [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]]. Humans can be infected with Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome through direct contact with rodent drippings, saliva, or urine infected with strains of the virus. These components mix into the air and get transmitted when inhaled through airborne transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transmission  {{!}} Hantavirus |url=https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/hps/transmission.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lassa virus]] from the ''[[Arenaviridae]]'' family causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever and is also a robovirus transmitted by the rodent genus ''[[Mastomys natalensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lecompte |first1=Emilie |last2=Fichet-Calvet |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Daffis |first3=Stephane |last4=Koulemou |first4=Kekoura |last5=Sylla |first5=Oumar |last6=Kourouma |first6=Fode |last7=Dore |first7=Amadou |last8=Soropogui |first8=Barre |last9=Aniskin |first9=Vladimir |last10=Allali |first10=Bernard |last11=Kouassi Ka |first11=Stephane |last12=Lalis |first12=Aude |last13=Koivogui |first13=Lamine |last14=Gunthe |first14=Stephan |last15=Denys |first15=Christiane |last16=ter Meulen |first16=Jan |title=''Mastomys natalensis'' and Lassa Fever, West Africa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |date=2006 |volume=12 |issue=12 |pages=1971–1974 |doi=10.3201/eid1212.060812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lassa Fever|first1=Joseph B.|last1=McCormick|first2=Isabel J.|last2=King|first3=Patricia A.|last3=Webb|first4=Curtis L.|last4=Scribner|first5=Robert B.|last5=Craven|first6=Karl M.|last6=Johnson|first7=Luanne H.|last7=Elliott|first8=Rose|last8=Belmont-Williams|date=2 January 1986|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=314|issue=1|pages=20–26|doi=10.1056/nejm198601023140104}}&lt;/ref&gt;The multimammate rat is able to excrete the virus in its urine and droppings. These rat are often found in the savannas and forests of Africa. When these rats scavenge and enter households this provides an outlet for direct contact transmission with humans. It has also been found that airborne transmission can occur by engaging in cleaning activities such as sweeping. In some areas of Africa, the Mastomys rodent is caught and used as a source of food. This process can also lead to transmission and infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Transmission of Lassa fever |url=https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/lassa/transmission/index.html |website=Centers for Disease control and Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bacteria cause ====
Rat-bite Fever (RBF) is an rodent borne disease caused by two types of bacteria, ''[[Streptobacillus moniliformis]]'', which is predominant in North America and ''[[Spirillum minus]]'', predominantly in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Rat-bite Fever (RBF) Centers for disease Control and Prevention. 2015, April 24. website: https://www.cdc.gov/rat-bite-fever/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rat-bite fever is contacted by bites or scratches from an infected rodent, contaminated food or beverages with either bacteria, or by handling rodents with the disease, without necessarily being bitten or scratched by the rodent.&lt;ref&gt;Rat- bite Fever (RBF)- "Transmission". CDC- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Page last reviewed;: 2015, June 9. website = https://www.cdc.gov/rat-bite-fever/transmission/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diseases indirectly transmitted by rats ===

==== Viral cause ====
Colorado Tick Fever virus causes high fevers, chills, headache, fatigue and sometimes vomiting, skin rash, and abdominal pain. The virus is caused by a Rock Mountain wood tick (''Dermacentro Andersoni''). It is an arbovirus, but rodents serve as the reservoir. The tick is carried by five species of rodents: the least chipmunk (Eutamias minimus, Richardson's ground squirrels (Spermophilus richarsoni), deer mice (Peromyscus manipulates), the golden mantled squirrel (Spermophilus laterals), and the Uinta chipmunk ( Eutamias umbrinus).&lt;ref&gt;"Experimental Colorado Tick Fever virus Infection in Colorado Mammals" G.S. Down, R.B. Shriner, K.S. Pokorny, L.J. Kirk, and R.G Mclean. 1980, July 21.

Page also reviewed: 2015, January 13. website: https://www.cdc.gov/coloradotickfever/transmission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Parasite cause ====
Rodents can serve as the primary reservoir host of obligate intracellular protozoa from the genus ''Leishmania''.&lt;ref&gt;DPDx- Laboratory Identification of Parasitic Disease of Public Health Concern- "Leishmaniasis". CDC. Last reviewed: 2015, May 3.

Website: http://www.who.int/leishmaniasis/cutaneous_leishmaniasis/en/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors affecting roboviruses ===

Rodent populations are affected by a number of diverse factors, including climactic conditions. Warmer winters and increased rainfall will make it more likely for rodent populations to survive, therefore increasing the number of rodent reservoirs for disease. Increased rainfall accompanied by flooding can also increase human to rodent contact&lt;ref&gt;Human Health in a Changing climate: A Canadian Assessment of Vulnerabilities and Adaptive Capacity Ch 5. p188.

Website: http://inweh.unu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Ch5-Impacts-Climate-Change-Water-Food-Vector-Rodent-Disease.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Global [[climate change]] will affect the distribution and prevalence of roboviruses. Inadequate hygiene and sanitation, as seen in some European countries, also contribute to increase rodent populations and higher risks of rodent borne disease transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Rodent-borne diseases |format= website |agency= European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control |date= 2009 |url= https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/climate-change/climate-change-europe/rodent-borne-diseases |access-date= 30 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salvador Agron'''&lt;ref group=note&gt;The correct spelling of his surname in Spanish is '''Agrón'''. But the biography by Jacoby, his personal friend, uses the americanized spelling '''Agron''' exclusively throughout. The book contains numerous examples of personal correspondence from its subject, and he signs himself Agron, even when writing in Spanish, for example, "Tu amigo y hermano, Salvador Agron #16846" (Jacoby, p. 70).&lt;br /&gt;Reports of his arrest use the conventional americanized spelling. He was described as "Salvador Agron, the Cape Man" in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' on September 3, 1959 (reprinted in Jacoby, p. 181).&lt;/ref&gt; (April 24, 1943 – April 22, 1986), a.k.a. '''"The Capeman"''', was a Puerto Rican gang member who murdered two teenagers in a [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] park in 1959. Agron mistook both teenagers for members of a gang called the Norsemen who were supposed to show up for a gang fight. Agron was the subject of the musical ''[[The Capeman]]'' by [[Paul Simon]].

==Early years==
Agron was born in the city of [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]] on the western coast of Puerto Rico.  When he was young, his parents divorced and his mother had custody of him and his sister, Aurea. She earned a living by working at a local [[convent]]; however, according to Agron, he and his sister were mistreated by the nuns. His mother met and married a [[Pentecostal]] minister and the family moved to [[New York City]]. Agron's relationship with his stepfather was negative, and he asked his mother to send him back to Puerto Rico to live with his father. In Puerto Rico, his father had remarried. One day the teenage Agron found the body of his stepmother, who had committed [[suicide]] by hanging herself. Agron began to get into trouble and was sent to the Industrial School of Mayagüez.&lt;ref name="SCM"&gt;[http://www.wbr.com/paulsimon/capeman/cmp/story.html The story of the Capeman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415154222/http://www.wbr.com/paulsimon/capeman/cmp/story.html |date=April 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Capeman==
His father sent him back to his mother in New York, and in 1958 he became a member of notorious teenage [[street gang]] the [[Mau Maus]] from the [[Fort Greene, Brooklyn|Fort Greene]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newyorkcitygangs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/agron1.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;  He later joined another gang called the Vampires after meeting Tony Hernandez,&lt;ref group=note&gt;The correct spelling of his surname in Spanish is '''Hernández'''. The biography by Jacoby uses the americanized spelling '''Hernandez''' (Jacoby, p. 182).&lt;/ref&gt; the gang's president. On August 29, 1959, the Vampires were on their way to "rumble" (street gang fight) with a gang composed mostly of  [[Irish American]]s called the Norsemen. When they arrived, they mistook a group of teenagers for members of the Norsemen. Agron stabbed two of the teenagers to death and fled the scene. The two victims were Anthony Krzesinski and Robert Young, Jr.&lt;ref name="SCM"/&gt;

The murders made headlines in New York and the city went into an uproar. Agron was called "The Capeman" because he wore a black cape with red lining during the fight, while Hernandez was labeled "The Umbrella Man" because he used an umbrella with a sharp end as a weapon. After Agron was captured, he was quoted as saying: "I don't care if I burn, my mother could watch me."&lt;ref name="NYDN"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2009/09/06/2009-09-06_salvador_agron_cape_man.html Salvador Agron, the Capeman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incarceration==
Agron was sentenced to death, which made the 16-year-old the youngest prisoner ever sentenced to [[death row]] in New York.  While many New Yorkers were outraged about the killings, others like former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] and Robert Young, the father of one of the victims, campaigned for leniency.&lt;ref name="SCM"/&gt; While on death row, Agron became a born-again [[Christian]]. In prison he learned to read and write, earning his high school equivalency diploma. He wrote poems about his life and street life, including "The Political Identity of Salvador Agron; Travel Log of Thirty-Four Years", "Uhuru Sasa! (A Freedom Call)", and "Justice, Law and Order", which were published by some newspapers. He later earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[sociology]] and [[philosophy]] from the [[State University of New York]] in [[New Paltz (town), New York|New Paltz]], New York. His death sentence was commuted to life in prison by Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;

==Escape and release from prison==
In December 1976, Governor [[Hugh Carey]] reduced Agron's sentence, making him eligible for release in 1977. Agron was enrolled at [[SUNY New Paltz]] while spending his nights at the [[Fishkill Correctional Facility]]. However, in April 1977, Agron took flight and absconded to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] where he was captured two weeks later and brought back to New York. In November 1977, Agron went on trial for his escape (his lawyer was [[William Kunstler]]), but was found not guilty of absconding due to "mental illness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ex-iwp.org/st001.php "Matter Over Mind"; Vol. 1, No. 1, December, 1977 - NY State Jury Agrees That Prisons Produce Mental Illness; By Harry Kresky]&lt;/ref&gt; Agron was finally released from prison on November 1, 1979. A television movie based on his life was proposed and he set up a fund for the families of his victims with the money he received.&lt;ref name="SCM"/&gt;

==Later years==
Agron began working as a youth counselor, and spoke out against [[gang violence]] for over five years. On April 16, 1986, he was admitted to a hospital with [[pneumonia]] and internal bleeding and died six days later at age 42.&lt;ref name="NYDN"/&gt;

The extinct '''Solenoporaceae''' have traditionally been interpreted as a group of [[red alga]]e ancestral to the [[Corallinales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0022-3360| pages = 563–567 | last = Johnson | jstor = 1300291| date = May 1956| issue = 3| first = J.

The genus from which they take their name, '''''Solenopora''''', originates in the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=Blackwell1972&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = W. H.| first2 = J. H.| first3 = M.

The differences in structure suggest that the holotype is not an alga at all, but rather is a [[chaetetid]] sponge.

The term '''somatic''' is often used in biology to refer to the cells of the body in contrast to the germ line cells which usually give rise to the [[gamete]]s ([[ovum]] or [[sperm]]). These [[somatic cell]]s are [[diploid]] containing two copies of each [[chromosome]], whereas the germ cells are [[haploid]] as they only contain one copy of each chromosome. Although under normal circumstances all somatic cells in an organism contain identical [[DNA]], they develop a variety of tissue-specific characteristics. This process is called [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]], through [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] and regulatory alterations. The grouping of like cells and tissues creates the foundation for organs.

[[Somatic mutation]]s are changes to the genetics of a multi-cellular organism which are not passed on to its offspring through the germ-line. Many [[cancer]]s are somatic mutations.

Somatic is also defined as relating to the wall of the body cavity, particularly as distinguished from the head, limbs or [[Viscus|viscera]].

It is also used in the term [[somatic nervous system]] which is the portion of the [[vertebrate]] [[nervous system]] which regulates voluntary movements of the body.
==Mutation frequency==

The frequency of [[mutation]]s in mouse somatic tissue ([[brain]], [[liver]], [[Sertoli cell]]s) was compared to the mutation frequency in male [[germline]] cells at sequential stages of [[spermatogenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid9707592"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Walter CA, Intano GW, McCarrey JR, McMahan CA, Walter RB |title=Mutation frequency declines during spermatogenesis in young mice but increases in old mice |journal=Proc.

[[File:SuperTux 0.4.0 Ice in the Hole speedrun.webm|thumb|Speedrun of the Ice in the Hole phase of ''[[SuperTux]]'', skipping a large portion of the level by abusing a collision [[video game glitch|glitch]].]]
A '''speedrun''' is a play-through (or a recording thereof) of a [[video game]] performed with the intention of completing it as fast as possible. Speedruns may cover a whole game or a selected part, such as a single [[Level (gaming)|level]]. While all speedruns aim for quick completion, some speedruns are characterized by additional rules that players promise to obey, such as collecting all key items. Players attempt speedruns mainly to challenge themselves and to entertain and compete with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/|website=Speedrunslive| title = Speedrunslive FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Players performing speedruns call themselves speedrunners and often record their attempts. These recordings are used to entertain others, to verify the completion time, to certify that all rules were followed, and to spot ways to further improve the completion time.{{refn|group=Note |name=DemoFormat|Although many speedruns are released as video recordings, which are often preferred due to being more universal,  some communities use a game's native demo recordings (such as the &lt;tt&gt;DEM&lt;/tt&gt; format in by ''Quake'') since these are much more compact and easier to share with others. Such recordings require specific software to view, usually a version of the original game. Some communities release speedruns in both formats, so that they become accessible to a larger audience.}}

To achieve a high level of play, speedrunners often have to reason about the game differently from the way that ordinary players might. Speedruns usually follow [[gameplay]] routes that are planned out carefully before they are attempted. Many games have opportunities to disarrange the intended sequence of events and skip entire parts of it — often called [[sequence breaking]] — and many more have programming mistakes, or [[Glitch|glitches]], that a skillful player can exploit to their advantage. [[Tool-assisted speedrun|Tool-assisted speedrunning]] is a type of speedrunning in which various computer tools are used to obtain performances which would be near-impossible for a human player.

Some games are considered to be particularly suited to speedrunning and have [[virtual community|online communities]] dedicated to them, which can provide an active platform for discussing, publishing, and improving speedruns. Speedruns can be viewed on a variety of platforms, including [[Streaming media|live streams]] where players can carry out and share their attempts in real-time. Although speedrunning was originally not a widespread phenomenon, it has since grown to involve several active websites and an increasingly expansive assortment of speedrun videos that are freely and widely circulated on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/|title=Speedrun.com|last=|first=|date=|website=Speedrun.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SpeedRunsLive|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/|website=SpeedRunsLive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SpeedDemosArchive|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/|website=SpeedDemosArchive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SmashingTheClock"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url =  http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&amp;did=1 | title = Smashing the Clock | publisher = [[1UP.com]] | author = Turner, B. | accessdate =August 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GamersDividedMTV"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528811/20060417/index.jhtml|title=Gamers Divided Over Freakish Feats Achieved With Tool-Assisted Speed Runs|author=Totilo|first=Stephen|date=|year=2006|website=|publisher=[[MTV News]]|accessdate=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Common occurrences ==

=== Sequence breaking ===
{{main|Sequence breaking}}
While routing, it becomes apparent that some of the goals in the game do not need to be achieved for completion. Such elements include [[cutscene]]s that need to be watched before the player can progress, items that the player needs to possess in order to continue to a next stage, or even entire parts of the gameplay that may convey a part of the game's plot or a subplot. Skipping a part of the game in such a fashion that it can be described as disjointed with the game's intended/common sequence of events is referred to as ''sequence breaking''.

The term ''sequence break'' was first used in 2003 in an online [[Internet forum|discussion forum]] thread concerning the [[GameCube|Nintendo GameCube]] game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''.{{refn|group=Note |name=OldMetroidTopics|Metroid 2002, a major Metroid speedrunning website, has retained back-ups of these topics that can be found at &lt;tt&gt;[http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php http://www.metroid2002.com/home.php]&lt;/tt&gt;. See [[Speedrun#Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)|section "Metroid 2002 (Metroid series)"]] for more information on Metroid 2002.}} The original thread was called "Gravity Suit and Ice Beam before Thardus"; since then, the "''x'' before ''y''" notation has become common in the nomenclature of speedrunning. Thardus, a fictional creature in the [[Metroid|''Metroid'' series]], was designed to be a mandatory [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] before the Gravity Suit and Ice Beam could be obtained, hence the novelty of bypassing the boss while still obtaining the items. Since its initial discovery, sequence breaking has become an integral part of speedrunning and has been applied to many other games.

=== Glitch usage ===
[[Image:Sm64 mips.png|thumb|large|Usage of a [[Speedrun#Glitches|glitch]] in ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' to pass through a wall, performing a sequence break.]]
An example of sequence breaking as a result of a [[glitch]] can be found in the "16 Star" run of ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. In this game, [[Mario]] normally needs to collect at least 70 of the 120 power stars before he is allowed to challenge [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], the final boss, but a glitch makes it possible to access the final level with only 16 stars. With the right kind of movement, it is possible to pass through the boundary of a wall by pushing into it while holding onto MIPS, an [[Non-player character|NPC]] rabbit.&lt;ref name="SuperMario6416Star"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/Mario64.html | title = Super Mario 64 | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | accessdate =March 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, similar tricks have been found to complete the game without collecting any stars.

While some speedrun rules require that the skipping of such events be avoided, it is often desirable to make full use of such possibilities. Therefore, some websites, such as Speeddemosarchive&lt;ref name="speeddemosarchive.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|title=Speed Demos Archive - Rules|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022020158/http://speeddemosarchive.com/lang/rules_en.html|archivedate=October 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;, offer support for multiple speedrun categories. Each category specifies which glitches are permitted and what game objectives must be completed. For example, it is typically agreed that glitches arising from outside the game, such as improperly inserting the [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]], are impermissible.

{{quotation|Removing or altering a game disc/cartridge/files while the game is running is forbidden. Examples of this are the crooked cartridge trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]] and the CD streaming trick in [[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess]]. If you're not sure what this rule means, think about it this way: don't mess with your system while playing the game, and don't modify the game itself at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZeldaSpeedRuns Leaderboard Rules|url=http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|website=ZeldaSpeedRuns|access-date=September 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916220003/http://zeldaspeedruns.com/leaderboards/rules|archive-date=September 16, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

== Tool-assistance ==
{{main|Tool-assisted speedrun}}
Although most speedruns assume normal human play of a game, ''[[tool-assisted speedrun]]s'' (abbreviated ''TAS'') allow authors to use outside tools to aid their playing. For example, utilizing the [[Saved game#Save states|save state]] function of an [[Video game console emulator|emulator]] to go back in time and revise mistakes (known as ''re-recording''), or using software to read [[Variable (computer science)|variables]] directly from the game's memory, giving the player information not normally available to them. The result is that human limitations, such as skill and reflex, are no longer a barrier in the creation of a run; tool-assisted runs have (sometimes significantly) lower completion times than their unassisted equivalents.&lt;ref name="WhyAndHow"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://tasvideos.org/WhyAndHow.html | title = Why And How | publisher = TASVideos | author = TASVideos contributors | accessdate =March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Completion ==
Speedruns are categorized into various levels of completion, or how thoroughly a game is completed, which are as follows:

*'''Any%''', or fastest completion, refers to completing the game as quickly as possible, and often involves sequence breaking. 
*'''100%''', or full completion, requires the player to complete the game to its fullest. This often includes collecting all key items or upgrades, finding all secret features, or anything else that may be deemed important. Specific requirements for a 100% speedrun are different depending on the game.&lt;ref name="forum.speeddemosarchive.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forum.speeddemosarchive.com/post/low100_definitions.html|title=low%/100% definitions|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some games, such as ''[[Super Metroid]]'', have a percentage counter and therefore have an easy definition for 100%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=sweetnumb's SM 100% Item Advanced Tutorial with WildAnaconda69|url=https://www.twitch.tv/sweetnumb/v/44379421|website=Twitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others do not, and instead the game's community decides what the definition for 100% should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|title=SpeedRunsLive Speedrunning Glossary|last=|first=|date=|website=SpeedRunsLive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615224214/http://www.speedrunslive.com/faq/glossary/|archive-date=June 15, 2018|dead-url=No|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any% and 100% are the most common categories for speedrunning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@CeltThulu/speedrunning-a-primer-for-beginners-by-a-beginner-76d1f2bdc|title=Speedrunning — A Primer For Beginners, By a Beginner|last=Steele|first=Brian|date=November 15, 2015|website=Medium|access-date=July 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Low%''', or minimalist completion, requires the player to complete the game by obtaining the fewest key items or upgrades possible. If the fastest way to complete the game already involves the player picking up the fewest key items or upgrades, a low% category may not exist for that game's speedruns.&lt;ref name="speeddemosarchive.com"/&gt; As with 100% runs, low% speedruns have requirements that vary between games.&lt;ref name="forum.speeddemosarchive.com"/&gt;

In addition, there can be game-specific categories that change how much of the game must be completed. These categories usually include completing or avoiding specific aspects of the game and/or not allowing certain glitches or game exploits to be used in the run. An example of this would be the medallions/stones/trials category in ''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''; this category requires the runner to beat all major levels in the game and restricts some of the glitches that can be performed. In ''[[Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!|Donkey Kong Country 3]]'', there is a "Water%" run, which constitutes collecting every DK Coin in the game; this requires the player to collect every Bear Coin to access the Lost World, but does not require a player to actually 100% the game and ignore the Banana Birds.&lt;ref name="DKCspeedruns"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dkcspeedruns.com/Leaderboards#DKC3_-_Water.25|title=water% definition|accessdate=June 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Historically, speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]] pertaining to video games in general. When the activity became popular enough to accede to [[subculture]], the first sites dedicated to speedrunning started appearing—usually specializing in just one or a few games. Some of these sites have sustained activity for a long time, sometimes even up to today, providing coverage of its members' achievements and serving as a platform for related discussions.

=== COMPET-N (Doom) ===
December 1993 saw the release of [[id Software]]'s ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', which allowed players to record demo files of their playthrough. The feature was first picked up by Christina "Strunoph" Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.&lt;ref name="DoomWorldHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.doomworld.com/10years/demos/demos01.php|title=A Brief DOOM Demo History|author=Merrill, D.|first=|date=|year=2003|website=|publisher=Doomworld|accessdate=October 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This site was, however, quickly followed up by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'' (also known as the "DHT"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/dht/dht6.html|title=Doom Honorific Titles|last=|first=|date=|website=Doom Honorific Titles|accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.&lt;ref name="SmashingTheClock"/&gt; This site, designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on one of the predetermined maps in the "[[Doom WAD|IWADs]]", would create the basis for all ''Doom'' demo sites that would follow.&lt;ref name="DoomWorldHistory"/&gt; These so-called "exams" became very popular as the player had to earn each title by submitting a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify his application. ''[[Doom II|Doom II: Hell on Earth]]'' was released in October 1994,{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new ''Doom'' version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles.&lt;ref name="DoomWorldHistory"/&gt; For example, playing with only the in-game fists and pistol, while killing all monsters on a map, became known as "Tyson" mode, named after the heavyweight boxer and former champion [[Mike Tyson]]. "Pacifist mode" was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had "easy", "medium", and "hard" difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. As an authentication method to prevent players from submitting demos made by other people, it was required that they performed a distinct "dance" during their demo (often at the very beginning). With such varied categories, the DHT was appealing to a diverse group of players.&lt;ref name="DoomWorldHistory"/&gt; However, the DHT had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the constantly changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, caused public interest to wane as the years went by.

In November 1994, the definitive installment ''Doom'' speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, was launched.&lt;ref name="DoomWorldHistory"/&gt; Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of ''Doom''-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they were all based on the idea of fast completion, thus making it the first actual speedrunning site. Players were challenged to run through ''Doom''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards, leading to demo material gradually amounting to hundreds of hours of recorded gameplay.&lt;ref name="DoomStats"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = Doom2.net | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | archivedate = April 12, 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140412062105/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was hosted on the ''[[Simtel]]'' servers for a while, before Istvan Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to a now defunct [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server of the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics|Technical University of Budapest]]. From there on, since early 1998, it had been administered by Adam Hegyi, who was maintaining the site, but left around 2007 without notice. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bužanić took over maintaining the site and re-created new database for WAD-s and PWAD-s. It is currently located at http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n.

As of November 2007, COMPET-N contained a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.&lt;ref name="DoomStats"/&gt; As of January 2012, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 9122 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 749 hours, 41 minutes and 47 seconds.

=== Speed Demos Archive ===

[[File:Q1scr 0.png|thumb|320px|A "[[grenade jumping|grenade jump]]" is used in the ''E4M3'' (''The Elder God Shrine'') level in order to jump over a large lava pit without having to wait for a bridge to appear.&lt;ref name="E4M3ElderGod"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/mkt.pl?level:e4m3|title=e4m3 – The Elder God Shrine|author=Petersen|first=Sandy|date=|website=|publisher=[[Speed Demos Archive]]|accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Following the success of the ''Doom'' speedrunning community, people first started recording demos of ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' playthroughs when it was released in June 1996 and sharing them with others on the &lt;tt&gt;demos/e&lt;/tt&gt; directory in [[Simtel]]'s ''Quake'' file hierarchy.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXT"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = History of Quake speed-running | publisher = Internet Archive | author = Speed Demos Archive contributors | accessdate =November 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two distinct kinds of demos: those in which the player killed all monsters and found all secrets on the map (called "100% demos") and those in which the player ignored these goals in order to finish the level as fast as possible (called "runs"). All levels were, at that time, recorded solely on the "Nightmare" difficulty level, the highest in the game.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXT"/&gt;

In April 1997, Nolan "Radix" Pflug first started the ''Nightmare Speed Demos'' website to keep track of the fastest demos.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXT"/&gt; In June of that same year, the first ''[[Quake Done Quick|Quake done Quick]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/qdq/|title=Quake done Quick|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; project was finalized; ''Quake done Quick'', unlike the conventional record demos, featured a full playthrough of the game, carrying over one level's finishing statistics to the next.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXT"/&gt; The project members ended up making a movie in which the entire game is finished on Nightmare difficulty in 0:19:49;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqr.html |title=PlanetQuake |work=gamespy.com |accessdate=March 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409151629/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqr.html |archivedate=April 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it was a collection of the best runs that the members of the site had been made thus far, and at that time, there was no other run that came close.&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuick"&gt;{{Cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/all_1949.txt | publisher = [[Quake done Quick]] | title = ALL_1949 | author1 = Donner, Yonatan | author2 = Belz, Matthias | author3 = Pflug, Nolan | author4 = Bailey, Anthony | archivedate = June 7, 2007 | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070607054958/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/all_1949.txt | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The run was "recammed", i.e reconstructed so that it could be also viewed from a third-person perspective, which gained it its [[machinima]] status.&lt;ref name="QdQrMachinima"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machinima.com/article/view%26id%3D78|title=Showcase: Quake done Quicker|author=Machinima.com Staff|first=|date=|year=2001|website=|publisher=Machinima.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409004729/http://www.machinima.com/article/view%26id%3D78|archivedate=April 9, 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=October 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received widespread attention from gaming magazines, being distributed as part of the free CDs that they came with.&lt;ref name="qdqr"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/qdq/movies/qdqr.html | title = Quake Done Quick: QdQr | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | author = Speed Demos Archive contributors | accessdate =March 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This popularized speedrunning for a much larger audience than before and attracted many newcomers. Not all of those newcomers agreed with the standard that runs should be made on the hardest possible difficulty level. Thus, in August 1997, ''Muad'Dib's Quake Page'' came to be, run by Gunnar "Muad'Dib" Andre Mo and specializing in "Easy" difficulty runs.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXT"/&gt; One month after that, the ''Quake done Quick'' movie was superseded by a new movie called ''Quake done Quicker'' on September 14, 1997, which shortened the game's fastest playthrough to 0:16:35.&lt;ref name="qdqr"/&gt;

In April 1998, Pflug and Mo merged their pages, thus creating the ''[[Speed Demos Archive]]'', which, as of 2007, is still the dominant community for ''Quake'' speedrunning and also acts as repository for demos, maps, statistics, and software pertaining to the practice.&lt;ref name="HistoryTXT"/&gt; Ever since its creation, a large variety of tricks have been discovered in ''Quake''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s physics. Despite being released as early as 1996, ''Quake'' has steadily remained popular with its players, who subsequently released the ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance'' movie on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through ''Quake'' in 0:12:23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |accessdate=March 25, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423162351/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |archivedate=April 23, 2006 |title=Quake done Quick with a Vengeance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily tricks that had not been used in both its predecessors allowed for this improvement, as the run's manual states that it "[makes] use of every known trick, including unrestricted [[Strafe-jumping|bunny-hopping]], to represent the state-of-the-art in Nightmare running".&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeance"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | publisher = Quake done Quick | title = Quake done Quick with a Vengeance | author = Quake done Quick contributors | archivedate = April 9, 2006 | accessdate = October 28, 2016 | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060409151532/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.txt | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2014, Speed Demos Archive can be found at the web address &lt;tt&gt;[http://speeddemosarchive.com/ http://speeddemosarchive.com/]&lt;/tt&gt; and contains a total amount of 9535 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of over 250 hours.&lt;ref name="QuakeStats"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = Quake (PC) – Speed demo collection | publisher = Internet Archive | accessdate =September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, a new run was produced and called ''Quake done Quickest''. The improvements that were made resulted in a time of 0:11:29 for the entire game, an improvement of 54 seconds over ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance''.&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeancePartIIProgress"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2011 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/projects/qdqwavp2/ | title = Quake done Quickest | publisher = [[Speed Demos Archive]] | author = Speed Demos Archive contributors | accessdate =April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metroid 2002 (Metroid series) ===
Released in August 1986, ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' was one of the earliest games to introduce special rewards for fast completion times. As is the case for the rest of the games in the series, highly [[nonlinear gameplay]] makes it possible for runners to search extensively for different routes towards the end of the game. In particular, the ability to perform sequence breaking has been researched thoroughly, leading to the discovery of ways to complete the games while obtaining only a small percentage of items. Prior to the inception of Metroid speedrunning, there were special websites which documented these so-called "low-percentage" completion possibilities.

The first game to be exceedingly popular with the speedrunning audience was ''[[Super Metroid]]'', released in 1994, which proved to lend itself to fast completion purposes very well.&lt;ref name="SmashingTheClock"/&gt; It featured a physics system that allowed for a wide array of skills for mobility, like "wall jumping" or the "Shinespark", allowing players to skip over large areas of the game, or play through the game in different manners based on how well they can perform these tricks in contextual situations. Additionally, it had the same nonlinear gameplay as its predecessors. Due to the way the game was laid out, several different run types or tiers that incorporate different completion percentages have been performed,{{refn|group=Note |name=TierFooter|A "tier", in this context, is a certain time-related goal that determines the strategy or route used in a speedrun. For example, a low-percentage speedrun is in a different tier than an any-percentage speedrun, as both have different completion goals.}} including any%, 100%, low%, and reverse boss order (RBO), in which the player beats the game's bosses in the opposite order they were meant to be played via sequence breaking.

As the Internet became more available to the general public, groups of players started collaborating on [[Internet forum|message boards]] to discuss these tricks with one another in what became a community based on playing the games speedily.

The first ''Metroid'' community that was created for the purpose of fast completion was ''Metroid Prime Discoveries'', created and led by Jean-Sebastien "Zell" Dubois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|title=Lycos.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 22, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410072328/http://membres.lycos.fr/zellmetroid/|archivedate=April 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Rather than being a site that focused on speedrunning, it was dedicated to documenting the possibilities of sequence breaking in the game ''[[Metroid Prime]]''. When the interest arose to begin the documentation of other games in the series, however, the new site ''Metroid 2002'' was created by Nathan "nate" Jahnke in August 2003.[http://www.metroid2002.com/]{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Initially, the only incentive was to document the two ''Metroid'' games released in 2002—''Metroid Prime'' and ''[[Metroid Fusion]]''—but this changed when Nathan was asked to take all content of ''Metroid Online''—another site that had been developed at that time and contained sequence breaking documentation, a message board, and a 1% ''Metroid Fusion'' run—and relaunch Metroid 2002 as "the one resource for ''Metroid Prime'' sequence breaking info." This relaunch happened less than two weeks after the proposition and came to be in November.&lt;ref name="Metroid2002History1"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2005 | url = http://forum.metroid2002.com/index.php/topic,3394.0.html | title = history of metroid 2002, part 1 (was: happy birthday, m2k2!) | publisher = metroid 2002 | author = Jahnke, N. | accessdate =April 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ever since, it has been the central repository for everything related to speedrunning the ''Metroid'' series.

It was also in November 2003 that ''Metroid'' speedrunner Nolan Pflug released his 100% run of ''[[Metroid Prime]]'', in which he finished the entire game in 1 hour, 37 minutes.{{refn|group=Note |name=NolanPflug100MetroidPrime|This speedrun has since been replaced with an improved version, and as such, its original host, [[Speed Demos Archive]], no longer makes mention of it. The original announcement, however, may still be found using the [[Internet Archive]]'s Wayback Machine at &lt;tt&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031202174746/http://planetquake.com/sda/mp/ https://web.archive.org/web/20031202174746/http://planetquake.com/sda/mp/]&lt;/tt&gt;.}} Since it was featured in the games section of [[Slashdot]], it gained widespread attention.&lt;ref name="SlashdotMetroid"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/10/0655226&amp;tid=213&amp;tid=10 |title = Metroid Prime Done Even Quicker |work= [[Slashdot]] |accessdate =January 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications in numerous different languages ran stories on the run, and topics about the run were made on gaming message boards around the world. The first segment of his run was being downloaded over five thousand times a day at the peak of its popularity.&lt;ref name="Metroid2002History2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metroid2002.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=4151|title=history of metroid 2002, part 2|author=Jahnke|first=Nate|date=|year=2005|website=|publisher=Metroid 2002|accessdate=December 31, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Metroid 2002 [[IRC]] channel was flooded with people who had heard about the run and wanted to know more about it, fast dwarfing the original population, and its message board saw its member count double in size the month following the run's release. As a result of the popularity of this run, it was decided that in order to best serve the growing bandwidth consumption, Metroid 2002 would have to merge its array of videos with [[Speed Demos Archive]], which was at that time being provided nearly limitless server capacity for their runs on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref name="Metroid2002History2"/&gt;

As of September 2018, the best completion time for the North American version of ''Metroid Prime'' is 51 minutes by "JustinDM." He has also reduced the 100% time to 1 hour 10 minutes, obsoleting "Bartendorsparky"'s and "MPZoid"'s runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14nXkGxsMnR_ln6GXXUT5-M1byqm0kHphU4PxS1VbASQ/edit#gid=0|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TASVideos (tool-assisted speedruns) ===
It was in early 1999 that the term "[[tool-assisted speedrun]]" was first coined, during the early days of ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' speedrunning, although they were also called "built demos", in accordance with the "demo" terminology. Players first started recording these special demos when Andy "Aurican" Kempling released a modified version of the ''Doom'' [[source code]] that made it possible to record demos in slow motion and in several sessions. A couple of months afterwards, in June 1999, the first site made for the purpose of sharing these demos, aptly called "Tools-Assisted Speedruns", was opened by Esko Koskimaa, Peo Sjoblom, and Yonatan Donner.&lt;ref name="DoomWorldHistory"/&gt;{{refn|group=Note |name=ToolsAssistedSpeedrun|Doom tool-assisted speedrunning is sometimes referred to as "tools-assisted speedrunning", after the first site used to share these demos. A news post after the creation of this site, however, read "Indeed, I was wrong and the site should be called 'Tool-Assisted Speedruns' rather than 'Tools-Assisted Speedruns'. I'm not going to redo the logo though."}}

Like other such communities, the maintainers of the site stressed that their demos were for entertainment purposes rather than skill competitions, although the attempt to have the fastest time possible with tools itself became a competition as well.&lt;ref name="AboutToolsAssistedSpeedruns"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2000 | url = http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | publisher = Internet Archive | title = Information about Tools-Assisted Speedruns | author = Koskimaa, E. | author2 = Sjoblom, P. | author3 = Donner, Y. | accessdate = April 8, 2006 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20000411175100/http://doomworld.com/tas/about.html | archivedate = April 11, 2000 | deadurl = yes | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The site became a success, usually updating several times a week with demos recorded by its maintainers and submitted by its readers. The site was active until August 10, 2001, at which point a news message was posted to state that the site would cease its regular updates and act as archive from then on.&lt;ref name="EndOfToolsAssistedSpeedruns"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2001 | url = http://www.doomworld.com/tas/ | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010813062639/http://www.doomworld.com/tas/ | archivedate = August 13, 2001 | publisher = Internet Archive | title = Tools-Assisted Speedruns | author = Koskimaa, E. | author2 = Sjoblom, P. | author3 = Donner, Y. | accessdate =April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of ''Doom'' tool-assisted speedrunning has dwindled since then.

In mid-2003, an anonymous speedrunner using the nickname {{Nihongo|Morimoto|もりもと}} released a video in which he played through ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' with an unprecedented level of skill; he beat the entire game in just over 11 minutes without making a single mistake and managed to accumulate 99 [[Life (gaming)|1-ups]] throughout levels during which he had to wait.&lt;ref name="SmashingTheClock"/&gt; In addition, he put himself in dangerous situations over and over, only to escape them without sustaining any damage. Although it was widely believed that the video was made by an extremely skilled player, it was actually the first tool-assisted speedrun made with a special emulator to generate widespread interest.{{refn|group=Note |name=EarlyTASVideos|There is evidence that several tool-assisted speedrun videos had been made before then, including a few others by Morimoto himself, but the Super Mario Bros. 3 video was the first to become popular with a general audience.}} When Morimoto detailed the making of the run on his website,&lt;ref name="MorimotoExplanation"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2003 | url = http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20031203222907/http://soramimi.egoism.jp/emu.htm | archivedate = December 3, 2003 | title = emu | publisher = Internet Archive | author = "もりもと" | accessdate =December 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; many felt deceived and turned to criticizing the video's "illegitimacy" instead. The knowledge that the video was constructed through tedious and careful selective replaying also raised some questions about the authenticity of video game replays; after all, if it is practically impossible to tell the videos of both kinds apart, one cannot possibly know whether a run was made with or without the use of a special emulator. It was even feared that this fact would cause the downfall of competitive speedrunning.&lt;ref name="SmashingTheClock"/&gt; Neither the Speed Demos Archive nor Metroid 2002 have ever published runs that were known to be made with a special emulator. Nolan Pflug, the former [[webmaster]] of Speed Demos Archive, has been quoted as saying, "My basic thought is 'don't like them, haven't made them, don't watch them,'" when asked for his opinion on the subject.&lt;ref name="GamersDividedMTV"/&gt;

Thus, in late 2003, the first public website that served tool-assisted speedrun videos from multiple authors, TASVideos (then known as NESVideos), was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NESVideos - Backup|url=http://bisqwit.iki.fi/jutut/backup-nesvideos.html|website=Nintendo Entertainment System "superplay" videos}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally created by Joel "Bisqwit" Yliluoma for the purpose of showcasing, sharing, and discussing speedruns made with special emulators—at first, the site only held videos of [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] games, in part due to the fact that the only emulator suitable for this specialist purpose was, at that time, the Famtasia NES emulator.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Besides just serving the speedrun recordings in the emulator's original format (which, much like ''Doom'' and ''Quake'' demos, required both the emulator and the game in order to be played back), the site also held &lt;tt&gt;AVI&lt;/tt&gt; files, which were made available using the [[BitTorrent|BitTorrent protocol]]. &lt;!-- add info about site's growth--&gt;As of March 2016, it holds over 3,000 complete speedruns.&lt;ref name="TASMovieList"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tasvideos.org/ListAllMovies.html |title= List All Movies |work=tasvideos.org |accessdate=March 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speedrun.com===

In 2014, a new dedicated website was opened up for speedrunners called [https://www.speedrun.com/ speedrun.com]. Since the website opened, more people from the speedrunning community added game pages to popular video games and has a dedicated leaderboards for each game. The leaderboards show who has what position and who holds the World Record for the game and category. The website also shows who is streaming on what game and has a dedicated forum and a guides section for each game.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedrun.com/about&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, the site has over 160,000 registered users and over 670,000 submitted runs. The founder of this website is Pac.

==Speedrun marathons==
{{About|speedrunning marathons in general|information about the American Speedrunning Marathon hosted by [[Speed Demos Archive]]|Games Done Quick|section=yes}}

A speedrun marathon is a webstream of multiple games being speedrun in succession. This often takes the form of a [[fan convention]] where runners get together to speedrun video games to raise money for charity, but may also be a purely online event. The most popular speedrun marathons are the biannual [[Games Done Quick]] marathon in the United States. Before the marathons, discussions take place on a forum, and runners submit their game choices. An online schedule is created that will show who is speedrunning, when they are speedrunning, and what game they are speedrunning. Their runs are streamed live at [[Twitch.tv]], and runners often provide commentary throughout the run to give viewers a better understanding of what is going on. Runners who are speedrunning often practice their game in a practice room at the event before their scheduled run as a warm up, or they practice at home beforehand. Speedrun marathons such as the Awesome Games Done Quick 2017 marathon have raised $2,222,934.52 for the [[Prevent Cancer Foundation]].&lt;ref name="gdq2016total"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gamesdonequick.com/tracker/donations/agdq2017|title=Donation Index|last=|first=|date=|website=Games Done Quick 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Star lifting''' is any of several hypothetical processes by which a sufficiently advanced civilization (specifically, one of [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev-II]] or higher) could remove a substantial portion of a [[star]]'s matter which can then be re-purposed, while possibly optimizing the star's energy output and lifespan at the same time. The term appears to have been coined by [[David Criswell]].

Stars already lose a small flow of mass via [[solar wind]], [[coronal mass ejection]]s, and other natural processes. Over the course of a star's life on the [[main sequence]] this loss is usually negligible compared to the star's total mass; only at the end of a star's life when it becomes a [[red giant]] or a [[supernova]] is a large amount of material ejected. The star lifting techniques that have been proposed would operate by increasing this natural [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] flow and manipulating it with [[magnetic field]]s.

Stars have deep [[gravity well]]s, so the energy required for such operations is large. For example, lifting solar material from the surface of the [[Sun]] to infinity requires 2.1 [[scientific notation|&amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[joule|J]]/[[kilogram|kg]]. This energy could be supplied by the star itself, collected by a [[Dyson sphere]]; using 10% of the Sun's total power output would allow 5.9 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt; kilograms of matter to be lifted per year (0.0000003% of the Sun's total mass), or 8% of the mass of [[Earth]]'s [[the Moon|moon]].

==Methods for lifting material==

===Thermal-driven outflow===
[[Image:Star lifting 1.svg|thumb|180px|right|A mechanism for "harvesting" solar wind (RC = ring current, MN = magnetic nozzles, J = plasma jet).]]
The simplest system for star lifting would increase the rate of solar wind outflow by directly heating small regions of the star's atmosphere, using any of a number of different means to deliver energy such as [[microwave]] beams, [[laser]]s, or [[particle beam]]s &amp;ndash; whatever proved to be most efficient for the engineers of the system. This would produce a large and sustained eruption similar to a [[solar flare]] at the target location, feeding the solar wind.

The resulting outflow would be collected by using a [[ring current]] around the star's equator to generate a powerful [[torus|toroidal]] [[magnetic field]] with its [[dipole]]s over the star's rotational poles. This would deflect the star's solar wind into a pair of jets aligned along its rotational axis passing through a pair of magnetic rocket [[nozzle]]s. The [[magnetic nozzle]]s would convert some of the plasma's thermal energy into outward velocity, helping cool the outflow. The ring current required to generate this magnetic field would be generated by a ring of [[particle accelerator]] [[space station]]s in close orbit around the star's equator. These accelerators would be physically separate from each other but would exchange two counterdirected beams of oppositely charged [[ion]]s with their neighbor on each side, forming a complete circuit around the star.

==="Huff-n-Puff"===
Criswell proposed a modification to the polar jet system in which the magnetic field could be used to increase solar wind outflow directly, without requiring additional heating of the star's surface. He dubbed it the "Huff-n-Puff" method, inspired from the Big Bad Wolf's threats in the fairy tale of ''[[Three Little Pigs]]''.

In this system the ring of particle accelerators would not be in orbit, instead depending on the outward force of the magnetic field itself for support against the star's gravity. To inject energy into the star's atmosphere the ring current would first be temporarily shut down, allowing the particle accelerator stations to begin falling freely toward the star's surface. Once the stations had developed sufficient inward velocity the ring current would be reactivated and the resulting magnetic field would be used to reverse the stations' fall. This would "squeeze" the star, propelling stellar atmosphere through the polar magnetic nozzles. The ring current would be shut down again before the ring stations achieved enough outward velocity to throw them too far away from the star, and the star's gravity would be allowed to pull them back inward to repeat the cycle.

A single set of ring stations would result in a very intermittent flow. It is possible to smooth this flow out by using multiple sets of ring stations, with each set operating in a different stage of the Huff-n-Puff cycle at any given moment so that there is always one ring "squeezing". This would also smooth out the power requirements of the system over time.

===Centrifugal acceleration===
An alternative to the Huff-n-Puff method for using the toroidal magnetic field to increase solar wind outflow involves placing the ring stations in a polar orbit rather than an equatorial one. The two magnetic nozzles would then be located on the star's equator. To increase the rate of outflow through these two equatorial jets, the ring system would be rotated around the star at a rate significantly faster than the star's natural rotation. This would cause the stellar atmosphere swept up by the magnetic field to be flung outward.

This method suffers from a number of significant complications compared to the others. Rotating the ring in this manner would require the ring stations to use powerful rocket thrust, requiring both large [[rocket]] systems and a large amount of [[reaction mass]]. This reaction mass can be "recycled" by directing the rockets' exhausts so that it impacts the star's surface, but harvesting fresh reaction mass from the star's outflow and delivering it to the ring stations in sufficient quantity adds still more complexity to the system. Finally, the resulting jets would spiral outward from the star's equator rather than emerging straight from the poles; this could complicate harvesting it, as well as the arrangement of the [[Dyson sphere]] powering the system.

==Harvesting lifted mass==
The material lifted from a star will emerge in the form of plasma jets hundreds or thousands of [[astronomical unit]]s long, primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] and highly diffuse by current engineering standards. The details of extracting useful materials from this stream and storing the vast quantities that would result have not been extensively explored. One possible approach is to purify useful elements from the jets using extremely large-scale [[mass spectrometry]], cool them by [[laser cooling]], and condense them on particles of dust for collection. Small artificial [[gas giant]] planets could be constructed from excess hydrogen and helium to store it for future use.

==Stellar husbandry==
The lifespan of a star is determined by the size of its supply of nuclear "fuel" and the rate at which it uses up that fuel in [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions in its core. Larger stars have a larger supply of fuel, but the increased core pressure resulting from that additional mass increases the reaction rate even more; large stars have a significantly shorter lifespan than small ones. Current theories of stellar dynamics also suggest that there is very little mixing between the bulk of a star's atmosphere and the material of its core, where fusion takes place, so most of a large star's fuel will never be used naturally.

As a star's mass is reduced by star lifting its rate of nuclear fusion will decrease, reducing the amount of energy available to the star lifting process but also reducing the gravity that needs to be overcome. Theoretically, it would be possible to remove an arbitrarily large portion of a star's total mass given sufficient time. In this manner a civilization could control the rate at which its star uses fuel, optimizing the star's power output and lifespan to its needs. The hydrogen and helium extracted in the process could also be used as fusion reactor fuel. Alternatively, the material could be assembled into additional smaller stars, to improve the efficiency of its use. Theoretically all the energy of the matter lifted from a star could be harvested if it is made into small [[black holes]], via the mechanism of [[Hawking Radiation]].

==In fiction==
*In the series ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', the Ancient ship Destiny is fueled by plasma from stars. The ship skims over the surface of a star just before dipping below the star's photosphere to scoop in plasma using its retractable collectors.
*In the ''[[Star Wars]]'' franchise of ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)|Knights of the Old Republic]]'', the Star Forge is capable of star lifting. In a way, Starkiller Base in the seventh canonical film star lifts in order to power its planets-destroying laser cannon.
*The novel ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]] &amp;ndash; [[The Murdered Sun]]'' featured a reptilian race using the material from a star to sustain the opening of a [[wormhole]]. However, the novel depicted the process as shortening the star's lifespan precipitously rather than extending it.
*In ''[[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]]'' by [[Peter F. Hamilton]], the alien species the Kiint created an arc of custom made planets around their sun from mass extracted from their star.
*In the [[Doctor Who]] episode "[[42 (Doctor Who)|42]]" the crew of the starship ''Pentallian'' use a [[Sun scoop]] to draw matter from a star to use as fuel for their ship.

'''''Transhuman Space''''' ('''THS''') is a [[role-playing game]] published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as parts of the "Powered by ''[[GURPS]]''" (''Generic Universal Role-Playing System'') line. Set in the year 2100, humanity has begun to [[space colonization|colonize]] the [[Solar System]]. The pursuit of [[transhumanism]] is now in full swing, as more and more people struggle to reach a fully [[posthuman]] state.

''Transhuman Space'' was one of the first role-playing games to tackle [[postcyberpunk]] and transhumanist themes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} In 2002, the ''Transhuman Space'' adventure "Orbital Decay" received an Origins Award nomination for Best Role-Playing Game Adventure. ''Transhuman Space'' won the 2003 Grog d'Or Award for ''Best Role-playing Game, Game Line or RPG Setting''.

==Setting==
The game assumes that no cataclysm — natural or human-induced — swept [[Earth]] in the 21st century. Instead, constant developments in [[information technology]], [[genetic engineering]], [[nanotechnology]] and [[nuclear physics]] generally improved condition of the average human life. Plagues of the 20th century (like [[cancer]] or [[AIDS]]) have been suppressed, the [[ozone layer]] is being restored and Earth's [[ecosystem]]s are recovering (although thermal emission by [[fusion power]] plants poses an environmental threat—albeit a much lesser one than previous sources of energy). Thanks to [[Medicine|modern medicine]] humans live [[Genealogies of Genesis|biblical]] timespans surrounded by various [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]] helper [[Application software|applications]] and [[robot]]s (cybershells), sensory experience [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s (future TV) and [[cyberspace]] [[telepresence]]. Thanks to cheap and clean [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] energy humanity has power to fuel all these wonders, restore and transform its home planet and finally settle on other heavenly bodies.

Human [[genetic engineering]] has advanced to the point that anyone—single individuals, [[Same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]], groups of three or more—can reproduce. The embryos can be allowed to be developed naturally, or they can undergo three levels of tinkering: 
1. ''Genefixing'', which corrects defects; 
2. ''Upgrades'', which boost natural abilities (Ishtar Upgrades are slightly more attractive than usual, Metanoia Upgrades are more intelligent, etc.); and... 
3. Full transition to ''parahuman'' status (Nyx Parahumans only need a few hours of sleep per week, Aquamorphs can live underwater, etc.) Another type of [[human genetic engineering]], far more controversial, is the creation of [[bioroid]]s, fully sentient slave races.

People can "[[mind transfer|upload]]" by recording the contents of their brains on [[Disk storage|computer disks]]. The individual then becomes a ''ghost'', an [[infomorph]] very easily confused with "[[sapience|sapient]] [[artificial intelligence]]". However, this technology has several problems as the solely available [[mind transfer#Serial sectioning|"brainpeeling"]] technique is fatal to the original [[Organism|biological]] [[lifeform]] being [[simulation|simulated]], has a significant failure rate and the philosophical questions regarding [[personal identity]] remain equivocal. Any infomorph, regardless of its origin, can be plugged into a  "cybershell", or a biological body, or "bioshell". Or, the individual can illegally make multiple "xoxes", or copies of themselves, and scatter them throughout the system, [[exponential growth|exponentially increasing]] the odds that at least one of them will live for centuries more, if not forever.

This is also a time of [[space]] colonization. First, humanity (specifically [[People's Republic of China|China]], followed by the United States and others) colonized Mars in a fashion resembling that outlined in the [[Mars Direct]] project. The [[Moon]], [[Lagrangian point]]s, [[inner planet]]s and [[asteroid]]s soon followed. In the late 21st century even some of [[Saturn]]'s moons have been settled as a base for that planet's [[Helium-3]] scooping operations.

Red=Below Average]]

This is no [[utopia]], however: several problems have arisen from these otherwise beneficial developments. The [[generation gap]] has become a chasm as lifespans increase. No longer do the elite fear death, and no longer can the young hope to replace them. While it seemed that outworld colonies would offer accommodation and work for those young ones, they are being replaced by genetically tailored bioroids and AI-powered cybershells. The concept of ''[[human condition|humanity]]'' is no longer clear in a world where even some animals speak of their rights and the dead haunt both cyberspace and reality (in form of infomorph-controlled bioshells or cybershells).

And the wonders of high science are not universally shared — some countries merely struggle with [[Information Age|informatization]] while others suffer from nanoplagues, defective drugs, implants and software tested on their populace. In some poor countries high-tech [[tyrant]]s oppress their backward people. And in outer space all sort of modern [[crime]] thrives, barely suppressed by military forces.

==Publication history==
After the initial set of ''GURPS'' books which included ''[[GURPS Lite]]'' in them, later publications such as ''Transhuman Space'' by [[David Pulver]] were labelled "Powered by ''GURPS''" without including "''GURPS''" in the book title, primarily to make it easier for fans to find the books at mass-market retailers.&lt;ref name="designers"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers &amp; Dragons|publisher=[[Mongoose Publishing]]|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7|pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Transhuman Space'' was well supported by an extensive game line, and was the first major original background produced by Steve Jackson Games in 15 years.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt; The books inclusion of posthuman characters began to show the limits of the current ''GURPS'' system, which is something that Pulver would address soon thereafter.&lt;ref name="designers"/&gt;

While Steve Jackson Games has not updated the core book (''GURPS Transhuman Space'') to 4th edition it has produced 4th edition supplements for the setting: Transhuman Space: Bioroid Bazaar, Transhuman Space: Martial Arts 2100, Transhuman Space: Personnel Files 2-5, Transhuman Space: Shell-Tech, GURPS Spaceships 8: Transhuman Spacecraft, Transhuman Space: Transhuman Mysteries, Transhuman Space: Changing Times, and Transhuman Space: Wings of the Rising Sun.

'''Vladimir Petrovich Tushinsky '''(born September 14, 1976 in [[RSFSR]] - August 5, 2016 in [[Khabarovsk]], [[Russia]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[serial killer]], rapist and [[pedophile]]. Between September 2010 and February 2014, he killed five girls aged between 11 and 22 in the [[Kamchatka Krai]]. In the media, he received the nickname "Kamchatka [[Chikatilo]]".&lt;ref name="лента1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/12/kamchatka/|title="Камчатский Чикатило" признался в убийстве пяти девушек|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|date=2016-02-12|author=|accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="новая газета"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Хитров В. |editor=  |url= http://www.novayagazeta.ru/society/70052.html |title= Край бездны |type=  |origyear= | agency =  |edition= [[Новая газета]]  |location=  |date=   |year=  |publisher=  |at=  |volume=  |issue=  |number= 105 (25 сентября 2015)|pages = 13 |page=  |series=  |isbn =  |issn =  |doi =  |bibcode =  |arxiv =  |pmid =  |ref=  |archiveurl =  |archivedate =  |language=  |quote=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was detained on February 17, 2014 and charged with murder, as well as raping his underage stepdaughter. On February 19, 2016, the Kamchatka Regional Court sentenced him to [[life imprisonment]], with the [[Supreme Court of Russia]] upholding the verdict without change. On August 5, 2016 while he was being transferred to the colony on [[Ognenny Ostrov]], Tushinsky suddenly died.

== Biography ==
Tushinsky was born on September 14, 1976.&lt;ref name="думов"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kamtime.ru/node/3465|title=Камчатский Чикатило Владимир Тушинский получил пожизненный срок в "Белом лебеде"|author=Иван Думов|date=2016-02-19|work=|publisher=Газета «Камчатское время»|accessdate=2016-08-23|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="newsru-дело"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/crime/08sep2015/kamchikatiltrial.html|title=Передано в суд дело "камчатского Чикатило", убившего 5 девочек и девушек из-за привычки насиловать падчерицу|author=|date=2015-09-08|work=|publisher=[[NEWSru.com]]|accessdate=2016-08-23|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, he was convicted of theft and beatings, and according to some media reports, was nicknamed "Bald" in the colony. After his release, he married, and along with his wife and her daughter from the first marriage, moved to the Pionersky settlement in the [[Yelizovsky District]]; a son was born there soon after. In the autumn of 2009, he got a job as a fuel supply engineer in boiler room No. 3 of JSC Kamchatskenegro in the Mokhovaya micro-district of [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]].

According to the investigators, in 2005, Tushinsky raped his 11-year-old stepdaughter, Julia, and then continued to coerce her into [[cohabitation]] for four years. The girl did not dare for a long time to tell anybody what happened. In 2009, when she turned 16, she moved to the mainland, where her parents lived.

== Murders ==
After the stepdaughter left Tushinsky, investigators believe that because of the inability to satisfy his "pathological sexual desire", a hatred for women arose. The man began to drive around Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and his neighborhood in his [[Toyota 4Runner]] in search of lonely girls resembling his stepdaughter, and then offered to drive them home, choking or killing them with a knife afterwards.&lt;ref name="риа-2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/incidents/20140909/1023367860.html|title=Подозреваемого в убийствах пяти девушек ищут на Камчатке|publisher=[[РИА Новости]]|date=2014-09-09|author=|accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first victim was 22-year-old Ulyana Nikiforova, who worked as a saleswoman in one of the shopping centers of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky; she was killed on September 12, 2010. The offender, who used a knife, inflicted a lot of blows to the face, head and body. The body was found in the tall grass next to the road connecting Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky and [[Yelizovo]].&lt;ref name="аиф2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kamchatka.aif.ru/society/1123185|title=Признания машиниста. На Камчатке пойман серийный убийца|publisher=[[Аргументы и факты]]|date=2014-03-13|author=|accessdate=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next murder Tushinsky committed a month later. In the evening of October 10, 15-year-old Natalya Moiseyeva stood a "BAM" shop, waiting for the bus, where she was seen by the criminal. Shortly before the disappearance, the schoolgirl phoned her parents and said that she could not go home, because there was no bus; after 20 minutes her phone was out of range. The remains of the girl were found two years later by a woman who collected mushrooms in the Mokhovaya micro-district.

On November 18, 2010, the criminal killed 11-year-old Olga Besprozvannaya, a high school student in Yelizovo, and then buried her corpse. Her parents told the police about her disappearance after she did not return to the village of Dvurechye after the end of the school day. For several weeks policemen and volunteers were looking for her, but the could only find her mobile phone, broken into pieces.

On January 9, 2011, Tushinsky killed 16-year-old Christina Orlova. The search operation again did not give any results, because, as in the Besprozvannaya case, the criminal carefully buried the body in a secret place.

The last murder Tushinsky committed on February 16, 2014 in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. He offered to give a ride to 20-year-old Irina Khodos, but she refused. "I just stopped and in a friendly way offered to give her a lift, and she became rude. She took out her phone, and threatened to call the police. I got scared, got in the car, but then I thought that she could blame me", the murderer later told.&lt;ref name="МК статья"&gt;''Седов В.''&amp;#x20;[http://www.mk.ru/daily/hotnews/article/2014/03/05/994190-na-kamchatke-zaderzhan-manyak-na-schetu-kotorogo-ubiystvo-11letney-devochki.html Убийца использовал минуту славы, чтобы стать маньяком]&amp;nbsp;// [//ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D1%86 Московский комсомолец]&amp;nbsp;: газета.&amp;nbsp;— &lt;span class="nowrap"&gt;№ 26471 (6 марта 2014)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; He inflicted more than 20 knife wounds on the girl, after which she died, and left the body at the "Stepnaya" bus stop, where it was later discovered.&lt;ref name="аиф"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kamchatka.aif.ru/incidents/v_petropavlovske_nachalsya_sud_nad_seriynym_ubiycey_vladimirom_tushinskim|title=В Петропавловске начался суд над серийным убийцей Владимиром Тушинским|date=2015-10-07|publisher=[[Аргументы и факты]]|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arrest ===
After the murder of Irina Khodos, the investigators contacted the locals through the media for help, counting on the fact that among them there might have been witnesses of the crime. After a while a man came to the regional department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, passing a stop with his car when, according him, the murder was committed. The DVR camera captured the Toyota 4Runner car parked near the murder site; the registration numbers were not visible, however, the inscription "PICK UP" on the cockpit was in frame. Law enforcement agencies found out that the car belonged to Tushinsky, and on February 17, he was arrested.

In trunk of Tushinsky's car an axe, [[taser]], [[air gun]], as well as female tights and an artificial vagina were found. After examining the car, traces of blood and hair from Khodos were found. Under the pressure of evidence, the killer began to give confessions: he not only confessed to the last murder, but also to his previous crimes, and subsequently pointed out the burial sites of Besprozvannaya and Orlova's bodies. During the search of Tushinsky's apartment, video records were found on his computer, on which he committed violent acts against his minor stepdaughter.

Soon the court gave Tushinsky a measure of restraint in the form of imprisonment, thus satisfying the petition of the investigation. A criminal case was initiated against him on the basis of crimes such as violent acts of a sexual nature, rape and murder of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]].

== Trial ==
In early September 2015, Tushinsky's case along with the indictment was referred to the court for examination. Previously, experts conducted more than 60 examinations, including complex forensic psycho-sexual-psychiatric ones, which revealed that the man showed signs of pedophilia, but was declared sane. At the same time, the investigators failed to find evidence that the murderer's victims had been sexually assaulted. The trial itself began on October 7, 2015 in the Kamchatka Regional Court.

During the judicial investigation, more than 70 volumes of the criminal case were examined. On January 27, 2016, the judicial debate began. The state prosecutor asked the court to appoint a final sentence in the form of life imprisonment to the defendant. Family members of the victims, who also spoke in the debate, supported the position of the prosecution.&lt;ref name="прения-27.01"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pressa41.ru/crime/preniya-po-delu-manyaka-tushinskogo-nachalis-na-kamchatke/|title=Прения по делу маньяка Тушинского начались на Камчатке|author=|date=2016-01-27|work=|publisher=Информационное агентство «Камчатка»|accessdate=2016-08-23|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tushinsky's lawyer asked for a softer punishment towards his client.

After the end of the debate, the court decided to appoint the last word of the defendant on February 9,&lt;ref name="пс1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kam24.ru/news/main/20160208/33613.html|title=9 февраля судья Урбан предоставит маньяку Тушинскому последнее слово|date=2016-02-08|publisher=Информационное агентство «Кам 24»|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on the appointed day Tushinsky was not ready, as a result of which the meeting was postponed and held on February 11 instead.&lt;ref name="пс2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kam24.ru/news/main/20160209/33646.html|title=Тушинскому не хватило времени для подготовки последнего слова|date=2016-02-08|publisher=Информационное агентство «Кам 24»|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last words, he pled guilty to all counts and at the same time drew the court's attention to the contradictions in the victims' testimonies, witnesses, and the inadmissibility of a number of evidence materials in the case.&lt;ref name="пс3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kam24.ru/news/main/20160212/33796.html|title=Тушинский признал вину по всем пунктам обвинения и попросил прощения|date=2016-02-12|publisher=Информационное агентство «Кам 24»|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, Tushinsky asked for forgiveness from the victims' families and said that he would "accept any punishment".

On February 19, 2016, the final hearing for the case took place. Tushinsky was found guilty of all counts and sentenced to life imprisonment, and to serve his sentence in a special regime colony. The court also granted civil claims to relatives of the victims for the amount of 12 million [[rubles]], and also obliged the defendant to pay 500,000 rubles to his stepdaughter.&lt;ref name="newsru приговор"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/crime/19feb2016/kamchikatlolifesnt.html|title="Камчатский Чикатило", убивший 5 девочек и девушек из-за привычки насиловать падчерицу, получил пожизненный срок|date=2016-02-19|publisher=[[NEWSru.com]]|access-date=2016-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="риа1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ria.ru/incidents/20160219/1377068001.html|title=Житель Камчатки осужден за убийства девушек, похожих на его дочь|date=2016-02-19|publisher=[[РИА Новости]]|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was read out by the judge of the Kamchatka Regional Court, Dmitry Urban.

Tushinsky's defense team challenged the verdict. In July 2016, the Board of the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]] inspected  a video depicting the convict and three of the victims, and ultimately upheld the verdict without change.&lt;ref name="regnum вс рф"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://regnum.ru/news/accidents/2160407.html|title="Камчатскому чикатило" не удалось обжаловать пожизненный срок|date=2016-07-25|publisher=[[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]]|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
After the enforcement of the verdict, Tushinsky was sentenced to serve his sentence in the special regime colony on Ognenny Ostrov. From Kamchatka, he was taken to a prison in Khabarovsk, where he was placed in solitary confinement under enhanced surveillance, which, in particular, had round-the-clock surveillance.&lt;ref name="смерть"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kam24.ru/news/main/20160808/40505.html|title=В УФСИН рассказали, как умер "камчатский чикатило" Тушинский|date=2016-08-08|publisher=Информационное агентство «Кам 24»|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 5, 2016, Tushinsky died suddenly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://regnum.ru/news/accidents/2164236.html|title="Камчатский чикатило" умер во время этапирования в "Вологодский пятак"|date=2016-01-27|publisher=[[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]]|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to official information, the cause of death was "sudden [[cardiac arrest]] without signs of violent death": according to the press service of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia in the [[Khabarovsk Oblast]], at 17:50 the junior inspector received information that offender was ill. The medical officer, who examined him in the cell, called an ambulance brigade. At 18:58, the prisoner was taken to the intensive care unit of the Regional Clinical Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 20:05.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25907">A '''war of annihilation''' ({{lang-de|Vernichtungskrieg|links=no}}) is a type of [[warfare]] in which the goal is the complete annihilation of a state, a people or an ethnic minority through [[genocide]] or through the destruction of their livelihood. The goal can be outward-directed or inward, against elements of one's own population. The goal is not like other types of warfare, the recognition of limited political goals, such as recognition of a legal status (such as in a [[war of independence]]), control of disputed territory (as in [[war of aggression]] or [[defensive war]]), or the 
total military defeat ([[debellatio]]) of an enemy state.
 
== Features ==
War of annihilation is defined as a radicalized form of [[warfare]] in which "all psycho-physical limits" are abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sven Lindqvist]]: ''Durch das Herz der Finsternis. Ein Afrika-Reisender auf den Spuren des europäischen Völkermords'', Unionsverlag, Zürich 1999, S. 62; Susanne Kuß, Bernd Martin: ''Das Deutsche Reich und der Boxeraufstand''. Iudicium, München 2002, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hamburg social scientist [[Jan Philipp Reemtsma]] sees a war, "which is led, in the worst case, to destroy or even decimate a population", as the heart of the war of annihilation.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Philipp Reemtsma: ''Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz – Ludendorff – Hitler''. In: [[Hannes Heer]], [[Klaus Naumann (historian)|Klaus Naumann]] (Eds.): ''Vernichtungskrieg. Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941–1944''. Hamburg 1995, pp. 377–401, hier S. 377, vgl. auch 386–398.&lt;/ref&gt;
The state organization of the enemy will be smashed. Another characteristic of a war of annihilation is its ideological character and the rejection of negotiations with the enemy, as the historian Andreas Hillgruber [[Andreas Hillgruber]] has shown in the example of the 1941 [[Operation Barbarossa]] against [[Jewish Bolshevism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Die ideologisch-dogmatische Grundlage der nationalsozialistischen Politik der Ausrottung der Juden in den besetzten Gebieten der Sowjetunion und ihre Durchführung 1941–1944''. In: German Studies Review 2 (1979), Bd. 3, p. 263–296.&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy and trustworthiness of the opponent is negated, demoted to status of a total enemy, with whom there can be no understanding, but rather devotes the totality of one's own ''"Volk, Krieg und Politik [als] Triumph der Idee des Vernichtungskrieges"'' (people, war and politics [to the] triumph of the idea of the war of annihilation).&lt;ref&gt;Jan Philipp Reemtsma: ''Die Idee des Vernichtungskrieges. Clausewitz – Ludendorff – Hitler'', pp. 386–398, Zitat p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
=== War of extermination ===
The term "war of extermination" was used in many American wars with [[Amerindian]]s, most notably California governor [[Peter Burnett]]'s prediction of one during the [[California Genocide]]:

{{cquote|That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.|||—From California governor Peter Hardeman Burnett's Second Annual Message to the Legislature, January 7, 1851:&lt;ref&gt;"The Governor's Message (Transmitted January 7, 1851)," Sacramento Transcript, 10 January 1851, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On January 6, 1851 at his State of the State address to the California Senate, 1st Governor Peter Burnett used the following words: "That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate this result but with painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power or wisdom of man to avert."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, Brenden C (2012). "Murder State: California's Native American Genocide, 1846–1873." University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln and London. p.231&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Herero uprising ===
[[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] political communications had circulated the term ''Vernichtungskrieg'' in order to criticize the action against the insurgents during the [[Herero Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Frank Oliver Sobich: ''„Schwarze Bestien, rote Gefahr“. Rassismus und Antisozialismus im deutschen Kaiserreich''. Campus, Frankfurt am Main 2006, S. 301–305.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1904 the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] began in the German colony [[German South West Africa]]. With a total of about 15,000 men under Lieutenant General [[Lothar von Trotha]], this uprising was prostrated until August 1904. Most of the Herero fled to the almost waterless [[Omaheke]], an offshoot of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. From Trotha had them locked down and the refugees chased away from the few water spots there, so that thousands of Herero along with their families and cattle herds thirst. The hunted in the desert, let Trotha in the so-called ''Vernichtungsbefehl'', "Annihilation Command":

{{quote|''Die Herero sind nicht mehr Deutsche Untertanen. […] Innerhalb der Deutschen Grenze wird jeder Herero mit oder ohne Gewehr, mit oder ohne Vieh erschossen, ich nehme keine Weiber und keine Kinder mehr auf, treibe sie zu ihrem Volke zurück oder lasse auch auf sie schießen.''

The Herero are no longer German subjects. [...] Within the German border, every Herero is shot with or without a rifle, with or without cattle, I take no more wives and no children, I drive them back to their people or let them be shot.|ref=Gewald&lt;ref&gt;Jan-Bart Gewald: ''The Great General of the Kaiser'', in: ''Botswana Notes and Records.'' Band 26, S. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trotha's warfare aimed at the complete annihilation of the Herero ("I believe that the nation must be destroyed as such"&lt;ref&gt;Brief an Generalstabschef [[Alfred Graf von Schlieffen]], 5. Oktober 1904, in: Michael Behnen: ''Quellen zur deutschen Aussenpolitik im Zeitalter des Imperialismus 1890–1911.'' Darmstadt 1977, S. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;) and was supported in particular by Schlieffen and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].&lt;ref name="schaller"&gt;Dominik J. Schaller: ''»Ich glaube, dass die Nation als solche vernichtet werden muss: Kolonialkrieg und Völkermord in «Deutsch-Südwestafrika» 1904–1907«.'' In: ''Journal of Genocide Research.'' 6:3, S. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach is therefore considered to be the first [[genocide]] of the twentieth century. Trotha's action sparked outrage in Germany and abroad; at the instigation of chancellor [[Bernhard von Bülow]], the Emperor lifted the order of annihilation two months after the events in the Omaheke. Trotha's policy remained largely unchanged until its revocation in November 1905.&lt;ref name="schaller" /&gt;

=== Ludendorff's conception ===
The war of annihilation was a further development of the concept of [[Total War]], as 1935 the former imperial [[Generalquartiermeister|General Quartermaster]] [[Erich Ludendorff]] had designed. Thereafter, in a coming war, victory must be given unlimited priority over all other societal concerns: all [[resources]] would have to be harnessed, the will of the nation had to be made available before the outbreak of the hostilities are unified by [[propaganda]] and dictatorship violence, all available weapons would have to be used, and no consideration could be taken of [[International law]]. Even in its objectives, total war is unlimited, as the experience of [[First World War]] teaching:

{{quote|''Ihn führten nicht nur die Wehrmächte der am Kriege beteiligten Staaten, die gegenseitig ihre Vernichtung erstrebten, die Völker selbst wurden in den Dienst der Kriegsführung gestellt, der Krieg richtete sich auch gegen sie selbst und zog sie selbst in tiefste Mitleidenschaft […] Zum Kampf gegen die feindlichen Streitkräfte auf gewaltigen Fronten und weiten Meeren gesellte sich das Ringen gegen die Psyche und Lebenskraft der feindlichen Völker zu dem Zweck, sie zu zersetzen und zu lähmen.''

They not only led the armed forces of the states involved in the war, who aspired to annihilate each other; the peoples themselves were put in the service of warfare; the war was also directed against them and pulled them into deepest passion [...] Fighting against the enemy forces on huge fronts and wide seas, the struggle against the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and [[Vitality|life force]] of the hostile peoples was joined with the purpose of depressing and paralyzing them.
|ref=Ludendorff 1935&lt;ref&gt;Erich Ludendorff: ''Der totale Krieg''. Ludendorffs Verlag, München 1935, S. 4&amp;nbsp;f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In this conceptual delimitation of the war, Ludendorff was able to draw from the German military-theoretical discourse, which had formed in the confrontation with the [[People's War]], the "Guerre à outrance", which the newly created [[Third French Republic]] in the fall and winter of 1870 against the Prussian-German invaders of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="Fowley2001"&gt;Robert T. Foley: ''From Volkskrieg to Vernichtungskrieg. German Concepts of Warfare, 1871–1935.'' In: Anja Hartmann, Beatrice Heuser (Hrsg.): ''War, Peace, and World Orders in European History''. Routledge, London/New York 2001, S. 215–220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff also dealt with [[Carl von Clausewitz]] and his 1832 posthumously published work ''[[On War]]'', in which he distinguished between 'absolute' and 'limited' wars. But even for Clausewitz absolute war was subject to restrictions, such as the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, between military and civil or between public and private. Ludendorff claimed now that in total war it is no longer a "petty political purpose", not even "big [...] national interests", but the sheer ''Lebenserhaltung'' (life-support) of the nation, its identity. This existential threat also justifies the annihilation of the enemy, at least moral, if not physical. &lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Janssen: "War". In: [[Reinhart Koselleck]], [[Werner Conze]], [[Otto Brunner (historian) | Otto Brunner]] (eds.): ''Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe: Historisches Lexikon zur politisch-sozialen Sprache in Deutschland''. Historical lexicon on the political-social language in Germany. Vol. 3, Klett-Cotta, Stuttgart 1982, pp. 613.&lt;/ref&gt; Ludendorffs efforts to radicalize the war (for which he was responsible from 1916) met with social, political and military barriers. In the year 1935, his advice was then, as the historian Robert Foley writes, "on fertile ground"; the time seemed ripe for an even more radical delimitation of the war by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]].&lt;ref name="Fowley2001" /&gt;

=== Nazi warfare ===
{{further |Bandenbekämpfung}} 
The best known example of a ''Vernichtungskrieg'' is the [[German-Soviet War]], which began on June 22, 1941 with the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. The Berlin historian [[Ernst Nolte]] called this 1963 in a much-quoted formulation as the "most egregious ''Versklavungs- und Vernichtungskrieg'' [war of enslavement and annihilation] known to modern history" and distinguished it from a "normal war", as the Nazi regime conducted against France.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nolte: ''Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche. Action francaise – Italienischer Faschismus – Nationalsozialismus''. Taschenbuchausgabe, Piper, München 1984, S. 451.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1965 [[habilitation thesis]] ''Hitlers Strategie'' [[Andreas Hillgruber]] worked out the motifs of the Nazi state based on racial ideological basis for the war against the Soviet Union:
#The physical extinction of the "[[Jewish Bolshevism | Judeo-Bolshevik]]" elite of the country and the Jews themselves as their supposed biological root
#The conquest of colonial and ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for the German Reich and
#The subjugation and decimation of the Slavic population.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Hitlers Strategie. Politik und Kriegführung 1940–1941.'' Frankfurt a.&amp;nbsp;M., 2. Auflage 1982, S.&amp;nbsp;519 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Hillgruber explicitly described the character of the Eastern Front as "intended racial-ideological war of annihilation".&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Hillgruber: ''Der Ostkrieg und die Judenvernichtung'', in: Gerd R. Ueberschär u. Wolfram Wette (Hrsg.): ''Der deutsche Überfall auf die Sowjetunion. „Unternehmen Barbarossa“ 1941.'' Fischer Taschenbuch, Frankfurt a.&amp;nbsp;M. 1991, S. 185–206, Zitat S. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Barbarossa has also found its way into the historical-political teaching of general education schools as a historical example of an extermination war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wigbert Benz]]: ''„Unternehmen Barbarossa“ 1941. Vernichtungskrieg und historisch-politische Bildung''. In: Informationen für den Geschichts- und Gemeinschaftskundeunterricht. Heft 60/2010, S. 5–33; [http://87.106.4.207/service/unter/benz_2.htm siehe auch Online-Version].&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the war of annihilation was intensely discussed in the 1990s with reference to the ''[[Wehrmachtsausstellung]]'' of the [[Hamburg Institute for Social Research]], which carried the word "''Vernichtungskrieg''" in the title.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hannes Heer]] u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Verbrechen der Wehrmacht. Dimensionen des Vernichtungskrieges 1941–1944''. Ausstellungskatalog. Hamburger Institut für Sozialforschung. 1. Auflage, [[Hamburger Edition]], Hamburg 1996. Johannes Klotz: ''Die Ausstellung „Vernichtungskrieg, Verbrechen der Wehrmacht 1941 bis 1944“. Zwischen Geschichtswissenschaft und Geschichtspolitik.'' In: Detlef Bald, Johannes Klotz, Wolfram Wette: ''Mythos Wehrmacht. Nachkriegsdebatten und Traditionspflege''. Aufbau, Berlin 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; That Operation Barbarossa would be a war of annihilation, Adolf Hitler had pronounced openly on March 30, 1941 before the generals of the Wehrmacht:

{{quote|''Kampf zweier [[Weltanschauung]]en gegeneinander. Vernichtendes Urteil über Bolschewismus, ist gleich asoziales Verbrechertum. [[Kommunismus]] ungeheure Gefahr für die Zukunft. Wir müssen von dem Standpunkt des soldatischen Kameradentums abrücken. Der Kommunist ist vorher kein Kamerad und nachher kein Kamerad. Es handelt sich um einen Vernichtungskampf. Wenn wir es nicht so auffassen, dann werden wir zwar den Feind schlagen, aber in 30 Jahren wird uns wieder der kommunistische Feind gegenüberstehen. Wir führen nicht Krieg, um den Feind zu konservieren. […] Kampf gegen Rußland: Vernichtung der bolschewistischen Kommissare und der kommunistischen Intelligenz. […] Der Kampf wird sich sehr unterscheiden vom Kampf im Westen. Im Osten ist Härte mild für die Zukunft. Die Führer müssen von sich das Opfer verlangen, ihre Bedenken zu überwinden.'

Fight two [[worldview]]s against each other. Devastating verdict on [[Bolshevism]] is equal to antisocial criminality. [[Communism]] immense danger for the future. We have to move away from the position comradeship between soldiers. The communist is not a comrade before and not a comrade afterwards. It is a battle of annihilation. If we do not take it that way, we will beat the enemy, but in 30 years the Communist enemy will be facing us again. We are not waging war to preserve the enemy. [...] Fight against Russia: destruction of Bolshevik commissioners and Communist intelligence. [...] The fight will be very different from the fight in the West. In the east, hardness is mild for the future. The leaders must ask the victim to overcome their concerns.|ref=Halder 1963&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Halder]]: ''Kriegstagebuch. Tägliche Aufzeichnungen des Chefs des Generalstabes des Heeres 1939–1942, Bd. 2: Von der geplanten Landung in England bis zum Beginn des Ostfeldzuges''. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 1963, S. 335 ff.; [[Christian Hartmann (Historiker)|Christian Hartmann]]: ''Halder. Generalstabschef Hitlers 1938–1942''. Schoeningh, Paderborn 1991, S. 241 f.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The orientation of Operation Barbarossa as a prior planned war of annihilation proves the commands prepared according to the general guidelines cited by Hitler on 30 March 1941 before the start of the campaign, such as the [[Barbarossa Decree]] of 13 May 1941, the Guidelines for the conduct of the troops in Russia of 19 May 1941 and the [[Commissar Order]] of 6 June 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rolf-Dieter Müller]], [[Gerd R. Ueberschär]]: ''Hitlers Krieg im Osten 1941–1945. Ein Forschungsbericht.'' Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2000, S. 226 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German guidelines for agricultural policy in the Soviet territories to be conquered are one of the most extreme examples of a robbery and annihilation strategy. In a meeting of the secretaries of State on May 2, 1941, the [[Hunger Plan]] prepared:

{{quote|''Hierbei werden zweifellos zig Millionen Menschen verhungern, wenn von uns das für uns Notwendige aus dem Lande herausgeholt wird.''

This will undoubtedly starve tens of millions of people if we get what we need pried out of the country.|ref=Müller and Ueberschär 2000&lt;ref&gt;''Aktennotiz über Ergebnis der heutigen Besprechung mit Staatssekretären über Barbarossa vom 2.5.1941.''

Ueberschär: ''Hitlers Krieg im Osten 1941–1945. Ein Forschungsbericht.'' Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2000, S. 310–338.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The German historian Jochen Böhler regarded the [[Invasion of Poland]] as "prelude to the ''Vernichtungskrieg''" against the Soviet Union 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Jochen Böhler: ''Die Zerstörung der Nachbarschaft. Die Anfänge des Vernichtungskrieges gegen Polen 1939''. In: Mike Schmeitzner, Katarzyna Stokłosa (Hrsg.): ''Partner oder Kontrahenten? Deutsch-polnische Nachbarschaft im Jahrhundert der Diktaturen''.

Auflage, Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other examples ==
In journalism and research, many other conflicts are also known as ''Vernichtungskrieg''.

In 1876, the German writer and historian [[Felix Dahn]] used the term for the first time in the modern sense: in his novel ''A struggle for Rome'' he let the Byzantine warlord [[Narses]] aim his campaign against [[Goths]] to Ethnic group in Italy completely utterly, i.e. lead a "war of annihilation against their entire folklore". &lt;ref&gt;Felix Dahn: ''Ein Kampf um Rom'' , in: ''Gesammelte Werke'' (Collected Works), First Series, vol. 2, Leipzig O. J., pp. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also for the [[Third Punic War]] 149 – 146 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Werner Huss: ''Die Geschichte der Karthager'' (The History of Carthaginians), C.H. Beck, München 1985, S. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]]&lt;ref&gt;Christian Pantle: ''Vernichtungskrieg in Germanien'', in: ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', 3.

Nymphenburger, München 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Find evidence that they call war of annihilation.

The ethnologist [[Otto Stoll]] wrote 1888 of a war of annihilation of the Spanish [[Conquistador | Conquistadores]] against the indigenous population.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Stoll: ''Die Maya-Sprachen der Pokom-Gruppe. Erster Theil: Die Sprache der Pokonchí-Indianer'' (The Mayan languages of the Pokom group. Part One: the language of the Pokonchí Indians).

The former employee of the German [[Military History Research Office (Germany)]] [[Joachim Hoffmann]] described in his book ' ' Stalin's Annihilation War ' ' (1995) the Soviet warfare against Nazi Germany as "War of Annihilation". He cites as the motto a speech [[Josef Stalin]] s of 6 November 1941, in which this stated:

{{quote|Well, if the Germans want a ''Vernichtungskrieg'', they will get it (stormy, prolonged applause). From now on, it will be our task to be the task of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, the task of the fighters, the commanders and the [[Political commissar|political officials of our army and our fleet]], to destroy all invading Germans occupying the territory of our homeland to the last man. No mercy to the German occupiers!{{efn|''Nun wohl, wenn die Deutschen einen Vernichtungskrieg wollen, so werden sie ihn bekommen (stürmischer, lang anhaltender Beifall). Von nun an wird es unsere Aufgabe, die Aufgabe aller Völker der Sowjetunion, die Aufgabe der Kämpfer, der Kommandeure und der politischen Funktionäre unserer Armee und unserer Flotte sein, alle Deutschen, die in das Gebiet unserer Heimat als Okkupanten eingedrungen sind, bis auf den letzten Mann zu vernichten. Keine Gnade den deutschen Okkupanten!''&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Hoffmann: ''Stalins Vernichtungskrieg 1941–1945''. Verlag für Wehrwissenschaft, München 1995, S. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Other academics do not follow Hoffmann's interpretation of the speech, but refer to Stalin's further statements in the following months that an annihilation of Germany is by no means his goal of war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Ulrich]]: ''Stalingrad'', C.H. Beck, München 2005, S. 33&amp;nbsp;f.; Jochen Laufer: ''Pax Sovietica. Stalin, die Westmächte und die deutsche Frage 1941–1945'', Böhlau, Köln/Weimar 2009, S. 205 ff. Vgl. auch Stalins viel zitiertes Diktum aus dem Jahr 1945: „Die Hitler kommen und gehen, aber das deutsche Volk, der deutsche Staat hat Bestand“. [[Wolfgang Leonhard]]: ''Die Revolution entläßt ihre Kinder'', S. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Hoffmann's work as a whole was highly critically reviewed by a majority.&lt;ref&gt;For example ''[[Die Zeit]]'' Nr. 46, 1995 ([http://www.zeit.de/1995/46/Stalins_Vernichtungskrieg_ online], abgerufen am 5. August 2010), [[die tageszeitung]], 27.

There is talk of an "unbridled War of Annihilation" ([[Norbert Blüm]]),&lt;ref&gt;Cited from [https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article382556/Nahost-Konflikt-entfacht-in-Deutschland-heftige-Diskussion.html ''Nahost-Konflikt entfacht in Deutschland heftige Diskussion''], in: [[Die Welt]] vom 5. April 2002; [[Alan Posener]]: ''Wo die Freundschaft aufhört. „Nazi-Methoden“, „hemmungsloser Vernichtungskrieg“, „zionistische Lobby“. Wie viel Kritik verträgt das Verhältnis zwischen Deutschland und Israel?'', in: Die Welt, 15. Mai 2002, S. 8. Vgl. dazu [[Wolfgang Benz]]: ''Was ist Antisemitismus?'', C.H. Beck, München 2004, {{ISBN|3-406-52212-2}}, [https://books.google.de/books?id=FaGpj0ORpwAC&amp;pg=PA24 S. 24].&lt;/ref&gt; or its English counterpart, "War of Extermination", when Israel's approach is described in [[Middle East conflict]] from various sides.&lt;ref&gt;See for example "Deutsche Soldaten in Israel nicht denkbar", in: [[taz.de]], 26. Juli 2006 (Interview mit [[Norman Paech]], [http://www.taz.de/?id=archivseite&amp;dig=2006/07/26/a0134 online], abgerufen am 5. August 2010). "Der Vorwurf des Antisemitismus wird auch als Knüppel benutzt", in: ''[[Stern (Zeitschrift)|Stern]]'', 18. Juni 2002 (Interview mit [[Norbert Blüm]]); Ahdaf Soueif: ''The Palestinians say: ‘This is a war of extermination’'', in: ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17. Januar 2009 ([https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jan/17/gaza-israel-palestine online], abgerufen am 5. August 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The "Nazi comparison" implied in this wording is an indication of [[secondary antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Rensmann]]: ''Demokratie und Judenbild. Antisemitismus in der politischen Kultur der Bundesrepublik Deutschland'', VS Verlag, Wiesbaden 2004, S. 215; Norbert Reck: ''Christliche Schuldgeschichte und Judenfeindschaft.

In a publication of the Human Rights Centre of the [[University of Potsdam]] from the year 1998, the action of [[Guatemala | Guatemalan]] military in [[Guatemalan Civil War | Civil War]] is called the "relentless war of annihilation against one's own people."&lt;ref&gt;Menschenrechtszentrums der Universität Potsdam: [https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/4856/file/SGM02.pdf publishup.uni-potsdam.de ''„Menschenrechte für alle“. 50 Jahre Allgemeine  Erklärung  der Menschenrechte''].
