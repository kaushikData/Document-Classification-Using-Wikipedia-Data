'''AdvisorShares Investments''' is a US-based [[investment management]] firm based in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] which offers actively managed [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs) through the AdvisorShares Trust.  The firm launched its first active ETF fund in 2009.

The firm has been part owned by [[Fund.com]] since 2008.

==History==
The firm launched its first active ETF fund in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ETF Daily News.|title= AdvisorShares Investments, Initiates Public Offering Launching its Unique Exchange Traded Fund Platform for Investment Advisors and Lists on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE Ticker: DENT).|url=http://etfdailynews.com/2009/09/10/advisorShares-investments-initiates-public-offering-launching-its-unique-exchange-traded-fund-platform-for-investment-advisors-and-lists-on-the-new-york-stock-exchange-nyse-ticker-dent/}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2014 it had 24 active ETFs and $1.83 billion under management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeff Benjamin|title=Are active ETFs finally growing in popularity?|publisher=Investment News|url=http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20140420/FREE/304209997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By August 2018 it had 17 ETFs with an average expense ratio of 1.12% and only $817.6 million in assets under management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AdvisorShares ETF Overview |url=https://www.etf.com/channels/advisorshares-etfs |website=ETF.com |publisher=ETF.com |accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; AdvisorShares is a subsidiary of [[Fund.com]], which has a 60% ownership interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Richard|title=Fund.com Subsidiary, AdvisorShares, Partners with BNY Mellon and WCM Investment Management to Launch WCM/BNY Mellon Focused Growth ADR ETF|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fundcom-subsidiary-advisorShares-partners-with-bny-mellon-and-wcm-investment-management-to-launch-wcmbny-mellon-focused-growth-adr-etf-79322667.html|publisher=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AdvisorShares partners with third party [[financial adviser]]s who already manage clients’ assets to package their investment strategy using exchange-traded funds.  As part of promoting its funds it also provides educational support to help financial advisors and investors understand actively managed ETFs and their underlying investment strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher= Financial Advisor Magazine|title= AdvisorShares Launches Four Gold ETFs|url= http://www.fa-mag.com/news/advisorShares--golden-moment-16941.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Nasdaq|title=AdvisorShares|url= http://www.nasdaq.com/author/advisorShares}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 Esposito Securities LLC sued AdvisorShares, claiming that the parties signed a mutual nondisclosure agreement and that subsequently Dan Ahrens, an officer of AdvisorShares, began sharing confidential information with Esposito's clients and told them not to do business with Esposito.&lt;ref name=CNS&gt;{{cite web|title=Nasty Doings Alleged in Investment Business|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/10/25/51647.htm|publisher=Courthouse News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funds==

===The DENT Tactical ETF ===
The Dent Tactical ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 15, 2009 under the {{nyse|DENT}}. The first product of AdvisorShares Investments, LLC, DENT was actively managed by HS Dent Investment Management, LLC, an independent economic research and forecasting company and publisher of The Dent Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AdvisorShares Investments, LLC Brings a Tailored ETF Investment Vehicle to the Marketplace|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS188713+17-Sep-2009+PRN20090917 | work=Reuters | date=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HS Dent Investment Management was managed by financial author, [[Harry Dent|Harry S. Dent Jr.]]   Previously, HS Dent had raised and managed a $2.0 billion mutual fund, AIM Dent Demographic Trends, which was merged into another fund after it lost 80% of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roth|first=Allan|title=Second Dent investment fund to disappear|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/second-dent-investment-fund-to-disappear/|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Morningstar, Inc.]], DENT had highest expense ratio among ETFs, 1.5% of assets, as of July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burton|first=Jonathan|title=His Forecasts of Booms and Busts Sell Lots of Books. But an ETF? Maybe Not.|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304447804576414071029583008|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
DENT closed in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Dent Tactical ETF Gets The Ax|url=http://news.investors.com/investing-etfs/080612-621147-harry-dent-tactical-etf-folds.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its last day of trading was August 8, 2012 and remaining investments were returned to shareholders on August 15, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AdvisorShares Announces the Closing of the Dent Tactical ETF (DENT)|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/25/idUS252439+25-Jul-2012+PRN20120725 | work=Reuters | date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF (NYSE symbol: GRV)===
The Mars Hill Global Relative Value ETF commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange on July 9, 2010 under the NYSE Ticker: GRV and was managed by Mars Hill Partners, LLC.  GRV was the industry's first actively managed [[Long/short equity|long/short ETF]].&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Cinthia|title=AdvisorShares’ GRV To Get A Makeover|url=http://www.indexuniverse.com/sections/news/10250-advisorShares-grv-to-get-a-makeover.html|publisher=IndexUniverse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While GRV managed to raise $38 million a month after it launched, investors fled until the fund had only $3.2 million left.  On December 1, 2011, Accuvest Global Advisors took over management of the fund and changed the name and ticker to  AdvisorShares Accuvest Global Long Short ETF (AGLS).&lt;ref name=Murphy/&gt;

===The Global Echo ETF (NYSE Symbol: GIVE) and partnership with Philippe Cousteau Jr. ===
In May 2012, AdvisorShares launched the AdvisorShares Global Echo ETF on the New York Stock Exchange {{nyse|GIVE}} focused on sustainable investing; the fund also said it would donate a portion of the fund expense fees to Global Echo Foundation, a nonprofit co-founded by [[Philippe Cousteau, Jr.]] focused on social issues impacting women and children to environmental conservation, as well as supporting social entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Michael|title=AdvisorShares Launches Global Echo ETF (GIVE)|url=http://etfdb.com/2012/advisorShares-launches-global-echo-etf-give/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fund's [[expense ratio]] is 1.7%, including 0.4% that is donated to the Global Echo Foundation. One potential concern investors may have about investing in GIVE is that they don't get a tax write-off for the portion of the management fee that is donated to the charitable foundation, whereas an individual donating the proceeds of a profitable investment to an eligible charity would be able to get a substantial tax write-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ferri |first=Rick |title=This ETF is Bound to be Underwater |url=http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/this-etf-is-bound-to-be-underwater/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224351/http://www.rickferri.com/blog/investments/this-etf-is-bound-to-be-underwater/ |archivedate=2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In reaction to that, AdvisorShares lowered the management fee on GIVE to 0.80% and capped its net expense ratio at 0.99% in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=Johanna|title=AdvisorShares Cuts Management Fee For Global Echo ETF|url=http://www.barrons.com/articles/advisorshares-cuts-management-fee-for-global-echo-etf-1485286819|website=barrons.com|publisher=Barron's|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIVE finally closed on May 17, 2017. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Heather|title=ETF Closures|url=http://www.etf.com/etf-watch-tables/etf-closures|website=ETF.com|publisher=etf.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established in 1970, the first women were inducted the following year.  The museum is located in Bean Hall on the campus of [[Judson College (Alabama)|Judson College]] in [[Marion, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awhf.org/ |title=Alabama Women's Hall of Fame |work=Alabama Women's Hall of Fame |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became a state agency in 1975 by an act of the [[Alabama Legislature]]. The organization is governed by an eleven-member board.  They are elected to three-year terms with a minimum of one board member from the fields of art, business, community service, education, law, medicine, politics, religion, and science.  In addition to the board, the President of Judson College and [[List of Governors of Alabama|Governor of Alabama]] both serve as voting members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-2981 |title=Alabama Women's Hall of Fame |work=The Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |accessdate=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{lowercase|title=alt.sex.stories}}
'''alt.sex.stories''' is a [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] for [[erotic stories]] created on May 7, 1992 by Tim Pierce as an alternative to pre-existing [[alt.* hierarchy|alt]] erotica newsgroups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup|title=Google Groups|newsgroup= alt.sex.stories|date=1992-05-07|author=twpierce@amhux1.amherst.edu (Tim Pierce)|message-id=1992May7.181432.5078@amhux2.amherst.edu|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!original/alt.sex.stories/PbITMmUfHsY/oLS7l1ErUdEJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Source seems unreliable and original (WP:SOURCE)|date=November 2014}} The group was initially unmoderated, a feature that was not shared by some of the other Usenet or altnet newsgroups. This feature allowed for greater user freedom.

==Site history==
===alt.sex.stories.moderated===
In early 1997 a moderated version of alt.sex.stories was created due to an increasing number of posts by “various pay services, scam artists, and bots”. This moderated newsgroup (ASSM) has always operated by cross-posting all approved stories to alt.sex.stories, and is not simply a filtered version of the unmoderated group, rather, all stories posted to ASSM were specifically submitted there.

Currently the day-to-day operations and general direction of ASSM is overseen by the Alt.Sex.Stories Text Repository (ASSTR), which coordinates a group of volunteers to moderate the newsgroup using a web-based voting system. ASSTR also hosts an archive of the newsgroup, and a mirror of the [[Nifty Erotic Stories Archive]] (gay). ASSM is one of the few remaining active groups in the alt.sex.* hierarchy.

Due to competition from web-based erotica sites and communities, the volume of stories posted to ASSM (and thus to alt.sex.stories) had dropped considerably by 2006, although the group is still actively moderated.

===Notable authors===
Alt.sex.stories is notable for assisting in the launch of several notable authors of erotica such as [[Elf Sternberg]]{{cn|date=October 2011}} and [[Mary Anne Mohanraj]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/ASIAN-POP-Sexing-Sri-Lanka-How-a-Tamil-2648701.php|title=ASIAN POP Sexing Sri Lanka / How a Tamil immigrant girl grew up to become an erotica queen and new voice in South Asian literature|last=Roy|first=Sandip|date=11 August 2005|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|accessdate=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mamohanraj.com/Interviews/intersmut.html |title=Intersmut Magazine Interview with M.A. Mohanraj |publisher=Mamohanraj.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928065857/http://www.mamohanraj.com/Interviews/intersmut.html |archive-date=2013-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story codes===
Because of the large volume of stories posted, a set of codes to describe the story content was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FAQ about Abbreviated Story Codes in A.S.S. Authors' Version |url=http://www.asstr.org/~Uther_Pendragon/code/scfa.htm |website=www.asstr.org |date=June 2005 |accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers were encouraged to include these story codes in the title of their stories.

'''''Angry Inuk''''' is a 2016 [[Canada|Canadian]] feature-length documentary film written and directed by [[Alethea Arnaquq-Baril]] that defends the [[Inuit]] [[Seal hunting|seal hunt]], as the hunt is a vital means for Inuit peoples to sustain themselves. Subjects in ''Angry Inuk'' include Arnaquq-Baril herself as well as [[Aaju Peter]], an Inuit seal hunt advocate, lawyer and seal fur clothing designer who depends on the sealskins for her livelihood. Partially shot in the filmmaker's home community of Iqaluit, as well as Kimmirut and Pangnirtung, where seal hunting is essential for survival, the film follows Peter and other Inuit to Europe in an effort to have the [[EU Ban on Seal Products]] overturned. The film also criticizes NGOs such as [[Greenpeace]] and the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] for ignoring the needs of vulnerable northern communities who depend on hunt for their livelihoods by drawing a false distinction between subsistence-driven Inuit hunters and profit-driven commercial hunters.&lt;ref name=Mullen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mullen|first1=Patrick|title=Review: 'Angry Inuk'|accessdate=9 September 2016|url=http://povmagazine.com/articles/view/review-angry-inuk|work=Point of View|publisher=[[Documentary Organization of Canada]]|date=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nowtoronto.com/movies/hot-docs-2016/angry-inuk/|title=Angry Inuk|last=Cole|first=Susan G.|authorlink=Susan G.

==Development==
''Angry Inuk'' was co-produced by Arnaquq-Baril and the [[National Film Board of Canada]] (NFB) in association with [[EyeSteelFilm]].&lt;ref name="Winton"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Winton|first1=Ezra|title=CURATING THE NORTH: DOCUMENTARY SCREENING ETHICS AND INUIT REPRESENTATION IN (FESTIVAL) CINEMA (Interview)|url=http://artthreat.net/2015/12/alethea-arnaquq-baril/|accessdate=9 September 2016|work=Art Threat|date=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Arnaquq-Baril has stated that the anti-sealing movement has forced Inuit to turn to the mining and the natural gas industry to support themselves, with dire consequences for the Arctic environment, supporters of the EU ban on seal products have countered that such a ban does not block Inuit from seal hunting to sustain themselves and supply market demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/thecurrent/the-current-for-may-4-2016-1.3565645/angry-inuk-argues-anti-seal-hunt-campaign-hurts-canadian-inuit-life-1.3565719|title='Angry Inuk' argues anti-seal hunt campaign hurts Canadian Inuit life|last=Tremonti|first=Anna Maria|authorlink=Anna Maria Tremonti|date=4 May 2016|work=[[The Current (radio program)|The Current]]|publisher=[[CBC Radio]]|access-date=9 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however is not possible when bans are in place. Without the commercial hunt, hunters can't afford to hunt to sustain themselves.

The '''Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society''' is a research center at [[Harvard University]] that focuses on the study of [[cyberspace]]. Founded at [[Harvard Law School]], the center traditionally focused on internet-related legal issues. On May 15, 2008, the Center was elevated to an interfaculty initiative of Harvard University as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradt |first=Steve |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/05.15/99-berkman.html |title=Harvard Gazette announcement of Berkman Center elevation to Harvard interfaculty initiative |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022192227/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2008/05.15/99-berkman.html |archive-date=2008-10-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after the Berkman family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/node/883|title=Berkman Gift of $5.4 Million to Support Professorship for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies and Center for Internet &amp; Society|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2016, the Center added "Klein" to its name following a gift of $15 million from Michael R. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://today.law.harvard.edu/berkman-klein-center/|title=Michael R. Klein LL.M.

== History and mission ==
[[File:Berkman Center.jpg|thumb|The location at 23 Everett Street]]

The center was founded in 1996 as the "Center on Law and Technology" by professors [[Jonathan Zittrain]] and [[Charles Nesson]]. This built on previous work including a 1994 seminar they held on legal issues involving the early Internet. Professor Arthur Miller and students David Marglin and Tom Smuts also worked on that seminar and related discussions. In 1997, the Berkman family underwrote the center, and [[Lawrence Lessig]] joined as the first Berkman professor. In 1998, the center changed its name to the "Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/about/faq|website=Berkman Klein Center FAQ |title= Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Berkman Klein Center|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/berkmanat10/Timeline|website=Berkman Klein Center Timeline |title=Timeline |publisher=Berkman Klein Center|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swartz /&gt; Since then, it has grown from a small project within [[Harvard Law School]] to a major interdisciplinary center at Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/reviews/digitalresources/859154-315/harvardaposs_berkman_center_launches_publius.html.csp |title=Harvard's Berkman Center Launches Publius Project |publisher=Schoollibraryjournal.com |date=May 19, 2008 |accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berkman Klein Center seeks to understand how the development of Internet-related technologies is inspired by the social context in which they are embedded and how the use of those technologies affects society in turn. It seeks to use the lessons drawn from this research to inform the design of Internet-related law and pioneer the development of the Internet itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/about |title=About Berkman Center |date=November 3, 2008 |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berkman Klein Center sponsors Internet-related events and conferences, and hosts numerous visiting lecturers and research fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fellows |title=Berkman Center People: Fellows |publisher=Cyber.law.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906015228/http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/fellows |archive-date=2011-09-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the center teach, write books, scientific articles, [[weblog]]s with [[RSS (file format)|RSS 2.0]] feeds (for which the Center holds the specification&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rssboard.org/advisory-board-notes |title=Advisory Board Notes |date=July 18, 2003 |publisher=[[RSS Advisory Board]] |accessdate=September 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[podcast]]s (of which the first series took place at the Berkman Klein Center). Its newsletter, ''The Buzz'', is on the Web and available by e-mail, and it hosts a blog community of Harvard faculty, students, and Berkman Klein Center affiliates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QY_2CG9_bqEC |title=Az internet természete - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkman Klein Center faculty and staff have also conducted major public policy reviews of pressing issues. In 2008, [[John Palfrey]] led a review of child safety online called the Internet Safety Technical Task Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/02/harvard-myspace-spearhead-internet-safety-task-force.ars|title=Harvard, MySpace spearhead Internet safety task force|work=Ars Technica|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Yochai Benkler]] led a review of United States broadband policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/21/opinion/21Benkler.html |title=Ending the Internet's Trench Warfare|author= Yochai Benkler|journal= New York Times Op-Ed|date= March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Urs Gasser, along with Palfrey and others, led a review of Internet governance body [[ICANN]], focusing on transparency, accountability, and public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icann.org/en/announcements/announcement-10aug10-en.htm|title=Accountability and Transparency Review Team – Selection of Independent Expert and Update on ATRT Review|work=icann.org|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and initiatives==
The Berkman Klein Center's main research topics are Teens and Media, [[Computer and network surveillance|Monitoring]], [[Privacy]], [[Digital art]], [[Internet Governance]], [[Cloud Computing]] and [[Internet censorship]]. The Berkman Klein Center supports events, presentations, and conferences about the Internet and invites scientists to share their ideas.

=== Digital Media Law Project ===
The Digital Media Law Project (DMLP) was a project hosted by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard Law School. It had previously been known as the Citizen Media Law Project. The purposes of the DMLP were: 
#To provide resources and other assistance, including [[legal advice|legal assistance]]&lt;ref name=auernheimer&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/document/brief-amicus-curiae-digital-media-law-project-support-defendant-appellant|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF.org]]|last1=Walsh|first1=Kit|last2=Hermes|first2=Jeffrey P.|last3=Sellars|first3=Andrew F.|date=2013-07-08|title=Brief of ''Amicus Curiae'' Digital Media Law Project in Support of Defendant-Appellant [Andrew Auernheimer]|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2009|lc=y}},&lt;ref name=benton/&gt; to individuals and groups involved in online and citizen media.
#To "ensur[e] that online journalists, media organizations, and their sources are allowed to examine and debate network security and data protection vulnerabilities without criminal punishment, in order to inform citizens and lawmakers about networked computer security."&lt;ref name=auernheimer/&gt;
#To facilitate the participation of citizens in online media.

In 2014, Berkman Klein Center announced that it would "spin off its most effective initiatives and cease operation as a stand-alone project within the Berkman Klein Center."&lt;ref name=benton&gt;{{cite web|title=The Digital Media Law Project is shutting down, but its most important projects will find new homes|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/06/the-digital-media-law-project-is-shutting-down-but-its-most-important-projects-will-find-new-homes/|last=Benton|first=Joshua|date=2014-06-25|publisher=NiemanLab.org|accessdate=2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet and Democracy Project ===
The Berkman Klein Center operated the now-completed Internet and Democracy Project, which describes itself as an:
{{quote|initiative that will examine how the Internet influences democratic norms and modes, including its impact on civil society, citizen media, government transparency, and the rule of law, with a focus on the Middle East. Through a grant of $1.5 million from the US Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative, the Berkman Center will undertake the study over the next two years in collaboration with its extended community and institutional partners.  As with all its projects, the Berkman Center retains complete independence in its research and other efforts under this grant.

The goal of this work is to support the rights of citizens to access, develop and share independent sources of information, to advocate responsibly, to strengthen online networks, and to debate ideas freely with both civil society and government. These subjects will be examined through a series of case studies in which new technologies and online resources have influenced democracy and civic engagement.  The project will include original research and the identification and development of innovative web-based tools that support the goals of the project.  The team, led by Project Director Bruce Etling, will draw on communities from around the world, with a focus on the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/internetdemocracy|title=Internet and Democracy - Berkman Center|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=29 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== StopBadware ===
In 2006, the Center established the non-profit organization StopBadware, aiming to stop viruses, spyware, and other threats to the open Internet, in partnership with the [[Oxford Internet Institute]], [[Google]], [[Lenovo]] and [[Sun Microsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mohammed|first1=Arshad|title=Internet Coalition Sets Up Anti-'Badware' Site|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/24/AR2006012401621.html|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=The Washington Post|date=25 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, StopBadware became an independent entity supported by [[Google]], [[PayPal]], and [[Mozilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Mary Helen|title=StopBadware Spins Off From Harvard U. to Be a Stand-Alone Nonprofit Group|url=https://www.chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/stopbadware-spins-off-from-harvard-u-to-be-a-stand-alone-nonprofit-group/20915|accessdate=3 February 2018|publisher=The Chronicle of HIgher Education|date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''BioBlitz''', also written without capitals as '''bioblitz''', is an intense period of biological surveying in an attempt to record all the living [[species]] within a designated area. Groups of scientists, naturalists and volunteers conduct an intensive [[field study]] over a continuous time period (e.g., usually 24 hours).  There is a public component to many BioBlitzes, with the goal of getting the public interested in biodiversity. To encourage more public participation, these BioBlitzes are often held in [[urban park]]s or [[nature reserve]]s close to cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amentsoc.org/insects/glossary/terms/bioblitz|title=BioBlitz  - Definition of  BioBlitz n the Entomologists' glossary|publisher=Amateur Entomologists' Society (AES)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- [http://www.whistlerbioblitz.ca/?page_id=2] --&gt;

==Features==
A BioBlitz has different opportunities and benefits than a traditional, scientific field study. Some of these potential benefits include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/blitz.html|title=Bio-blitz home page|publisher=Patuxent Wildlife Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Enjoyment - Instead of a highly structured and measured field survey, this sort of event has the atmosphere of a festival. The short time frame makes the searching more exciting.
*Local - The concept of biodiversity tends to be associated with coral reefs or tropical rain forests. A BioBlitz offers the chance for people to visit a nearby setting and see that local parks have biodiversity and are important to conserve.
*Science - These one-day events gather basic taxonomic information on some groups of species.
*Meet the Scientists - A BioBlitz encourages people to meet working scientists and ask them questions.
*Identifying rare and unique species/groups -  When volunteers and scientists work together, they are able to identify uncommon or special habitats for protection and management and, in some cases, rare species may be uncovered.
*Documenting species occurrence - BioBlitzes do not provide a complete species inventory for a site, but they provide a species list which makes a basis for a more complete inventory and will often show what area or what taxon would benefit from a further study.

==History==
The term "BioBlitz" was first coined by U.S. National Park Service naturalist Susan Rudy while assisting with the first BioBlitz.  The first BioBlitz was held at [[Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens]], [[Washington D.C.]] in 1996.  Approximately 1000 species were identified at this first event. This first accounting of biodiversity was organized by Sam Droege (USGS) and Dan Roddy (NPS) with the assistance of other government scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/blitz/kenilw.html|title=Kenilworth BioBlitz Home Page|publisher=Patuxent Wildlife Research Center|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public and especially the news media were invited.  Since the success of the first bioblitz, many organisations around the world have repeated this concept.

Since then, most BioBlitz contain a public component so that adults, kids, teens and anyone interested can join experts and scientists in the field. Participating in these hands-on field studies is a fun and exciting way for people to learn about [[biodiversity]] and better understand how to protect it.

In 1998, [[Harvard]] biologist [[E.O. Wilson]] and Massachusetts wildlife expert [[Peter Alden]] developed a program to catalog the organisms around [[Walden Pond]]. This led to a statewide program known as [[Biodiversity Days]].  This concept is very similar to a BioBlitz and occasionally the two terms are used interchangeably.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waldenbiodiversity.com/about/|title=About}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variation on the BioBlitz, the Blogger Blitz began in 2007. Rather than gather volunteers and scientists at one location, participant blogs pledged to conduct individual surveys of biodiversity.  These results were then compiled and mapped. The purpose of this blitz is not to survey down to species level across all taxonomic groups, but rather to raise awareness about biodiversity and provide a general snapshot of diversity.&lt;!-- better refs needed: [http://scienceblogs.com/voltagegate/2007/03/announcing_the_first_annual_bl.php][http://invasivespecies.blogspot.com/2007/03/join-blogger-bioblitz.html] --&gt;

From 2007 through 2016 [[National Geographic Society]] and the US [[National Park Service]] partnered to put on a Bioblitz in a different National Park each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/projects/bioblitz/}}&lt;/ref&gt; culminating in a Bioblitz across the National Park Service in 2016 as part of the National Park Service Centennial Celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Geographic|url=http://www.nps.gov/subjects/biodiversity/national-parks-bioblitz.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iNaturalist]] platform was used as the recording tool for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 Centennial Bioblitzes in this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iNaturalist|url=http://www.inaturalist.org/stats/nps_bioblitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The National Park Service and National Geographic hosted the first ever nationwide National Parks BioBlitz with scientists, park managers, and the public serving as citizen scientists making more than 60,000 observations on the mobile app iNaturalist. This endeavor has currently documented nearly 7,000 species, including species that are new to parks’ species lists, and engaged an estimated 80,000 public participants.'' Check out the [https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/2016-national-parks-bioblitz-nps-servicewide iNaturalist results].

Highlights of the 2016 nationwide BioBlitz include:
* '''The National Parks BioBlitz—Washington, D.C'''. was the cornerstone of the national event. Nearly 300 scientists and experts led more than 2,600 students and thousands of members of the general public in all 13 of the '''National Capital Region’s parks'''. As of the closing ceremony on May 21, nearly 900 species were recorded from this area alone.
* The Biodiversity Festival at '''Constitution Gardens on the National Mall''' served as a window to events across the country, with regular live feeds featuring species discoveries  on jumbo screens located on the National Mall.
* '''Dr. Edward O. Wilson''', “father of biodiversity”, was a significant part of the pre-BioBlitz events, including the Special Speaker Series at the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the 2016 National Parks BioBlitz Scientist Dinner at National Geographic Headquarters on Thursday, May 19.
* The '''BioBlitz Dance''' was a common activity throughout the festival weekend. Participants danced with John Griffith, founder of the dance, on the main stage several times at Constitution Gardens, and on the jumbotron from other park units across the nation.
* National parks and participating partners shared their BioBlitz activities via social media, using the hashtags '''#BioBlitz2016''' and '''#FindYourPark'''.  During the weekend’s event, #BioBlitz2016 ranked in the top 10 on Twitter!
* At '''Cabrillo National Monument,''' Green Abalone (''Haliotis fulgens'') was documented. For the past thirty years, abalone have faced substantial conservation concerns due to overharvesting and disease. Their presence in the Cabrillo Rocky Intertidal Zone can be described as ephemeral at best.
* '''Knife River National Park''' conducted an ArcheoBlitz. A centuries-old bison tooth was found at Big Hidatsa Village, which was occupied from about 1740 to 1850. DNA extracted from this tooth can provide data on bison populations before their near-extinction at the end of the 19th century, a useful comparison for managers of modern herds.
* At '''Great Smoky Mountain National Park''', experts teamed up with about 100 5thgraders. Together they set out to explore pollinators and succeeded in discovering nearly 200 species. While it is too early to tell if they found any new species, they have added significant information to the park’s database.
* '''Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve''' conducted a lichen survey and added several new species to their park list. One of those identified is ''Xanthoria elegans''. This species of lichen was known to have resided on the International Space Station for a year and a half.
* '''Channel Islands National Park''' broadcast a dive with oceanographer and National Geographic Explorer, Dr. Sylvia Earle, with support from the National Park Trust. The feed was featured online and on the jumbotrons on the National Mall and enabled the public to follow the exploration of the one of the richest marine ecosystems in the world, the giant kelp forest.
* The National Parks BioBlitz used the '''iNaturalist app''' to deliver real-time information on species finds. Verified data will be included in National Park Service databases and international databases tracking biodiversity on the planet. This application can be used by parks and citizen scientists well into the future.
* Beginning with the 2010 NPS/NGS BioBlitz at Biscayne National Park, NPS initiated a corps of '''Biodiversity Youth Ambassadors'''. Each year through 2016, a student ambassador is selected by the host park to participate in the BioBlitz and assist in raising biodiversity awareness to their peers and in their home communities. In addition to the new NCR Biodiversity Youth Ambassador, Ms. Katherine Hagan, Ms. Mikaila Ulmer, 11, was selected to be the National Park Service Biodiversity Youth Ambassador representing the President’s Pollinator Conservation Initiative for the National Park Service.

===Hungary===
BioBlitz Events in Hungary are organized by the Hungarian Biodiversity Research Society http://www.biodiverzitasnap.hu/ since 2006, starting with the eco-village Gyürüfű and its surroundings in Baranya County. Since then the Society organizes BioBlitz Events (called also Biodiversity Days) every year, sometimes even several events a year, during which 60-80 experts and researchers contribute to a profound momentary inventory of a chosen area in Hungary, and from time to time in cross-border areas in joint-projects with neighbour countries. The Hungarian Biodiversity Research Society invites local inhabitants and the interested public to join their events, and focusses in its outreach to young local and regional pupils and their teachers just like students from Hungary and abroad. The BioBlitz Events are taking place in partnership with the local National Park Directories, Municipalities and Civil Organisations. A rather fresh approach is the involvement of high school students during their obligatory community/voluntary work into research and field work in the topics of biodiversity and nature protection based upon long term co-operation contracts with schools and educational centres. The main goals pursued by the Hungarian Biodiversity Research Society are to promote the correct understanding of biodiversity in its true context, based upon data collection, monitoring, research and expertise, passing on knowledge from generation to generation and outreach to the broader public. It also aims to strengthen national and international networks. The results of the BioBlitz Events are published in print and on-line media and serve mainly as fundamentals for maintenance-instructions for protected areas and for appropriate natural-resource management, but also for educational purposes.

===Ireland===
*An Ireland's BioBlitz Event has been held annually since 2010 - established by the National Biodiversity Data Centre http://www.biodiversityireland.ie/ to celebrate International Year of Biodiversity. A unique feature of this event is that it has a number of parks through the island competing against each other to see which site records the most species over a 24hr period. The event is usually held on the third weekend in May each year.
*In 2010, the first year it was held, Connemara National Park won the competition having recording 542 species. In 2011, Killareny National Park won the event having recorded an astonishing tally of 1088 species. Crawfordsburn Country Park won in 2012 having recorded 984 species. All of the data are made available through an online mapping system, Biodiversity Maps http://maps.biodiversityireland.ie/# and hard copy species lists are produced http://bioblitz.biodiversityireland.ie/bioblitz-species-lists-now-available/
*The event is co-ordinated by the National Biodiversity Data Centre who maintain a special website http://bioblitz.biodiversityireland.ie/ each year so that progress with the event can be tracked on-line.
*To cater for the success of BioBlitz in Ireland, support is provided for a special 'Local BioBlitz Challenge' for local sites. Also, on 14–15 June 2013 Limerick City hosts the first Urban BioBlitz in Ireland.
*On May 1, 2014 the first Intervaristy BioBlitz was held with support from the National Biodiversity Data Centre.

'''[[Bosniaks]]''' ([[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Bošnjaci /'' Бошњаци) are the fourth largest ethnic group in '''[[Serbia]]''' after [[Serbs]], [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Hungarians]] and [[Romani people in Serbia|Roma]], numbering 145,278 or 2.02% of the population according to the 2011 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptId=1210 РЗС | Резултати извештаја&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are concentrated in south-western Serbia, and their cultural centre is [[Novi Pazar]].

==Demographics==
Bosniaks, as ethnic minority, are primarily the ones living in south-western Serbia, in the region historically known as [[Sandžak]], which is today divided between the states of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Colloquially referred to as ''Sandžaklije'' by themselves and others, Bosniaks form the majority in three out of six municipalities in the Serbian part of Sandžak: [[Novi Pazar]] (77.1%), [[Tutin, Serbia|Tutin]] (90%) and [[Sjenica]] (73.8%) and comprise an overall majority of 59.6%. The town of Novi Pazar is a cultural center of the Bosniaks in Serbia. Many Bosniaks from the Sandžak area left after the fall of the Ottoman Empire to continental [[Turkey]]. Over the years a large number of Bosniaks from the Sandžak region left to other countries, such as [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Turkey]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], etc. A second group is formed by Bosniaks that came from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the largest cities in Serbia during 20th century as economic migrants and inter-Yugoslav migrations.

Today, the majority of Bosniaks are [[Sunni Muslim]] and adhere to the [[Hanafi]] school of thought, the largest and oldest school of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] in jurisprudence within [[Sunni Islam]]. Some in this region are [[Albanians|Albanian]] by ethnicity and live in villages (Boroštica, Doliće, Ugao) located in the Pešter region. They have adopted a Bosniak identity in censuses, due to past sociopolitical discrimination against Albanians in the former Yugoslavia after World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Pieroni, Maria Elena Giusti, &amp; Cassandra L. Quave (2011). "Cross-cultural ethnobiology in the Western Balkans: medical ethnobotany and ethnozoology among Albanians and Serbs in the Pešter Plateau, Sandžak, South-Western Serbia." ''Human Ecology''. '''39'''.(3): 335. "The current population of the Albanian villages is partly “bosniakicised”, since in the last two generations a number of Albanian males began to intermarry with (Muslim) Bosniak women of Pešter. This is one of the reasons why locals in Ugao were declared to be “Bosniaks” in the last census of 2002, or, in Boroštica, to be simply “Muslims”, and in both cases abandoning the previous ethnic label of “Albanians”, which these villages used in the census conducted during “Yugoslavian” times. A number of our informants confirmed that the self-attribution “Albanian” was purposely abandoned in order to avoid problems following the Yugoslav Wars and associated violent incursions of Serbian para-military forces in the area. The oldest generation of the villagers however are still fluent in a dialect of Ghegh Albanian, which appears to have been neglected by European linguists thus far. Additionally, the presence of an Albanian minority in this area has never been brought to the attention of international stakeholders by either the former Yugoslav or the current Serbian authorities."&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Bosnia Eyalet, Central europe 1683.png|thumb|left|The [[Bosnia Eyalet]] (1580–1864) spanned large areas of modern-day [[Sandžak]] and included the eponymous [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]]]

Two thirds of Sandžak [[Bosniaks]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} trace their ancestry to the regions of [[Montenegro]] proper, from Malesia, region inhabited by Albanians. {{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} which they started departing first in 1687, after [[Turkey]] lost [[Boka Kotorska]]. The trend continued in Old [[Montenegro]] after 1711 with the extermination of alleged converts to [[Islam]] (“istraga poturica”).{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Another contributing factor that spurred migration to Sandžak from the Old [[Montenegro]] was the fact that the old [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] population of Sandžak moved towards [[Serbia]] and [[Habsburg Monarchy]] ([[Vojvodina]]) in two waves, first after 1687, and then, after 1740, basically leaving Sandžak depopulated. The advance of increasingly stronger ethnic [[Serbs]] of [[Montenegro]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} caused additional resettlements out of [[Montenegro proper]] in 1858 and 1878, when, upon [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], [[Montenegro]] was recognized as an independent state. While only 20 Bosniak families remained in [[Nikšić]] after 1878, the towns like [[Kolašin]], [[Spuž]], [[Grahovo, Nikšić|Grahovo]], and others, completely lost their Bosniak population.

The last segment of Sandžak [[Bosniaks]] arrived from a couple of other places. Some [[Bosniaks]] came from [[Slavonia]] after 1687, when [[Turkey]] lost all the lands north of [[Sava]] in the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683-1699)|Austro-Turkish war]]. Many more came from [[Herzegovina]] in the post-1876 period, after the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovina Rebellion]] staged by the [[Serbs]] against [[Austro-Hungary]] and their [[Muslim]] subjects. Another wave followed immediately thereafter from both [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], as the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] placed the [[Vilayet of Bosnia]] under the effective control of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1878. The last wave from Bosnia followed in 1908, when [[Austria-Hungary]] officially [[annexation of Bosnia|annexed Bosnia]], thereby cutting off all direct ties of [[Bosnian Muslims]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], their effective protector.

== Politics ==

[[Image:Prvomajska ulica sa pogledom na Altun-alem džamiju.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Prvomajska Street in [[Novi Pazar]]]]
The first major political organising of the Sandžak Muslims happened at the [[Sjenica]] conference, held in August 1917, during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian-Hungarian]] occupation of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]]. The Muslim representatives at the conference decided to ask the Austrian-Hungarian authorities to separate the Sanjak of Novi Pazar from Serbia and Montenegro and merge it with [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], or at least to give an autonomy to the region.{{sfn|Kamberović|2009|p=94&amp;ndash;95}}

After the end of the [[World War I]] and the creation of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] in 1918, the [[Sandžak]] region also become a part of the newly created country. At the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes Constitutional Assembly election, 1920|Constitutional Assembly election]] held in 1920, the Sandžak Muslims voted for the [[People's Radical Party]]. The main reason for supporting the radicals was a promise made to several influential Muslims that they would be compensated for losing their lands during the agrarian reform.{{sfn|Crnovršanin|Sadiković|2001|p=287}}

In order to protect their interests, the Sandžak Muslims organised themselves jointly with the Albanians in the [[Džemijet]] party, that covered the area of the present-day [[Kosovo]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and Sandžak. The main goal of the Džemijet was the protection of interests of the Slavic Muslims and Albanians. Džemijet was founded in 1919 in [[Skopje]] and was led by [[Nexhip Draga]] and later by his brother [[Ferhat Bey Draga]]. After it was founded in Skopje, branches of the party were soon founded in Kosovo, Sandžak and the rest of Macedonia. District and municipal branches in Sandžak were founded at a meeting of Džemijet held in [[Novi Pazar]] in 1922. The meeting was highly attended, and it insisted upon Muslim unity instead of division by various political parties.

Currently{{When|date=January 2016}} the most important political party is the [[Party of Democratic Action of Sandžak]] led by [[Sulejman Ugljanin]], which has parliamentary representation and has participated in coalition governments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">The '''Ciboney''', or '''Siboney''', were a [[Taíno]] people of [[Cuba]]. A Western Taíno group living in central Cuba during the 15th and 16th centuries, they had a dialect and culture distinct from the Classic Taíno in the eastern part of the island, though much of the Ciboney territory was under the control of the eastern chiefs. Confusion in the historical sources led 20th-century scholars to apply the name "Ciboney" to the non-Taíno [[Guanahatabey]] of western Cuba and various [[archaic stage|archaic]] cultures around the [[Caribbean]], but this is deprecated.

[[File:Taínos.svg|450px|thumb|Ciboney was the region of Cuba inhabited by the Western [[Taíno]] group. ]]

==History==
At the time of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization]], the Ciboney were the most populous group in [[Cuba]]. They inhabited the central part of the island, between western [[Pinar del Río Province]] and eastern [[Oriente Province]].&lt;ref&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, p. 20, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], who lived among the Ciboney in the early 16th century, related that their dialect and culture was similar to that of the [[Lucayans]] of the present-day [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref name=Granberry20&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, scholars classify the Ciboney as a Western [[Taíno]] group, associating them with the peoples of the Bahamas, [[Jamaica]], and westernmost [[Hispaniola]], while distinguishing them from the Classic Taíno of eastern Cuba, most of Hispaniola, and [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, p. 9, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Classic Taíno in eastern Cuba, the Ciboney shared the island with the [[Guanahatabey]], an [[Archaic stage|archaic]] people inhabiting western Pinar del Río Province.&lt;ref&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ciboney spoke a dialect of the [[Taíno language]] conventionally known as Ciboney Taíno; it was distinct from, but mutually intelligible with, Classic Taíno.&lt;ref&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ciboney were the dominant population in Cuba until around 1450.&lt;ref name=Granberry2021&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Las Casas states that unlike the highly organized Classic Taíno to the east, the Ciboney had no integrated [[chiefdoms]] or wider political structure.&lt;ref name=Granberry9&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-15th century, Classic Taíno from Hispaniola began migrating into eastern Cuba, overcoming the native Ciboney. These "Cuban Taíno" established chiefdoms concentrated in Oriente Province, though they established settlements as far west as [[Havana Province]].&lt;ref name=Granberry2021/&gt; However, the Cuban Taíno never established an island-wide political structure as existed in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=Granberry9/&gt; Classic Taíno migration from Hispaniola to Cuba increased after Spanish contact, with many Taíno leaving to escape the Spanish incursion. Notably, Hispaniola Taíno chief [[Hatuey]] fled to Cuba with most of his people; he remained there until the Spanish captured and executed him.&lt;ref name=Granberry20/&gt; Following the Spanish conquest of Cuba in 1511 under [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], the population of all native groups declined precipitously until they had disappeared as distinct groups by the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confusion with the Guanahatabey==
In the 20th century, misreadings of the historical record led scholars to confuse the Ciboney with both a neighboring group, the [[Guanahatabey]], and with archaic-level populations around the Caribbean. Las Casas referred to both the Ciboney and the Guanahatabey, but he was clear they were different: the Guanahatabey were a primitive society of [[hunter-gatherers]] in western Cuba, and they spoke a separate language distinct from Taíno. A confusion of the sources led archaeologists to use the term "Ciboney" for the [[aceramic]] (lacking pottery) archaeological sites found on various Caribbean islands. As many of these were found in the former Guanahatabey territory, the term became associated with the historical non-Taíno Guanahatabey.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, pp. 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rouse, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars recognized the error in the 1980s and have restored the name "Ciboney" to the Western Taíno people of Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Granberry and Vescelius, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''death by sawing'''" indicates the act of sawing a living person in half, either [[Anatomical plane|sagittally]] (usually midsagittally), or transversely. Thus, [[decapitation]] by sawing or [[dismemberment]] by sawing are tangential sub-themes, though some ambiguous cases might be included. Death by sawing was a method of execution reportedly used in different parts of the world. Some of the reviewed examples are legendary.  At least one source states that the method was probably never used.&lt;ref&gt;''Schild'' (1997) p. 44 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Different methods of death by sawing have been recorded. In cases related to the Roman Emperor [[Caligula]], the sawing is said to be through the middle ([[wiktionary:transversely|transversely]]).&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;''Scott'' (1995), p.142&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases of [[Morocco]], it is stated that the sawing was lengthwise, both from the groin and upwards and from the skull and downwards (mid[[wiktionary:sagittally|sagittally]]).&lt;ref name=Busnot1&gt;''Busnot'' (1717), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yiNSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 pp.167–70]&lt;/ref&gt;

In only one case, in the story about [[Simon the Zealot]], the person is explicitly described as being hung upside-down and sawn apart vertically through the middle, starting at the groin, with no mention of fastening or support boards around the person, in the manner depicted in illustrations.&lt;ref name= "Geyer"&gt;''Geyer'' (1738) [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2VCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA631 p.631]&lt;/ref&gt; In other cases where details about the method beyond the mere sawing act are explicitly supplied, the condemned person was apparently fastened to either one or two boards prior to sawing.&lt;ref name=Busnot1 /&gt;

==Archaic Age and antiquity==
===Ancient Persia===
;The legend of Jamshid
[[Jamshid]] was a legendary [[shah]] of [[Greater Iran|Persia]], whose story is told in the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' by [[Ferdowsi]]. After 300 years of blessed reign, Jamshid forgot the blessings came from God, and began demanding that he be revered as a god himself. The people rebelled, and [[Zahhak]] had him sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1744), [https://books.google.com/books?id=afRSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA179 p.179]&lt;/ref&gt;
; Parysatis
[[Parysatis]], wife and half-sister of [[Darius II]] (r. 423–405 BC) was the real power behind the throne of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]; she instigated and became involved in a number of court intrigues, made several enemies, yet had an uncanny knack for dispatching them at an opportune time. At one point, she decided to have the siblings of her daughter-in-law [[Stateira (wife of Artaxerxes II)|Stateira]] killed, and only relented from killing Stateira as well due to the desperate pleas of her son, [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]]. Stateira's sister Roxana was the first of her siblings to be killed, by being sawn in half. When Dareius II died, Parysatis moved quickly, and was able to have the new queen Stateira poisoned; Parysatis still remained a power to be reckoned with for years after.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1747), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=266&amp;id=Y9gGAAAAcAAJ p.266]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Hormizd IV
[[Hormizd IV]] ({{lang-fa| هرمز چهارم}}), son of [[Khosrow I]], reigned as the twenty-first [[Sasanian Empire|King of Persia]] from AD 579 to 590.&lt;ref&gt;''Dignas; Winter'' (2007) p.42&lt;/ref&gt; As the years went by, he was, due to his "cruelties", deeply resented by the nobility. In 590, a palace coup was staged in which his son, [[Khosrow II]], was declared king. Hormuzd IV was forced to watch his wife and one of his sons sawn in two, and the deposed king was then blinded. After a few days, the new king is said to have killed his old, blind father in a fit of rage.&lt;ref&gt;''Osborne'' (1742), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=535&amp;id=tfJSAAAAcAAJ p.535]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thracians===
[[Thracians]] were regarded as warlike, ferocious, and bloodthirsty by Romans and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Head; Heath'' (1982), p. 51, ''Webber; McBride'' (2001): "Perhaps the prospect of getting to the spoils explains Thucydides VII, 29: `For the Thracian race, like all the most bloodthirsty barbarians, are always particularly bloodthirsty when everything is going their own way", p.1&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notorious was the king [[Diegylis]], possibly only topped by his son [[Ziselmius]]. According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], Ziselmius sawed several persons to death and commanded their families to eat the flesh of their murdered relatives. The Thracians eventually rebelled, captured him and sought to inflict every conceivable torture upon him prior to his death.&lt;ref&gt;''Diodorus Seculus'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?id=LFg-AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA2450 p.2450]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Rome===
;The Twelve Tables
Promulgated about 451 BC, the [[Twelve Tables]] is the oldest extant law code for the Romans. [[Aulus Gellius]], whose work "Attic Nights" is partially preserved, states that death by the saw was mentioned for some offenses in the tables, but that the use of which was so infrequent that no one could remember ever having seen it done.&lt;ref&gt;For Gellius' statement, see, ''Rosenmüller'' (1820), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dk8_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA95 p.95]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the retained laws in the Twelve Tables, the following concerning how creditors should proceed with debtors is found in Table 3, article 6: "On the third market-day they [the creditors] shall cut pieces. If they shall have cut more or less [than their shares], it shall be with impunity (_s[in]e fraude_)." The translator notes the ambiguity of the original text, but says that later Roman writers understood this to mean that creditors were allowed to cut their shares from the body of the debtor. If true, that would constitute dismemberment, rather than sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''Coleman-Norton'' (1948))[https://archive.org/stream/thetwelvetables14783gut/14783.txt The Twelve Tables]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Caligula
This method of execution was uncommon throughout the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. However, it was used extensively during the reign of [[Caligula]]&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Calig. 27: multos [...] medios serra dissecuit - , [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html Vita Caligulae] "Many..had them sawn asunder" [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Caligula*.html Life of Caligula]&lt;/ref&gt; when the condemned, including members of his own family, were sawn across the [[torso]] rather than lengthways down the body. It is said that Caligula would watch such executions while he ate, stating that witnessing the suffering acted as an appetiser.&lt;ref name="Scott" /&gt;
;The Kitos War
The [[Kitos War]] occurred 115–117 AD, and was a rebellion by the Jews within the Roman Empire. Major revolts happened several places, and the main source by [[Cassius Dio]] claims that in [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], 220,000 Greeks were massacred by the Jews; in [[Cyprus]], 240,000. Dio adds that many of the victims were sawn asunder, and that the Jews licked up the blood of the slain, and "twisted the entrails like a girdle about their bodies"&lt;ref&gt;''Gibbon'' (1776), [https://books.google.com/books?id=aLcWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR76 Appendix, p.lxxvi]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Valens
In 365 AD, [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] declared himself emperor, and moved against [[Valens]]. He was defeated in battle, and due to the treachery of his two generals Agilonius and [[Gomoarius]] (they had been promised they would be "shown favour" by Valens), he was captured. In 366, he was fastened to two trees bent down with force; when the trees were released, Procopius was ripped apart. The "favour" Valens showed to Agilonius and Gomoarius was to have them both sawn asunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Sozomen'' (1846), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDmxf3_Ju1sC&amp;pg=PA262 p.262]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish tradition===
;Death of Isaiah
The prophet [[Isaiah]] was, according to some traditional rabbinic texts, sawn apart on orders of King [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh of Juda]].&lt;ref name="Warnekros"&gt;''Warnekros'' (1832), [https://books.google.com/books?id=P4hAAAAAcAAJ&amp;PA=711 p.368]&lt;/ref&gt; One tradition states that he was put within a tree, and then sawn apart; another says he was sawn apart by means of a wooden saw.&lt;ref&gt;''Du Pin'' (1699), [https://books.google.com/books?id=VzZWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA115 p.115]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian Martyrs===
;Simon the Zealot
[[File:Zersägen des Heiligen Simon.png|thumb|Illustration by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] of St. Simon sawn in two]]
Several early Christians are credited with being martyred by means of a saw. The earliest, and most famous, is the obscure apostle of [[Jesus]], [[Simon the Zealot]]. He is said to have been martyred in [[Iran|Persia]], and that the express mode by which he was executed was to be hanged up by the feet, as in the woodcut illustration.&lt;ref name= "Geyer" /&gt;
;Conus and his son
Living in the age of [[Domitian]], Conus went, after his wife's death, with his 7-year-old son into a desert. However, he then had the idea of attacking paganism, and destroyed several idols in [[Konya|Cogni]], Asia Minor ([[Anatolia]]). Caught, he and his son were tortured by starvation and fire, but they were finally put to the saw, dying while they prayed.&lt;ref&gt;''Schmauss'' (1719), [https://books.google.com/books?id=e6VMAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA69 p.69]&lt;/ref&gt;
;Symphorosa and her seven sons
[[Symphorosa]] was, allegedly, a widow with seven sons living in the age of emperor [[Trajan]] (98-117). They were commanded to pray at a heathen temple, but refusing, Symphorosa was scourged, and then with a large stone fastened to her, thrown in the river [[Aniene]]. The six eldest sons were all killed by stab wounds, but the youngest, Eugenius, was sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Foxe'' (1840), [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=5&amp;id=IeLq-CNyOcIC p.5]&lt;/ref&gt; However, she may have been killed ca. 138, near the end of the reign of [[Hadrian]] (117–138).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14379a.htm Symphorosa] at the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
;The 38 monks and martyrs on Mount Sinai
Supposedly during the reign of [[Diocletian]], a community of monks lived at [[Mount Sinai]]. One day, the "wild barbarians" (said to be inveterate robbers and even cannibalizing their own sons occasionally) decided to rob the community. But, there was nothing of material wealth there, and in their rage, the Arabs slaughtered them all, several by [[flaying]], others by sawing them with dull saws.&lt;ref&gt;''Deinl'' (1850), [https://books.google.com/books?id=MhJNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA42 p.42]&lt;/ref&gt;
;St. Tarbula
Accused of practicing witchcraft and of causing sickness to befall the wife of the ardently anti-Christian Persian king [[Shapur II]], she was condemned and executed by being sawed in half in the year 345.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1909 St. Tarbula]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
===Egypt===
;The monk from Montepulciano
In the 1630s, there are several reports from the [[Levant]] and Egypt that monks were killed. One of them, Brother Conrad d'Elis Barthelemy, a native of [[Montepulciano]] is said to have been sawn in two, from the head and downwards.&lt;ref&gt;''Chateaubriand'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3uFBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 p.143]&lt;/ref&gt;
; The renegade Coptic governor
Writing in 1843, William Holt Yates speaks of a governor under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (r.1801–49), Abd-ur-Rahman Bey, who was said to be particularly cruel and avaricious. He was a renegade [[Copts|Copt]], and abused his position to gain hold of wealth. He is even credited with having sawed people in two. Yates further supplies the detail: "This fellow has since been assassinated-report says, with sanction and approval of the Government"&lt;ref&gt;''Yates'' (1843), [https://books.google.com/books?id=7WRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA123 p.123] More on this governor and his assassination in 1840 in ''Gliddon'' (1841), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YWQGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 p.70-72, footnote]&lt;/ref&gt;

;1705 The sawing of Alcaide Melec
One of the most notorious cases of sawing as execution is that of the [[Qaid|Alcaide]] (castellan/governor) Melec under emperor [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Ishmael]] (r. 1672–1727). The fullest description of this execution is found in Dominique Busnot's&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Dominique Busnot]]&lt;/ref&gt; 1714 work ''Histoire du règne de Mouley Ismael'', although a brief notice of the event can be found in the January 1706 edition of ''Present state of Europe''.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;''Rhodes'' (1706), [https://books.google.com/books?id=bwALAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA46 p.46]&lt;/ref&gt; In the following, the tale as told by Busnot will be given.&lt;ref name="Busnot1" /&gt;

Melec was judged as the chief rebel to be punished in a rebellion instigated by one of the emperor's sons, Mulay Muhammad. In particular, according to Busnot, the empress was incensed that Melec had personally beheaded one of her cousins, Ali Bouchasra.&lt;ref&gt;''Busnot'' (1716), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yiNSAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA167 p.66-67]&lt;/ref&gt; In September/October 1705,&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt; Mulay Ismail sent for his chief carpenter and asked if his saws were capable of sawing a man in two. The carpenter answered "Sure enough". He was then given the grisly task, and before he left, he asked him whether Melec should be sawn across or along the length. The emperor said the sawing should proceed lengthwise, from the head downwards. He told, however, Boachasra's sons, they should follow the carpenter and decide for themselves how best to take revenge upon the murderer (i.e., Melec) of their father. Taking with him 8 of the public executioner's assistants, the master carpenter went to the prison where Melec was held, two of his brand new saws packed in cloth, in order to keep from Melec information of the intended manner of execution. Melec was now placed on a mule, bound with an iron chain, and led to the public square, where some 4000 of his relatives and members of his tribe were assembled. These made a "terrifying" spectacle through screaming, and clawing their faces in a public display of grief. Melec, on the other hand, seemed unperturbed, calmly smoking from his tobacco pipe. When taken down from the mule, Melec's clothes were removed, damning letters "proving" his treason was cast in the fire.

Then, he was strapped onto a board, and placed upon a sawbench, his arms and legs fastened. The executioner's team then sought to start by sawing him from the head downwards, but Boucasra's sons intervened, and demanded that one began between Melec's legs instead, because otherwise, he would die too quickly. Under the terrible screams of Melec and his relatives, thus began his execution. Once they had sawed him up to the navel, they pulled out the saw in order to commence from the other side. Melec is said to have been still conscious, asking for some water. His friends, though, thought it best to hasten his demise and shorten his sufferings, and the executioners went on, sawing him from skull to navel so he fell apart. In the process, chunks of flesh were ripped out by the saw's teeth, causing blood to splatter everywhere, thus making the execution quite unbearable to watch.

Around 300 other conspirators were [[Impalement|impaled]] alive, and another report states that in addition to these, some other 20 chief conspirators had their arms and legs sawed off, and left to expire in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Rhodes" /&gt;
;1721 The sawing of Larbe Shott
19 July 1721, a noble descended from the [[Andalusia]]n [[Moors]], Larbe Shott was put to the saw. He had spent considerable time at [[Gibraltar]], and one of the crimes imputed to him was to have spent time in Christian kingdoms without his emperor's leave. Furthermore, he had been found guilty of defiling himself with Christian women, and often drunk alcohol. In short, he was charged as an apostate and unbeliever, in addition to being charged with having invited the "Spaniards" to invade [[Barbary Coast|Barbary]] (i.e., treason). They brought him to one of the gates in the city, fastened him between two boards, and sawed him in two, from skull and downwards. After his death, Mulay Ishmael pardoned him, so that his body could be picked up and given a decent burial at least, instead of being eaten by the dogs.&lt;ref&gt;''Windus'' (1725), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rmRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA156 p.156-57]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Swiss sawing
In 1757, a French officer was executed by his men in a mutiny on [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]] in current-day [[Mississippi]]. Three of the mutineers were eventually captured and brought to [[New Orleans]] for trial. After conviction, two of the mutineers died on the [[Breaking wheel|French wheel]]. The last mutineer, a Swiss from the Karrer regiment, was allegedly, nailed into a coffin-shaped wooden box, and it was sawed into with a cross-cut saw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cuevas, John|title=The History of a Mississippi Gulf Coast Barrier Island|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aTP8fxliBI4C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim of a Swiss being sawed in two was first made by the French captain and traveller [[Jean Bernard Bossu]] in his 1768 ''Nouveaux Voyages aux Indes Occidentales'', translated into English by [[Johann Reinhold Forster]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;On French publication date and biographical details of Bossu, see: [http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=5922 Jean Bernard Bossu (1720–1792)] at the website: "[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/ Encyclopedia of Arkansas History&amp;Culture]". On relevant excerpt, see ''Forster'' (1771), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 p.324-325]&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on Bossu's general reliability in a footnote to his essay ''A Map within an Indian Painting?'', jurist [[Morris S. Arnold]] says the following: "Bossu's books contain a lot of tall tales, so one needs to be cautious about relying on him".&lt;ref&gt;''Lewis, Arnold'' (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=h2tGe9U39UIC&amp;pg=PA200 footnote 11, p.200]&lt;/ref&gt; Bossu claims that being "sawed asunder" was a traditional Swiss military punishment, and alleges that one Swiss mutineer actually committed suicide to avoid that punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Forster'' (1771), [https://books.google.com/books?id=QiYVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA324 p.324]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the one who was allegedly sawed in half had his punishment as governed by Swiss military law, rather than French. An incident from 1741 (in [[Louisbourg]], Canada) shows that at that time, when two Frenchmen and a Swiss were executed, Swiss mercenary troops had been placed under French military law, rather than under Swiss.&lt;ref&gt;" Whatever the rights and wrongs of a particular case might be, the Swiss were not to be treated as an independent unit and their officers must be subordinate to the French commandant", at [http://fortress.cbu.ca/justice/Karrer.htm The Administration Of Justice At The Fortress Of Louisbourg (1713-1758)], excerpted from Greer (1976), "The Soldiers of Isle Royale, 1720-1745"&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, detailing the recorded executions in the Swiss [[Canton of Zürich]] through the 15th-18th century, Gerold Meyer von Knonau records 1445 executions in total, none of them being through death by sawing.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Meyer_von_Knonau,_Gerold_%28Archivar%29 Knonau]'' (1846) [https://books.google.com/books?jtp=335&amp;id=4xRMAAAAYAAJ p.335]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1791, a [[Haitian Revolution#1791 slave rebellion|great slave revolt]] broke out at [[Saint-Domingue]], eventually leading to Haitian independence. In the process, some 4,000 white planters and their family members were massacred.&lt;ref&gt;''Censer and Hunt'' (2001), p.124&lt;/ref&gt; One of the victims was a carpenter by trade, Robert. The rebels decided he "should die in the way of his occupation" and accordingly fastened him between two boards and sawed him apart.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1819), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TcI-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA79 p.79]&lt;/ref&gt;

;An episode from the Crusades
In 1123, [[Joscelin I, Count of Edessa|Joscelin de Courtenay]] and [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] were separately ambushed and surprised by a Turkish [[emir]], Balac, and made prisoners at the castle at Quartapiert. Some 50 [[Armenians]], bound by oath to Joscelin as [[Count of Edessa]], decided to free their liege lord as well as Baldwin II. Dressed as monks and pedlars, they gained entry in the town where the two nobles were held captive, and managed, through massacre, to take control of the castle. Joscelin slipped out in order to raise a force, while Baldwin II and his nephew Galeran remained behind to hold the castle. Apprised of the capture of the castle, Balac sent quickly a force to recapture it, and Baldwin II saw no possibility of holding it. Graciously, Balac took Baldwin and his nephew merely prisoners. Not so merciful was he towards the Armenians: Several of them were flayed, others buried up to the neck and used as target practice, the rest were sawn apart.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins'' (1812), [https://books.google.com/books?id=YhIwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p.220]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement of a saw may cause a body to sway back and forth making the process difficult for the executioners. The Chinese overcame this problem by securing the victim in an upright position between two boards firmly fixed between stakes driven deep into the ground. Two executioners, one at each end of the saw, would saw downwards through the stabilized boards and enclosed victim.&lt;ref&gt;''Abbott'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Whether sawing as an execution method actually existed, or that cases referred to are garbled accounts of the "[[Lingchi|slow slicing]]" method of execution will remain an open question.

===Segare la vecchia===
In Italy and Spain, a curious tradition of "segare la vecchia" ("sawing the old woman") was upheld on [[Laetare Sunday]] (Mid-[[Lent]] Sunday) in hamlets and towns, well into the 19th century. The custom consisted of the boys running about to find the "oldest woman in the village", and then make a wooden effigy in her likeness. Then, the wooden figure was sawn across the middle. The folklorist [[Jacob Grimm]] regards this as an odd spring ritual, in which the "old year"/winter is symbolically defeated. He also notes that a rather similar custom existed in his day among [[South Slavs|Southern Slavs]].&lt;ref&gt;''Grimm'' (1835) [https://books.google.com/books?id=OhIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA453 p.453]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 census, [[Nepal]]'s population was approximately 26 million people with a population growth rate of 1.35% and a median age of 21.6 years.&lt;ref name="pre-cen"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Population and Housing Census 2011 (National Report) |url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/National%20Report.pdf |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics (Nepal) |accessdate=26 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418041642/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/National%20Report.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the female median age was approximately 25 years old and the male median age was approximately 22 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2177.html#np|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 4.4% of the population is estimated to be more than 65 years old, comprising 681,252 females and 597,628 males. 61% of the population is between 15 and 64 years old, and 34.6% is younger than 14 years. In 2011, the [[Birth rate]] is estimated to be 22.17 births per 1,000 people with an [[infant mortality]] rate of 46 deaths per 1,000 live births. Compared to the infant mortality rate in 2006 of 48 deaths per 1000 live births, the 2011 IMR is a slight decrease within that 5-year period. Infant mortality rate in Nepal is higher in rural regions at 44 deaths per 1000 live births, whereas in urban regions the IMR is lower at 40 deaths per 1000 live births. This difference is due to a lack of delivery assistance services in rural communities compared to their urban counterparts who have better access to hospitals and neonatal clinics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamichhane|first=Reeta|last2=Zhao|first2=Yun|last3=Paudel|first3=Susan|last4=Adewuyi|first4=Emmanuel O.|date=2017-01-01|title=Factors associated with infant mortality in Nepal: a comparative analysis of Nepal demographic and health surveys (NDHS) 2006 and 2011|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-3922-z|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=17|pages=53|doi=10.1186/s12889-016-3922-z|issn=1471-2458|pmc=5223552|pmid=28068969}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Life expectancy]] at birth is estimated to be 67.44 years for females and 64.94 years for males.

== Population Growth ==

The population of Nepal has been steadily rising recent decades. In the June 2001 census, there was a population of about 23 million in Nepal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2002/PopulationGrowthContinuestoHinderNepalsEconomicProgress.aspx|title=Population Growth Continues to Hinder Nepal’s Economic Progress|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population increased by 5 million from the last census (1991); the growth rate is 2.3%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The current population is roughly 30 million which contributes to an increase of about 3 million people every 5 years.

Sixty caste and linguistic subgroups have formed throughout time with the waves of [[Migration in Nepal|migration]] from Tibet and India.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massey|first=Douglas S.|last2=Axinn|first2=William G.|date=August 2010|title=Environmental change and out-migration: evidence from Nepal|url=https://link-springer-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/content/pdf/10.1007/s11111-010-0119-8.pdf|journal=Population and Environment|volume=32|pages=109–136|doi=10.1007/s11111-010-0119-8.pdf|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a moderate amount of immigration early in Nepal's history, then the population essentially remained the same without any significant fluctuations for over one hundred years.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Natural disasters and the following government resettlement programs in the 1950s led to a spike in internal migration from the hills to the Terai region.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In the 1980s the Western Chitwan Valley became a major transportation hub for all of Nepal. Along with this major change came a dramatic increase in government services, business expansion, and growing employment, especially in the agricultural industry. The valley's population grew rapidly through both in-migration and natural increase.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Nepal's diverse linguistic heritage evolved from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], and various [[indigenous language]] isolates. According to the 2001 national census, 92 different living languages are spoken in Nepal (a 93rd category was "unspecified"). Based upon the 2011 census, the major languages spoken in Nepal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Summary of Census |year=2011 |work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202145804/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (percentage spoken out of the mother tongue language) includes

[[Nepali language|Nepali]] (derived from [[Khas]] bhasa) is considered to be a member of Indo-European language and is written in [[Devanagari]] script. [[Nepali language|Nepali]] was the language of the house of Gorkhas in the late 18th century and became the official, national language that serves as the ''lingua franca'' among Nepalese of different ethnolinguistic groups. [[Maithili language]]—along with regional dialects Awadhi and Bhojpuri—are mother tongue Nepalese languages and spoken in the southern [[Terai Region]]. Many Nepali in government and business uses English as an official language. English is the language of technical, medical, and scientific community as well as the elite bankers, traders, and entrepreneurs. There has been a surge in the number and percentage of people who understand English. Majority of the urban and a significant number of the rural schools are English-medium schools. Higher education in technical, medical, scientific and engineering fields are entirely in English. [[Nepal Bhasa]], the mother-tongue of the Newars, is widely used and spoken in and around [[Kathmandu Valley]] and in major Newar trade towns across Nepal.

Other languages, particularly in the Inner Terai hill and mountain regions, are remnants of the country's pre-unification history of dozens of political entities isolated by mountains and gorges. These languages typically are limited to an area spanning about one day's walk.  Beyond that distance, dialects and languages lose mutual intelligibility. Since Nepal's unification, various indigenous languages have come under threat of extinction as the government of Nepal has marginalized their use through strict policies designed to promote Nepali as the official language. Indigenous languages which have gone extinct or are critically threatened include Byangsi, Chonkha, and Longaba. Since democracy was restored in 1990, however, the government has worked to improve the marginalization of these languages. Tribhuvan University began surveying and recording threatened languages in 2010 and the government intends to use this information to include more languages on the next Nepalese census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tumbahang|first=Govinda Bahadur|year=2010|title=Marginalization of indigenous languages of Nepal|url=|journal=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|volume=37|pages=69|via=Expanded Academic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2011 census, 81.3% of the Nepalese population was [[Hindu]], 9.0% [[Buddhist]], 4.4% [[Muslim]], 3.0% [[Kirat Mundhum|Kirant/Yumaist]], 1.42% [[Christian]], and 0.9% followed other or no religion.&lt;ref name="2011census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/National%20Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=2011 Nepal Census Report |page=16 |work=cbs.gov.np |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418041642/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/National%20Report.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nepal defines itself as a [[Hinduism in Nepal|Hindu]] nation based in the caste system of traditional Hindu ideology.&lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ostrowski|first=Ally|title=THE FRAMING OF RELIGION|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1080/14746680600555410|journal=South Asian Popular Culture|volume=4|issue=1|pages=3–18|doi=10.1080/14746680600555410}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for many Hindus in the country to also worship Buddhist deities simultaneously with Hindu traditions. The notion of religion in Nepal is more fluid than other countries, particularly Western countries.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Linda|title=Order, identity, and religion in Nepal|url=https://www-tandfonline-com.aurarialibrary.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1080/00988157.2000.9978248|journal=Reviews in Anthropology|volume=29|issue=1|pages=71–82|doi=10.1080/00988157.2000.9978248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nepali people build their social networks through their religious celebrations, which are a central part to the whole of communities within the country.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt;

There is a general ideal held by the Nepalese people that there is an omnipotent, transcendental "moral order" that is sacred to Hinduism. This ideal exists along with the constant presence of chaos and disorder in the material world.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; In the Northwestern region of the country, this all-encompassing state of disorder in the world is synonymous with human affliction, for which the religious Shamans can alleviate.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Shamans create a world of mythic time and space to restore order and balance to the world to cure the suffers.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

Kathmandu Valley is home to the Newars, a major ethnic group in Nepal. The city Bhaktapur is located inside of Kathmandu Valley. Bhaktapur was once an independent Hindu Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Individual homes typically have at least one shrine devoted to personal deities, with an altar displaying flowers, fruit, and oil among other offerings to the Gods.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; The perimeter of Kathmandu Valley is lined with shrines devoted to Hindu goddesses, whose purpose is to protect the city from chaotic events.In fact, at least one shrine can be found on the vast majority of streets in Kathmandu.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; The people of Nepal do not feel the need to segregate or compete based upon religion, so Hindu and Buddhist shrines are often coexisting in the same areas.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; The areas outside of the city are perceived to always possess some form of wild or disordered nature, so the Nepalese people inside of the city lines regularly worship the Hindu gods through public ceremonies.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt;

The Hindu god Vishnu symbolizes moral order in the Newar society. The natural human shortcomings in maintaining the godly moral order is represented by the Hindu god Shiva.&lt;ref name=":16"/&gt; Shiva is destructive and acts in greed, and he threatens the moral order. In ancient myths, Vishnu must step in to contain Shiva and restore the order.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In recent times, there has been a rise in political violence, specifically Maoist violence.&lt;ref name=":06"/&gt; This increased violence, along with the widespread poverty creates times of hardship for the people of Nepal. During their struggles they find stability and peace in religion.

Nepal's constitution continues long-standing legal provisions prohibiting discrimination against other religions (but also proselytization). The king was defied as the earthly manifestation of the Hindu god [[Vishnu]]. On May 19, 2006, the government faced a [[constitutional crisis]], the House of Representatives which had been just reformed, having been previously dissolved, declared Nepal a "[[separation of church and state|secular state]]".

However, the 2001 census identified 80.6% of the population as [[Hindu]] and 10.7% as [[Buddhist]] (although many people labeled Hindu or Buddhist often practice a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] blend of Hinduism, Buddhism, or [[animism|animist]] traditions), 4.2% of the population was [[Muslim]], 3.6% of the population followed the indigenous [[Kirat Mundhum]] religion and [[Christianity]] was practiced by 0.45% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs.gov.np/Nepal%20in%20figure/nepal%20in%20figures%202006.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409125126/http://www.cbs.gov.np/Nepal%20in%20figure/nepal%20in%20figures%202006.pdf|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhist and Hindu shrines and festivals are respected and celebrated by most Nepalese. Certain animist practices of old indigenous religions survive.

The [[Kirati people]] of eastern Nepal, [[Limbu people|Limbus]] together with [[Rai people|Rais]] form one of the largest single ethnic groups in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;Researches Into the History and Civilization of the Kirātas By G. P. Singh, Gyan Publishing House, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pahari people|Pahari]] Hill Hindus of the [[Khas]] ([[Bahun]] and [[Chhetri]] castes) and the [[Newar people|Newar ethnicity]] dominated the civil service, the judiciary and upper ranks of the army throughout the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Shah regime]] (1768–2008). [[Nepali language|Nepali]] was the national language and [[Sanskrit]] became a required school subject. Children who spoke Nepali natively and who were exposed to Sanskrit had much better chances of passing the national examinations at the end of high school, which meant they had better employment prospects and could continue into higher education. Children who natively spoke local languages of the [[Madhesh]] and [[Hill Region|Hills]], or Tibetan dialects prevailing in the high mountains were at a considerable disadvantage. This history of exclusion coupled with poor prospects for improvement created grievances that encouraged many in ethnic communities such as [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]] and [[Tharu people|Tharu]] in the [[Tharuhat]] and [[Madhesh]] and [[Kham Magar]] in the mid-western hills to support the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and various other armed Maoist opposition groups such as the [[JTMM]] during and after the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. The negotiated end to this war forced King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] to abdicate in 2008. Issues of ethnic and regional equity have tended to dominate the agenda of the new republican government and continue to be divisive. Today, even after the end of a 10-year-old Maoist conflict, the upper caste dominates every field in Nepal. Specifically, Brahmin and Chhetri (Indo-Aryan) have advantage everywhere. Although Newars are low in numbers, their urban living habitat gives them a competitive advantage. Thus, Newars are the toppers in Human Development Index. From a [[Gender inequality in Nepal|gender perspective]], Newari women are the most literate and lead in every sector. Brahmins and Chhetris' women have experienced less social and economic mobility compared to Newari women. Specifically, Brahmin women experience less equality due to their predominately rural living conditions which deprives them of access to certain educational and healthcare advantages.&lt;ref name=OCHA1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 12 |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113112940/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCHA2&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2E89F2121C2C57A24925733F000F4F21-Full_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 16 |date=July–August 2007 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OCHA3&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal – Situation Overview |volume=Issue 30 |date=June–July 2008 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218090410/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Him-ext"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&amp;NewsID=266104 |title=Body of murder victim found in Gulmi |publisher=The Himalayan Times online |location=Gulmi |first=Hari |last=Sharma |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2011-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525142109/http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&amp;NewsID=266104 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hatlebakk07&gt;{{cite web|last=Hatlebakk |first=Magnus |year=2007 |title=Economic and social structures that may explain the recent conflicts in the Terai of Nepal |location=[[Kathmandu]] |publisher=Norwegian Embassy |url=http://www.norway.org.np/NR/rdonlyres/0993F5660B3548A98F819167B4FD596C/72944/http___wwwcmi.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the years of 2001 to 2006, there were 7,500 applications for student visas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Nepalese in Hong Kong ===
{{Main|South Asians in Hong Kong}}
The Nepali people residing in Hong Kong are primarily made up of children of ex-[[Gurkha]]s; born in Hong Kong during their parents' service with the [[British Army]]'s [[Brigade of Gurkhas]], which was based in Hong Kong from the 1970s until the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover]]. Large groups of Nepali people can be found in [[Shek Kong]] and [[Yuen Long District]] off of the main bases of the British army. Many ex-Gurkhas remained in Hong Kong after the end of their service under the sponsorship of their Hong Kong-born children, who held [[Right of abode issue, Hong Kong|right of abode]].

Nepalese of middle age or older generations in Hong Kong are predominantly found in [[security]], while those of younger generations are predominantly found in the business industry.

Mostly the people from [[Kirati]] [[ethnic groups]] such as [[Rai (ethnic group)|Rai]] and [[Limbu]] are the ones residing in [[Hong Kong]] and other neighbouring nations such as [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]]

=== Nepalese overseas ===
Nepalese migrants abroad have suffered tremendous hardships, including some 7,500 deaths in the [[Middle East]] and [[Malaysia]] alone since the year 2000, some 3,500 in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/01/07/top-story/natural-deaths-raise-doubts/383506.html|title='Natural deaths’ raise doubts|work=ekantipur.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prevention is becoming increasingly important. Dental related diseases are largely preventable and there is a growing burden on health care systems for cure. Dental public health looks beyond the role of a dental practitioner in treating dental disease, and seeks to reduce demand on health care systems by redirection of resources to priority areas.&lt;ref name=DBTW2017&gt;Daly B, Batchelor P, Treasure E, Watt R. Essential Dental Public Health. 2nd ed. Great Britain: Oxford; 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Countries around the world all face similar issues in relation to dental disease. Implementation of policies and principles vary due to available of resources. Similar to  [[public health]], an understanding of the many factors that influence [[health]] will assist the implementation of effective strategies.&lt;ref name=DBTW2017 /&gt;

Public health dentistry, is practiced generally through government sponsored programs, which are for the most part directed toward public-school children in the belief that their education in [[oral hygiene]] is the best way to reach the general public. The pattern for such programs in the past was a dental practitioners annual visit to a school to lecture and to demonstrate proper tooth-brushing techniques. The 1970s saw the emergence of a more elaborate program that included a week of one-hour sessions of instruction, demonstration, and questions and answers, conducted by a dentist and a dental assistant and aided by a teacher who had previously been given several hours of instruction. Use was also made of televised dental health education programs, which parents were encouraged to observe.&lt;ref name=TD&gt;Tyack D. Health and social services in public schools: Historical perspectives. The Future of Children. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

There seems to be a lot more that can be done to help individuals prevent [[tooth decay]] and gum disease based on what is already known.
[[File:Dental Caries Cavity 2.JPG|thumb|Dental Caries Cavity 2]]
Even with [[water fluoridation|fluoridation]] and [[oral hygiene]], [[tooth decay]] is still the most common diet–related disease affecting many people. Tooth decay has the economic impact of [[cardiovascular disease|heart disease]], [[obesity]] and [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].&lt;ref name=LGMM&gt;Listl S, Galloway J, Mossey PA, Marcenes W. Global economic impact of dental diseases. Journal of Dental Research. 2015 28:0022034515602879&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dental decay]] is however easily prevented by reducing [[acid]] demineralisation caused by the remaining [[dental plaque]] left on teeth after brushing. Risk factors for [[tooth decay]] include physical, biological, environmental, behavioural, and lifestyle-related factors such as high numbers of cariogenic [[bacteria]], inadequate salivary flow, insufficient [[fluoride]] exposure, poor [[oral hygiene]], inappropriate methods of feeding infants, and poverty.' &lt;ref name=SIP&gt;Selwitz RH, Ismail AI, Pitts NB. Dental caries. The Lancet. 2007 Jan 12;369(9555):51-9&lt;/ref&gt; Neutralising acids after eating and at least twice a day brushing with fluoridated toothpaste will assist prevention.

[[tooth decay|Cavities]] can develop on any surface of a [[tooth]], but are most common inside the pits and fissures in grooves on chewing surfaces. This is where the toothbrush bristles and [[fluoride]] toothpaste cannot reach effectively.&lt;ref name=KR&gt;Kluss R. What Causes Tooth Decay? [Internet]. Absolute Smile. 2015 [cited 3 May 2017]. Available from: http://www.absolutesmile.com/what-causes-tooth-decay/&lt;/ref&gt;

Gum diseases [[gingivitis]] and [[periodontitis]] are caused by certain types of [[bacteria]] that accumulate in remaining [[dental plaque]]. The extent of [[gum disease]] depends a lot on host susceptibility.&lt;ref name=AL&gt;Axelsson P, Lindhe J. Effect of controlled oral hygiene procedures on caries and periodontal disease in adults. Journal of clinical periodontology. 1981 Jun 1;8(3):239-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Daily brushing must include brushing of both the [[tooth|teeth]] and [[gums]]. Effective brushing itself, will prevent progression of both [[dental decay]] and [[gum disease]]s. Neutralising acids after eating and at least twice a day brushing with [[fluoride|fluoridated]] toothpaste will assist preventing [[dental decay]]. Stimulating [[saliva]] flow assists in the [[Remineralisation of teeth|remineralisation]] process of [[tooth|teeth]], this can be done by chewing sugar free gum.&lt;ref name=SIP /&gt; Using an interdental device once daily will assist prevention of [[gum disease]]s.&lt;ref name=AL /&gt;

[[Dental sealant|Fissure sealants]] applied over the chewing surfaces of [[tooth|teeth]], block [[dental plaque|plaque]] from being trapped inside pits and fissures. The sealants make brushing more effective and prevent acid demineralisation and [[tooth decay]].&lt;ref name=BCCDFGIKSS&gt;Beauchamp J, Caufield PW, Crall JJ, Donly K, Feigal R, Gooch B, Ismail A, Kohn W, Siegal M, Simonsen R. Evidence-based clinical recommendations for the use of pit-and-fissure sealants: a report of the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs. The Journal of the American Dental Association. 2008 Mar 31;139(3):257-68&lt;/ref&gt; A diet low in fermentable carbohydrates will reduce the buildup of plaque on teeth.&lt;ref name=SIP /&gt;

===Dental Public Health Competencies===
[http://www.aaphd.org/abdph/ The American Board of Dental Public Health (ABDPH)] have devised a list of competencies for dental public health specialists to follow.&lt;ref name=AM&gt;Altman D, Mascarenhas A. New competencies for the 21st century dental public health specialist. Journal of Public Health Dentistry. 2016;76:S18-S28&lt;/ref&gt; Dental public health specialists are a select group of certified dentists. The 10 competencies allow for growth and learning of individuals and set expectations for the future. An advantage of the design is that they are implementable on a global level. The list is updated periodically.&lt;ref name=AM /&gt;

=== Scope of the Dental Public Health ===
Major areas of dental public health activity include:

*Oral health surveillance
National Oral Health Surveillance system (NOHSS) is designed to monitor the effects of oral disease on the population, as well as monitor how the oral care is delivered. Additionally the status of water fluoridation on both a state and a national level is continually supervised &lt;ref name=OHS&gt;CDC. National Oral Health Surveillance System (NOHSS) [Internet]. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2017 [cited 7 May 2017]. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealthdata/overview/nohss.html&lt;/ref&gt;

*Assessing the evidence on oral health and dental interventions, programmes, and services
*Policy and strategy development and implementation
*Oral health improvement
* Health and public protection
*Developing and monitoring quality dental services
*Dental public health intelligence
*Academic dental public health 
*Role within health services 
&lt;ref&gt;Gulliford M, Tan CC, Karim QA, editors. Oxford textbook of global public health. Oxford University Press, USA; 2015 Feb 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of Dental Public Health==
Dental health is concerned with promoting [[health]] of an entire population and focuses on an action at a community level, rather than at an individual clinical approach. Dental public health is a broad subject that seeks to expand the range of factors that influences peoples oral health and the most effective means of preventing and treating these oral health problems.&lt;ref name=DBTW2017/&gt;

=== Criteria to determine a public health problem ===
To allow a health problem to be properly managed, it is important that there is a set of rules or criteria to follow which determines what is defined as a public health problem and what is the best way to manage health problems in communities. The following are questions should be considered when addressing public health problems:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!What is the prevalence of the condition?

|-
|What is the prevalence of the health problem?

|-
|Is the disease widespread?

|-
|Who has the disease?

|-
|What percentage of the population is affected?

|-
|What is the distribution of the disease within the community?

|-
|Is the prevalence increasing or decreasing?

|} &lt;ref name=DBTW2017 /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!What is the impact of the condition on an individual level?

|-
|How severe are the effects of the disease on the patient?

|-
|Do  people die because of it?

|-
|Do they suffer pain, discomfort or loss of function?

|-
|Can they perform their normal social roles?

|-
|Are they prevented from going to school or becoming employed because of their problem?

|-
|}
&lt;ref name=DBTW2017 /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!What is the impact on the wider society?

|-
|What are the costs to the health service of treating the condition?

|-
|How much time do people take off work to get treatment and care?

|-
|What effects does the condition have on economic performance and productivity of the country?

|}
&lt;ref name=DBTW2017 /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!What conditions are preventable and effective treatments available?

|-
|Is the natural history of the disease fully understood?

|-
|Can the early stages of the conditions be recognised?

|-
|If so, are there interventions that can be implemented to stop the disease progressing?

|-
|If it does progress, are there effective treatments available?

|}
&lt;ref name=DBTW2017 /&gt;

Once these questions have been answered, the way a public health problem is acted upon to protect a population can be determined.

==Approaches to Prevention==
===Fluoridation of drinking water===

[[Water fluoridation]] is the implementation of artificial [[fluoride]] in public water supplies with the intentions to halt the progression of dental diseases.&lt;ref name="FLU1"&gt;[http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v199/n7s/full/4812863a.html]. Mullen J. History of Water Fluoridation. BDJ. 2005;199:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Fluoride has the ability to interfere with the demineralisation and remineralisation process that occurs on the tooth surface and improves the mineral intake when the pH level may reduce below the neutral pH level.&lt;ref name=FLU2&gt;Fejerskov O, Nyvad B, Kidd E. Dental caries. 1st ed. Chichester, West Sussex: Wiley Blackwell; 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

This achievement was implemented through the public health development in the 19th, 20th century and led into the 21st century. Research into the effects of [[fluoride]] on [[tooth|teeth]] began due to the concern about the presence of [[dental fluorosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Capper S. Silent Victories: The History and Practice of Public Health in Twentieth-Century America. Inquiry. 2007;44(1):128-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many clinical case trials occurred in the beginning of the 20th century. However, the very first clinical trial to have occurred dates back to the 19th century when Denninger conducted a trial prescribing children and pregnant women with [[calcium fluoride]].&lt;ref name=FLU2/&gt; From this trial it was recognised [[fluoride| fluoride’s]] significance on [[Human tooth|tooth tissue]] and from this point, many clinical trials were conducted &lt;ref name=FLU1 /&gt;
Following these studies, the recognition of the positive outcome on dental tissues became clear and projects in water fluoridation became of significant importance.

The development of artificial [[water fluoridation]] began in 1945 in the Grand rapid Michigan followed by Newburgh, New York and Evanston, Illinois.&lt;ref name=FLU3&gt;Lennon M. One-in-a-million; the first community trial of water fluoridation. Bulletin of the World Health Organization. 2006;84(9):759-760.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 three towns Watford, Kilmarnock and Anglesey trialled the water fluoridation implementation scheme.&lt;ref name=FLU1 /&gt; In 1960 the Republic of Ireland implemented all public water supplies with artificial fluoridated water and four years later extending this into the main cities of Dublin and Cork.&lt;ref name=FLU1 /&gt;

Currently, 40 countries have fluoridated water schemes implemented. [[Fluoridation by country|Fluoride]] is still yet to be completely implemented across the full population however, progress is slowly improving and access is becoming more common.&lt;ref name=FLU1/&gt;

|}&lt;ref name=FLU1/&gt;

===Career opportunities focusing on prevention===

Prevention methods such as oral health promotion began with the education of clinicians and the population in the health promotion strategies. Since the mid 19th century oral health practice has revolved more around prevention and education rather than treatment of disease.&lt;ref name=FLU5&gt;Satur J. The development of the dental therapy profession. The Australian Dental and Oral Health Therapists. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This education can be focused towards dental practitioners and to the wider population who may interested.

There has been a change in focus in the education of developing clinicians all over the world. The first dental school was developed in 1828 &lt;ref&gt;Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1217–1218.&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by an ever-growing field of practice. The dental practice began with its main focus on the treatment of oral disease and branched into a wide scope of practice with many dental occupations involved.

The most common form of dental clinicians are either general [[dentists]], oral health therapists, [[dental therapist]]s and [[dental hygienist]]. When desired, some of these clinicians may seek further experience in projects that may assist the dental public system in bringing further awareness to prevention of dental diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Dental Hygienist [Internet]. Ada.org. 2017 [cited 3 May 2017]. Available from: http://www.ada.org/en/education-careers/careers-in-dentistry/dental-team-careers/dental-hygienist&lt;/ref&gt;

Oral health prevention is the current form of practice of many clinicians. As education in oral care to the population is now believed to be the superior solution rather than the treatment of disease. Dental university education now develops clinicians to focus on the education of patients, education of the community and a wider population using different approaches.&lt;ref name=FLU5/&gt;

==Approaches to Promotion==
Oral Health Promotion outlines the strategies for improving and educating the general public about how they can better take improve and maintain their current oral health. Oral health promotion is part of both government and private incentives to create a healthier and better educated generation of individuals.&lt;ref name=OH2&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). (2009). Milestones in Health Promotion Statements from Global Conferences [Internet]. [cited 5 April 2017]. Available from: http://www.who.int/healthpromotion/Milestones_Health_Promotion_05022010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the nine key principles involved for oral health promotion: 
&lt;ref name="OH1"&gt;Daly B, Batchelor P, Treasure E, Watt R. Essential Dental Public Health. 2nd ed. 2017. [cited 5 April 2017].  Great Britain: Oxford, pp.102.  Available from: [https://books.google.com.au/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zObt2ptZx-UC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=dental+public+health&amp;ots=c2z_HOHKVC&amp;sig=erhkcDbQV7FUO-rV85ItyBGG4ro#v=onepage&amp;q=dental%20public%20health&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Empowerment ||  Individuals, groups and communities are given the ability to exercise more control over the personal, socioeconomics, and environmental factors through interventions that affect their oral health.
|-
| Participatory ||Key stakeholders that are invested in the intervention program should be actively participating in the stages of planning, implementing and evaluating interventions.
|-
| Holistic || Common risks and conditions of oral health, general health and inequalities should be taken into consideration of a broad intervention approach.
|-
| Inter-sectoral || Collaboration between all relevant agencies and sectors is paramount as it allows oral health improvement to be implemented upon the wider public health agenda.
|-
| Equity || It is important to place an emphasis on Oral health inequalities when planning interventions for oral health improvement. 
|-
| Evidence base || Future interventions of oral health improvement should be implemented through existing knowledge of effectiveness and good practice of oral health.
|-
| Sustainable || The measures of whether individuals, groups and communities of achieving long-term oral health improvement can be maintained. 
|-
| Multi-strategy || It is imperative to perform a range of complementary actions such as health public policies, community development and environmental change in order to address the underlying determinants of oral health.
|-
| Evaluation || Adequate resources in conjunction with suitable methods should be present for effective assessment of oral health interventions.
|} &lt;ref name=OH1 /&gt;

There are three important way in achieving oral health promotion, which is done by addressing the determinants of oral health, community participation, and implementing a strategy approach that involves a range of complementary actions.&lt;ref name=OH1 /&gt;

'''Determinants of oral health'''

Oral health promotion focuses on individual behaviour, the [[Socioeconomic status]] and environmental factors. Underlying determinants that can also impact oral health, including non-milk extrinsic sugars consumption, alcohol consumption and smoking behaviour.&lt;ref name=OH1 /&gt;

The ability to remove [[dental plaque]], exposure to [[fluoride]] and access to quality dental care can affect the ways the aforementioned underlying factors are and can be modified to the needs of the individual to obtain optimum oral health.&lt;ref name=OH1 /&gt; Ways in which oral health promotion can minimise the effects of these determinants;
*	Promoting healthy eating.
*	Teaching effective oral hygiene practices.
*	Promoting the use of topical fluoride for preventing and control of [[dental decay|dental caries]].
*	Facilitating early access to preventative dental services.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. Promoting Oral Health A toolkit to assist the development, planning, implementation and evaluation of oral health promotion in New Zealand. New Zealand: Ministry of Health; 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also important to note that these factors are also influenced by socio-political considerations that are outside the control of most individuals.&lt;ref name=OH1 /&gt;

Community participation is a key factor in oral health promotion. Inter-sectoral collaboration is where relevant agencies and sectors are involved in partnership to identify key oral health issues and to implement new methods to improve oral health.&lt;ref name=OH1 /&gt;

The [[World Health Organization]] has agreed on a health promotion approach as the foundation for oral health improvement strategies and policies for the population. Oral health promotion is based on the principles of the framework, [[Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion|Ottawa Charter]]. There are five areas of action outlined to achieve oral health promotion; building Health public policy, creating supportive environment, strengthening community action, developing personal skills, re-orienting healthcare services.&lt;ref name=OH2 /&gt;

== Research studies on dental public health issues ==

=== Oral Health in Care Homes ===
A study investigating the efficacy of staff workers' oral care education on improving the oral health of care home residents found that despite the education and training of care workers, certain ongoing barriers prevented them from conducting the necessary daily oral hygiene care for the residents. The most frequently listed obstacles to care included the residents' bad breath, inadequate time to perform oral care and uncooperative residents who do not perceive the need for oral care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Le|first=Phu|last2=Dempster|first2=Laura|last3=Limeback|first3=Hardy|last4=Locker|first4=David|date=November 2012|title=Improving residents' oral health through staff education in nursing homes|journal=Special Care in Dentistry|volume=32|issue=6|pages=242–250|doi=10.1111/j.1754-4505.2012.00279.x|issn=1754-4505|pmid=23095067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autonomous Region of Madeira - Portugal ===
In 1985 three dentists with the sponsorship of Colonel Joy Wheeler Dow, Jr., implemented an Oral Health Program in the Autonomous Region of [[Madeira]] with the aid of five assistants.

The four-year program reached 15,000 children around the main island and Porto Santo and it included Oral Hygiene Instruction classes, informative literature including films, fortnightly fluoride mouth-rinse and daily fluoride tables with the collaboration of the school teachers.

During this period a study was undertaken using the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Combined Oral Health Assessment (CPTIN) plan resulting in the final report where it was found that there had been a decrease of 44% in the need for fillings, 40% decrease in the need for extractions, whilst the caries free children population grew from the initial 1% to 5%.

==== National Health Service (NHS) Dentistry====
[[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service (NHS)]] is the name of the public health services of England, Scotland and Wales and is directly funded from [[tax]]ation. The dentistry services are available to all, regardless of wealth. In order to find a NHS dentist search [http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Dentist/LocationSearch/3 NHS Dentist Near You] Some clinics may not have the capacity to take on new patients so waiting lists may occur.&lt;ref name= UKPH&gt;NHS.

===Nepal===
Nepalese population is at a greater disadvantage than westernized societies in terms of oral health. The benefit of implementing health insurance is to assist a large number of people with similar risks by sharing funding.&lt;ref name=KGFK&gt;Knevel RJ, Gussy MG, Farmer J, Karimi L. Perception of Nepalese dental hygiene and dentistry students towards the dental hygienists profession. International journal of dental hygiene&lt;/ref&gt; In Nepal, implementing health insurance is difficult due to limited supply of finances.

'''Elaine Antoinette Parent''' (August 4, 1942 – April 6, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[crime|criminal]] known as "the world's most wanted woman" in the late nineties and early 2000s.

She was wanted for the murder of her potential roommate, Beverly McGowan, a 34-year-old bank clerk. McGowan had placed an ad in the paper looking for a roommate. A woman named "Alice" answered the ad. The woman was actually Parent. Soon after, McGowan disappeared; on July 19, 1990, her remains were found in a rural canal in [[St. Lucie County, Florida]]. She had been mutilated by removing a tattoo on her stomach, her head and hands to hinder the identification of her corpse but a small tattoo was enough to identify her.

The origin of Parent's nickname, the "Chameleon Killer," was a photograph of an oil painting of herself she sent to police with the message "Best wishes: your Chameleon" typed on the back. The nickname was apt as she stole the identities of her victims and was found to have used McGowan's credit cards after she killed her. She also scoured graveyards for names and dates of birth and stole the information of other potential roommates by telling them she was a numerologist, soliciting their social security numbers, driver's licences and even birth certificates.

When Florida police caught up with her in Panama City, Florida, on April 6, 2002, she committed suicide by shooting herself in the heart as they stood outside her bedroom door waiting for her to get dressed.

There have been concerns that in her time on the run she is likely to have committed other crimes.
Beverly McGowan's murder and the search for Elaine Parent were profiled on ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' and ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref name="Tate-2002"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tate |first=Tim |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1391705/Chameleon-Killer-cheats-the-Florida-police-by-ending-her-many-faced-life.html |title='Chameleon Killer' cheats the Florida police by ending her many-faced life |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2002-04-21 |accessdate=2010-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was featured on the [[Investigation Discovery]] program ''Swamp Murders.''

'''George Remus''' (November 14, 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=William A.|title=King Of The Bootleggers: A Biography of George Remus|year=2008|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co.|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=9780786436521|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmaXU8H3EUgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=George%20Remus&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; – January 20, 1952) was an American [[lawyer]] and [[rum-running|bootlegger]] during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] era. Remus was known to have referred to himself in the third person after his rise to power during the early days of Prohibition, which he reportedly continued to do until his death.&lt;ref name="rochin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rochlin|first=Margy|url= http://blogs.laweekly.com/squidink/2011/09/ken_burns_prohibition_bootlegg.php |title=Ken Burns' Prohibition: Bootleggers, Organized Crime + The Glamorization of Getting Blitzed|website=laweekly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that he was the inspiration for the title character [[Jay Gatsby]] in ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seelbachhilton.com/history_celebrities.html |title=Celebrities &amp; Ghosts |accessdate=2006-03-03 |publisher=Seelbach Hilton |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060215201629/http://www.seelbachhilton.com/history_celebrities.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Remus was born in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] in 1874 to Frank and Maria Remus. Remus' family moved to [[Chicago]] by the time he was 5. At age 14, George supported the family by working at his uncle's [[pharmacy]] because Remus' father was unable to work. Remus became a certified pharmacist at 19 years old after graduating from the [[Chicago College of Pharmacy]] and bought the pharmacy at age 21.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, William A.. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=98 "George Remus."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified July 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within five years, Remus expanded, buying another drugstore. Remus soon tired of the pharmacy business and by 24, he had become a lawyer.

==Legal and bootlegging careers==
Remus attended the Illinois College of Law (later merged with [[DePaul University College of Law]]) and was admitted to the Illinois Bar in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/details/benchbarofillino00henniala&lt;/ref&gt;  Remus specialized in [[defense (legal)|criminal defense]], especially murder, and became rather famous. By 1920, Remus was earning $50,000 a year (approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1920|r=-3}}}} today), a vast sum at the time.

Alcohol [[Prohibition]] began on January 17, 1920 with ratification of the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment]], and within a few months Remus saw that his criminal clients were becoming very wealthy very quickly. He decided to become a criminal himself, using his knowledge of the law to escape punishment.

Remus memorized the [[Volstead Act]] and found loopholes whereby he could buy distilleries and pharmacies to sell "bonded" liquor to himself under government licenses for medicinal purposes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}} Remus's employees would then hijack his own liquor so that he could sell it illegally.  Remus moved to [[Cincinnati]], in the region of the country where 80 percent of America's bonded whiskey was located, and bought up most of the whiskey manufacturers. In less than three years Remus made $40 million with the help of his trusted number two man [[George Conners]]. Remus owned many of America's most famous distilleries, including the Fleischmann Distillery, which Remus bought for $197,000, a price which included 3,100 gallons of whiskey.{{citation needed|date=July 2017|reason=This claim needs references to prove that it contains reliable and well sourced information that can be easily verified}} 

In addition to serving the Cincinnati community, many other small towns, such as [[Newport, Kentucky]], began serving as drinking towns where gamblers opened small casinos to entertain their drunken patrons.

One of Remus' fortified distilleries was the Death Valley Farm, which he purchased from George Gehrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=William|title=King Of The Bootleggers: A Biography of George Remus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmaXU8H3EUgC&amp;pg=PA60&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;dq=Death+Valley+Farm&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aNPtB23RTm&amp;sig=srbF2OItny2EnXXwA6ho7AAPKQg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KEGGUOqPD-30iwKW_YCQBw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Death%20Valley%20Farm&amp;f=false|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outside world thought it was only accessible by dirt road.   The actual distillery was located at 2656 Queen City Ave.  The alcohol was distilled in the attic of the home then dumb-waitered below. The basement was where a trap door was located and a tunnel approximately fifty to 100 feet long and six feet under the earth.  The bootleggers would push the products along the tunnel out to a waiting car, usually making it safely away.  It is believed to be one of the only locations never busted in the Cincinnati area. In 1920, a raid by hijackers took place, but Remus' armed guards, led by John Gehrum, fired heavy volleys at the hijackers and, after a short fight, the wounded attackers left.

In addition to becoming the "King of the Bootleggers", Remus was known as a gracious host. He held many parties, including a 1923 birthday party for his wife Imogene in which she appeared in a daring bathing suit along with other aquatic dancers, serenaded by a fifteen-piece orchestra. Children in the area also saw Remus as a fatherly figure. Jack Doll recalls an episode in which Remus playfully tossed a boy into his Olympic-sized swimming pool and then gave him $10 to buy a new suit. Doll states that a full boy's suit could be purchased for one dollar in 1920.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Remus and his wife held a [[New Year's Eve]] party at their new mansion, nicknamed the Marble Palace, in 1922. The guests included one hundred couples from the most prestigious families in the area. As parting gifts, Remus presented all the men with diamond stickpins, and gave each guest's wife a brand new car. Remus held a similar party in June 1923, during his problems with the government, when he gave each female guest (of the fifty present) a brand new Pontiac.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
On July 20, 1899, Remus married Lillian Klauff. Their daughter, born in 1900, was [[Romola Remus]], who became a child actress in silent films,&lt;ref name=Folkart&gt;{{cite news

The marriage ended in divorce in 1920 after Remus began an affair with his legal secretary, Augusta Imogene Holmes (née Brown). Holmes was a young divorcée with a young daughter, Ruth. Remus and Holmes were married in [[Newport, Kentucky]] in June 1920.

==Legal issues==
In 1925, Remus' plan to use his legal knowledge to evade the law went awry. He was indicted for thousands of violations of the Volstead Act, convicted by a jury that made its decision in under two hours, and given a two-year federal prison sentence. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/prohibition/people/#detail=2085902832-remus |title=George Remus 1876-1937 |date=September 2011 |work=Prohibition: A Film by Ken Burns &amp; Lynn Novick |publisher=PBS |accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent two years in [[Atlanta Federal Penitentiary]] for bootlegging.&lt;ref name="haunted"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QMZ9eYhgWj8C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;lpg=PA66&amp;dq=%22Marble+Palace%22+%22price+hill%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BCTDwdHzLf&amp;sig=KhheaiK5NYTfxkId0XVxtO1y6r4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=sLSATuv1IaG_0QWNnoDDCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marble%20Palace%22%20%22price%20hill%22&amp;f=false Haunted Cincinnati and Southwest Ohio] by Jeff Morris, Michael A. Morris; Arcadia Publishing, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; While he was in prison, Remus befriended another inmate and eventually confided in him that his wife,
Imogene Holmes, had control over his money. The inmate was an undercover prohibition agent [[Franklin Dodge]], who was there to gather information of that sort.&lt;ref name="haunted" /&gt; Instead of reporting the information, Dodge resigned his job and began an affair with Remus' wife. Dodge and Holmes liquidated Remus' assets and hid as much of the money as possible, in addition to attempting to deport Remus, and even hiring a hit man to murder Remus for $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In late 1927, Imogene Holmes filed for divorce from Remus. On the way to court, on October 6, 1927, for the finalization of the divorce, Remus had his driver chase the cab carrying Holmes and her daughter through [[Eden Park (Cincinnati)|Eden Park]] in Cincinnati, finally forcing it off the road. Remus jumped out and fatally shot Imogene in the abdomen in front of the [[Spring House Gazebo]] to the horror of park onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMZ9eYhgWj8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=spring%20house%20gazebo%20cincinnati%20ghost&amp;pg=PA68#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Haunted Cincinnati and Southwest Ohio | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2009 | accessdate=2013-06-02 | author=Morris, Jeff | pages=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prosecutor in the case was 30-year-old [[Charles Phelps Taft II]], son of [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and former President [[William Howard Taft]] and brother of the future Senator [[Robert A. Taft]]. Although he had lost his last big case against another bootlegger, Taft was seen as a man with a bright political future. The trial made national headlines for a month, as Remus defended himself on the murder charge. Remus pleaded temporary insanity, and the jury deliberated only nineteen minutes before acquitting him.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/32031972/ ''The Escanaba Daily Press'', "REMUS FOUND NOT GUILTY OF MURDER JURY DELIBERATES 19 MINUTES; INSANITY IS PLEA" Page 1. December 21, 1927]&lt;/ref&gt; The State of Ohio then tried to commit Remus to an insane asylum since the jury found him insane, but prosecutors were thwarted by their previous claim (backed up by the prosecution's three well-known psychiatrists) that he could be tried for murder because he was not insane.

==Later years and death==
George Remus later moved to [[Covington, Kentucky]] (across the [[Ohio River]] from [[Cincinnati]]) where he lived out the next twenty years of his life modestly without incident. He married for a third and final time to his long time secretary Blanche Watson. Remus ran a small contracting firm, Washington Contracting, until he suffered a [[stroke]] in August 1950.&lt;ref name="chicago"&gt;{{cite news |title=George Remus, Whisky King of 20's, Dies At 79.

For the next two years, he lived in boarding house in Covington under the care of a nurse.

==In popular culture==
Remus is the subject of Craig Holden’s, ''The Jazz Bird A Novel'', Simon &amp; Schuster, June 2008 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Jazz-Bird/Craig-Holden/9781416572770&lt;/ref&gt;

Remus was featured in the 2011 [[Ken Burns]] documentary, [[Prohibition (miniseries)|''Prohibition'']]; texts written by Remus were read by [[Paul Giamatti]]. Remus has also been portrayed by [[Glenn Fleshler]] as a supporting character on [[HBO]]'s Prohibition-era series ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'' beginning in its second season. In this series, he is portrayed as having the quirk of referring to himself in the third person.&lt;ref name="rochin" /&gt;

In 2014, Queen City Whiskey started producing [[small batch bourbon]] and rye whiskeys named after George Remus. The whiskey was distilled locally and was introduced in liquor stores and select bars throughout the Cincinnati region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entrepreneur George Remus returns, whiskey in hand|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/money/josh-pichler/2014/08/16/entrepreneur-george-remus-returns-whiskey-hand/14011491/|website=Cincinnati.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mutand dAguila Joan Castejon Wax on Paper 1982 100x81.jpg|thumb|220px|'Mutant eagle', wax on paper, by Joan Castejon.]]
The Grup d' Elx artists began their training in an precarious artistic scenario. Its activity was a task that built a bridge between modernity and vertebrate and radical vanguard, which for them was inseparable from a social transition out of the [[Francoist]] dictatorship.  In this sense, as the members of El Paso  or [[Dau al set]], the artists of the Grup d' Elx conducted an art in which there are several components that are part of a common denominator: primacy of intense expressiveness, intentional reduction of color to a minimum and, finally, the belief in an artistic poetics of engagement centered on human beings and their social situation. In fact, one of its most representative members, [[Joan Castejón]], was imprisoned for four years.&lt;ref name="Así era entonces."&gt;{{cite news

The group was inspired by the activity of other postwar artistic groups such as [[Dau al Set]] and [[Grup Parpalló]]. Members of Grup d'Elx included [[Joan Castejón]], Albert Agulló, Antoni Coll y Sixto Marco.

The group dissolved in 1973.

'''Hector the Cat''' (also known as '''Hector Cat''', '''Hector the Road Safety Cat''' or simply '''Hector''') is a fictional [[cat]] and [[mascot]] created to aid the teaching of [[Road traffic safety|road safety]] to children in Australia. Educational material relating to the character was developed by the [[Department of Infrastructure and Transport|Australian Department of Transport]] in association with state and territory road authorities.&lt;ref name=maggs&gt;{{cite book|author=Maggs, Alex &amp; Margaret Brown|title=Primary School and Road Safety Curricula: A review of Australian Materials and practices|date=May 1986|publisher=Federal Office of Road Safety|isbn=0642513066 |url=http://www.infrastructure.gov.au/roads/safety/publications/1986/pdf/Child_Edu_5.pdf|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Hector's road safety song" became well known in Australia when it was shown as a public service announcement on television. The blue and yellow striped cat first appeared on a school calendar in 1971 with a storyline that he had lost eight of his [[Cat#History and mythology|nine lives]] due to "ignorance of road safety practices".&lt;ref name=maggs/&gt; This was followed by a short instructional film. In subsequent years other characters were introduced in calendars, instructional films, and [[comic book]]s including Millie, his girlfriend (1973), Uncle Tom (1974), Hector and Millie's three kittens (1975) and his space friend Ding Dong (1982).&lt;ref name=maggs/&gt;&lt;ref name=NMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Hector's Road Safety Calendar from 1982|work=Search our Collections

A study in 1978 found that, although children enjoyed the characters and stories, the material had a number of inadequacies. It stressed that road safety research findings and [[child development]] theory would need to be considered for any future development.&lt;ref name=maggs/&gt;&lt;ref name=henderson&gt;{{cite web|author=Henderson, Michael |title=Education, publicity and Training in Road Safety: A literature Review - Report No. 22 |date=November 1991 |publisher=Monash University Accident Research Centre |url=http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/reports/muarc022.pdf |accessdate=17 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706114650/http://www.monash.edu.au/muarc/reports/muarc022.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documentary depicts the social hygiene clinic in Angeles where hundreds of young women and children line up daily for health checks in primitive conditions.
Interviews with prostitutes, mama-sans, community workers, academics and clients expose the complexity of [[prostitution]] in two very different cultures.
The documentary also shows live footage of seventeen children (some as young as ten years old) are rescued from a local brothel in Angeles and caught disturbingly on film.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/thelens/program_160107.html CBC News: The Lens: Selling Sex in Heaven&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Hungarian people|ethnic Hungarians]] of [[Romania]] live in areas that were, before the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], parts of [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. Encompassed in a region known as [[Transylvania]], the most prominent of these areas is known generally as [[Székely Land]] ([[Ținutul Secuiesc]], [[Szekelyföld]]), where Hungarians comprise the majority of the population, comprising [[Harghita County|Harghita]] and [[Covasna County|Covasna]] counties and parts of [[Mureș County|Mureș]] county.&lt;ref name="insse3"/&gt; Transylvania also includes the historic regions of [[Banat]], [[Crișana]] and [[Maramureș region|Maramureș]]. There are forty-one [[counties of Romania]]; Hungarians form a large majority of the population in the counties of [[Harghita County|Harghita]] (85.21%) and [[Covasna County|Covasna]] (73.74%), and a large percentage in [[Mureș County|Mureș]] (38.09%), [[Satu Mare County|Satu Mare]] (34.65%), [[Bihor County|Bihor]] (25.27%), [[Sălaj County|Sălaj]] (23.35%) and [[Cluj County|Cluj]] (15.93%) counties.

=== Historical background ===
{{Main article|History of Transylvania}}
[[File:Kingdom of Hungary 1102.jpg|thumb|left|300x300px|Transylvania as a part of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary]]
The [[Hungarian tribes]] originated in the vicinity of the Ural Mountains, arrived in the territory formed by present-day Romania during the 9th century from [[Etelköz]] or ''Atelkuzu'' (roughly the space occupied by the present day Southern [[Ukraine]], the [[Republic of Moldova]] and the Romanian province of Moldavia).&lt;ref&gt;Constantine Porphyrogenitus: [[De Administrando Imperio]], edited by Gy. Moravcsik and translated by R. J. H. Jenkins, Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies, Washington D. C., 1993 pp. 175)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to various circumstances (see [[Hungarian prehistory#The Landtaking (Honfoglalás)|Honfoglalás]]), the Magyar tribes crossed the Carpathians around 895 AD and occupied the [[Carpathian Basin]] (including present-day [[Transylvania]]) without significant resistance from the local populace.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Jr., John V. A. (1994). The Early Medieval Balkans - A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century. The University of Michigan Press. p. 139. {{ISBN|0-472-08149-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise date of the conquest of Transylvania is not known; the earliest Magyar artifacts found in the region are dated to the first half of the 10th century. While the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] emerged around 1000 AD the conquest of Transylvania was not completed until the late 12th century according to a historical theory.

In 1526, at the [[Battle of Mohács]], the forces of the [[Ottoman Empire]] annihilated the Hungarian army and in 1571 Transylvania became an autonomous state, under the Ottoman [[suzerainty]]. The [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]] was governed by its princes and its parliament (Diet). The Transylvanian Diet consisted of three Estates ([[Unio Trium Nationum]]): the Hungarian nobility (largely ethnic Hungarian nobility and clergy); the leaders of Transylvanian [[Saxons]]—German burghers; and the free [[Székely]] Hungarians.

With the defeat of the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683, the [[Habsburg Empire]] gradually began to impose their rule on the formerly autonomous Transylvania. From 1711 onward, after the conclusion of [[Rákóczi's War for Independence]], Habsburg control over Transylvania was consolidated, and the princes of Transylvania were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Transylvania"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/603323/Transylvania |title=Transylvania |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=7 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1765 the ''Grand Principality of Transylvania'' was proclaimed, consolidating the special separate status of Transylvania within the Habsburg Empire, established by the ''[[Diploma Leopoldinum]]'' in 1691.&lt;ref name="Britannica-Leopoldinum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1459175/Diploma-Leopoldinum|title=Diploma Leopoldinum - Transylvanian history|website=Britannica.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian historiography sees this as a mere formality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=John Hunyadi: Hungary in American History Textbooks |url=http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/hunyadi/hu03.htm |work=Andrew L. Simon |publisher=Corvinus Library Hungarian History |accessdate=7 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090820003355/http://www.hungarian-history.hu/lib/hunyadi/hu03.htm |archivedate=20 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Habsburg Empire, Transylvania was administratively part of [[Kingdom of Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Britannica-Transylvania" /&gt;

After quashing the [[1848 revolution]], the Habsburg Empire imposed a repressive regime on Hungary and ruled Transylvania directly through a military governor. Habsburgs abolished the Unio Trium Nationum and granted citizenship to ethnic Romanians. However, in the compromise ([[Ausgleich]]) of 1867, which established the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the special status of Transylvania ended and it became a province under the control of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Hungarian becomes the official language and a policy of [[Magyarization]] was applied to the various ethnic groups in Transylvania.

Following defeat in [[World War I]], Austria-Hungary disintegrated. The [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] majority in Transylvania elected representatives, who then proclaimed [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Union with Romania]] on 1 December 1918.
[[File:TransylvaniaProper.png|thumb|right|Map of Romania with "Transylvania proper" in bright yellow]]
With the conclusion of World War I, the [[Treaty of Versailles]], formally signed in June 1919, recognized the sovereignty of [[Kingdom of Romania]] over Transylvania as a historic fact. The Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|St. Germain]] (1919) and [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]] (signed on June 1920) further elaborated the status of Transylvania and defined the new border between the states of [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. As a result, the more than 1.5 million Hungarian minority of Transylvania found itself becoming a minority group within Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Kovrig, Bennett (2000), Partitioned nation: Hungarian minorities in Central Europe, in: Michael Mandelbaum (ed.), The new European Diasporas: National Minorities and Conflict in Eastern Europe, New York: Council on Foreign Relations Press, pp. 19-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1940, during the Second World War, the northern half of Transylvania was annexed to Hungary by the second [[Second Vienna Award]]. Historian Keith Hitchins&lt;ref&gt;Hitchins, Keith (1994), Rumania: 1866-1947 (Oxford History of Modern Europe). Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the situation created by the award: ''Some 1,150,000 to 1,300,000 Romanians, or 48 per cent to over 50 per cent of the population of the ceded territory, depending upon whose statistics are used, remained north of the new frontier, while about 500,000 Hungarians (other Hungarian estimates go as high as 800,000, Romanian as low as 363,000) continued to reside in the south.''
The [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] (1947) after the end of the Second World War overturned the Vienna Award, and the territory of northern Transylvania was returned to Romania. The post-World War II borders with Hungary agreed on at the Treaty of Paris were identical with those set out in 1920.

After the war, in 1952, a [[Magyar Autonomous Region]] was created in Romania by the communist authorities. The region was dissolved in 1968, when a new administrative organization of the country (still in effect today) replaced regions with counties. The communist authorities, and especially after [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s regime came to power, restarted the policy of [[Romanianization]].


Today, "Transylvania proper" (bright yellow on the accompanying map) is included within the Romanian counties (''[[județ]]e'') of [[Alba (county)|Alba]], [[Bistrița-Năsăud]], [[Brașov County|Brașov]], [[Cluj County|Cluj]], [[Covasna County|Covasna]], [[Harghita]], [[Hunedoara County|Hunedoara]], [[Mureș County|Mureș]], [[Sălaj County|Sălaj]] (partially) and [[Sibiu County|Sibiu]]. In addition to "Transylvania proper", modern Transylvania includes [[Crișana]] and part of the [[Banat]]; these regions (dark yellow on the map) are in the counties of [[Arad County|Arad]], [[Bihor County|Bihor]], [[Caraș-Severin County|Caraș-Severin]], [[Maramureș County|Maramureș]], [[Sălaj County|Sălaj]] (partially), [[Satu Mare County|Satu Mare]], and [[Timiș County|Timiș]].

===Post-communist era===
[[File:Szekely04.png|thumb|300px|Ethnic map of Harghita, Covasna, and Mureș Counties based on the 2011 data, showing localities with Hungarian majority or plurality.]]
In the aftermath of the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]], ethnic-based political parties were constituted by both the Hungarians, who founded the [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]], and by the Romanian Transylvanians, who founded the [[Romanian National Unity Party]]. Ethnic conflicts, however, never occurred on a significant scale, even though some violent clashes, such as the [[Ethnic clashes of Târgu Mureș|Târgu Mureș events of March 1990]], did take place shortly after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|fall of Ceaușescu regime]].

In 1995, a basic treaty on the relations between Hungary and Romania was signed. In the treaty, Hungary renounced all territorial claims to Transylvania, and Romania reiterated its respect for the rights of its minorities. Relations between the two countries improved as Romania and Hungary became EU members in the 2000s.

== Politics ==
The [[Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania]] (UDMR) is the major representative of Hungarians in Romania, and is a member of the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]]. The aim of the UDMR is to achieve local government, cultural and territorial autonomy and the right to self-determination for Hungarians. UDMR is a member of the [[European Democrat Union]] (EDU) and the [[European People's Party]] (EPP). Since 1996, the UDMR has been a member or supporter of every governmental coalition.

Political agreements have brought the gradual implementation of Hungarian language in everyday life: Public administration Law 215/2002 stipulates "the use of national minority languages in public administration in settlements where minorities exceed 20% of the population"; minority ethnics will receive a copy of the documents in Romanian language and a translation in their language; however, official documents are preserved by the local administration in Romanian only; local administration will provide inscriptions for the names of localities and public institutions under their authority, and display public interest announcements in the native language of the citizens of the respective ethnic minority under the same 20% rule.

Even though Romania co-signed the European laws for protecting minorities' rights, the implementation has not proved satisfactory to all members of Hungarian community. There is a movement by Hungarians both for an increase in autonomy and distinct cultural development. Initiatives proposed by various Hungarian political organizations include the creation of an "autonomous region" in the counties that form the ''Szekler region'' (''[[Székelyföld]]''), roughly corresponding to the territory of the former [[Hungarian Autonomous Province]] as well as the historical Szekler land that had been abolished by the Hungarian government in the second half of the 19th century, and the re-establishment of an independent state-funded Hungarian-language university.

However, the situation of the Hungarian minority in Romania has been seen as a model of cultural and ethnic diversity in the Balkan area:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47de378f1a.html|title=Refworld - Romania: Ethnic Hungarians (January 2001 - January 2006)|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|website=Unhcr.org|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an address to the American people, President Clinton asked in the midst of the air war in Kosovo: ''Who is going to define the future of this part the world... [[Slobodan Milošević]], with his propaganda machine and paramilitary forces which compel people to give up their country, identity, and property, or a state like Romania which has built a democracy respecting the rights of ethnic minorities?''&lt;ref&gt;Tom Gallagher, "Modern Romania: the end of communism, the failure of democratic reform, and the theft of a nation", p. 216, NYU Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ethnic background of Csango is nevertheless disputed, since, due to its active connections to the neighboring [[History of Poland|Polish kingdom]] and to the [[Papal States]], the Roman Catholic faith persisted in [[Moldavia]] throughout medieval times, long after [[Vlachs]] living in other Romanian provinces, closer to the [[Bulgarian Empire]], had been completely converted to [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern-Rite]] Christianity. Some Csango claim having Hungarian ancestry while others claim Romanian ancestry. The Hungarian-speaking Csangos have been subject to some violations of basic minority rights: Hungarian-language schools have been closed down over time, their political rights have been suppressed and they have even been subject to slow, forced nationalisation by various Romanian governments over the years, because the Romanian official institutions deem Csangos as a mere Romanian population that was Magyarized in certain periods of time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Culture ==
The number of Hungarian social and cultural organizations in Romania has greatly increased after the fall of communism, with more than 300 being documented a few years ago.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} There are also several puppet theatres.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Professional Hungarian dancing in Romania is represented by the [[Maros Folk Ensemble]] (formerly State Szekler Ensemble) in Târgu-Mureș, the [[Hargita Ensemble]], and the [[Pipacsok Dance Ensemble]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} Other amateur popular theaters are also very important in preserving the cultural traditions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

While in the past the import of books was hindered, now there are many bookstores selling books written in Hungarian. Two public TV stations, [[TVR1]] and [[TVR2]], broadcast several Hungarian programs with good audiences also from Romanians.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} This relative scarcity is partially compensated by private Hungarian-language television and radio stations, like [[Duna TV|DUNA-TV]] which is targeted for the Hungarian minorities outside Hungary, particularly Transylvania. A new TV station entitled "Transylvania" is scheduled to start soon, the project is funded mostly by Hungary but also by Romania and EU and other private associations. There are currently around 60 Hungarian-language press publications receiving state support from the Romanian Government. While their numbers dropped as a consequence of economic liberalisation and competition, there are many others private funded by different Hungarian organizations. The [[Székely Land|Székely Region]] has many touristic facilities that attract Hungarian and other foreign tourists.

== Education ==
According to Romania's minority rights law, Hungarians have the right to education in their native language, including as a [[medium of instruction]]. In localities where they make up more than 20% of the population they have the right to use their native language with local authorities.

According to the official data of the 1992 Romanian census, 98% of the total ethnic Hungarian population over the age of 12 has had some schooling (primary, secondary or tertiary), ranking them fourth among ethnic groups in Romania and higher than the national average of 95.3%. On the other hand, the ratio of Hungarians graduating from higher education is lower than the national average. The reasons are diverse, including a lack of enough native-language lecturers, particularly in areas without a significant proportion of Hungarians.

At [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Babeș-Bolyai University Cluj-Napoca]], the largest state-funded tertiary education institution in Romania, more than 30% of courses are held in the [[Hungarian language]]. There is currently a proposal by local Hungarians, supported by the [[Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania]] (RMDSZ), to separate the Hungarian-language department from the institution, and form a new, Hungarian-only Bolyai University. The former Bolyai University was disbanded in 1959 by [[Communist Romania|Romanian Communist authorities]] and united with the Romanian Babeș University to form the multilingual Babeș-Bolyai University that continues to exist today.

== Identity and citizenship ==
Many Hungarians living in Transylvania were disconcerted when the referendum held in Hungary in 2004 on the issue of giving dual-citizenship to ethnic Hungarians living abroad failed to receive enough electoral attendance and the vote was uncertain. Some of them complain that when they are in Hungary, they are perceived as half-Romanians, and are considered as having differences in language and behaviour. However, a large proportion of Transylvanian Hungarians currently work or study in Hungary, usually on a temporary basis. After 1996, Hungarian-Romanian economic relations boomed, and Hungary is an important investor in Transylvania, with many cross-border firms employing both Romanians and Hungarians.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

A proposal supported by the [[RMDSZ]] to grant Hungarian citizenship to Hungarians living in Romania but without meeting Hungarian-law residency requirements was narrowly defeated at a 2004 referendum in Hungary (the referendum failed only because there were not enough votes to make it valid).&lt;ref name="Brubaker2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogers Brubaker|title=Nationalist Politics and Everyday Ethnicity in a Transylvanian Town|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zgg6eqKKkbcC&amp;pg=PA328|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12834-4|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the failed vote, the leaders of the Hungarian ethnic parties in the neighboring countries formed the [[HTMSZF]] organization in January 2005, as an instrument lobbying for preferential treatment in the granting of Hungarian citizenship.&lt;ref name="MabryMcGarry2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tristan James Mabry|author2=John McGarry|author3=Margaret Moore|author4=Brendan O'Leary|title=Divided Nations and European Integration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFCbBW18yU4C&amp;pg=PA112|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-4497-7|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''hype cycle''' is a branded graphical presentation developed and used by the American research, advisory and [[information technology]] firm [[Gartner]], for representing the maturity, adoption and social application of specific [[Technology|technologies]]. The hype cycle provides a graphical and conceptual presentation of the maturity of emerging technologies through five phases.

An example of a hype cycle is found in ''Amara's law''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|title=Amara's Law|publisher=|accessdate=April 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180410135130/https://spotlessdata.com/blog/amaras-law|archive-date=April 10, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Roy Amara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neatorama.com/2012/09/05/Four-Geeky-Laws-That-Rule-Our-World/ |title=Four Geeky Laws That Rule Our World |first1=Alex |last1=Santoso |date=September 5, 2012|publisher=Neatorama |accessdate=April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that &lt;blockquote&gt;We tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run.&lt;ref name=PC_Mag&gt;{{cite journal|title=Encyclopedia: Definition of: Amara's law|journal=PC Magazine|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/37701/amara-s-law|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isen.com/archives/011126.html|title=isen.com: Amara's Law -- SMART Letter #63|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Five phases==
[[File:Hype-Cycle-General.png|thumb|right|320px|General hype cycle for technology]]

Each hype cycle drills down into the five key phases of a technology's life cycle.

{|class="wikitable"
!align=center|No.
!align=center width=180px|Phase
!align=center|Description
|-
!align=center|1
|Technology Trigger
|A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off. Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity. Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.
|-
!align=center|2
|Peak of Inflated Expectations
|Early publicity produces a number of success stories—often accompanied by scores of failures. Some companies take action; most don't.
|-
!align=center|3
|Trough of Disillusionment
|Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver. Producers of the technology shake out or fail. Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.
|-
!align=center|4
|Slope of Enlightenment
|More instances of how the technology can benefit the enterprise start to crystallize and become more widely understood. Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers. More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.
|-
!align=center|5
|Plateau of Productivity
|Mainstream adoption starts to take off. Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined. The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off. If the technology has more than a niche market then it will continue to grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital marketing|last=1963-|first=Chaffey, Dave|publisher=Pearson|others=Ellis-Chadwick, Fiona|year=2016|isbn=9781292077611|edition= Sixth |location=Harlow|pages=140–141|oclc=942844494}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|}
The term "hype cycle" and each of the associated phases are now used more broadly in the [[marketing]] of new technologies.

==Hype in new media==
Hype (in the more general media sense of the term "hype"&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia /&gt;) plays a large part in the adoption of [[new media]] forms by society. [[Terry Flew]] states{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}} that hype (generally the enthusiastic and strong feeling around new forms of media and technology in which people expect everything will be modified for the better{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}) surrounding [[new media]] technologies and their popularization, along with the development of the Internet, is a common characteristic. But following shortly after the period of 'inflated expectations', as per the diagram above, the new media technologies quickly fall into a period of disenchantment, which is the end of the primary, and strongest, phase of hype.

Many analyses of the Internet in the 1990s featured large amounts of hype,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Negroponte |first=Nicolas |title=Being Digital |publisher=Vintage |date=1996-01-03 |edition= 1st |isbn= 978-0-679-76290-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=Kevin |title=New Rules For The New Economy |journal=Wired |date=1997-09-01 |url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/5.09/newrules.html |accessdate=2011-12-30 |volume=5.09 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |last=Dyson |first=Esther |title=Release 2.0: A Design For Living In The Digital Age |publisher=Broadway Books |location=New York |year=1997 |edition= 1st}}
&lt;/ref&gt; which created "debunking" responses.&lt;ref name=Flew_Newmedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Flew |first=Terry |title=New Media: An Introduction |publisher=OUP Australia and New Zealand |location=South Melbourne |year=2008 |edition= 3rd |isbn=978-0-19-555149-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such hype and the negative and positive responses toward it have given way to research that looks empirically at new media and its impact.

A longer-term historical perspective on such cycles can be found in the research of the economist [[Carlota Perez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henton|first=Doug|last2=Held|first2=Kim|date=2013|title=The dynamics of Silicon Valley: Creative destruction and the evolution of the innovation habitat|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=52|issue=4|pages=539–557|doi=10.1177/0539018413497542|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; D R Laurence in clinical pharmacology described a similar process in drug development in the seventies.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Another is that it is limited in its application, as it prioritizes economic considerations in decision-making processes. It seems to assume that a business' performance is tied to the hype cycle, whereas this may actually have more to do with the way a company devises its branding strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rootbranded.com/mindshift-magazine/branding-strategy-cut-hype-cycles|title=RootBranded {{!}} Mindshift Magazine|website=RootBranded {{!}} Saving Great Ideas from Obscurity|language=en|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related criticism is that the "cycle" has no real benefits to the development or marketing of new technologies and merely comments on pre-existing trends. Specific disadvantages when compared to, for example, [[technology readiness level]] are:
* The cycle is not scientific in nature, and there is no data or analysis that would justify the cycle.
* With the (subjective) terms ''disillusionment'', ''enlightenment'' and ''expectations'' it can not be described objectively or clearly where technology now really is.
* The terms are misleading in the sense that one gets the wrong idea what he or she can use a technology for. The user does not want to be disappointed, so should he or she stay away from technology in the Trough of Disillusionment?
* No action perspective is offered to move technology to a next phase.
* This appears to be a very simplified impulse response of an elastic system representable by a differential equation.  Perhaps more telling would be to formulate a system model with solutions conforming to observable behavior.
An analysis of Gartner Hype Cycles since 2000&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; shows that few technologies actually travel through an identifiable hype cycle, and that in practice most of the important technologies adopted since 2000 were not identified early in their adoption cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18835">'''Inspirational fiction''' is a sub-category within "inspirational literature," or "inspirational writing," defined in various ways in the United States and other nations.  More and more bookstores (including online booksellers) and libraries&lt;ref name=appleton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonpubliclibrary.ca/inspirationalfiction Inspirational Fiction.] City of London (Ontario) Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt; consider inspirational fiction to be a separate genre, classifying and shelving books accordingly.

Organizations like [https://web.archive.org/web/20100412145414/http://www.lyrasis.org/About-Us.aspx ''LYRASIS''], the nation’s largest regional membership organization serving libraries and information professionals, have begun holding classes for library workers to "explore the explosion in recent years in popularity of Inspirational Fiction and how it has blended in with all other genres to become appealing to more than its original target audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyrasis.org/Classes-and-Events/Catalog/H/Historical-and-Inspirational-Fiction-Readers-Advisory-More-than-Wagon-Trains-Live-Online.aspx LYRASIS Historical and Inspirational Fiction Readers Advisory]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Libraries are increasingly recognizing and using the categories of inspirational writing and inspirational fiction. In the larger category of "inspirational writing," there are some books that easily and obviously fit, such as the ''[[Chicken Soup for the Soul]]'' series, clearly written for the purpose of providing anecdotes that provide inspiration to the readers. Inspiration fiction is fiction that focuses
on religious values;it provides readers with content that is non offensive and lacks explicit storylines. Finding a good definition for the subgenre of inspirational fiction is a little more difficult.  However, while acknowledging that it is not a "rigorous category," many libraries do identify and list some works in such a category, using some working definitions to explain their choices.

For example, one library list of "inspirational fiction" books begins with the statement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Any good book can be an inspiration, but many of these books highlight people overcoming adversity or reaching new levels of understanding. Whether they pull themselves up by their own bootstraps or have help from a higher power, these books will uplift and entertain you.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plcmc.org/readers_club/subcategory.asp?cat=1&amp;id=15 Public Library of Charlette and Mecklenburg County] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615183542/http://plcmc.org/readers_club/subcategory.asp?cat=1&amp;id=15 |date=2010-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While it is true that many novels involve a positive change in the lives of some characters, this library definition might help limit the books that fit into this category to those whose main purpose, if not their entire purpose, seem to be using the example of the change in the life of a major character to inspire readers to think that such changes are possible in their lives, as well.  Also, the fact that this definition includes those who learn on their own and those who have help from a "higher power" allows the category to embrace both religious and non-religious works of fiction.Inspirational fiction specifically appeals to readers of all ages and backgrounds,specially 
those interested inreligious works.

==Christian fiction==

While, as the above definition shows, "inspirational fiction" is a category and genre larger than religious writing, in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] it is often used only to refer to "religious fiction," "faith-based fiction," or more narrowly (and perhaps most often), "Christian fiction".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arrtreads.org/bootcampchristian.htm Adult Reading Roundtable - Genre meanings.]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some inspirational fiction is written to appeal to a general Christian audience, but more often in the United States "inspirational fiction" (and especially "inspirational romance") that can be classified as Christian is written for the Evangelical Protestant market.&lt;ref name=neal&gt;Neal, Lynn S. ''Romancing God: Evangelical Women and Inspirational Fiction.''  University of North Carolina Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-8078-5670-3}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=uk21585BqHkC&amp;dq=%22inspirational+fiction%22+definition\&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Through Google Books].''&lt;/ref&gt; Although American literature has always been infused with religion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likesbooks.com/125.html All About Romance: At The Back Fence - Inspirational Romance"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102112656/http://likesbooks.com/125.html |date=2010-01-02 }} by Ellen Micheletti and Rachel Potter.&lt;/ref&gt; the popularity of Christian romance dates to the 1940s, as leaders of the Evangelical movement attempted to bring their faith into the mainstream both religiously and culturally.&lt;ref name=neal/&gt; Some works of inspirational fiction have also been written to appeal to Roman Catholic or Orthodox Christian readers.

One definition of "Christian fiction" is literature that

&lt;blockquote&gt;"...celebrates God's presence in our life. It can be narrow and didactic or broad and literal. Character's relationship to God is the primary focus. Another definition is that these stories are about "the journey of the soul." Readers seek "wholesome, yet compelling" reading. There is considerable interest in characters "who are like the reader" in some important way.  Although the label "Christian fiction" is used..to reflect the fact that God plays a significant role in the plot and the outcome. Christian novels focus on ordinary people who are challenged to live their lives in accordance with Christian principles."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.utk.edu/~wrobinso/590_lec_chr.html Readers Advisory Work With Genre Fiction, University of Tennessee, Knoxville.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201062732/http://web.utk.edu/~wrobinso/590_lec_chr.html |date=2010-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Janette Oke]]'s writings are an example of inspirational fiction that would often also fit into the Christian fiction genre, and she has often been referred to as one of the earliest and most prolific of writers in this category.  Her books often focus on individuals, very often pioneers in the early West, who must draw upon a sense and awareness of faith to overcome adversity.  Although most often identified with Christian writing, her books reach both religious and non-religious readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.janetteoke.com/ME2/Sites/dirmod.asp?sid=AAE7FBED480042CCB2A35E0112405950&amp;type=gen&amp;mod=Core+Pages&amp;gid=1638F265D3C543F4912C5EB61EC6DE97 Janette Oke website.]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other genres==

Many books written by non-religious writers in other genres (including [[literature#fiction|literary fiction]], [[Children's literature|children's fiction]], [[young adult fiction]], and even [[science fiction]]) have begun to be classified as inspirational fiction.&lt;ref name=appleton&gt;[http://www.apl.org/booklists.pdf InspirationalFictionforTeens.pdf Inspirational Fiction for Teens.]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Appleton Public Library.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact,''The Readers Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction'',&lt;ref&gt;Joyce C. Saricks, The Readers Advisory Guide to Genre Fiction, American Library Association, June 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[American Library Association]], lists "inspirational" as a subgenre in every type of fiction it discusses, from westerns to thrillers, to romances. Inspirational Fiction could be broken down into these subgenres as well: Inspirational Romance Fiction, Inspirational Western Fiction, etc.

Some American authors, like [[Mitch Albom]], have built strong reputations on books like ''[[The Five People You Meet in Heaven]]'' and ''[[For One More Day]]'', which are marketed as inspirational fiction; and others, like ''[[Tuesdays With Morrie]]'' and ''[[Have a Little Faith (Mitch Albom book)|Have a Little Faith]]'', which are marketed more in the category of inspirational non-fiction, or the larger category of inspirational literature, or inspirational writing.

Because it is often difficult to determine which books fit into the category of inspirational fiction according to a strict set of rules, libraries often include explanations (and sometimes, even disclaimers), such as the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Please note: The books listed here cover a wide variety of genres and types, from traditional inspirational fiction authors such as June Masters Bacher and Janette Oke, to thrillers such as those written by Paul Meier and fantasy and science fiction titles by J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. In addition, many titles address issues of faith from unconventional viewpoints. Some readers may question the suitability of titles that do not fit their personal view of what constitutes inspirational fiction; we simply ask that you keep in mind that individual readers' tastes vary. If you have questions about particular titles, please let us know.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofirving.org/library/readers-advisory/inspire.html Library Services, Irving Texas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One library distinguishes between inspirational fiction and the smaller category of religious fiction by noting that "inspirational fiction is more broad based. Instead of dwelling on the religious aspects of faith, they emphasize morals, values and life lessons."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.provolibrary.com/inspirational-fiction Provo City Library, Utah.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228173114/http://www.provolibrary.com/inspirational-fiction |date=2014-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misery literature===

In the UK, "inspirational fiction" (or, more commonly, "inspirational lit" or "inspi-lit") is sometimes used as another term for "[[misery lit]], a term "that describes a genre of biographical literature mostly concerned with the protagonist's triumph over personal trauma or abuse, often during childhood."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6563529.stm "Misery lit...read on".] ''BBC News'', April 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While this genre is growing in popularity, it is also controversial. Some authors have said they write in order to come to terms with their traumatic memories, and to help readers do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supporters of the genre also claim the genre's popularity indicates a growing cultural willingness to directly confront topics—specifically child sexual abuse—that once would have been ignored or swept under the rug.  However, critics locate the genre's popular appeal in its combination of moral outrage and titillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visionary fiction===

Some writers, including psychotherapist and author, Michael Gurrian, are promoting the term, "[[visionary fiction]]," for some inspirational fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionaryfiction.org/ Visionary Fiction.org.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gurian, who has written non-fiction works of psychology and parenting in addition to science-fiction, includes his own book, "The Miracle: A Visionary Novel," in this genre. Possibly a subgenre of "inspirational fiction," he adds to the definition of growth and the overcoming of obstacles the fact that this genre is "fiction in which the expansion of the human mind drives the plot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visionaryfiction.org/a_new_genre.html Definition of Visionary Fiction.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some well-known books, like ''[[Golf in the Kingdom]]'', by [[Michael Murphy (author)|Michael Murphy]], "defied categorization" when it was first published in 1971, described as "an altogether unique confluence of fiction, philosophy, myth, mysticism, enchantment, and golf instruction."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Golf-Kingdom-Michael-Murphy/dp/0140195491 [[Amazon.com]] editorial review.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that this novel could now be included in the subgenre, "visionary fiction," and the larger genre, "inspirational fiction." {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Gentle fiction===

Another category that is sometimes associated with "inspirational fiction" is "gentle fiction."  Although by no means can all inspirational fiction titles be considered in this category, the majority of "Christian inspirational fiction" or "faith-based inspirational fiction" might at one time have fit.  However, as one library instructor puts it, "In the last two decades the genre has expanded beyond the gentle read to follow the reading interests of the general public," to include titles that might be called "edgy inspirational fiction."&lt;ref name="Bryan"&gt;[http://skyways.lib.ks.us/tricon/2006/handouts/books_soul.pdf Books for the Soul: A Survey of Inspirational Fiction, Deborah Bryan, Topeka &amp; Shawnee County Public Library,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226081916/http://skyways.lib.ks.us/tricon/2006/handouts/books_soul.pdf |date=2010-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This genre is often used to identify works categorized by a lack of profanity and portrayal of explicit sex.  However, like other genres linked to "inspirational fiction," precise definitions of this category vary as well.  One used bookstore list begins with the explanation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By this category, we mean those lovely little books that tells stories of characters wrestling with life's ordinary problems, rather than global ones.  Our customers like them because they don't aim to shock you, just to lull you into a good, thoughtful read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sagebks.com/home/gentle_fiction.htm ''Sage Books'', List of Gentle Fiction titles.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sometimes books in this category are referred to as "gentle reads," and again definitions vary, but often are close to this public library description:&lt;ref&gt;[http://arrtreads.org/bootcampgentlereads.htm Adult Reading Round Table, Rolling Meadows Library, Rolling Meadows, IL]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With charm and humor, these novels explore the everyday joys, frustrations, and sorrows of lives quietly led. They typically revolve around the activities of a small community of people, such as a small town, a church, or a gathering of friends. The realities of sex, violence, and other passions are downplayed and are never presented in a graphic manner. Although the genre was once largely dominated by British authors, American authors in the vein of [[Jan Karon]] are now extremely popular.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal taste==

It may be easier to classify a book as inspirational fiction based on the goal of the writer (and, of course, the plot of the book), rather than the effect on the reader, since personal choice, taste, and even personal beliefs are factors that affect the way a book can "inspire" a reader.

At least one study has revealed that gender may also be a factor in a reader's reaction to inspirational literature. In a 2006 study of inspirational literature that men considered to have affected their lives (following a similar study regarding women),&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article702258.ece Inspirational Reads, The Times Online, April 6 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Lisa Jardine]] found that "a substantial number of men were immediately able to identify their most inspirational novel. Women, in general found it more difficult with many ultimately choosing a shortlist rather than one single book." "The men we interviewed had a tendency towards identifying themselves with angst-ridden books showing intellectual struggle, violence, personal vulnerability, catastrophe and the struggle to rise above circumstance." The books most frequently cited by men in this study included ''[[The Stranger (Camus novel)|The Outsider]]'' by [[Albert Camus]], ''[[The Lord of The Rings]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' by [[J.D. Salinger]], and—the only book written by a female that made the list of "top twenty" inspirational books for men -- ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' by [[Harper Lee]]. ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' was also only one of four books to be included in the top twenty list for both men and women.

==Objections==

Some object to the category of inspirational fiction, based on the idea that a book that is "inspirational" to one reader may not be inspirational to another, and therefore the category is too subjective to be used in an appropriate way.  On the other side of the question, it is argued that the category is useful even if it is not completely objective, and there are some authors whose works are written for the specific purposes that would be included in such a categorization.

'''La Corporación''' ("The Corporation"), also known as the "Santa Ana Cartel", was a Bolivian [[drug cartel]] and criminal organization, headed in the 1970s and 1980s by notorious drug lord [[Roberto Suárez Goméz]], known as the "King of Cocaine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eju.tv/2012/12/una-vida-cinematogrfica-revelaciones-de-la-viuda-del-boliviano-roberto-surez-el-rey-de-la-cocana/|title=Una vida cinematográfica: Revelaciones de la viuda del boliviano Roberto Suárez, el rey de la cocaína|website=eju.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"La Corporación" was founded in the 1970s by several drug traffickers and transnational criminals. After the 1980 coup d'état, "La Corporación" received political protection from the Bolivian military dictatorship, effectively making Bolivia a [[narco-state]], and became one of the largest cocaine producers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/15/world/bolivians-find-a-patron-in-reputed-drug-chief.html?pagewanted=all|title=BOLIVIANS FIND A PATRON IN REPUTED DRUG CHIEF|first=Warren Hoge and Special To the New York|last=Times|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were allied with several Mexican and Colombian drug cartels and had a notable presence in [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]].

==History==
In the 1970s, Suárez created "La Corporación" and began hiring various Bolivian coca producers, becoming one of the largest cocaine producers in the country. Because of the relationship with Suárez and [[Pablo Escobar]], "La Corporación" became a major supplier to the Medellín Cartel. Drugs were smuggled from the cocaine labs in the Bolivian Amazon to Colombia, selling at $9,000 per kilo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Roberto-Suarez-Gomez|title=Roberto Suárez Goméz - Bolivian criminal|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 1980, a [[1980 Bolivian coup d'état|coup d'état]] overthrew President [[Lidia Gueiler Tejada]], replaced by her cousin [[Luis García Meza Tejada]]. The event became known as the "Cocaine Coup" because it was reportedly backed by criminals and drug traffickers, including Suárez and other members of "La Corporación".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/bill-conroy/2011/03/bolivian-president-uses-former-dea-agent-s-book-send-message-world|title=Bolivian President Uses Former DEA Agent’s Book to Send Message to the World   - the narcosphere|website=narcosphere.narconews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the coup, drug traffickers received political protection and cocaine production dramatically increased in Bolivia. According to members of the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], the cartel was making an annual income of more than $400 million and was backed by several right-wing death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/node/28950|title=The Economist|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-DEA agent [[Michael Levine (DEA)|Michael Levine]] once accused the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] of facilitating multiple Latin American drug cartels, most notably "La Corporación".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://therearenosunglasses.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/cias-role-in-creating-la-corporacion-the-general-motors-of-cocaine/|title=CIA’s role in creating La Corporacion, the “General Motors of cocaine”|date=7 August 2012|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Suárez's arrest in 1988, "La Corporación" was headed by his nephew [[Jorge Roca Suarez]], who continued to smuggle drugs into the United States and began a major drug-trafficking operation in Southern California until his arrest in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-02-06/local/me-957_1_money-laundering|title=Bolivian Accused of Heading Drug Cartel Convicted :  Crime: Jorge Roca Suarez is found guilty of cocaine, tax and money-laundering charges in his second trial.

==Eamon Harkin==
Eamon was born in Northern Ireland and moved to New York in 2004. He then created ‘Calling All Kids’, a party which played homage to New York legend [[Arthur Russell (musician)|Arthur Russell]] and the history of downtown New York. He hosted a residency at FUN, at the now-gone Brooklyn club, Studio B. There he led the bookings and production and brought a variety of talent to the venue. He now produces Mister Saturday Night and Mister Sunday and DJs with his partner Justin Carter. 
As a producer, Eamon has released edits, remixes and original productions, on his own and with former partner Steve Raney (as Harkin and Raney).

==Justin Carter==
Justin moved from North Carolina to New York in 1999. In 2004 he started DJing and producing secret parties at Asterisk, a pioneering DIY venue in Bushwick that led the way for many other living-spaces-turned-party-places and carved a new path for underground parties in Brooklyn. That year he also became a member of the [[Nublu Club|Nublu]] family, where he launched the club’s record label and performed and DJed regularly. Justin has sung in the chorus of avant-garde composer [[Butch Morris]] and co-written and is currently working on an album of solo material.

The '''Motu''' are native inhabitants of [[Papua New Guinea]], living along the southern coastal area of the country. Their indigenous language is also known as [[Motu language|Motu]], and like several other languages of the region is an [[Austronesian]] language. They and the [[Koitabu people]] are the original inhabitants and owners of the land on which [[Port Moresby]] &amp;mdash; the national capital city — stands. The largest Motu village is [[Hanuabada]], northwest of Port Moresby.

Among the relatively light-skinned Motu he found tattooing in patterns similar to those of [[Micronesia]]. He also reported, among the old women, blackening the body with a kind of earth which gives a lustre like black lead. This was said to be a sign of mourning.

[[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] came into contact with the Motu, in 1904. He noted that, unlike many of their neighbors in the region, the Motu did not practice [[exogamy]]. Every year, they practiced the [[Hiri trade cycle|''hiri'']], when community members made trading voyages through the [[Gulf of Papua]]. Women made [[pottery]] for sale through the ''hiri''.&lt;ref name=Seligman49&gt;{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=C.G.|title=The Melanesians of British New Guinea|year=1910|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=49|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2394/view/1/49/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nakukymppi''' is a [[nudity|nude]] [[sport]] event in [[Finland]], held in the municipality of [[Padasjoki]] one week before [[Midsummer]] every year.

The idea is to run or walk 10 kilometres naked. Participants wear only [[shoe]]s, [[sock]]s and headwear. Women wear a top if their [[breasts]] are shaking too much. It has been held annually since 2003. It usually draws about 100 to 150 participants, of which one-tenth to one-fifth are women. Even though the event isn't organised by naturists and not only for naturists, half of the participants are naturists.

The event is organized by Mr. Aarne Heino together with local village community.

The '''nanomesh''' is a new [[inorganic]] nanostructured two-dimensional material, similar to [[graphene]]. It was discovered in 2003 at the [[University of Zurich]], Switzerland
.&lt;ref name="corso04"&gt;{{cite journal | author = M.

It consists of a single layer of [[boron]] (B) and [[nitrogen]] (N) atoms, which forms by [[self-assembly]] into a highly regular mesh after high-temperature exposure of a clean [[rhodium]]&lt;ref name="corso04"/&gt; or [[ruthenium]]&lt;ref name="goriachko07"&gt;{{cite journal | author = A.

The nanomesh looks like an assembly of hexagonal pores&lt;ref name="nomenc"&gt;In the literature different words referring to similar concepts can be found. Below is a summary of them:
* ''Pores, apertures, holes:'' areas of the nanomesh laying the closest to the underlying substrate due to a strong attraction. They form depressions, which are 0.05 nm deep and have a hexagonal shape.
* ''Wires:'' areas of the nanomesh referring to the border of the pores, which lay the farer away to the underlying substrate and therefore represent the upper part of the nanomesh.&lt;/ref&gt; (see right image) at the [[nanometer]] (nm) scale. The distance between two pore centers is only 3.2&amp;nbsp;nm, whereas each pore has a diameter of about 2&amp;nbsp;nm and is 0.05&amp;nbsp;nm deep. The lowest regions bind strongly to the underlying metal, while the wires&lt;ref name="nomenc"/&gt; (highest regions) are only bound to the surface through strong cohesive forces within the layer itself.

The [[boron nitride]] nanomesh is not only stable under vacuum,&lt;ref name="corso04"/&gt; air&lt;ref name="bunk07"&gt;{{cite journal | author = O.

These characteristics promise interesting applications of the nanomesh in areas like [https://web.archive.org/web/20071117050608/http://www.inano.dk/sw2519.asp nanocatalysis], [[surface functionalisation]], [[spintronics]], [[quantum computing]] and data storage media like [[hard drive]]s.

==Structure==
[[Image:Cross section nanomesh.jpg|thumb|300px|Cross-section of nanomesh on rhodium showing pore and wire regions.]]
h-BN nanomesh is a single sheet of [[boron nitride#Hexagonal boron nitride|hexagonal boron nitride]], which forms on substrates like [[rhodium]] Rh[[miller index|(111)]] or [[ruthenium]] Ru[[miller index|(0001)]] [[crystal]]s by a [[self-assembly]] process.

The [[unit cell]] of the h-BN nanomesh consists of 13x13 BN or 12x12 Rh atoms with a [[lattice constant]] of 3.2&amp;nbsp;nm. In a cross-section it means that 13 boron or nitrogen atoms are sitting on 12 rhodium atoms. This implies a modification of the relative positions of each BN towards the substrate atoms within a unit cell, where some [[chemical bond|bonds]] are more attractive or repulsive than other (site selective bonding), what induces the corrugation of the nanomesh (see right image with pores and wires).
	
The nanomesh corrugation amplitude of 0.05&amp;nbsp;nm causes a strong effect on the [[electronic structure]], where two distinct BN regions are observed. They are easily recognized in the lower right image, which is a [[scanning tunneling microscope|scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM) measurement, as well as in the lower left image representing a theoretical calculation of the same area. A strongly bounded region assigned to the pores is visible in blue in the left image below (center of bright rings in the right image) and a weakly bound region assigned to the wires appears yellow-red in the left image below (area in-between rings in the right image).

==Properties==
[[Image:ncNanomesh.gif|thumb|Naphthalocyanine molecules evaporated onto the nanomesh. They only adsorb in pores, forming a well-defined pattern.]]

The nanomesh is stable under a wide range of environments like air, water and [[electrolyte]]s among others. It is also temperature resistant since it does not decompose in temperatures up to 1275K under a vacuum. In addition to these exceptional stabilities, the nanomesh shows the extraordinary ability to act as a scaffold for metallic nano[[cluster (physics)|clusters]] and to trap [[molecule]]s forming a well-ordered array.

In the case of [[gold]] (Au), its evaporation on the nanomesh leads to formation of well-defined round Au nanoparticles, which are centered at the nanomesh pores.

The [[scanning tunneling microscope|STM]] figure on the right shows [[Naphthalocyanine]] (Nc) molecules, which were [[chemical vapor deposition|vapor-deposited]] onto the nanomesh. These planar molecules have a diameter of about 2&amp;nbsp;nm, whose size is comparable to that of the nanomesh pores (see upper inset). It is spectacularly visible how the molecules form a well-ordered array with the periodicity of the nanomesh (3.22&amp;nbsp;nm). The lower inset shows a region of this substrate with higher resolution, where individual molecules are trapped inside the pores. In addition, the molecules seem to keep their native [[Chemical structure|conformation]], what means that their functionality is kept, which is nowadays a challenge in [[nanoscience]].

Such systems with wide spacing between individual molecules/clusters and negligible [[chemical bond#Intermolecular bonding|intermolecular interactions]] might be interesting for applications such as [[molecular electronics]] and [[flash memory|memory elements]], in [[photochemistry]] or in optical devices.

See &lt;ref name="goriachko07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="berner07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="widmer07"/&gt; for more detailed information.

==Preparation and analysis==

[[Image:BorazineDecomp.jpg|thumb|Decomposition of borazine on transition metal surfaces.]]
Well-ordered nanomeshes are grown by [[thermal decomposition]] of [[borazine]] (HBNH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a colorless substance that is liquid at room temperature. The nanomesh results after exposing the atomically clean [[rhodium|Rh]][[miller index|(111)]] or [[ruthenium|Ru]][[miller index|(0001)]] surface to borazine by [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD).

The substrate is kept at a temperature of 796&amp;nbsp;°C (1070 K) when borazine is introduced in the vacuum chamber at a dose of about 40 L (1 Langmuir = 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pressure units|torr]] sec). A typical borazine vapor pressure inside the ultrahigh vacuum chamber during the exposure is 3x10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pressure units|mbar]].

After cooling down to room temperature, the regular mesh structure is observed using different experimental techniques. [[scanning tunneling microscope|Scanning tunneling microscopy]] (STM) gives a direct look on the local real space structure of the nanomesh, while [[low-energy electron diffraction|low energy electron diffraction]] (LEED) gives information about the surface structures ordered over the whole sample. [[ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy|Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy]] (UPS) gives information about the electronic states in the outermost atomic layers of a sample, i.e. electronic information of the top substrate layers and the nanomesh.

{{Spanish name|Oseguera|Cervantes}}
'''Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes''' ({{IPA-es|ne'mesio ose'ɣera θeɾˈβantes}}; born 17 July 1966), commonly referred to by his alias '''El Mencho''' ({{IPA-es|el 'mentʃo}}), is a Mexican suspected [[drug lord]] and leader of the [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]] (CJNG), a criminal group based in [[Jalisco]]. He is the most-wanted criminal in Mexico and one of the most-wanted in the U.S. Both governments are offering up to MXN$30&amp;nbsp;million and US$10&amp;nbsp;million, respectively, for information that leads to his arrest. He is wanted for drug trafficking, organized crime involvement, and illegal possession of firearms. El Mencho is reportedly responsible for coordinating drug trafficking operations in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Under his command, the CJNG became one of Mexico's leading criminal organizations.

Born into poverty in Mexico, El Mencho grew [[avocados]] and dropped out of primary school before [[Illegal immigration to the United States|immigrating illegally]] to the U.S. in the 1980s. After being arrested several times, he was deported to Mexico in the early 1990s and worked for the [[Milenio Cartel]]. He eventually climbed to the top of the criminal organization and founded the CJNG after several of his bosses were arrested or killed. His notoriety was also a result of his aggressive leadership and sensationalist acts of violence against both rival criminal groups and Mexican security forces alike. These attacks brought him increased government attention and an extensive manhunt. Security forces suspect he is hiding in the rural terrains of Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit, and/or Colima, and is guarded by mercenaries with former military training.

Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes was born on 17 July 1966 in the rural community of Naranjo de Chila in [[Aguililla|Aguililla, Michoacán]], Mexico.{{efn|According to the [[United States Department of the Treasury]], (USDOT), he has a listed alternative date of birth for 17 July 1964.&lt;ref name="usdptstate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hR4kx" /&gt; The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) states he was born in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]].&lt;ref name="dea" /&gt; Other sources state he was born in [[Uruapan|Uruapan, Michoacán]].&lt;ref name="menchobbc" /&gt;}}&lt;ref name="hR4kx" /&gt; His first name is cited as "Rubén" and/or "Nemesio".&lt;ref name="usdptstate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="w6Fvh" /&gt; He has alternative aliases like "Nemecio", "Rubén Acerguera Cervantes", "Lorenzo Mendoza", and "Nemesio Oseguera Ramos".&lt;ref name="jgfyn" /&gt; Some sources state that his birth-given name was Rubén but that he changed it to Nemesio in memory of his godfather.&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gallero" /&gt; However, he is widely known by his alias "El Mencho", a nickname that derives from the [[Phonology#Derivation and definitions|phonetic derivation]] of Nemesio.&lt;ref name="z33ie" /&gt;

El Mencho grew up in a poor family that cultivated avocados.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; He had five brothers: Juan, Miguel, [[Antonio Oseguera Cervantes|Antonio]], Marín, and Abraham.&lt;ref name="joH5l" /&gt; He dropped out of [[primary school]] in 5th grade to work in the fields.&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt; At the age of 14, however, he started guarding marijuana plantations.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; A few years later, he decided he wanted a better life for himself and [[Illegal immigration to the United States|immigrated illegally]] to the U.S. state of [[California]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gallero" /&gt; To conceal his identity in the U.S., he used a different names and combinations, like "Rubén Ávila", "José López Prieto", "Miguel Valadez", "Carlos Hernández Mendoza", "Roberto Salgado", among others.&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

=== Time in the U.S. ===
In 1986, he lived in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. He was arrested by the [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco Police]] at the age of 19 for stolen property and carrying a loaded gun. Two months after his arrest, his first child was born. According to border entry records, El Mencho crossed the U.S.-Mexico border several times during the late 1980s under other aliases. The DEA and Mexican investigators believe that it was during this time that he became involved in meth production and trade in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] alongside his brother-in-law [[Abigael González Valencia]] (alias "El Cuini").&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

In 1989, El Mencho was arrested again in San Francisco for selling narcotics. He was deported to Mexico several months later, but re-entered the U.S. and resettled in San Francisco. In September 1992, he was arrested again, this time on federal drug charges in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; According to court records, El Mencho and his brother Abraham were at a San Francisco bar known as Imperial to carry out a heroin deal: five ounces for US$9,500. Abraham was in charge of the transaction, while El Mencho acted as a lookout. El Mencho was 26-years-old at that time and much younger than Abraham, but he was savvy enough to recognize that the transaction was a set-up by the police. He told his brother that the men who they gave the heroin to handed them perfectly stashed dollar bills instead of giving them loose ones. Through a [[Telephone tapping|wiretap]] conversation, the police overheard El Mencho warning his brother to never do business with them again since they were [[Undercover operation|undercover cops]].&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

=== Arrest and deportation ===
Three weeks after the incident, however, both of them were arrested by the police. Once in court, El Mencho insisted that he was innocent. He said he was not involved in the heroin deal and that the undercover agents were lying about him handling the drugs. The prosecution insisted that both siblings were working together. El Mencho was left with few options; if he pleaded not guilty, his brother Abraham—who already had felony drug sentences in his record—would probably face [[Life imprisonment|life in prison]]. His defense understood that if he decided on a [[jury trial]], they would likely win the case. However, he decided to [[Guilt (law)|plea guilty]] and protect his brother from life imprisonment. He was sentenced to 5 years and imprisoned at the [[Big Spring Correctional Center]] in [[Texas]], which houses a large population of illegal immigrants.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

After three years, he was released from prison on [[parole]] and [[Deportation and removal from the United States|deported to Mexico]] at the age of 30.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt; Once in Mexico, he joined the local police forces of [[Cabo Corrientes (municipality)|Cabo Corrientes]] and [[Tomatlán]] in the state of [[Jalisco]]. Within some time, however, he left the police and joined organized crime as a full-time member of the [[Milenio Cartel]].&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt; To strengthen his relationship with the Milenio Cartel, El Mencho married one of the clan leader's sisters, [[Rosalinda González Valencia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It was in this criminal group where El Mencho would become a leading figure in organized crime.&lt;ref name="rollingstone" /&gt;

==Rise to leadership==
In the Milenio Cartel, El Mencho started as a member of the assassin squad that protected the drug lord [[Armando Valencia Cornelio]] (alias "El Maradona"). On 12 August 2003, his boss was arrested by Mexican authorities. Around the same time, a rival criminal group known as [[Los Zetas]], with the backing of the [[Gulf Cartel]], carried out an armed offensive against the Milenio Cartel in Michoacán. The attack forced the Valencia family to exile in Jalisco; El Mencho relocated in the state capital, Guadalajara, with his father-in-law José Luis González Valencia (alias "El Quini") and Román Caballero Valencia. In Jalisco, El Mencho and the Milenio Cartel formed an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel subgroup headed by [[Ignacio Coronel Villarreal|Ignacio "Nacho" Coronel]], a high-ranking drug lord and ally of [[Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]]. Under Coronel, El Mencho and his group managed the Sinaloa Cartel's drug operations, finances, and murder activities in the states of [[Colima]] and Jalisco.&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saltillo" /&gt;

On 28 October 2009, however, the Milenio Cartel's top leader [[Óscar Orlando Nava Valencia]] (alias "El Lobo") was arrested.&lt;ref name="g9p5f" /&gt; The following year on 6 May 2010, his brother [[Juan Carlos Nava Valencia|Juan Carlos]] (alias "El Tigre") was arrested too.&lt;ref name="7FQ17" /&gt; Two months later, Coronel was killed in a shootout with the [[Mexican Army]]. Following their downfalls, the Milenio Cartel began to rupture and El Mencho tried to take over its leadership structure.&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="saltillo" /&gt; One sect within the Milenio Cartel wanted to appoint Elpidio Mojarro Ramírez (alias "El Pilo"), who worked closely with Óscar Orlando and Juan Carlos before their arrest, as the leader of the group. [[Érick Valencia Salazar]], one of the clan members, however, wanted El Mencho to take command. El Mencho then asked the other Milenio bloc to hand over Gerardo Mendoza (alias "Tecato" and/or "Cochi") for killing a group of men that reported to him in [[Tecomán|Tecomán, Colima]]. The other division refused El Mencho' request, prompting an internal war.&lt;ref name="JYqeL" /&gt;

The Milenio Cartel's divisions split into two. One side was known as [[La Resistencia (gang)|La Resistencia]]; the other was Los Torcidos, headed by El Mencho. La Resistencia accused Los Torcidos of turning in Óscar Orlando to the authorities. A war ensued, and the two groups fought for the drug smuggling turfs in Jalisco.&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rb2im" /&gt; To legitimize its presence, El Mencho' group launched a propaganda campaign against its enemies, denouncing extortions done by rival gangs against civilians, businessmen, and government authorities.&lt;ref name="saltillo" /&gt; Los Torcidos eventually won the war and consolidated their influence in western Mexico. The group then changed its name to the [[Jalisco New Generation Cartel]] (Spanish: Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación, or CJNG).&lt;ref name="crystalpower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fI3hQ" /&gt;

==Leadership tenure==
As leader of the CJNG, El Mencho solidified his position and grew his organization through territorial expansion and by corrupting government officials. The CJNG went from being a small, offshoot criminal gang to one of the leading criminal groups in Mexico. Throughout the process, El Mencho established himself as one of Mexico's most-wanted criminals.&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt; His rise to fame is due to a number of factors, including the aggressive and sensationalist displays of public violence by the CJNG. The direct attacks of the CJNG against Mexico's security forces earned El Mencho a reputation among authorities as "[[Public enemy|principal enemy]]" of the state and as a dangerous criminal. In addition, the fall of Mexico's former top crime bosses cleared the way for El Mencho to gain visibility and status.&lt;ref name="crystalpower" /&gt;&lt;ref name="policetodruglord" /&gt;

He consolidated his operations in Jalisco and its adjacent states by fighting off incursions from criminal groups like Los Zetas and the [[Knights Templar Cartel]]. According to government sources, he is responsible for overseeing the CJNG's entire drug trafficking operations in the states of Jalisco, Colima, and [[Guanajuato]], where he created a bastion for [[methamphetamine]] production and trade.&lt;ref name="menchouni" /&gt;&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt; Their operational capacity in Mexico is concentrated in 8 states: Jalisco, Colima, Guanajuato, [[Nayarit]], and [[Veracruz]], where it holds a firm grip of drug trafficking operations, and Morelos, Guerrero and Michoacán, where it fights competing rival drug groups. Between 2014 and 2016, the only region in the country where the CJNG lost its territorial presence was in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="radiografica" /&gt; Internationally, the CJNG reportedly has ties with criminal groups in the U.S., Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On an international scale, the CJNG is mainly focused on trafficking [[cocaine]] and methamphetamine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

El Mencho was able to make the CJNG one of Mexico's most profitable criminal gangs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The government estimates that El Mencho's group has about US$50&amp;nbsp;billion in total assets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This success was shared with Abigael González Valencia, his brother-in-law, who headed a drug trafficking group known as [[Los Cuinis]], allied to the CJNG.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Abigael was arrested by the Mexican Navy on 28 February 2015.&lt;ref name="ldfxG" /&gt; Part of El Mencho' success in the drug trade had to do with his ability to strategize market and consumer changes. Initially, the CJNG produced methamphetamine, but then he moved to heroin production when the [[Demand|consumer demand]] changed.&lt;ref name="policetodruglord" /&gt;

===Manhunt===
On 25 August 2012, a unit of the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Mexican Federal Police]] based in [[Tonaya|Tonaya, Jalisco]], responded to an anonymous tip stating that there was an organized crime cell present in a rural community close by. When the security forces got to the area, a shootout broke out between the two parties.&lt;ref name="axbtZ" /&gt; 6 CJNG gunmen were killed in the firefight. Initial reports stated that El Mencho was captured in the operation, but the Mexican government later confirmed that he was not in custody.&lt;ref name="ja9UG" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WVBvW" /&gt; In a series of highly coordinated tactics to prevent El Mencho' arrest, the CJNG blocked several highways and roads across the [[Guadalajara Metropolitan Area]] by setting at least 37 vehicles on fire.&lt;ref name="fOo0U" /&gt; The purpose of the burning vehicles was to place them as blockades to impede the security forces from traveling across Jalisco's capital and giving El Mencho' ample time to escape.&lt;ref name="insightprofile" /&gt; The blockades were placed in strategic routes to prevent police reinforcements to come in or leave Guadalajara. After the attacks were over, the government confirmed that El Mencho was in the area and had evaded capture.&lt;ref name="iRsBm" /&gt;

On 19 March 2015, in [[Ocotlán, Jalisco]], CJNG gunmen ambushed a Federal Police convoy. [[2015 Ocotlán ambush|The total death toll was 11]]; five police officers, three civilians, and three CJNG gunmen. The attack was a response by the CJNG to protect El Mencho, who was reportedly in the area for a meeting.&lt;ref name="kCwQn" /&gt; On 23 March, Heriberto Acevedo Cárdenas (alias "El Gringo" and "El Güero"), one of El Mencho' close associates, was killed in a shootout with the Federal Police in [[Zacoalco de Torres|Zacoalco de Torres, Jalisco]]. Three other CJNG suspects were killed. According to government sources, Acevedo Cárdenas directed CJNG cells in Zacoalco, [[Tlajomulco de Zúñiga|Tlajomulco]], [[Cocula, Jalisco|Cocula]], [[Tapalpa]] and [[Atemajac de Brizuela|Atemajac de Brizuela, Jalisco]].&lt;ref name="v2dyV" /&gt; In response to his death, El Mencho commanded the CJNG to carry out attacks against the Mexican Federal Police.&lt;ref name="Oufb5" /&gt; On 30 March, CJNG gunmen in [[Zapopan|Zapopan, Jalisco]], ambushed a convoy where Alejandro Solorio Aréchiga, Jalisco's security commissioner, was travelling in. No one was killed in the fire exchange.&lt;ref name="MEXw0" /&gt; On 6 April, CJNG gunmen blocked a road in [[San Sebastián del Oeste|San Sebastián del Oeste, Jalisco]], with a burning vehicle and opened fire at a convoy of the Federal Police, [[2015 San Sebastián del Oeste ambush|killing 15 policemen and wounding 5 more]].&lt;ref name="0ctjY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2CrXM" /&gt; The incident was the deadliest single-attack on the Mexico's police force since 2010.&lt;ref name="BeI3d" /&gt; That same day, Miguel Ángel Caicedo Vargas, the police chief of Zacoalco de Torres, was killed by CJNG hitmen.&lt;ref name="13X9A" /&gt;

A month later on [[1 May 2015 Jalisco attacks|1 May 2015]], the Mexican government launched [[Operation Jalisco]], a military-led campaign that intended to combat organized crime groups in Jalisco and capture their respective leaders.&lt;ref name="GcbBc" /&gt; The announcement came after a series of violent attacks from the CJNG in previous weeks. The day the operation was inaugurated, however, intelligence reports stated that El Mencho was in Tonaya, which prompted an offensive to apprehend him. As the security forces moved to the area where El Mencho was allegedly hiding, a gunfight broke out between law enforcement officials and gunmen of the CJNG.&lt;ref name="TAHVi" /&gt; In the small town of [[Villa Purificación|Villa Purificación, Jalisco]], El Mencho' men shot down a Mexican Army [[Eurocopter EC725|helicopter]] with a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] (RPG) launcher, killing 9 soldiers.&lt;ref name="7FDqe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3Ysi8" /&gt; The battle extended throughout several municipalities in Jalisco; El Mencho' men blockaded several roads across the Guadalajara area to slow down the mobilization of law enforcement and facilitate their leader's escape. The CJNG set 39 buses, 11 banks, and 16 gas stations on fire. The attack spread through 20 different towns and in three neighboring states.&lt;ref name="leyvD" /&gt;

According to the Mexican government, El Mencho may be hiding in the state of Jalisco, the CJNG's stronghold. However, they believe he does not stay in one place for too long, and travels across several municipalities in Jalisco and into the states of Michoacán, Colima, and Nayarit.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eohj4" /&gt; He usually travels across the mountains and rural terrains in these areas since it provides multiple escape routes in the event that security forces attempt to encircle him.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Authorities suspect El Mencho's inner circle is made up of mercenaries with former military training. His second security circle is much larger in size and serves as a rearguard to notify El Mencho's inner circle of suspicious activity and ambush potential parties that attempt to get close to him.&lt;ref name="derrotamilitar" /&gt;

==Criminal charges==
Since the 2000s, the DEA office in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]], tracked El Mencho' activities and detected that the CJNG had expanded its drug trafficking operations internationally.&lt;ref name="animalpolitico1" /&gt; In 2000, the U.S. government discovered that El Mencho was involved in a cocaine and methamphetamine operation internationally. Five years later, they discovered he had used firearms to facilitate his operations.&lt;ref name="enlos90" /&gt; In 2007, the DEA discovered that El Mencho was involved in a cocaine operation that went through Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and ended in the U.S. They also uncovered a second cocaine shipment from Colombia, Mexico, to the U.S. In 2009, DEA detected that El Mencho was involved in another cocaine shipment originating from Ecuador.&lt;ref name="oMtrD" /&gt; Two more shipments were then detected in 2013 from Mexico then the U.S.&lt;ref name="enlos90" /&gt; In 2014, however, the DEA noticed a radical shift in the CJNG's [[modus operandi]]; El Mencho' was discovered to have coordinated a methamphetamine shipment that went from Mexico to Australia then to the U.S by leveraging China-based gangs.&lt;ref name="animalpolitico1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="6j150" /&gt;

On 27 September 2011, Mexico's [[Attorney General of Mexico|Office of the General Prosecutor]] (PGR) issued an arrest warrant for El Mencho and offered MXN$2&amp;nbsp;million for anyone who can help provide information that leads to his arrest.&lt;ref name="j2CDA" /&gt; He was accused of organized crime involvement and [[Criminal possession of a weapon|illegal possession of firearms]].&lt;ref name="UkKxZ" /&gt; In March 2014, the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], based on the previous investigations by the DEA, indicted El Mencho for several charges, including drug trafficking and for being leaders of a "[[Continuing Criminal Enterprise]]".&lt;ref name="irvLL" /&gt; El Mencho and Abigael were accused of coordinating shipments of cocaine and methamphetamine from South America via Mexico to the U.S. They also stated that the CJNG and Los Cuinis coordinated the collection and delivery of the drug proceeds from the U.S. to Mexico.&lt;ref name="OTsmt" /&gt; In addition, the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]] is looking to convict El Mencho for drug trafficking offenses.&lt;ref name="dea" /&gt;

On 18 December 2017, seventeen year-old YouTuber star [[Juan Luis Lagunas Rosales]], known as "El Pirata de Culiacán" (English: The Pirate from Culiacán), was gunned down in a bar in Jalisco by a group of four men armed with rifles, shortly after Lagunas Rosales published videotaped insults towards El Mencho.&lt;ref name="f8eRH" /&gt; Police are investigating if El Mencho gave the order to execute him, but no charges have been filed.&lt;ref name="PqozT" /&gt;

On 15 August 2018, the PGR announced they were offering up to MXN$30 million to anyone who provides information that leads to El Mencho's capture.&lt;ref name="0H6gu" /&gt; This announcement was made public when the DEA and Mexican authorities prepared to reveal a new cooperation plan against organized crime, which included a stronger focus against their financial structure and the creation of a law enforcement group responsible for investigating international cases.&lt;ref name="VkD8m" /&gt; The bounty derives from a new arrest warrant issued against him for his alleged participation in masterminding the kidnapping and murder of two agents of the [[Criminal Investigation Agency (Mexico)|Criminal Investigation Agency]] (AIC), a branch of the PGR, in February 2018.&lt;ref name="DjULo" /&gt;

On 16 October 2018, the [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Department of Justice|Justice]], and [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] announced a joint law enforcement measure against the CJNG, and increased El Mencho's bounty to US$10&amp;nbsp;million from US$5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="xgPe6" /&gt; This increase was one of the largest ones approved in the history of the [[Narcotics Rewards Program]].&lt;ref name="D3smN" /&gt;

===Kingpin Act designation===
On 8 April 2015, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] (OFAC) sanctioned El Mencho under the [[Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act]] ("Kingpin Act") for his involvement in international drug smuggling operations. The sanction was joint investigation conducted by the Treasury and the DEA office in Los Angeles as part of a larger effort with their Mexican counterparts to sanction drug trafficking groups in Mexico. The sanction extended to the CJNG, his brother-in-law Abigael González Valencia, and Los Cuinis. As part of the sanction, all the U.S.-based assets and/or assets in control of U.S. individuals on behalf of El Mencho, González Valencia, the CJNG, and Los Cuinis, were frozen in the U.S. In addition, the act prohibited U.S. citizens from engaging in business activities with them.&lt;ref name="gaYtX" /&gt;

On 17 September 2015, the OFAC sanctioned five businesses in Jalisco for financially supporting the CJNG and El Mencho' operations. This sanction was a result of another investigation done by the Treasury and the DEA office in Los Angeles. All the U.S.-based assets of these businesses were frozen, and U.S. citizens were prohibited from doing business with them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The businesses were a sushi restaurant in [[Puerto Vallarta]] and Guadalajara, a tequila company in Guadalajara,{{efn|Other sources state that the tequila company is based in [[Tepatitlán|Tepatitlán, Jalisco]].&lt;ref name="universalamparos" /&gt;}} a rental cabin business in [[Tapalpa]], and an advertising firm and agricultural company, both in Guadalajara.&lt;ref name="xGBPJ" /&gt; According to the report, the diversity of these businesses showed that the CJNG was successful at penetrating the economy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

On 27 October 2016, the OFAC sanctioned nine more individuals for providing material and financial assistance to El Mencho and González Valencia and their respective groups, the CJNG and Los Cuinis. This sanction was also result of another investigation done by the Treasury and the DEA office in Los Angeles. This sanction was an attempt by the U.S. government to disrupt the inner circle of complicit family members within the CJNG and Los Cuinis and affect their finances in Mexico's domestic economy. The individuals sanctioned were El Mencho' brother Antonio; his son-in-law [[Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez]]; five of González Valencia's siblings: Arnulfo, Édgar Edén, [[Elvis González Valencia|Elvis]], Marisa Ivette, and Noemí; businessman Fabián Felipe Vera López; and attorney María Teresa Quintana Navarro. All their U.S.-based assets were frozen, and U.S. citizens were prohibited from doing business with them.&lt;ref name="9GVIt" /&gt;

==Family==
El Mencho has five brothers: Juan, Miguel, Antonio, Marín and Abraham. In the 1990s, Abraham in California was given a 10-year sentence. In 2013, Mexican authorities accused him of murder in Michoacán. The charges were later dropped and the case was closed.&lt;ref name="df3mc" /&gt; Marín was accused in a California court, but the charges are not available to the public. Antonio lived in the U.S. and was released from a [[Mississippi]] prison in 2001 after completing his sentence for property damage charges.&lt;ref name="hTRsk" /&gt; He was arrested in Jalisco on 4 December 2015, by the Mexican Army and Navy for working as one of El Mencho' top financial operators. According to the Mexican government, Juan and Miguel are involved with the CJNG. Juan was charged in Michoacán for burglary, but the case was later dismissed.&lt;ref name="81YQI" /&gt;

Rosalinda González Valencia is the wife of El Mencho. They have three children: Jessica Johana, Laisha, and [[Rubén Oseguera González]] (alias "El Menchito).&lt;ref name="jYnQ8" /&gt; Jessica Johana is married to Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez (alias "El Ojo de Vidrio"), first arrested on 1 May 2015. He was released on 1 July for lack of evidence, but was re-arrested again on 6 April 2016, for his involvement in the CJNG.&lt;ref name="EzMjR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flLDF" /&gt; El Mencho's son Rubén was regarded by the Mexican government as the second-in-command in the CJNG prior to his arrest in 2014. He was released from prison on several occasions for lack of evidence, but was re-arrested each time by the police for additional charges.&lt;ref name="fU6B2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="3nW2n" /&gt;

In addition, Mexican authorities suspected in 2016 that Omar Eleazar Oseguera Cervantes was part of the CJNG leadership structure. Though he has identical last names as El Mencho, he was listed as his son-in-law and not as one of his brothers.&lt;ref name="7gleS" /&gt; He reportedly works as one of his top security chiefs.&lt;ref name="RF4Vr" /&gt;

Each event is typically a 2 or 3 day weekend, which includes:

==Road Race==

There is normally a 90-minute enduro with a mandatory 5 minute pit stop, with Sunday featuring 2 30 minute sprint races.  No one “owns” the corner at PBOC and contact is strongly discouraged.  The rules do allow for racing incidents.

==High Performance Driver’s Education==

Anyone can bring their street car (except SUV’s, pick up trucks, and certain convertibles) and drive it on the track.  The school includes 2 hours on autocross exercises, classroom instruction, and time on the track with an instructor in the passenger seat.  In the school groups, there is passing on the straights with a point by from the car being passed. In the Solo/Instructor run group, there is passing anywhere on the track with a point by.  There is also a Super Solo group where passing is allowed anywhere with or without a point by.

==Auto Cross==

Where track layout allows, each weekend includes an [[autocross]].  Novices spend 2 hours on the autocross learning [[over steer]], [[under steer]] and [[threshold braking]].

==Drag Race==

At the annual 5 day Winterfest event at [[Sebring International Raceway]], a 1/8 mile [[drag race]] is run on Saturday night.  Cars, tow vehicles, 4 wheelers, and just about anything else is allowed.

The [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesian]] island of [[Yap]] is known for its stone money, known as Rai, or Fei: large [[doughnut]]-shaped, carved  disks of (usually) [[calcite]], up to 4&amp;nbsp;m (12&amp;nbsp;ft) in diameter (most are much smaller). The smallest can be as little as {{convert|3.5|cm}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillilland|first=Cora Lee C.|title=The Stone Money of Yap. A Numismatic Survey.

S. Parsonson |accessdate=2016-09-19|quote=The natives of Yap in Micronesia went 300 miles to the Palau Islands for "stone money", great calcite disks, six to twelve feet in diameter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but briefly on [[Guam]] as well, and transported to Yap for use as money. They have been used in trade by the Yapese as a form of currency.

The monetary system of Yap relies on an oral history of ownership. Because these stones are too large to move, buying an item with one simply involves agreeing that the ownership has changed. As long as the transaction is recorded in the oral history, it will now be owned by the person to whom it is passed and no physical movement of the stone is required.

==Form and value==
Rai stones are circular disks with a hole in the middle. The stones vary widely in size. The largest are {{convert|3.6|m|cm ft in}} in diameter and {{convert|0.5|m|cm ft in}} thick and weigh {{convert|4|t|kg ST lb}}. The largest rai stone is located on [[Rumung]] island, near Riy village.&lt;ref name=wondermondo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wondermondo.com/Countries/Au/MicronesiaFS/Yap/RaiOfYap.htm |title=Rai of Yap – the stone money |publisher=Wondermondo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller rai stones might have a diameter of from {{convert|7|to|8|cm}}.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

The extrinsic (perceived) value of a specific stone is based on not only its size and craftsmanship, but also its history. If many people—or no one at all—died when the specific stone was transported, or a famous sailor brought it in, the value of the rai stone increases by reason of its anecdotal heft.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Rai stones were, and still are,&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goldstein |first1=Jacob |last2=Kestenbaum |first2=David |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2011/02/15/131934618/the-island-of-stone-money |title=The Island of Stone Money |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2010-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; used in rare important social transactions, such as marriage, [[inheritance]], political deals, sign of an alliance, [[ransom]] of the battle dead, or, rarely, in exchange for food. Many of them are placed in front of meetinghouses or along pathways. The physical location of the stone is often not significant. Although the ownership of a particular stone might change, the stone itself is rarely moved due to its weight and risk of damage. The names of previous owners are passed down to the new one. In one instance, a large rai being transported by canoe and outrigger was accidentally dropped and sank to the sea floor. Although it was never seen again, everyone agreed that the rai must still be there, so it continued to be transacted as genuine currency.&lt;ref name=NPR /&gt; What is important is that ownership of the rai is clear to everyone, not that the rai is physically transferred or even physically accessible to either party in the transfer.

==History==
Yapese quarried the limestone rocks from the islands of [[Palau]] and took them to Yap with [[canoe]]s and [[raft]]s. There is evidence that some limestone has been mined in Palau by Yapese as early as 500 AD, but more widespread mining started in the time period of 1000–1400 AD.&lt;ref name=wondermondo/&gt; Local legend holds that the Yapese discovered the rock of Palau about 500–600 years ago when an expedition led by a man called [[Anagumang]] landed on Palau.&lt;ref name=Pine&gt;{{Cite news |last=Pine |first=Art |title=Fixed Assets, or Why a Loan in Yap is Hard to Roll Over |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |page=A1 |date=29 March 1984}} reprinted in Mankiw, N. Gregory. ''Essentials of Economics, Third Edition.'' Mason: South-Western, 2004. pp. 454–455&lt;/ref&gt; Limestone was nonexistent in Yap and therefore very valuable to the Yapese. First Anagumang ordered his men to cut stone into the shape of fish but eventually a circular shape was chosen, probably because it was easier to transport. A pole was put through the hole in the center of the stone so that laborers could carry the stone. The largest of the disks probably needed hundreds of men to transport. Residents of Palau in turn required Yapese to pay in [[bead]]s, [[coconut]] meat and [[copra]] or in the form of services for the privilege of quarrying.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

It is unknown how long money stones have been used in Yap. Flat rocks have been found there that are up to 2000 years old, but the oldest do not resemble today's rai stones, and it is not known if they were used as money. It is nevertheless clear that the size of the stones grew sharply after European techniques and traders came to Yap. The stones may have evolved from smaller carved beads.&lt;ref name=Gillilland&gt;{{cite book |last=Gillilland |first=Cora Lee C. |title=The Stone Money of Yap: A Numismatic Survey (Smithsonian Studies in History and Technology 23) |year=1975 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |location=Washington, DC |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10088/2422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the Irish-American [[David Dean O'Keefe]] was shipwrecked near Yap and was helped by the natives. Later, he assisted the Yapese in acquiring rai and in return received [[copra]] and [[Sea cucumber as food|trepang]], which were valuable exports in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite book|last=Powers|first=Dennis M.|title=Tales of the Seven Seas: The Escapades of Captain Dynamite Johnny O'Brien|year=2010|publisher=Taylor Trade Publishing|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=9781589794474|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Keefe provided the Yapese with iron tools. As a result, a form of inflation set in and rai stones acquired with his help were less valuable than more ancient ones. The book ''His Majesty O'Keefe'' is the story of his life on Yap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klingman|first=Lawrence|title=His Majesty O'Keefe|year=1950|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=NY|last2=Green|first2=Gerald}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[His_Majesty_O%27Keefe|film of the same name]] starring Burt Lancaster was made in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0045876/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 ''His Majesty O'Keefe'' on IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade for rai stones eventually stopped at the beginning of the [[20th century]] due to trade disputes between Spanish and German interests in the area. Quarries were abandoned. When [[Imperial Japanese Army|Imperial Japanese]] forces took over Yap during [[World War II]], they used some of the stones for construction or as anchors.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

Economist [[Milton Friedman]] has compared the monetary role of the stone money to the reserves of gold held in Fort Knox for foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedman|first1=Milton|title=The Island of Stone Money|journal=Working Papers in Economics|date=1991|volume=E-91-3|url=http://www.karlwhelan.com/IMB/Friedman-Yap.pdf|accessdate=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although modern currency has replaced the stones as everyday currency, the rai stones are still exchanged in traditional ways between the Yapese. They are a [[national symbol]] and are depicted on local [[Vehicle registration plates of the Federated States of Micronesia|license plate]]s.

Patricia Hill Collins, ''Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment'' (2nd ed., 2000), Glossary, p. 300: "Scientific racism was designed to prove the inferiority of people of color"; Simon During, ''Cultural studies: a critical introduction'' (2005), p. 163: "It [''sc. scientific racism''] became such a powerful idea because ... it helped legitimate the domination of the globe by whites"; David Brown and Clive Webb, ''Race in the American South: From Slavery to Civil Rights'' (2007), p. 75: "...the idea of a hierarchy of races was driven by an influential, secular, scientific discourse in the second half of the eighteenth century and was rapidly disseminated during the nineteenth century".&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of [[World War II]], scientific racism in theory and action was formally denounced, especially in [[UNESCO]]'s early [[Anti-racism#Scientific anti-racism|antiracist]] statement "[[The Race Question]]" (1950): "The biological fact of race and the myth of 'race' should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes 'race' is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth of 'race' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years, it has taken a heavy toll in human lives, and caused untold suffering".&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, [http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf The Race Question], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Such "biological fact" is no longer considered to exist as developments in [[human evolutionary genetics]] showed that human genetic differences are nearly totally gradual.&lt;ref name="CSfrozaGPL"&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L. (2001). ''Genes, Peoples and Languages'', p. 30. Penguin Books, London. {{ISBN|9780865475298}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "scientific racism" is generally used pejoratively as applied to more modern theories, as in ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994). Critics argue that such works postulate racist conclusions unsupported by available evidence such as a connection between [[race and intelligence]].&lt;ref name=Tucker07&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications such as the ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'', founded explicitly as a "race-conscious" journal, are generally regarded as platforms of scientific racism for publishing articles on fringe interpretations of [[human evolution]], [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[ethnography]], [[language]], [[mythology]], [[archaeology]], and race subjects.

===Enlightenment thinkers===
{{See also|Race (historical definitions)}}
During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (an era from the 1650s to the 1780s), concepts of [[monogenism]] and [[polygenism]] became popular, though they would only be systematized epistemologically during the 19th century. [[Monogenism]] contends that all races have a single origin, while [[polygenism]] is the idea that each race has a separate origin. Until the 18th century, the words "race" and "species" were interchangeable.&lt;ref name="Jen E. Boyle 2010 page 74"&gt;Jen E. Boyle (2010), "Anamorphosis in Early Modern Literature: Mediation and Affect", Ashgate, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

====Robert Boyle vs. Henri de Boulainvilliers====

An early scientist who studied race was [[Robert Boyle]] (1627–1691), an Anglo-Irish [[natural philosopher]], [[chemist]], [[physicist]], and [[inventor]]. Boyle believed in what today is called 'monogenism', that is, that all races, no matter how diverse, came from the same source, [[Adam and Eve]]. He studied reported stories of parents' giving birth to different coloured [[albinos]], so he concluded that Adam and Eve were originally white and that whites could give birth to different coloured races. Theories of [[Robert Hooke]] and [[Isaac Newton]] about color and light via [[optical dispersion]] in [[physics]] were also extended by [[Robert Boyle]] into discourses of [[polygenesis (biology)|polygenesis]],&lt;ref name="Jen E. Boyle 2010 page 74"/&gt; speculating that maybe these differences were due to "seminal impressions". However, Boyle's writings mention that at his time, for "European Eyes", beauty was not measured so much in [[colour]], but in "stature, comely symmetry of the parts of the body, and good features in the face".&lt;ref&gt;Robert Boyle (1664), "Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours", Henry Herringman, London, pp. 160–61&lt;/ref&gt; Various members of the scientific community rejected his views and described them as "disturbing" or "amusing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palmeri, Frank|title=Humans And Other Animals in Eighteenth-Century British Culture: Representation, Hybridity, Ethics|year=2006|pages=49–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, historian [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]] (1658–1722) divided the French as two races: (i) the [[aristocracy|aristocratic]] "French race" descended from the invader Germanic [[Franks]], and (ii) the indigenous [[Gallo-Roman]] race (the political [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] populace). The Frankish aristocracy dominated the Gauls by innate [[right of conquest]].

In his time, [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]], a believer in the "right of conquest", did not understand "race" as biologically immutable, but as a contemporary (racist) cultural construct.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His racialist account of French history was not entirely mythical: despite "supporting" [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[epic poetry]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (''La Chanson de Roland'', c. 12th century), he sought [[scientific]] legitimation by basing his racialist distinction on the historical existence of genetically and linguistically distinguished Germanic and Latin-speaking peoples in France. His theoretic racialism was distinct from the biologic facts manipulated in 19th-century scientific racism.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} (cf. [[Cultural relativism]])

====Lord Kames====
The Scottish lawyer [[Henry Home, Lord Kames]] (1696–1782) was a [[polygenist]]: he believed God had created different races on Earth in separate regions. In his 1734 book ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home claimed that the environment, climate, or state of society could not account for racial differences, so the races must have come from distinct, separate stocks.&lt;ref name=Jackson05_39&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=John P.|last2=Weidman|first2=Nadine M.|title=Race, Racism, and Science: Social Impact and Interaction|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|pages=39–41|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Carl Linnaeus====
[[File:Urville-Patagonians3.jpg|thumb|upright|''Homo monstrosus'', or Patagonian giants, from ''Voyage au pole sud et dans l'Océanie'' (''Voyage to the South Pole, and in Oceania''), by [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]]]

[[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778), the Swedish physician, botanist, and zoologist, modified the established [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] bases of [[binomial nomenclature]] for fauna and flora, and was a pioneer researcher in biologically defining ''human race''. In ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1767), he labeled five&lt;ref&gt;Initially, Linnaeus had only described four categories: ''Europseus albus, Americanus rubescens, Asiaticus fuscus, &amp; Africanus niger''. Only later editions included the "Monstrosus".&lt;/ref&gt; "''[[Variety (botany)|varieties]]''"&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus did not use the term "race." He used the term ''"Homo variat"'', as can be seen in Systema naturae, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gloria Ramon (2002), [http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/biology/b103/f00/web2/ramon2.html "Race: Social Concept, Biological Idea"]&lt;/ref&gt; of human species.
Each one was described as possessing the following physiognomic characteristics ''"varying by culture and place"'':&lt;ref&gt;Linnaeus used the Latin term: ''diurnus, varians cultura, loco:''  [https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;id=-eIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor%3ACarl+von+Linn%C3%A9+%22diurnus%2C+varians+cultura%2C+loco%22&amp;q=Mammalia.+Primates.+Homo#v=snippet&amp;q=Mammalia.%20Primates.%20Homo&amp;f=false ''Systema Naturae,'' 13th edition, p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Americanus'': red, choleraic, righteous; black, straight, thick hair; stubborn, zealous, free; painting himself with red lines, and regulated by customs.&lt;ref&gt;In latin: ''rufus, cholericus, rectus. Pilis: nigris, rectis, crassis. Naribus: Patulis. Facie: ephelitica. Mento: subimberbi. Pertinax, contentus, liber. Pingit: Se lineis daedaleis rubris. Regitur Consuetudine.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeanus]]'': white, sanguine, browny; with abundant, long hair; blue eyes; gentle, acute, inventive; covered with close vestments; and governed by laws.&lt;ref&gt;In latin: ''albus, sanguineus, torosus. Pilis flavescentibus, prolixis. Oculis caeruleis. Levis, argutus, inventor. Tegitur Vestimentis arctis. Regitur Ritibus.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Asiaticus'': yellow, melancholic, stiff; black hair, dark eyes; severe, haughty, greedy; covered with loose clothing; and ruled by opinions.&lt;ref&gt;In latin: ''luridus, melancholicus, rigidus. Pilis nigricantibus. Oculis fuscis. Severus, fastuosus, avarus. Tegitur Indumentis laxis. Regitur Opinionibus.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Afer'' or ''Africanus'': black, phlegmatic, relaxed; black, frizzled hair; silky skin, flat nose, tumid lips; females without shame; mammary glands give milk abundantly; crafty, sly, lazy, cunning, lustful, careless; anoints himself with grease; and governed by caprice.&lt;ref&gt;In latin: ''niger, phlegmaticus, laxus. Pilis atris, contortuplicatis. Cute holosericea. Naso simo. Labiis tumidis. Feminis sinus pudoris. Mammae lactantes prolixae. Vafer, segnis, negligens. Ungit se pingui. Regitur Arbitrio.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Monstrosus'' were mythologic humans which didn't appear in the first editions of ''Systema Naturae.''   The sub-species included the "four-footed, mute, hairy" ''Homo feralis'' (''Feral man''); the animal-reared ''Juvenis lupinus hessensis'' (Hessian [[Feral child|wolf boy]]), the ''Juvenis hannoveranus'' ([[Peter the Wild Boy|Hannoverian boy]]), the ''Puella campanica'' ([[Marie-Angélique Memmie Le Blanc|Wild-girl of Champagne]]), and the agile, but faint-hearted ''Homo monstrosus'' (''Monstrous man''): the [[Patagon|Patagonian giant]], the Dwarf of the Alps, and the [[monorchid]] [[Khoikhoi]] (Hottentot).  In ''Amoenitates academicae'' (1763), Linnaeus presented the [[mythology|mythologic]] ''Homo anthropomorpha'' (''Anthropomorphic man''), humanoid creatures, such as the [[Troglodytae|troglodyte]], the [[satyr]], the [[Lernaean Hydra|hydra]], and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], incorrectly identified as [[Ape|simian]] creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reid|first=Gordon McGregor|date=2009|title=Carolus Linnaeus (1707–1778): His Life, Philosophy and Science and Its Relationship to Modern Biology and Medicine|journal=Taxon|volume=58|issue=1|pages=18–31|jstor=27756820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are disagreements about what was the basis for Linnaeus' human taxa. On the one hand, the harshest critics say that the classification not only was ethnocentric but seemed to be based upon skin-color. On the other hand, Quintyn (2010) points out that some authors believe the classification was based upon geographical distribution, being cartographically based, and not hierarchical.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad B. Quintyn (2010), "The Existence Or Non-existence of Race?, Teneo Press p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Paleontologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (1994) argues that the taxa was ''"not in the ranked order favored by most Europeans in the racist tradition"'', and that Linnaeus' division was influenced by the medical [[Humorism|theory of humors]] which said that a person's temperament may be related to biological fluids.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S.J. (1981), The mismeasure of man. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rachel N. Hastings (2008), "Black Eyez: Memoirs of a Revolutionary", p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of Kenneth A.R. Kennedy (1976), Linneus certainly considered his own culture better, but his motives for classification of human varieties were not race-centered.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth A.R. Kennedy (1976), "Human Variation in Space and Time". Wm. C. Brown Company, p. 25. Kennedy writes that while ''"Linnaes was the first to use biological traits as a basis for further subdivisions of the species into varieties. It would be unfair to ascribe racist motives to this effort."''&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Linnean Society of London]] has stated that in Linnaeus' view, ''"Europeans' superiority resides in "[[culture]]"'', and that the decisive factor in Linnaeus' taxa was "culture", ''not'' race. Thus, regarding this topic, they consider Linnaeus view as merely "[[eurocentric]]", arguing that Linnaeus never called for racist action, and did not use the word "race", which was only introduced later "by his French opponent [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mary J. Morris &amp; Leonie Berwick (2008), ''[http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/Other/Special%20Issue%208%20-%20The%20Linneaen%20Legacy.pdf The Linnaean Legacy: Three Centuries after his brith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513171426/http://www.linnean.org/Resources/LinneanSociety/Documents/Publications/Other/Special%20Issue%208%20-%20The%20Linneaen%20Legacy.pdf |date=2013-05-13 }}'', A forum for natural history. The Linnean Special Issue No. 8. [[Linnean Society of London]], Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. ''Was Linnaeus a racist?'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Stanley A. Rice agrees that Linnaeus' classification was not meant to "imply a hierarchy of humanness or superiority";&lt;ref&gt;Stanley A. Rice (2009), "Encyclopedia of Evolution", Infobase Publishing, p. 195. Stanley states: ''"Even though the prejudice and racism of the attributes are obvious to modern scientists, Linnaeus did not apparently mean to imply a hierarchy of humanness or superiority."''&lt;/ref&gt; although modern critics see that his classification was obviously [[stereotype]]d, and erroneous for having included [[anthropological]], non-biological features such as customs or [[tradition]]s.

====John Hunter====
[[John Hunter (Surgeon)|John Hunter]] (1728–1793), a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[surgeon]], said that originally the Negroid race was white at birth. He thought that over time because of the sun, the people turned dark skinned, or "black". Hunter also said that blisters and burns would likely turn white on a Negro, which he believed was evidence that their ancestors were originally white.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Charles White====
[[Charles White (physician)|Charles White]] (1728–1813), an English physician and surgeon, believed that races occupied different stations in the "[[Great Chain of Being]]", and he tried to scientifically prove that human races have distinct origins from each other. He believed that whites and Negroes were two different species. White was a believer in [[polygenism|polygeny]], the idea that different races had been created separately. His ''Account of the Regular Gradation in Man'' (1799) provided an empirical basis for this idea. White defended the theory of polygeny by rebutting French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]]'s interfertility argument, which said that only the same species can interbreed. White pointed to species hybrids such as foxes, wolves, and jackals, which were separate groups that were still able to interbreed. For White, each race was a separate species, divinely created for its own geographical region.&lt;ref name=Jackson05_39/&gt;

[[File:Johann Friedrich Blumenbach.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]

====Buffon and Blumenbach====
The French naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) and the German anatomist [[Johann Blumenbach]] (1752–1840) were believers in [[monogenism]], the concept that all races have a single origin. They also believed in the "degeneration theory" of racial origins. They both said that [[Adam and Eve]] were [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] and that other races came about by degeneration from environmental factors, such as the sun and poor dieting. They believed that the degeneration could be reversed if proper environmental control was taken, and that all contemporary forms of man could revert to the original Caucasian race.&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite book|first=Marvin|last=Harris|title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture|year=2001|page=84|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They thought Negroid [[pigmentation]] arose because of the heat of the tropical sun. They suggested cold wind caused the tawny colour of the [[Eskimos]]. They thought the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] relatively fair skinned compared to the other Asian stocks because they kept mostly in towns and were protected from environmental factors. Buffon said that food and the mode of living could make races degenerate and differentiate them from the original Caucasian race.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; According to Blumenbach, there are five races, all belonging to a single species: [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]], [[Ethiopia]]n, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American]], and [[Malays (ethic group)|Malay]]. Blumenbach said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I have allotted the first place to the Caucasian for the reasons given below which make me esteem it the primeval one."&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze, ''Race and the Enlightenment: A Reader,'' 1997, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Buffon believed [[human]]ity was only 6000 years old (the time since [[Adam]]). Many scientific racialists pointed out at the time that it would have been difficult for races to change so markedly in [[genotype]] and [[phenotype]] in such a short period of time. Believing in monogenism, Buffon thought that skin colour could change in a single lifetime, depending on the conditions of climate and diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Benjamin Rush====
[[Benjamin Rush]] (1745–1813), a [[Founding Father of the United States]] and a [[physician]], proposed that being black was a hereditary skin disease, which he called "negroidism", and that it could be cured. Rush believed non-whites were really white underneath but they were stricken with a non-contagious form of leprosy which darkened their skin color. Rush drew the conclusion that "whites should not tyrannize over [blacks], for their disease should entitle them to a double portion of humanity. However, by the same token, whites should not intermarry with them, for this would tend to infect posterity with the 'disorder'... attempts must be made to cure the disease".&lt;ref&gt;Rush, Benjamin (1799). "Observations Intended to Favour a Supposition That the Black Color (As It Is Called) of the Negroes Is Derived from the Leprosy". Transactions of the American Philosophical Society 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christoph Meiners====
[[File:Christoph Meiners.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Christoph Meiners]]

[[Christoph Meiners]] (1747–1810) was a German [[polygenist]] and believed that each race had a separate origin. Meiner studied the physical, mental and moral characteristics of each race, and built a race hierarchy based on his findings. Meiners split mankind into two divisions, which he labelled the "beautiful [[white race]]" and the "ugly [[black race]]". In Meiners's book ''The Outline of History of Mankind'', he said that a main characteristic of race is either beauty or ugliness. He thought only the white race to be beautiful. He considered ugly races to be inferior, immoral and animal-like. He said that the dark, ugly peoples were distinct from the white, beautiful peoples by their "sad" lack of virtue and their "terrible vices".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Isaac|2006|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Meiners,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The more intelligent and noble people are by nature, the more adaptable, sensitive, delicate, and soft is their body; on the other hand, the less they possess the capacity and disposition towards virtue, the more they lack adaptability; and not only that, but the less sensitive are their bodies, the more can they tolerate extreme pain or the rapid alteration of heat and cold; when they are exposed to illnesses, the more rapid their recovery from wounds that would be fatal for more sensitive peoples, and the more they can partake of the worst and most indigestible foods ... without noticeable ill effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Meiners said the Negro felt less pain than any other race and lacked in emotions. Meiners wrote that the Negro had thick nerves and thus was not sensitive like the other races. He went as far as to say that the Negro has "no human, barely any animal, feeling". He described a story where a Negro was condemned to death by being burned alive. Halfway through the burning, the Negro asked to smoke a pipe and smoked it like nothing was happening while he continued to be burned alive. Meiners studied the [[anatomy]] of the Negro and came to the conclusion that Negroes have bigger teeth and jaws than any other race, as Negroes are all [[carnivores]]. Meiners claimed the skull of the Negro was larger but the brain of the Negro was smaller than any other race. Meiners claimed the Negro was the most unhealthy race on Earth because of  its poor diet, mode of living and lack of morals.&lt;ref name=Gupta07&gt;{{cite book|author=Das Gupta, Tania|title=Race and Racialization: Essential Readings|year=2007|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meiners also claimed the "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Americans]]" were an inferior stock of people. He said they could not adapt to different climates, types of food, or modes of life, and that when exposed to such new conditions, they lapse into a "deadly melancholy".
Meiners studied the diet of the Americans and said they fed off any kind of "foul offal". He thought they consumed very much alcohol. He believed their skulls were so thick that the blades of Spanish swords shattered on them. Meiners also claimed the skin of an American is thicker than that of an ox.&lt;ref name=Gupta07/&gt;

Meiners wrote that the noblest race was the [[Celts]]. They were able to conquer various parts of the world, they were more sensitive to heat and cold, and their delicacy is shown by the way they are selective about what they eat. Meiners claimed that [[Slavs]] are an inferior race, "less sensitive and content with eating rough food". He described stories of Slavs allegedly eating poisonous fungi without coming to any harm. He claimed that their medical techniques were also backward: he used as an example their heating sick people in ovens, then making them roll in the snow.&lt;ref name=Gupta07/&gt;

In Meiners's large work entitled ''Researches on the Variations in Human Nature'' (1815), he studied also the [[sexology]] of each race. He claimed that the African Negroids have unduly strong and perverted sex drives, whilst only the white Europeans have it just right.

===Later thinkers===

====Thomas Jefferson====
[[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743–1826) was an American politician, scientist,&lt;ref&gt;[Thomas Jefferson, Scientist by Travis Martin](https://allthingsliberty.com/2015/08/thomas-jefferson-scientist/)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Thomas Jefferson: Founding Father of Science by Ross Pomeroy](https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2012/02/thomas-jefferson-citizen-scientist.html)&lt;/ref&gt; and slave owner. His contributions to scientific racism have been noted by many historians, scientists and scholars. According to an article published in the McGill Journal of Medicine: "One of the most influential pre-Darwinian racial theorists, Jefferson’s call for science to determine the obvious “inferiority” of African Americans is an extremely important stage in the evolution of scientific racism.&lt;ref&gt;[''A Brave Old World: An Analysis of Scientific Racism and BiDil'' by Joel Z. Garrod](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2687899/)&lt;/ref&gt;" The historian [[Paul Finkelman]] described Jefferson in [[The New York Times]] as follows: "A scientist, Jefferson nevertheless speculated that blackness might come “from the color of the blood” and concluded that blacks were “inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind.”&lt;ref&gt;["The Monster of Monticello" by Paul Finkelman](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/01/opinion/the-real-thomas-jefferson.html?pagewanted=all)&lt;/ref&gt;" In his "[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]" Jefferson described black people as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They seem to require less sleep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements to sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out with the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave, and more adventuresome. But this may perhaps proceed from a want of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present. When present, they do not go through it with more coolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection... Comparing them by their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason much inferior, as I think one [black] could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and that in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous... I advance it therefore as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether originally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances, are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]], ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, by 1791, Jefferson had to reassess his earlier suspicions of whether blacks were capable of intelligence when he was presented with a letter and almanac from [[Benjamin Banneker]], an educated black mathematician. Delighted to have discovered scientific proof for the existence of black intelligence, Jefferson wrote to Banneker:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No body wishes more than I do to see such proofs as you exhibit, that nature has given to our black brethren, talents equal to those of the other colors of men, &amp; that the appearance of a want of them is owing merely to the degraded condition of their existence both in Africa &amp; America. I can add with truth that no body wishes more ardently to see a good system commenced for raising the condition both of their body &amp; mind to what it ought to be, as fast as the imbecility of their present existence, and other circumstance which cannot be neglected, will admit. &lt;ref&gt; (Jefferson’s Letter to Benjamin Banneker, August 30, 1791. Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol 22, 6 August 1791 – 31 December 1791, ed. Charles T. Cullen. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986, pp. 49–54.)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Samuel Stanhope Smith====
[[Samuel Stanhope Smith]] (1751–1819) was an American Presbyterian Minister and author of ''Essay on the Causes of Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species'' in 1787. Smith claimed that Negro pigmentation was nothing more than a huge freckle that covered the whole body as a result of an oversupply of bile, which was caused by tropical climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Georges Cuvier====
[[File:Georges Cuvier large.jpg|thumb|upright|Georges Cuvier]]
Racial studies by [[Georges Cuvier]] (1769–1832), the French [[naturalist]] and [[zoologist]], influenced scientific [[polygenism]] and scientific racism. Cuvier believed there were three distinct races: the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] (white), [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]] (yellow) and the [[Ethiopia]]n (black). He rated each for the beauty or ugliness of the skull and quality of their civilizations. Cuvier wrote about Caucasians: "The white race, with oval face, straight hair and nose, to which the civilised people of Europe belong and which appear to us the most beautiful of all, is also superior to others by its genius, courage and activity".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Cuvier, ''Tableau elementaire de l'histoire naturelle des animaux'' (Paris, 1798) p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Negroes, Cuvier wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Negro race ... is marked by black complexion, crisped or woolly hair, compressed cranium and a flat nose. The projection of the lower parts of the face, and the thick lips, evidently approximate it to the monkey tribe: the hordes of which it consists have always remained in the most complete state of barbarism.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Cuvier, ''The Animal Kingdom: Arranged in Conformity with its Organization,'' Translated from the French by H.M. Murtrie, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He thought [[Adam and Eve]] were Caucasian and hence the original race of mankind. The other two races arose by survivors' escaping in different directions after a major catastrophe hit the earth 5,000 years ago.

One of Cuvier's pupils, [[Friedrich Tiedemann]], was one of the first to make a scientific contestation of racism. He argued based on craniometric and brain measurements taken by him from Europeans and black people from different parts of the world that the then-common European belief that Negroes have smaller brains, and are thus intellectually inferior, is scientifically unfounded and based merely on the prejudice of travellers and explorers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tiedemann, Friedrich|title=On the Brain of the Negro, Compared with that of the European and the Orang-outang|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=126|pages=497–527|year=1836|url=http://laboratoriogene.info/Ciencia_Hoje/Tiedemann_1836.pdf|format=PDF|bibcode=1836RSPT..126..497T|doi=10.1098/rstl.1836.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arthur Schopenhauer====
[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer by J Schäfer, 1859b.jpg|thumb|140px|Arthur Schopenhauer portrait]]
The German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860) attributed civilizational primacy to the white races, who gained sensitivity and intelligence via the refinement caused by living in the rigorous Northern climate:

&lt;blockquote&gt; The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient [[Hindus]] and [[Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste, or race, is fairer in colour than the rest, and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the [[Brahmin]]s, the [[Inca Empire|Inca]], and the rulers of the [[Polynesia|South Sea Islands]]. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention, because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers, and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want, and misery, which, in their many forms, were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] of nature, and out of it all came their high civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], ''Parerga and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Franz Ignaz Pruner====
[[Franz Ignaz Pruner]] (1808–1882) was a medical doctor who studied the racial structure of Negroes in Egypt. In a book which he wrote in 1846 he claimed that Negro blood had a negative influence on the Egyptian moral character. He published a monograph on Negroes in 1861. He claimed that the main feature of the Negro's skeleton is [[prognathism]], which he claimed was the Negro's relation to the ape. He also claimed that Negroes had very similar brains to apes and that Negroes have a shortened big toe, which is a characteristic connecting Negroes closely to apes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gustav Jahoda]], ''Images of Savages: Ancients [sic] Roots of Modern Prejudice in Western Culture'', 1999, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[scientific classification]] established by Carl Linnaeus is requisite to any human racial classification scheme. In the 19th century, [[unilineal evolution]] (a.k.a. classical social evolution) was a conflation of competing sociologic and anthropologic theories proposing that Western European culture was the acme of human socio-cultural evolution. The proposal that social status is unilineal—from primitive to civilized, from agricultural to industrial—became popular among philosophers, including [[Friedrich Hegel]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Auguste Comte]]. The Christian [[Bible]] was interpreted to sanction [[slavery]] and from the 1820s to the 1850s was often used in the [[History of the United States (1789–1849)|antebellum]] [[Southern United States]], by writers such as the Rev. [[Richard Furman]] and [[Thomas R. Cobb]], to enforce the idea that Negroes had been created inferior, and thus suited to slavery.&lt;ref name=drace/&gt;

===Charles Darwin===
[[File:Charles Darwin 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Charles Darwin in 1868]]
[[Charles Darwin]]'s influential 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' did not discuss human origins. The extended wording on the title page, which adds ''by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life'', uses the general term "[[Race (biology)|races]]" as an alternative for "[[Variety (botany)|varieties]]" and does not carry the modern connotation of [[Race (classification of human beings)|human races]]. The first use in the book refers to "the several races, for instance, of the cabbage" and proceeds to a discussion of "the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=30 15]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'' (1871), Darwin examined the question of "Arguments in favour of, and opposed to, ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species" and reported no racial distinctions that would indicate that human races are discrete species:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It may be doubted whether any character can be named, which is distinctive of a race and is constant ... they graduate into each other, and ... it is hardly possible to discover clear, distinctive characters between them ... As it is improbable that the numerous, and unimportant, points of resemblance, between the several races of man, in bodily structure and mental faculties (I do not here refer to similar customs) should all have been independently acquired, they must have been inherited from progenitors who had these same characters.&lt;ref name=drace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/darwin_nazism.htm|title=The Mis-portrayal of Darwin as a Racist|accessdate=2008-01-06|last=Price|first=R.G.|date=June 24, 2006|publisher=rationalrevolution.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant... they graduate into each other, and.. it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them...

[[Richard Weikart]], in his book ''[[From Darwin to Hitler]]: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics and Racism in Germany'' (2004), claims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Darwin clearly believed that the struggle for existence among humans would result in racial extermination. In ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|Descent of Man]]'' he asserted, "At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Weikart, ''From Darwin to Hitler'', p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also cited by Richard Weikart in [http://www.evolutionnews.org/2008/02/reexamining_the_darwinhitler_l.html Re-examining the Darwin–Hitler Link] [[Discovery Institute]], February 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also cited by Richard Weikart in [http://www.discovery.org/a/5069 Was It Immoral for "Expelled" to Connect Darwinism and Nazi Racism?] [[Discovery Institute]], May 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also cited by Richard Weikart in "[http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13061 Darwin and the Nazis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919222236/http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=13061 |date=2008-09-19 }}," [[The American Spectator]], April 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also cited by Richard Weikart in [http://www.stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XL/Issue_7/Features/features2.shtml The Impact of Darwinism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090917060508/http://stanfordreview.org/Archive/Volume_XL/Issue_7/Features/features2.shtml |date=2009-09-17 }} [[The Stanford Review]] April 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[talk.origins]], this is a common creationist [[quote mine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/part2.html|title=Quote Mine Project: Darwin Quotes|website=www.talkorigins.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that when Darwin referred to "race" he meant "varieties", not human races,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA005_2.html|title=CA005.2:  "Preservation of favoured races".|first=Mark|last=Isaak|website=www.talkorigins.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as per the cabbage example cited above. Apart from the plain meaning of the words, they assert "there is nothing in Darwin's words to support (and much in his life to contradict) any claim that Darwin wanted the 'lower' or 'savage races' to be exterminated. He was merely noting what appeared to him to be factual, based in no small part on the evidence of a European binge of imperialism and colonial conquest during his lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/part4.html#DarwinRaceQuotes|title=Quote Mine Project: Assorted Quotes|website=www.talkorigins.org|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quoted passage, in full context, reads:

{{Quote|The great break in the organic chain between man and his nearest allies, which cannot be bridged over by any extinct or living species, has often been advanced as a grave objection to the belief that man is descended from some lower form; but this objection will not appear of much weight to those who, from general reasons, believe in the general principle of evolution. Breaks often occur in all parts of the series, some being wide, sharp and defined, others less so in various degrees; as between the [[Orangutan|orang]] and its nearest allies—between the [[Tarsius]] and the other [[Lemuridae]] between the elephant, and in a more striking manner between the [[Ornithorhynchus]] or [[Echidna]], and all other mammals. But these breaks depend merely on the number of related forms which have become extinct. At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as [[Hermann Schaaffhausen|Professor Schaaffhausen]] has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a [[baboon]], instead of as now between the negro or Australian and the [[gorilla]].|''The Descent of Man'' (1871), Volume I, Chapter VI: "On the Affinities and Genealogy of Man", pp. 200–01}}

In the Chapter "''On the Development of the Intellectual and Moral Faculties during Primeval and Civilised Times''" Darwin claimed that "the western nations of Europe, who now so immeasurably surpass their former savage progenitors, and stand at the summit of civilisation, owe little or none of their superiority to direct inheritance from the old Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;The Descent of Man, (Second edition, 1874) p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

While proposing a sole human species, Darwin contrasted the "civilized races" with the "savage races". Like most of his contemporaries, except the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], he did not distinguish "biological race" from "cultural race". Moreover, he noted that savage races risked extinction more from white European [[colonialism]], than from evolutionary inadequacy.&lt;ref name=drace/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/mine/part4.html#DarwinRaceQuotes|title=Quote Mine Project: Assorted Quotes|accessdate=2007-12-29|publisher=[[TalkOrigins Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of differences between races, Darwin wrote:

{{Quote|There is, however, no doubt that the various races, when carefully compared and measured, differ much from each other,—as in the texture of the hair, the relative proportions of all parts of the body, the capacity of the lungs, the form and capacity of the skull, and even in the convolutions of the brain. But it would be an endless task to specify the numerous points of structural difference. The races differ also in constitution, in acclimatisation, and in liability to certain diseases. Their mental characteristics are likewise very distinct; chiefly as it would appear in their emotional, but partly in their intellectual, faculties. Every one who has had the opportunity of comparison, must have been struck with the contrast between the taciturn, even morose, aborigines of S. America and the light-hearted, talkative negroes. There is a nearly similar contrast between the Malays and the Papuans, who live under the same physical conditions, and are separated from each other only by a narrow space of sea.&lt;ref&gt;''The Descent of Man'', (First edition, 1871) pp. 216–17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Arthur de Gobineau===
[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Arthur de Gobineau]] by the Comtesse de la Tour, 1876]]
The French aristocrat and writer [[Arthur de Gobineau]] (1816–1882), is best known for his book ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]'' (1853–55) which proposed three human races (black, white and yellow) were natural barriers and claimed that [[miscegenation|race mixing]] would lead to the collapse of culture and civilization. He claimed that "The white race originally possessed the monopoly of beauty, intelligence and strength" and that any positive accomplishments or thinking of blacks and Asians were due to an admixture with whites. His works were praised by many white supremacist American pro-slavery thinkers such as Josiah C. Nott and Henry Hotze.

Gobineau believed that the different races originated in different areas, the white race had originated somewhere in Siberia, the Asians in the Americas and the blacks in Africa. He believed that the white race was superior, writing:
{{quote|I will not wait for the friends of equality to show me such and such passages in books written by missionaries or sea captains, who declare some Wolof is a fine carpenter, some Hottentot a good servant, that a Kaffir dances and plays the violin, that some Bambara knows arithmetic… Let us leave aside these puerilities and compare together not men, but groups.&lt;ref&gt;D'Souza, Dinesh "Is Racism a Western Idea?" pp. 517–39 from The American Scholar, Vol. 64, No. 4 Autumn 1995, p.538&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gobineau later used the term "[[Aryan race|Aryans]]" to describe the Germanic peoples (''la race germanique'').&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Woodman, 2009, ''The Cambridge Companion to Tacitus'', p. 294. (The Germanic race was also regarded by Gobineau as beautiful, honourable and destined to rule: 'cette illustre famille humaine, la plus noble'. While ''[[Aryan|arya]]'' was originally an [[endonym]] used only by [[Indo-Iranians]], "Aryan" became, partly because of the ''Essai'' a racial designation of a race, which Gobineau specified as 'la race germanique'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gobineau's works were also influential to the [[Nazi Party]], which published his works in German.  They played a key role in the [[master race]] theory of [[Nazism]].

===Karl Vogt===
Another [[polygenist]] evolutionist was [[Karl Vogt]] (1817–1895) who believed that the Negro race was related to the ape. He wrote the white race was a separate species to Negroes. In Chapter VII of his ''lectures of man'' (1864) he compared the Negro to the white race whom he described as "two extreme human types". The difference between them, he claimed are greater than those between two species of ape; and this proves that Negroes are a separate species from the whites.&lt;ref name="GustavJahoda" /&gt;

===Herbert Hope Risley===
[[File:H H Risley.png|thumb|upright|Herbert Hope Risley|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a man.]]
As an exponent of race science, Colonial administrator [[Herbert Hope Risley]] (1851–1911) used the ratio of the width of a [[nose]] to its height to divide [[Indian people]] into Aryan and Dravidian races, as well as seven castes.{{sfnp|Trautmann|1997|=p=203|ps=}}{{sfnp|Walsh|2011|=p=171|ps=}}

===Ernst Haeckel===
[[File:ErnstHaeckel.jpg|thumb|upright|Ernst Haeckel]]

Like most of Darwin's supporters, [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834–1919) put forward a doctrine of evolutionary [[polygenism]] based on the ideas of the linguist and polygenist [[August Schleicher]], in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman ''Urmenschen'' (German for "original humans"), which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. Haeckel divided human beings into ten races, of which the Caucasian was the highest and the primitives were doomed to extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|Weidman|2005|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haeckel was also an advocate of the [[out of Asia theory]] by writing that the origin of humanity was to be found in [[Asia]]; he believed that [[Hindustan]] (South Asia) was the actual location where the first humans had evolved. Haeckel argued that humans were closely related to the primates of Southeast Asia and rejected Darwin's hypothesis of [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palmer, Douglas|title=Prehistoric Past Revealed: The Four Billion Year History of Life on Earth|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=2006|page=43|isbn=978-0520248274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Regal, Brian|title=Human Evolution: A Guide to the Debates|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|year=2004|pages=73–75|isbn=978-1851094189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haeckel also wrote that Negroes have stronger and more freely movable toes than any other race which is evidence that Negroes are related to apes because when apes stop climbing in trees they hold on to the trees with their toes, Haeckel compared Negroes to "four-handed" apes. Haeckel also believed Negroes were savages and that whites were the most civilised.&lt;ref name="GustavJahoda"&gt;[[Gustav Jahoda]], ''Images of Savages: Ancients [sic] Roots of Modern Prejudice in Western Culture'', 1999, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism: de Lapouge and Herder===
At the 19th century's end, scientific racism conflated Græco–Roman eugenicism with [[Francis Galton]]'s concept of voluntary [[eugenics]] to produce a form of coercive, anti-immigrant government programs influenced by other socio-political [[discourse]]s and events. Such institutional racism was effected via [[Phrenology]], telling character from physiognomy; [[craniometry|craniometric]] skull and skeleton studies; thus skulls and skeletons of black people and other colored ''volk'', were displayed between apes and white men.

In 1906, [[Ota Benga]], a [[Pygmies|Pygmy]], was displayed as the "Missing Link", in the [[Bronx Zoo]], New York City, alongside apes and animals. The most influential theorists included the anthropologist [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936) who proposed "anthroposociology"; and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803), who applied "race" to [[nationalist]] theory, thereby developing the first conception of [[ethnic nationalism]]. In 1882, [[Ernest Renan]] contradicted Herder with a nationalism based upon the "will to live together", not founded upon ethnic or racial prerequisites. Scientific racist discourse posited the historical existence of "national races" such as the ''[[German people|Deutsche Volk]]'' in Germany, and the "French race" being a branch of the basal "[[Aryan race]]" extant for millennia, to advocate for [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] borders parallel to the racial ones.

===Craniometry and physical anthropology===
{{Further|Craniometry |physical anthropology}}
[[File:Petrus-Camper-(professor).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Pieter Camper]]

The Dutch scholar [[Pieter Camper]] (1722–89), an early craniometric theoretician, used "craniometry" (interior skull-volume measurement) to scientifically justify racial differences. In 1770, he conceived of the [[facial angle]] to measure intelligence among species of men. The facial angle was formed by drawing two lines: a horizontal line from nostril to ear; and a vertical line from the upper-jawbone prominence to the forehead prominence. Camper's craniometry reported that antique statues (the Græco–Roman ideal) had a 90-degree facial angle, whites an 80-degree angle, blacks a 70-degree angle, and the [[orangutan]] a 58-degree facial angle—thus he established a racist biological hierarchy for mankind, per the [[decadence|Decadent]] conception of history. Such scientific racist researches were continued by the naturalist [[Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] (1772–1844) and the anthropologist [[Paul Broca]] (1824–1880).

====Samuel George Morton====
[[File:Morton drawing.png|right|thumb|Racialist differences: "a Negro head ... a Caucasian skull ... a Mongol head", [[Samuel George Morton]], 1839.]]

In the 19th century, an early American [[Physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]], physician and polygenist [[Samuel George Morton]] (1799–1851), collected human skulls from worldwide, and attempted a logical classification scheme. Influenced by contemporary racialist theory, Dr Morton said he could judge racial intellectual capacity by measuring the interior [[cranial capacity]], hence a large skull denoted a large brain, thus high [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] capacity. Conversely, a small skull denoted a small brain, thus low intellectual capacity; superior and inferior established. After inspecting three mummies from ancient Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the bible indicated that [[Noah's Ark]] had washed up on [[Mount Ararat]] only a thousand years earlier, Morton claimed that Noah's sons could not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.&lt;ref name="DavidHurst"&gt;David Hurst Thomas, ''Skull Wars: Kennewick Man, Archaeology, And The Battle For Native American Identity'', 2001, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt;

In Morton's ''Crania Americana'', his claims were based on [[Craniometry]] data, that the Caucasians had the biggest brains, averaging 87 cubic inches, Native Americans were in the middle with an average of 82 cubic inches and Negroes had the smallest brains with an average of 78 cubic inches.&lt;ref name="DavidHurst" /&gt;

In ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981), the [[History of science|historian of science]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that Samuel Morton had falsified the craniometric data, perhaps inadvertently over-packing some skulls, to so produce results that would legitimize the racist presumptions he was attempting to prove. A subsequent study by the [[anthropologist]] John Michael found Morton's original data to be more accurate than Gould describes, concluding that "[c]ontrary to Gould's interpretation... Morton's research was conducted with integrity".&lt;ref name="jsmichael"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michael, J.S.|title=A New Look at Morton's Craniological Research|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=29|issue=2|pages=349–54|year=1988|doi=10.1086/203646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Lewis and colleagues reached similar conclusions as Michael in their reanalysis of Morton's skull collection; however, they depart from Morton's racist conclusions by adding that "studies have demonstrated that modern human variation is generally continuous, rather than discrete or "racial," and that most variation in modern humans is within, rather than between, populations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mismeasure of Science: Stephen Jay Gould versus Samuel George Morton on Skulls and Bias|year=2011|journal=PLoS Biology |volume=9|issue=6|pages=e1001071+|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001071|last1=Lewis|first1=Jason E.|last2=Degusta|first2=David|last3=Meyer|first3=Marc R.|last4=Monge|first4=Janet M.|last5=Mann|first5=Alan E.|last6=Holloway|first6=Ralph L.|pmid=21666803|pmc=3110184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, Paul Broca, founder of the Anthropological Society of Paris (1859), found the same pattern of measures—that ''Crania Americana'' reported—by weighing specimen brains at [[autopsy]]. Other historical studies, proposing a black race–white race, intelligence–brain size difference, include those by Bean (1906), Mall (1909), Pearl (1934), and Vint (1934).

===Nicolás Palacios===
After the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83) there was a rise of racial and national superiority ideas among the Chilean ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Ericka Beckman ''Imperial Impersonations: Chilean Racism and the War of the Pacific'', University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1918 book physician [[Nicolás Palacios]] argued for the existence of [[Chilean people|Chilean]] race and its superiority when compared to neighboring peoples. He thought Chileans were a mix of two [[martial race]]s: the indigenous [[Mapuche]]s and the [[Visigoth]]s of Spain, who descended ultimately from [[Götaland]] in Sweden. Palacios argued on medical grounds against immigration to Chile from southern Europe claiming that [[Mestizo]]s who are of south European stock lack "cerebral control" and are a social burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Monogenism and polygenism===
{{Further|Monogenism |Polygenism}}

Samuel Morton's followers, especially Dr [[Josiah C. Nott]] (1804–1873) and [[George Gliddon]] (1809–1857), extended Dr Morton's ideas in ''Types of Mankind'' (1854), claiming that Morton's findings supported the notion of [[polygenism]]—mankind has discrete genetic ancestries; the races are evolutionarily unrelated, and is predecessor of the [[Multiregional origin of modern humans|modern human multiregional origin hypothesis]]. Moreover, Morton himself had been reluctant to espouse polygenism, because it [[Theology|theologically]] challenged the Christian [[creation myth]] espoused in the Bible.

Later, in ''[[The Descent of Man]]'' (1871), Charles Darwin proposed the [[single-origin hypothesis]], i.e., [[monogenism]]—mankind has a common genetic ancestry, the races are related, opposing everything that the polygenism of Nott and Gliddon proposed.

One of the first [[typology (anthropology)|typologies]] used to classify various human races was invented by [[Georges Vacher de Lapouge]] (1854–1936), a theoretician of [[eugenics]], who published in 1899 ''L'Aryen et son rôle social'' (1899 – "The [[Aryan]] and his social role"). In this book, he classified humanity into various, hierarchized races, spanning from the "Aryan white race, dolichocephalic", to the "brachycephalic", "mediocre and inert" race, best represented by Southern European, Catholic peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The end of the soul : scientific modernity, atheism, and anthropology in France|last=1965–|first=Hecht, Jennifer Michael,|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0231128469|location=New York|page=171|oclc=53118940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between these, Vacher de Lapouge identified the "''[[Nordic theory|Homo europaeus]]''" (Teutonic, Protestant, etc.), the "''[[Homo alpinus]]''" ([[Auvergne (province)|Auvergnat]], [[Turkish people|Turkish]], etc.), and finally the "''[[Homo mediterraneus]]''" ([[Naples|Neapolitan]], [[Andalusia|Andalus]], etc.) Jews were brachycephalic like the Aryans, according to Lapouge; but exactly for this reason he considered them to be dangerous; they were the only group, he thought, threatening to displace the Aryan aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The end of the soul : scientific modernity, atheism, and anthropology in France|last=1965-|first=Hecht, Jennifer Michael,|date=2003|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0231128469|location=New York|pages=171–72|oclc=53118940}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vacher de Lapouge became one of the leading inspirators of [[Nazi]] [[antisemitism]] and [[Nazi racial policies|Nazi racist ideology]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], ''La couleur et le sang&amp;nbsp;– Doctrines racistes à la française'' ("Colour and Blood&amp;nbsp;– Racist doctrines ''à la française''"), Paris, [[Mille et une nuits]], 2002, 203 pages, and ''La Force du préjugé&amp;nbsp;– Essai sur le racisme et ses doubles'', Tel [[Gallimard]], La Découverte, 1987, 644 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Vacher de Lapouge's classification was mirrored in [[William Z. Ripley]] in ''The Races of Europe'' (1899), a book which had a large influence on American [[white supremacism]]. Ripley even made a map of Europe according to the alleged [[cephalic index]] of its inhabitants. He was an important influence of the American eugenist [[Madison Grant]].

Furthermore, according to John Efron of [[Indiana University]], the late 19th century also witnessed "the scientizing of [[antisemitism|anti-Jewish prejudice]]", stigmatizing Jews with [[male menstruation]], [[Histrionic personality disorder|pathological hysteria]], and [[nymphomania]].&lt;ref name=Efron&gt;{{harvnb|Efron|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bodek&gt;Richard Bodek.

[[Joseph Deniker]] (1852–1918) was one of [[William Z. Ripley]]'s principal opponents; whereas Ripley maintained, as did Vacher de Lapouge, that the European populace comprised three races, Joseph Deniker proposed that the European populace comprised ten races (six primary and four sub-races). Furthermore, he proposed that the concept of "race" was ambiguous, and in its stead proposed the compound word "[[ethnic group]]", which later prominently featured in the works of [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Alfred C. Haddon]]. Moreover, Ripley argued that Deniker's "race" idea should be denoted a "type", because it was less biologically rigid than most racial classifications.

==Ideological applications==
[[File:Madison Grant.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.6|Madison Grant, creator of the "Nordic race" term]]

===Nordicism===
Joseph Deniker's contribution to racist theory was ''La Race nordique'' (the [[Nordic race]]), a generic, racial-stock descriptor, which the American [[eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Madison Grant]] (1865–1937) presented as the white racial engine of world civilization. Having adopted Ripley's three-race European populace model, but disliking the "Teuton" race name, he transliterated ''la race nordique'' into "The Nordic race", the acme of the concocted racial hierarchy, based upon his racial classification theory, popular in the 1910s and 1920s.

[[Statens institut för rasbiologi]] and its director [[Herman Lundborg]] in [[Sweden]] were active in racist research.  Furthermore, much of early research on [[Ural-Altaic languages]] was coloured by attempts at justifying the view that European peoples east of Sweden were Asian and thus of inferior race, justifying colonialism, eugenics and racial hygiene.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Justification of slavery in the US===
[[File:Samuelcartwright.jpg|thumb|left|Dr Samuel Cartwright, M.D.]]

In the United States, scientific racism justified Black African slavery to assuage moral opposition to the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Alexander Thomas and [[Samuell Sillen]] described black men as uniquely fitted for bondage, because of their "primitive psychological organization".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Thomas and [[Samuell Sillen]] (1972). ''[https://www.jaacap.com/article/S0002-7138(09)61177-8/pdf Racism and Psychiatry]''. New York: Carol Publishing Group.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, in antebellum Louisiana, the physician [[Samuel A. Cartwright]] (1793–1863) wrote of slave escape attempts as "[[drapetomania]]", a treatable [[mental illness]], that "with proper medical advice, strictly followed, this troublesome practice that many Negroes have of running away can be almost entirely prevented". The term ''drapetomania'' (mania of the runaway slave) derives from the Greek δραπέτης (''drapetes'', "a runaway [slave]") and μανία (''mania'', "madness, frenzy")&lt;ref&gt;Samual A. Cartwright, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3106t.html "Diseases and Peculiarities of the Negro Race"], ''[[DeBow's Review]] – Southern and Western States'', Volume XI, New Orleans, 1851&lt;/ref&gt; Cartwright also described ''[[dysaesthesia aethiopica]]'', called "rascality" by overseers. The [[1840 United States Census]] claimed that Northern, free blacks suffered mental illness at higher rates than did their Southern, enslaved counterparts. Though the census was later found to have been severely flawed by the [[American Statistical Association]], to [[John Quincy Adams]] and others it became a political weapon against [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]]. Southern slavers concluded that escaping Negroes were suffering from "mental disorders".&lt;ref name="Higgins, 1994"&gt;Higgins, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the article + references for [[John Wingate Thornton]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65), the matter of [[miscegenation]] prompted studies of ostensible physiological differences between [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and [[Negro]]es. Early [[anthropology|anthropologists]], such as [[Josiah Clark Nott]], [[George Robins Gliddon]], [[Robert Knox]], and [[Samuel George Morton]], aimed to scientifically prove that Negroes were a human species different from the white people species; that the rulers of [[Ancient Egypt]] were not [[Africa]]n; and that mixed-race offspring (the product of miscegenation) tended to physical weakness and infertility. After the Civil War, Southern (Confederacy) physicians wrote textbooks of scientific racism based upon studies claiming that black freemen (ex-slaves) were becoming extinct, because they were inadequate to the demands of being a free man—implying that black people benefited from enslavement.

In ''Medical Apartheid'', Harriet A. Washington noted the prevalence of two different views on blacks in the 19th century: the belief that they were inferior and "riddled with imperfections from head to toe", and the idea that they didn't know true pain and suffering because of their primitive nervous systems (and that slavery was therefore justifiable). Washington noted the failure of scientists to accept the inconsistency between these two viewpoints, writing that "in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientific racism was simply science, and it was promulgated by the very best minds at the most prestigious institutions of the nation. Other, more logical medical theories stressed the equality of Africans and laid poor black health at the feet of their abusers, but these never enjoyed the appeal of the medical philosophy that justified slavery and, along with it, our nation's profitable way of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=apGhwRt6A7QC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Medical Experimentation on Black Americans from Colonial Times to the Present|page=42|last=Washington|first=Harriet A.|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|date=2008|isbn=978-0767929394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the end of the Civil War, some scientists continued to justify the institution of slavery by citing the effect of topography and climate on racial development. [[Nathaniel Shaler]], a prominent geologist at [[Harvard University]] from 1869-1906, published the book ''Man and the Earth'' in 1905 describing the physical geography of different continents and linking these geologic settings to the intelligence and strength of human races that inhabited these spaces. Shaler argued that North American climate and geology was ideally suited for the institution of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Man and the Earth|last=Shaler|first=Nathaniel Southgate|publisher=Duffield &amp; Company|year=1905|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South African apartheid===
{{See also|Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa}}
Scientific racism played a role in establishing [[apartheid]] in [[South Africa]]. In South Africa, white scientists, like Dudly Kidd, who published ''The essential Kafir'' in 1904, sought to "understand the African mind". They believed that the cultural differences between whites and blacks in South Africa might be caused by physiological differences in the brain. Rather than suggesting that Africans were "overgrown children", as early white explorers had, Kidd believed that Africans were "misgrown with a vengeance". He described Africans as at once "hopelessly deficient", yet "very shrewd".&lt;ref name="Dubow"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Saul Dubow|Dubow, Saul]]|title=Scientific Racism in Modern South Africa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1995|isbn=978-0521479073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Carnegie Commission on the Poor White Problem in South Africa]] played a key role in establishing apartheid in South Africa. According to one memorandum sent to Frederick Keppel, then president of the [[Carnegie Corporation]], there was "little doubt that if the natives were given full economic opportunity, the more competent among them would soon outstrip the less competent whites".&lt;ref name="swar"&gt;{{cite book|author=Füredi, Frank|title=The Silent War: Imperialism and the Changing Perception of Race|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|year=1998|pages=66–67|isbn=978-0813526126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keppel's support for the project of creating the report was motivated by his concern with the maintenance of existing racial boundaries.&lt;ref name="swar"/&gt; The preoccupation of the Carnegie Corporation with the so-called poor white problem in South Africa was at least in part the outcome of similar misgivings about the state of poor whites in the southern United States.&lt;ref name="swar"/&gt;

The report was five volumes in length.&lt;ref name="amcentry"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Slater, David |author2=Taylor, Peter J. |title=The American Century: Consensus and Coercion in the Projection of American Power|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|year=1999|page=290|isbn=978-0631212225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the start of the 20th century, white Americans, and whites elsewhere in the world, felt uneasy because poverty and economic depression seemed to strike people regardless of race.&lt;ref name="amcentry"/&gt;

Though the ground work for apartheid began earlier, the report provided support for this central idea of black inferiority. This was used to justify [[racial segregation]] and discrimination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Verbeek, Jennifer|title=Racially Segregated School Libraries in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|volume=18|issue=1|pages=23–46|year=1986|url=http://lis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/23|doi=10.1177/096100068601800102}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the following decades.&lt;ref name="haunted"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stoler, Ann Laura|title=Haunted by Empire: Geographies of Intimacy in North American History|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, NC|year=2006|page=66|isbn=978-0822337249}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report expressed fear about the loss of white racial pride, and in particular pointed to the danger that the poor white would not be able to resist the process of "Africanisation".&lt;ref name="swar"/&gt;

Although scientific racism played a role in justifying and supporting [[institutional racism]] in South Africa, it was not as important in South Africa as it has been in Europe and the United States. This was due in part to the "poor white problem", which raised serious questions for supremacists about white racial superiority.&lt;ref name="Dubow"/&gt; Since poor whites were found to be in the same situation as natives in the African environment, the idea that intrinsic white superiority could overcome any environment did not seem to hold. As such, scientific justifications for racism were not as useful in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Dubow"/&gt;

===Eugenics===
{{Further|Eugenics}}
[[File:Francis Galton2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francis Galton]] in his later years]]
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] described [[Madison Grant]]'s ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916) as "the most influential tract of American scientific racism." In the 1920s–30s, the German [[racial hygiene]] movement embraced Grant's [[Nordic theory]]. [[Alfred Ploetz]] (1860–1940) coined the term ''Rassenhygiene'' in ''Racial Hygiene Basics'' (1895), and founded the [[German Society for Racial Hygiene]] in 1905. The movement advocated [[selective breeding]], [[compulsory sterilization]], and a close alignment of [[public health]] with [[eugenics]].

Racial hygiene was historically tied to traditional notions of [[public health]], but with emphasis on [[heredity]]—what philosopher and historian [[Michel Foucault]] has called [[state racism]]. In 1869, [[Francis Galton]] (1822–1911) proposed the first social measures meant to preserve or enhance biological characteristics, and later coined the term "eugenics". Galton, a [[statistics|statistician]], introduced [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis]] and discovered [[regression toward the mean]]. He was also the first to study human differences and [[inheritance of intelligence]] with statistical methods. He introduced the use of [[questionnaires]] and [[Statistical survey|surveys]] to collect data on [[population]] sets, which he needed for genealogical and biographical works and for [[anthropometrics|anthropometric]] studies. Galton also founded [[psychometrics]], the science of measuring mental faculties, and [[differential psychology]], a branch of psychology concerned with psychological differences between people rather than common traits.

Like scientific racism, eugenics grew popular in the early 20th century, and both ideas influenced [[Nazi racial policies]] and [[Nazi eugenics]]. In 1901, Galton, [[Karl Pearson]] (1857–1936) and [[Walter Frank Raphael Weldon|Walter F.R. Weldon]] (1860–1906) founded the ''[[Biometrika]]'' scientific journal, which promoted [[biometrics]] and statistical analysis of [[heredity]]. [[Charles Davenport]] (1866–1944) was briefly involved in the review. In ''Race Crossing in Jamaica'' (1929), he made statistical arguments that biological and cultural degradation followed white and black [[miscegenation|interbreeding]]. Davenport was connected to [[Nazi Germany]] before and during [[World War II]]. In 1939 he wrote a contribution to the ''festschrift'' for [[Otto Reche]] (1879–1966), who became an important figure within the plan to remove populations considered "inferior" from eastern Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kühl|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interbellum to World War II==
Scientific racism continued through the early 20th century, and soon [[intelligence testing]] became a new source for racial comparisons. Before [[World War II]] (1939–45), scientific racism remained common to [[anthropology]], and was used as justification for [[eugenics]] programs, [[compulsory sterilization]], [[anti-miscegenation laws]], and [[immigration law|immigration restrictions]] in Europe and the United States. The [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] of [[Nazi Germany]] (1933–45) discredited scientific racism in academia,{{citation needed| date=July 2016}} but racist legislation based upon it remained in some countries until the late 1960s.

===Early intelligence testing and the Immigration Act of 1924===

Before the 1920s, social scientists agreed that whites were superior to blacks, but they needed a way to prove this in order to back social policy in favor of whites. They felt the best way to gauge this was through testing intelligence. By interpreting the tests to show favor to whites these test makers’ research results portrayed all minority groups very negatively.&lt;ref name=Tucker07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richards|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1908, [[Henry H. Goddard|Henry Goddard]] translated the Binet intelligence test from French and in 1912 began to apply the test to incoming immigrants on Ellis Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shultz|Shultz|2008|pp=233,236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some claim that in a study of immigrants Goddard reached the conclusion that 87% of Russians, 83% of Jews, 80% of Hungarians, and 79% of Italians were feeble-minded and had a mental age less than 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also claimed that this information was taken as "evidence" by lawmakers and thus it affected social policy for years.&lt;ref name=Shultz08_237&gt;{{harvnb|Shultz|Shultz|2008|p=237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Davis has pointed out that, in the first sentence of his paper, Goddard wrote that the subjects of the study were not typical members of their groups but were selected because of their suspected sub-normal intelligence. Davis has further noted that Goddard argued that the low IQs of the test subjects were more likely due to environmental rather than genetic factors, and that Goddard concluded that "we may be confident that their children will be of average intelligence and if rightly brought up will be good citizens".&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davis, Bernard|title=Neo-Lysenkoism, IQ and the Press|journal=The Public Interest|volume=74|issue=2|page=45|year=1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the American Psychological Association's Board of Scientific Affairs stated that IQ tests were not discriminatory towards any ethnic/racial groups.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{harvnb|American Psychologist|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'', Stephen Jay Gould argued that intelligence testing results played a major role in the passage of the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] that restricted immigration to the United States.&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gould, S.J.|title=The Mismeasure of Man|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0393314250|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Mark Snyderman]] and [[Richard J. Herrnstein]], after studying the [[Congressional Record]] and committee hearings related to the Immigration Act, concluded "the [intelligence] testing community did not generally view its findings as favoring restrictive immigration policies like those in the 1924 Act, and Congress took virtually no notice of intelligence testing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Snyderman, M. |author2=Herrnstein, R.J. |title=Intelligence Tests and the Immigration Act of 1924|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=986–95|year=1983|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.38.9.986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Juan N. Franco contested the findings of Snyderman and Herrnstein. Franco stated that even though Snyderman and Herrnstein reported that the data collected from the results of the intelligence tests were in no way used to pass The Immigration Act of 1924, the IQ test results were still taken into consideration by legislators. As suggestive evidence, Franco pointed to the following fact: Following the passage of the immigration act, information from the 1890 census was used to set quotas based on percentages of immigrants coming from different countries. Based on these data, the legislature restricted the entrance of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe into the United States and allowed more immigrants from northern and Western Europe into the country. The use of the 1900, 1910 or 1920 census data sets would have resulted in larger numbers of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe being allowed into the U.S. However, Franco pointed out that using the 1890 census data allowed congress to exclude southern and eastern Europeans (who performed worse on IQ tests of the time than did western and northern Europeans) from the U.S. Franco argued that the work Snyderman and Herrnstein conducted on this matter neither proved or disproved that intelligence testing influenced immigration laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Franco, J.N.|title=Intelligence tests and social policy|journal=Journal of Counseling and Development|volume=64|issue=4|pages=278–9|year=1985|doi=10.1002/j.1556-6676.1985.tb01101.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-16748, Ausstellung "Wunder des Lebens".jpg|thumb|left|200px|Nazi poster promoting eugenics]]
The [[Nazi Party]] and its sympathizers published many books on scientific racism, seizing on the [[eugenics|eugenicist]] and [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] ideas with which they were widely associated, although these ideas had been in circulation since the 19th century. Books such as ''Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes'' ("Ethnology of the German People") by [[Hans F. K. Günther]] and ''Rasse und Seele'' ("Race and Soul") by [[:de:Ludwig Ferdinand Clauß]] attempted to scientifically identify differences between the [[Germans|German]], [[Nordic theory|Nordic]], or [[Aryan]] people and other, supposedly inferior, groups.{{Citation needed|reason=Dubious sentence given Günther's views|date=April 2017}} German schools used these books as texts during the Nazi era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Nature, Human Nature, and Human Difference | publisher=Princeton University Press | author=Smith, Justin E.H.| year=2015 |pages=10–15| isbn=978-1400866311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1930s, the Nazis used [[racialized]] scientific rhetoric based on [[social Darwinism]]{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} to push its restrictive and discriminatory social policies.

During [[World War II]], Nazi racialist beliefs became anathema in the United States, and [[Franz Boas|Boasians]] such as [[Ruth Benedict]] consolidated their institutional power. After the war, discovery of [[the Holocaust]] and Nazi abuses of scientific research (such as [[Josef Mengele]]'s ethical violations and other [[war crime]]s revealed at the [[Nuremberg Trials]]) led most of the scientific community to repudiate scientific support for racism.

Propaganda for the Nazi eugenics program began with propaganda for eugenic sterilization. Articles in ''[[Neues Volk]]'' described the appearance of the mentally ill and the importance of preventing such births.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/nv39-05a.htm Women Who May Not Be Allowed to become Mothers]"&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of mentally incapacitated children were juxtaposed with those of healthy children.&lt;ref name="Claudia Koonz p 119"&gt;{{cite book| last = Koonz| first = Claudia| title = The Nazi Conscience| year = 2003| publisher = Harvard University Press| isbn = 978-0-674-01172-4| page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Das Erbe]]'' showed conflict in nature in order to legitimate the [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] by sterilization.

In the 20th century, concepts of scientific racism, which sought to prove the physical and mental inadequacy of groups deemed "inferior", was relied upon to justify [[involuntary sterilization]] programs.&lt;ref name="JacksonWeidman"&gt;John P. Jackson &amp; Nadine M. Weidman, ''Race, Racism, and Science: Social Impact and Interaction'' (Rutgers University Press, 2006), p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juliet Hooker, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GVy1DgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Theorizing Race in the Americas: Douglass, Sarmiento, Du Bois, and Vasconcelos]'' (Oxford University Press, 2017), pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Such programs, promoted by eugenicists such as [[Harry H. Laughlin]], were upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Buck v. Bell]]'' (1927). In all, between 60,000 and 90,000 Americans were subjected to involuntary sterilization.&lt;ref name="JacksonWeidman"/&gt;

Scientific racism was also used as a justification for the [[Emergency Quota Act of 1921]] and the [[Immigration Act of 1924]] (Johnson–Reed Act), which imposed racial quotas limiting [[Italian American]] immigration to the United States and immigration other southern European and eastern European nations. Proponents of these quotas, who sought to block "undesirable" immigrants, justifying restrictions by invoking scientific racism.&lt;ref&gt;Christa Wirth, ''Memories of Belonging: Descendants of Italian Migrants to the United States, 1884–Present'' ([[Brill Publishers]], 2015), pp. 190, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lothrop Stoddard]] published many racialist books on what he saw as the peril of immigration, his most famous being ''The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy'' in 1920. In this book he presented a view of the world situation pertaining to race focusing concern on the coming population explosion among the "colored" peoples of the world and the way in which "white world-supremacy" was being lessened in the wake of World War I and the collapse of colonialism.

Stoddard's analysis divided world politics and situations into "white", "yellow", "black", "Amerindian", and "brown" peoples and their interactions. Stoddard argued race and heredity were the guiding factors of history and civilization, and that the elimination or absorption of the "white" race by "colored" races would result in the destruction of Western civilization. Like Madison Grant, Stoddard divided the white race into three main divisions: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean. He considered all three to be of good stock, and far above the quality of the colored races, but argued that the Nordic was the greatest of the three and needed to be preserved by way of eugenics. Unlike Grant, Stoddard was less concerned with which varieties of European people were superior to others (Nordic theory), but was more concerned with what he called "bi-racialism", seeing the world as being composed of simply "colored" and "white" races. In the years after the Great Migration and World War I, Grant's racial theory would fall out of favor in the U.S. in favor of a model closer to Stoddard's.{{citation needed| date=July 2016}}

An influential publication was ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]'' (1939) by [[Carleton S. Coon]], president of the [[American Association of Physical Anthropologists]] from 1930 to 1961. Coon was a proponent of [[Multiregional origin of modern humans]]. He divided ''Homo sapiens'' into five main races:

{{Carleton S. Coon Racial Definitions}}
Coon's school of thought was the object of increasing opposition in mainstream anthropology after World War II. [[Ashley Montagu]] was particularly vocal in denouncing Coon, especially in his ''Man's Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race''. By the 1960s, Coon's approach had been rendered obsolete in mainstream anthropology, but his system continued to appear in publications by his student [[John Lawrence Angel]] as late as in the 1970s.

In the late 19th century, the ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) [[United States Supreme Court]] decision—which upheld the constitutional legality of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] under the doctrine of "[[separate but equal]]"—was intellectually rooted in the racism of the era, as was the popular support for the decision.&lt;ref name="rlac"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarat, Austin|title=Race, Law, and Culture: Reflections on Brown v. Board of Education|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=1997|pages=55, 59|isbn=978-0195106220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the mid 20th century, the Supreme Court's ''[[Brown v. Board of Education|Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka]]'' (1954) decision rejected [[Racism|racialist]] arguments about the "need" for racial segregation—especially in [[Public education|public schools]].

By 1954, 58 years after the ''Plessy v. Ferguson'' upholding of racial segregation in the United States, American popular and scholarly opinions of scientific racism and its sociologic practice had evolved.&lt;ref name="rlac"/&gt; In 1960 the journal ''[[Mankind Quarterly]]'' started, which some have described as a venue for scientific racism. It has been criticized for a claimed ideological bias, and for lacking a legitimate scholarly purpose.&lt;ref name=jackson/&gt; The journal was founded in 1960, partly in response to the Supreme Court decision ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' which desegregated the American public school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaffer|2007|pp=253–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jackson"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jackson, John |author2=McCarthy, John P.

In April 1966, [[Alex Haley]] interviewed [[American Nazi Party]] founder [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] for ''[[Playboy]]''.  Rockwell justified his belief that blacks were inferior to whites by citing a long 1916 study by G.O. Ferguson which claimed to show that the intellectual performance of black students was correlated with their percentage of white ancestry, stating "pure negroes, negroes three-fourths pure, mulattoes and quadroons have, roughly, 60, 70, 80 and 90 percent, respectively, of white intellectual efficiency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ferguson, G.O.|title= The Psychology of the Negro|url= https://archive.org/stream/psychologyofnegr00ferg#page/124/mode/2up|journal= Archives of Psychology|volume= 36|date= April 1916|page= 125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Playboy later published the interview with an editorial note claiming the study was a "discredited ... pseudoscientific rationale for racism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= Haley|first= Alex|title= Interview: George Lincoln Rockwell|magazine= [[Playboy]]|date= April 1966|url= https://archive.org/stream/1966PlayboyInterview/MicrosoftWord-Document1#page/n7/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International bodies such as [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] attempted to draft resolutions that would summarize the state of scientific knowledge about race and issued calls for the resolution of racial conflicts. In its 1950 ''The Race Question'', UNESCO did not reject the idea of a biological basis to racial categories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Banton, Michael|chapter=Race, Unesco statements on |editor=Schaefer, Richard T.|year=2008|title=Encyclopedia of Race, Ethnicity and Society |publisher=Sage |isbn= 978-1412926942 |pages= 1096, 1098}}&lt;/ref&gt; but instead defined a race as: "A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species Homo sapiens", which were broadly defined as the [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]], [[Mongoloid race|Mongoloid]], [[Negroid race|Negroid]] races but stated that "It is now generally recognized that intelligence tests do not in themselves enable us to differentiate safely between what is due to innate capacity and what is the result of environmental influences, training and education."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term "scientific racism" is used to refer to research seeming to scientifically justify racist ideology. The accusation of scientific racism often is cast upon researchers claiming the existence of races and or of quantifiable differences in intelligence among these races, especially if said differences are partly genetic in origin. Contemporary researchers and authors include the late [[Arthur Jensen]] (''[[The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability]]''); the late [[J.

The '''sex ratio''' is the [[ratio]] of [[male]]s to [[female]]s in a [[population]]. In most sexually reproducing species, the ratio tends to be 1:1. This tendency is explained by [[Fisher's principle]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; For various reasons, however, many species deviate from anything like an even sex ratio, either periodically or permanently. Examples include [[parthenogenic]] species, periodically mating organisms such as aphids, some [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[wasp]]s such as ''[[Polistes fuscatus]]'' and ''[[Polistes exclamans]]'', bees, ants, and termites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kobayashi Kazuya, Hasegawa Eisuke, Yamamoto Yuuka, Kawatsu Kazutaka, Vargo Edward L., Yoshimura Jin, Matsuura Kenji | year = 2013 | title = Sex ratio biases in termites provide evidence for kin selection | url = | journal = Nat Commun | volume =  4| issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1038/ncomms3048 | bibcode = 2013NatCo...4E2048K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[human sex ratio]] is of particular interest to anthropologists and demographers. In human societies, however, sex ratios at birth may be considerably skewed by factors such as the age of mother at birth,&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trend Analysis of the sex Ratio at Birth in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_20.pdf|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for Health Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[sex-selective abortion]] and infanticide. Exposure to pesticides and other environmental contaminants may be a significant contributing factor as well.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Devra Lee; Gottlieb, Michelle and Stampnitzky, Julie; "Reduced Ratio of Male to Female Births in Several Industrial Countries" in ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''; April 1, 1998, volume 279(13); pp. 1018-1023&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the global sex ratio at birth is estimated at 107 boys to 100 girls (1000 boys per 934 girls).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CIA Fact Book | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html | publisher=The Central Intelligence Agency of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
In most species, the sex ratio varies according to the age profile of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Coney N.S. Mackey | year = 1998 | title = The woman as final arbiter: a case for the facultative character of the human sex ratio | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 35 | issue = 2| pages = 169–175 | doi = 10.1080/00224499809551930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally divided into four subdivisions:

* '''primary sex ratio''' &amp;mdash; ratio at fertilization
* '''secondary sex ratio''' &amp;mdash; ratio at birth
* '''tertiary sex ratio''' &amp;mdash; ratio in sexually mature organisms
** Also called ''adult sex ratio'' and abbreviated to ''ASR''. ASR is defined as the proportion of adults in a population that are male.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, K. &amp; Hardy, I.C.W. (2002) “Statistical analysis of sex ratios: an introduction”; in Hardy, Ian C.W. (editor), ''Sex Ratios: Concepts and Research Methods'', pp. 48–92. {{ISBN|0521665787}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**''[[Operational sex ratio]]'' abbreviated as ''OSR'' is the proportion of adults in the sexually active population that are males. 'OSR' has often been confused with 'ASR' although these are conceptually different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Székely T., Weissing F. J., Komdeur J. | year = 2014 | title = Adult sex ratio variation: implications for breeding system evolution | url = | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 27 | issue = 8| pages = 1500–1512 | doi = 10.1111/jeb.12415 | pmid = 24848871 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''quaternary sex ratio''' &amp;mdash; ratio in post-reproductive organisms

Measuring these requires sophisticated mathematics since they lack clear boundaries.

==Sex ratio theory==
The theory of sex ratio is a field of study concerned with the accurate prediction of sex ratios in all sexual species, based on a consideration of their [[natural history]]. The field continues to be heavily influenced by [[Eric Charnov]]’s 1982 book, ''Sex Allocation''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Charnov|Eric L. Charnov]]. (1982) ''Sex allocation''. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey. {{ISBN|0-691-08312-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines five major questions, both for his book and the field in general (slightly abbreviated here):
#For a [[dioecious]] species, what is the equilibrium sex ratio maintained by natural selection?
#For a [[sequential hermaphrodite]], what is the equilibrium sex order and time of [[sex change]]?
#For a [[simultaneous hermaphrodite]], what is the equilibrium allocation of resources to male versus female function in each breeding season?
#Under what conditions are the various states of hermaphroditism or dioecy evolutionarily stable? When is a mixture of sexual types stable?
#When does selection favour the ability of an individual to alter its allocation to male versus female function, in response to particular environmental or life history situations?

Biological research mostly concerns itself with sex ''allocation'' rather than sex ratio, sex allocation denoting the allocation of energy to either sex. Common research themes are the effects of local mate and resource competition (often abbreviated LMC and LRC, respectively).

== Fisher's principle ==
{{Main article|Fisher's principle}}
Fisher’s principle explains why for most species, the sex ratio is approximately 1:1. [[W.D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]] expounded Fisher’s argument in his 1967 paper on “Extraordinary sex ratios”&lt;ref name=Hamilton67/&gt; as follows, given the assumption of equal parental expenditure on offspring of both sexes.&lt;!-- this is a better explanation than Fisher's contorted text--&gt;

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

In modern language, the 1:1 ratio is the [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] (ESS).&lt;ref name=MaynardSmithPrice73&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/246015a0 |author=Maynard Smith, J., Price, G.R. |title=The logic of animal conflict |journal=Nature |volume=246 |issue=5427 |pages=15–8 |year=1973 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v246/n5427/abs/246015a0.html |bibcode=1973Natur.246...15S}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio has been observed in many species, including the bee [[Macrotera portalis]]. A study performed by Danforth observed no significant difference in the number of males and females from the 1:1 sex ratio.&lt;ref name="Danforth2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danforth|first1=Bryan|title=Female Foraging and Intranest Behavior of a Communal Bee, Perdita portalis (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae)|journal=Annals of the Entomological Society of America|date=1991|volume=84|issue=5|pages=537–548|doi= 10.1093/aesa/84.5.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples in non-human species==

===Environmental and individual control===
Spending equal amounts of resources to produce offspring of either sex is an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]]: if the general population deviates from this equilibrium by favoring one sex, one can obtain higher reproductive success with less effort by producing more of the other. For species where the cost of successfully raising one offspring is roughly the same regardless of its sex, this translates to an approximately equal sex ratio.

[[bacterium|Bacteria]] of the genus ''[[Wolbachia]]'' cause skewed sex ratios in some [[arthropod]] species as they kill males. Sex-ratio of adult populations of pelagic [[copepods]] is usually skewed towards dominance of females. However, there are differences in adult sex ratios between families: in families in which females require multiple matings to keep producing eggs, sex ratios are less biased (close to 1); in families in which females can produce eggs continuously after only one mating, sex ratios are strongly skewed towards females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kiørboe, T. |title=Sex, sex-ratios, and the dynamics of pelagic copepod populations |journal=Oecologia |volume=148 |issue=1 |pages=40–50 |year=2006 |pmid=16425044 |doi=10.1007/s00442-005-0346-3 |bibcode=2006Oecol.148...40K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several species of reptiles have [[temperature-dependent sex determination]], where incubation temperature of eggs determines the sex of the individual. In the [[American alligator]], for example, females are hatched from eggs incubated between {{convert|27.7|to|30|C|F}}, whereas males are hatched from eggs {{convert|32.2|to|33.8|C|F}}. In this method, however, all eggs in a clutch (20–50) will be of the same sex. In fact, the natural sex ratio of this species is five females to one male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/296850a0 |author=Ferguson, M.W.J., Joanen, T. |title=Temperature of egg incubation determines sex in ''Alligator mississippiensis'' |journal=Nature |volume=296 |issue=5860 |pages=850–3 |date=April 1982 |pmid=7070524 |bibcode = 1982Natur.296..850F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In birds, mothers can influence the sex of their chicks. In [[peafowl]], maternal body condition can influence the proportion of daughters in the range from 25% to 87%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2004.12.020 |author=Pike, T.W., Petrie, M. |title=Maternal body condition and plasma hormones affect offspring sex ration in peafowl |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=70 |pages=745–51 |date=October 2005 |laysummary=[http://www.sciencenews.org/view/feature/id/8505/title/Egg_Shell_Game Egg Shell Game] |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several different groups of fish, such as [[wrasses]], [[parrotfish]] and [[clownfish]], [[dichogamy]] — or sequential hermaphoditism — is normal. This can cause a discrepancy in the sex ratios as well. In the [[bluestreak cleaner wrasse]], there is only one male for every group of 6-8 females. If the male fish dies, the strongest female changes its sex to become the male for the group. All of these wrasse are born female, and only become male in this situation. Other species, like clownfish, do this in reverse, where all start out as non-reproductive males, and the largest male becomes a female, with the second-largest male maturing to become reproductive.

===Domesticated animals===
Traditionally, farmers have discovered that the most economically efficient community of animals will have a large number of females and a very small number of males. A herd of cows with a few bulls or a flock of hens with one rooster are the most economical sex ratios for domesticated livestock.

=== Dioecious plants secondary sex ratio and amount of pollen ===
It was found that the amount of fertilizing pollen can influence secondary sex ratio in dioecious plants. Increase in pollen amount leads to decrease in number of male plants in the progeny. This relationship was confirmed on four plant species from three families – ''[[Rumex acetosa]]'' (''[[Polygonaceae]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Correns С. |title=Geschlechtsbestimmung und Zahlenverhaltnis der Geschlechter beim Sauerampfer (''Rumex acetosa'') |journal=Biol.

Sci., p. 363—367 (cit.: Plant Breeding Abstr., 1934, '''5''', № 3, p. 248, ref. № 768).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polyandrous and cooperatively breeding homeotherms===
In [[Charadriiformes|charadriiform]] birds, recent research has shown clearly that [[polyandry]] and sex-role reversal (where males care and females compete for mates) as found in [[phalarope]]s, [[Jacanidae|jacana]]s, [[painted snipe]] and a few [[plover]] species is clearly related to a strongly male-biased adult sex ratio.&lt;ref name="evolution"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liker András |author2=Freckleton Robert P. |author3=Székely Tamás | title = The evolution of sex roles in birds is related to adult sex ratio | url = | journal = [[Nature Communications]] | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 1587 | doi=10.1038/ncomms2600|year=2013 |bibcode=2013NatCo...4E1587L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those species with male care and polyandry invariably have adult sex ratios with a large surplus of males,&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; which in some cases can reach as high as six males per female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kosztolányi András |author2=Barta Zoltán |author3=Küpper Clemens |author4=Székely Tamás | year = 2011 | title = Persistence of an extreme male-biased adult sex ratio in a natural population of a polyandrous bird | url = | journal = [[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] | volume = 24 | issue = 8| pages = 1842–1846 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2011.02305.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-biased adult sex ratios have also been shown to correlate with [[cooperative breeding]] in mammals such as [[alpine marmot]]s and wild [[Canidae|canids]].&lt;ref&gt;Allainé, Dominique; Brondex, Francine; Graziani, Laurent; Coulon, Jacques and Till-Bottraud, Irène; "Male-biased sex ratio in litters of alpine marmots supports the helper repayment hypothesis"&lt;/ref&gt; This correlation may also apply to cooperatively breeding birds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doerr Erik D. |author2=Doerr Veronica A.J. | year = 2006 | title = Comparative demography of treecreepers: evaluating hypotheses for the evolution and maintenance of cooperative breeding | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 147–159 | doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2005.10.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the evidence is less clear.&lt;ref name="evolution"/&gt; It is known, however, that both male-biased adult sex ratios&lt;ref name="parental"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kokko Hanna |author2=Jennions Michael D | year = 2008 | title = Parental investment, sexual selection and sex ratios | url = | journal = [[Journal of Evolutionary Biology]] | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 919–948 | doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2008.01540.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cooperative breeding tend to evolve where caring for offspring is extremely difficult due to low secondary productivity, as in [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Orians Gordon H. |author2=Milewski Antoni V. | year = 2007 | title = Ecology of Australia: the effects of nutrient-poor soils and intense fires | url = | journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 393–423 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2007.00017.x|pmid=17624961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Africa]]. It is also known that in cooperative breeders where both sexes are philopatric like the [[varied sittella]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Noske R.A. | year = 1986 | title = Intersexual niche segregation among three bark-foraging birds of eucalypt forests | url = | journal = [[Australian Journal of Ecology]] | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 255–267 | doi=10.1111/j.1442-9993.1986.tb01396.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; adult sex ratios are equally or more male-biased than in those cooperative species, such as [[Malurus|fairy-wrens]], [[Climacteris|treecreepers]] and the [[noisy miner]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2001 | title = Sex-biased hatching sequences in the cooperatively breeding noisy miner | url = | journal = Journal of Avian Biology | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 219–223 | doi=10.1111/j.0908-8857.2001.320303.x| last1 = Arnold | first1 = Kathryn E. | last2 = Griffith | first2 = Simon C. | last3 = Goldizen | first3 = Anne W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; where females always disperse.

'''Sexual ethics''' or '''sex ethics''' (also called '''sexual morality''') is the study of [[human sexuality]] and the expression of [[Human sexual behaviour|human sexual behavior]]. Sexual ethics seeks to understand and evaluate the moral conduct of [[interpersonal relationship]]s and sexual activities from social, cultural, and philosophical perspectives. Historically, the prevailing notions of what was deemed as sexually ethical has been tied to religious values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/sexual-ethics|title=Sexual Ethics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sexual ethics involve issues, such as [[gender identification]], [[sexual orientation]], [[Consent (criminal law)|consent]], [[sexual relations]], and [[procreation]].

==Terminology and philosophical context==
The terms ''ethics'' and ''morality'' are often used interchangeably, but sometimes ''ethics'' is reserved for interpersonal interactions and ''morality'' is used to cover both interpersonal and inherent questions.&lt;ref&gt;See usage note on [[wiktionary:ethics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all approaches to applied ethics agree that there ''is'' an inherent morality:
* [[Moral nihilism]] is the meta-ethical view that nothing is inherently right or wrong, and that all value judgments are either human constructs or meaningless.
* [[Moral relativism]] is the meta-ethical view that moral judgments are subjective.  In some cases this is merely descriptive, in other cases this approach is [[normative]] – the idea that morality should be judged in the context of each culture's convictions and practices.
* [[Moral universalism]] is the meta-ethical view that moral judgments are objectively true or false, that everyone should behave according to the same set of normative ethics.

In philosophic terminology, [[hedonism]] is the idea that the only [[intrinsic good]] is [[pleasure]], making selfish pleasures their primary goal.  This may be combined with [[nihilism]] in a [[selfish]] morality, or with [[utilitarianism]] to seek maximization of happiness for everyone.  Some religions derive a normative sexual ethics from their texts or teachings, and these range from nihilistic utilitarianism to more complex, fixed systems for determining right and wrong.

Many practical questions arise regarding [[human sexuality]], such as whether [[sexual norm]]s should be enforced by law, given social approval, or changed.  Answers to these questions can be considered on a scale from [[social liberalism]] to [[social conservatism]].  Considerable controversy continues over which system of ethics or morality best promotes human happiness, and which, if any, is inherently right.

==Flirting==
{{Sex and the Law}}
{{main article|Flirting}}
[[Flirting]] can be an expression of [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]] and a common form of [[social interaction]] whereby one person obliquely indicates a [[romantic love|romantic]] and/or [[human sexuality|sexual]] interest towards another. However, flirting undertaken for amusement, with no intention of developing any further relationship, poses ethical dilemmas and sometimes faces disapproval from others, either because it can be misinterpreted as more serious, or it may be viewed as "cheating" if the person flirting is already in a romantic relationship with someone else; or if the person to whom flirting is directed is in an exclusive or a serious relationship. Flirting between individuals happens for a variety of reasons including the desire to interact sexually.&lt;ref name="Henningsen 481–489"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henningsen|first=David Dryden|title=Flirting with Meaning: An Examination of Miscommunication in Flirting Interactions|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=50|issue=7–8|pages=481–489|doi=10.1023/B:SERS.0000023068.49352.4b|issn=0360-0025|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when an individual chooses not to engage in flirtation with another, it may reflect the lack of sexual desire&lt;ref name="Henningsen 481–489"/&gt; or may reflect a lack of desire to flirt for other reasons.

==Consent==

===Present and historical perspectives===
{{Further information|Adultery|Fornication|Sodomy law|Marital rape|Laws regarding rape}}
From a [[human rights]] and [[international law]] perspective, [[consent (criminal law)|consent]] is a key issue in sexual ethics. Nevertheless, historically, this has not necessarily been the case. Throughout history, a whole range of consensual sexual acts, such as [[adultery]], [[fornication]], [[interracial sex|interracial]] or [[interfaith marriage|interfaith]] sex,  'sodomy' (see [[sodomy laws]]) have been prohibited; while at the same time various forced sexual encounters such as rape of a slave, prostitute, war enemy, and most notably of a spouse, were not illegal. The criminalization of [[marital rape]] is very recent, having occurred during the past few decades, and the act is still legal in many places around the world. Outside the West, in many countries consent is still not central. For instance, adultery and homosexual acts remain illegal in many countries; and in five countries and in parts of two others, homosexual acts carry the [[death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-25927595|title=Where is it illegal to be gay?|journal=BBC News|date=10 February 2014|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all modern systems of ethics insist that sexual activity is morally permissible only if all participants consent. Sexual ethics also considers whether a person is capable of giving consent and the sort of acts they can consent to. In western countries, the legal concept of "[[informed consent]]" often sets the public standards on this issue. Children, the mentally handicapped, the mentally ill, animals, prisoners, and people under the influence of drugs like alcohol might be considered in certain situations as lacking an ability to give an informed consent. In the United States, ''[[Maouloud Baby v. State]]'' is a state court case ruling that a person can withdraw sexual consent and that continuing sexual activity in the absence of consent may constitute rape. Also, if infected with a sexually transmitted disease, it is important that one notifies the partner before sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stein|first=Michael D.|last2=Freedberg|first2=Kenneth A.|last3=Sullivan|first3=Lisa M.|last4=Savetsky|first4=Jacqueline|last5=Levenson|first5=Suzette M.|last6=Hingson|first6=Ralph|last7=Samet|first7=Jeffrey H.|date=1998-02-09|title=Sexual Ethics|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/191291|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=158|issue=3|pages=253–7|doi=10.1001/archinte.158.3.253|pmid=9472205|issn=0003-9926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual acts which are illegal, and often considered unethical, because of the absence of consent include [[rape]] and [[Sexual assault|molestation]]. Enthusiastic consent, as expressed in the slogan "Yes means yes," is typically the focus of liberal sexual ethics, rather than marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yes Means Yes!

===Age of consent===
{{main article|Age of Consent}}
[[Age of consent]] is also a key issue in sexual ethics. It is a controversial question of whether or not minors should be allowed to have sex for recreation or engage in sexual activities such as [[sexting]]. The debate includes whether or not minors can meaningfully consent to have sex with each other, and whether they can meaningfully consent to have sex with adults. In many places in the world, people are not legally allowed to have sex until they reach a set age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ageofconsent.net/world|title=Age of Consent Laws By Country|website=www.ageofconsent.net|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The age of consent averages around the age of 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are you old enough?|url=http://www.unicef.org/rightsite/433_457.htm#to_have_sex|website=UNICEF.org|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often debated whether or not people under the [[age of consent]] are capable of having consensual sexual relationships.

==Feminist views==
{{Main article|Feminist views on sexuality}}
Feminists aim to redefine feminine sexuality in this world. The primary concern of feminists is that a woman should have the right to control her own sexuality. The woman's freedom of choice, regarding her sexuality, takes precedence over family, community, state, and church. Based on historical and cultural context, [[feminist views on sexuality]] has widely varied. Sexual representation in the media, the sex industry, and issues concerning consent to sex under conditions of male dominance are controversial topics among feminists. The debate resulting from the divergence of feminist attitudes culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s. Parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates, which came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]]. The [[feminist sex wars]] pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]].&lt;ref name="Duggan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=978-0-415-91036-1|location=New York|author1=Duggan, Lisa|author2=Hunter, Nan D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87722-630-7|location=Philadelphia|author=Hansen, Karen Tranberg|author2=Philipson, Ilene J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-231-11204-8|location=New York|author=Gerhard, Jane F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leidholdt"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0-08-037457-4|location=New York|author=Leidholdt, Dorchen|authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt|author2=Raymond, Janice G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{cite book|title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality|publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1|author=Vance, Carole S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{see also|Marriage|Fornication}}

In all cultures, consensual sexual intercourse is acceptable within marriage. In some cultures sexual intercourse outside marriage is controversial, if not totally unacceptable, or even illegal. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeontheun.org/voices.asp?p=632 |title=Human Rights Voices –  , August 21, 2008 |publisher=Eyeontheun.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121175822/http://www.eyeontheun.org/voices.asp?p=632 |archivedate=January 21, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |title=Home |publisher=AIDSPortal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081026065259/http://www.aidsportal.org/news_details.aspx?ID=4236 |archivedate=2008-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |title=Iran |publisher=Travel.state.gov |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801084310/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1142.html |archivedate=2013-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran,&lt;ref name="travel.state.gov"/&gt; Kuwait,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/2f5665ae20b956cb8025675a0033cafb?Opendocument |title=United Nations Human Rights Website – Treaty Bodies Database – Document – Summary Record – Kuwait |publisher=Unhchr.ch }}&lt;/ref&gt; Maldives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Ja-Ma/Maldives.html |title=Culture of Maldives – history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family, social |publisher=Everyculture.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morocco,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Fakim |first=Nora |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19049000 |title=BBC News – Morocco: Should pre-marital sex be legal? |journal=BBC News |date=9 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.com/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaOman.pdf |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160516065620/http://www.interpol.com/Public/Children/SexualAbuse/NationalLaws/csaOman.pdf |archivedate=16 May 2016 |title=Legislation of Interpol member states on sexual offences against children – Oman |publisher=Interpol }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mauritania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154358.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Mauritania |publisher=State.gov |date=8 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; United Arab Emirates,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dubai FAQs |url=http://www.dubaifaqs.com/education-dubai.php |title=Education in Dubai |publisher=Dubaifaqs.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Judd |first=Terri |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/briton-faces-jail-for-sex-on-dubai-beach-863918.html |title=Briton faces jail for sex on Dubai beach – Middle East – World |work=The Independent |date=10 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/06/28/idUSL28849488._CH_.2400 |title=Sudan must rewrite rape laws to protect victims |agency=Reuters |date=28 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yemen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/47387b712f.html/ |title=Refworld &amp;#124; Women's Rights in the Middle East and North Africa – Yemen |publisher=UNHCR }}&lt;/ref&gt;  any form of sexual activity outside marriage is illegal.

As the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has noted, such societies often create spaces or heterotopias outside themselves where sex outside marriage can be practiced. According to his theory, this was the reason for the often unusual sexual ethics displayed by persons living in brothels, asylums, onboard ships, or in prisons. Sexual expression was freed of social controls in such places whereas, within society, sexuality has been controlled through the institution of marriage which socially sanctions the sex act. Many different types of marriage exist, but in most cultures that practice marriage, extramarital sex without the approval of the partner is often considered to be unethical. There are a number of complex issues that fall under the category of marriage.

When one member of a marital union has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of their spouse, it may be considered to be [[infidelity]]. In some cultures, this act may be considered ethical if the spouse consents, or acceptable as long as the partner is not married while other cultures might view any sexual intercourse outside marriage as unethical, with or without consent.

Furthermore, the institution of marriage brings up the issue of premarital sex wherein people who may choose to at some point in their lives marry, engage in sexual activity with partners who they may or may not marry. Various cultures have different attitudes about the ethics of such behavior, some condemning it while others view it to be normal and acceptable.

==Premarital sex==
{{main article|Premarital sex}}
[[Premarital sex]] is sexual activity between two people who are not married to each other. Usually, both parties are unmarried. This might be objected to on [[fornication|religious or moral grounds]], while individual views within a given society can vary greatly.&lt;ref&gt;Premarital sex Definition. The Free Dictionary. http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Premarital+sex&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex and Society|year=2010|publisher=Marshall Cavendish Reference|location=New York|isbn=978-0761479079|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sex_and_Society.html?id=YtsxeWE7VD0C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent decades, premarital sex has increasingly become a socially and morally acceptable practice among Western cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Views on Morality: Premarital Sex|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/04/15/global-morality/table/premarital-sex/|date=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extramarital sex==
{{main article|Extramarital sex}}
[[Extramarital sex]] is sex occurring outside marriage, usually referring to when a [[Marriage|married person]] engages in [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with someone other than their marriage partner. Commonly there are [[morality|moral]] as well as [[religious]] objections to [[sexual relationships]] by a married person outside the marriage, and such activity is often referred to in law or religion as [[adultery]]. Others call it [[infidelity]] or "cheating".

In contrast, there are some cultures, groups or individual relationships in which extramarital sex is an accepted norm. In today's western cultures some people practice "[[polyamory]]", otherwise known as responsible non-monogamy, or "[[open marriage]]". The ethical practice of this necessitates honest dialogue and consent of all those involved.

==Individuals and societies==
{{see also|Abuse of power|Sexual harassment|Incest|Pedophilia}}
Most societies disapprove of a person in a position of power to engage in sexual activity with a subordinate. This is often considered unethical simply as a [[Position of trust|breach of trust]]. When the person takes advantage of a position of power in the workplace, this may constitute [[sexual harassment]], because subordinates may be unable to give proper consent to a sexual advance because of a fear of repercussions.

Child-parent [[incest]] is also seen as an [[abuse]] of a position of trust and power, in addition to the inability of a child to give [[consent]]. Incest between adults may not involve this lack of consent, and is, therefore, less clear-cut for most observers. Many professional organizations have rules forbidding sexual relations between members and their clients. Examples in many countries include psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, doctors, and lawyers. In addition, laws exist against this kind of abuse of power by priests, preachers, teachers, religious counselors, and coaches.

==Sex work==
Various sexual acts are traded for money or other goods across the world. Ethical positions on [[sex work]] may depend on the type of sex act traded and the conditions in which it is traded, there are for example additional ethical concerns over the abrogation of autonomy in the situation of [[human trafficking|trafficked]] sex workers.

Sex work has been a particularity divisive issue within [[feminism]]. Some feminists may regard sex work as an example of societal oppression of the sex workers by the [[patriarchy]]. The ethical argument underlying this position is that despite the apparent consent of the sex worker, the choice to engage in sex work is often not an autonomous choice, because of economic, familial or societal pressures. Sex work may also be seen as an [[objectification]] of women. An opposing view held by other feminists such as [[Wendy McElroy]] is that sex work is a means of empowering women, the argument here being that in sex work women are able to extract psychological and financial power over men which is a justified correction of the power unbalance inherent in a patriarchal society. Some feminists regard to sex work as simply a form of labor which is neither morally good or bad, but subject to the same difficulties of other labor forms.

If sex work is accepted as unethical, there is then the dispute over which parties of the contract are responsible for the ethical or legal breach. Traditionally, in many societies, the legal and ethical burden of guilt has been placed largely on the sex worker rather than consumers. In recent decades, some countries such as [[Sweden]], [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]] have rewritten their laws to outlaw the buying of sexual services but not its sale (although they still retain laws and use enforcement tactics which sex workers say are deleterious to their safety, such as pressuring to have sex workers evicted from their residences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nswp.org/sites/nswp.org/files/Norway%20Executive%20Summary%2C%20Amnesty%20International%20-%202016.PDF|title=The Human Cost of 'Crushing' the Market: Criminalization of Sex Work in Norway: Executive Summary|date=2016|newspaper=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Gender identity and sexuality ==
There are three different approaches to gender identity and sexuality. These three different approaches are the "person-centered", "rights-based", and "deconstructive" which draws on ideas from ''Queer Theory.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=LGBT Issues: Looking beyond categories. Policy and Practice in Health and Social Care|last=Jones|first=Reginald L.|publisher=Dunedin Academic|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=10|quote=|via=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/clunet/detail.action?docID=10411899}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Queer Theory'' is a book that discusses different sexuality categories of 'woman', 'man', 'lesbian', and 'heterosexual' based on the opinions of Judith Butler, Steven Epstein, Steven Seidman, and Michael Warner. The debate between sexuality being predetermined and developed throughout a person's life is further talked about. Despite the opinions of these commenters, we can talk about the two different opinions about sexuality. One opinion is that sexuality is something someone is born with and will not be changed. Someone may choose to suppress their sexuality or behave differently from it due to their family or society. The other opinion is that sexuality is developed based on someone's environment and sexual relationships. See also [[queer theory]].

==Homosexuality==
{{see also|Homosexuality|Sodomy}}In ancient [[Athens]], sexual attraction between men was the norm. In the Levant, however,  persons who committed homosexual acts were stoned to death at the same period in history that young [[Alcibiades]] attempted to seduce [[Socrates]] to glean wisdom from him. As presented by Plato in his Symposium, Socrates did not "daily" with young Alcibiades, and instead treated him as his father or brother would when they spent the night sharing a blanket.  And in Xenophon's Symposium Socrates strongly speaks against men kissing each other, saying that doing so will make them slavish, i.e., risk something that seems akin to an addiction to homosexual acts.

Although there has been a lot of debate regarding homosexuality, there is evidence that supports the notion that individuals are born with their sexual orientation. There was a study in 1991 that showed the hypothalamus of a gay man differed with that of a straight man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1815538,00.html|title=What the Gay Brain Looks Like|last=Park|first=Alice|date=2008-06-17|newspaper=Time|issn=0040-781X|access-date=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also there is however a debate that environmental aspects impact the sexuality of individuals.

Most modern secular ethicists since the heyday of Utilitarianism, e.g. [[T.M. Scanlon]] and [[Bernard Williams]], have constructed systems of ethics whereby homosexuality is a matter of individual choice and where ethical questions have been answered by an appeal to non-interference in activities involving consenting adults. However, Scanlon's system, notably, goes in a slightly different direction from this and requires that no person who meets certain criteria could rationally reject a principle that either sanctions or condemns a certain act. Under Scanlon's system, it is difficult to see how one would construct a principle condemning homosexuality outright, although certain acts, such as homosexual rape, would still be fairly straightforward cases of unethical behavior.

==Religion==
{{See also|Religion and sexuality}}
Many cultures consider ethics to be intertwined with religious faith. Along with all those activities listed above, some acts that might be considered ethical or unethical from a religious standpoint:
*[[Contraception]]
**[[Religious views on birth control]]
***[[Christian views on contraception]]
***[[Islamic sexual jurisprudence#Contraception|Islamic views on contraception]]
***[[Jewish views on contraception]]
*[[Masturbation]]
*[[Promiscuity]]
*Various [[paraphilia]]s

===Paraphilia===
{{main article|Paraphilia}}

==Public health==
In countries where public health is considered a public concern, there is also the issue of how sex impacts the health of individuals. In such circumstances, where there are health impacts resulting from certain sexual activities,  there is the question of whether individuals have an ethical responsibility to the public at large for their behavior.  Such concerns might involve the regular periodic testing for [[sexually transmitted diseases]], disclosure of infection with [[sexually transmitted diseases]], responsibility for taking [[safer sex]] precautions, ethics of sex without using contraception, leading to an increased level of [[unplanned pregnancy|unplanned pregnancies]] and unwanted children, and just what amount of personal care an individual needs to take in order to meet his or her requisite contribution to the general health of a nation's citizens.

==Public decency==
{{See also|Decency}}
Legal and social [[dress code]]s are often related to sexuality. In the United States, there are many rules against nudity. An individual cannot be naked even on their own property if the public can see them. These laws are often considered a violation to the constitution regarding freedom of expression. It is said that common sense needs to be used when deciding whether or not nudity is appropriate. However, in Hawaii, Texas, New York, Maine, and Ohio allow all women to go topless at all locations that let men be shirtless. In California it is not illegal to hike in the nude, however it is frowned upon. Also in state parks it is legal to sunbathe in the nude unless a private citizen complains then you are to be removed from the premise by force if the individual doesn't comply. [[Breastfeeding in public]] is considered wrong and mothers are encouraged to either cover themselves in a blanket or go to the restroom to breastfeed their newborn. There are no actual laws that prohibit the action of breastfeeding in public except two places in Illinois and Missouri.

[[Slavery]] was a common practice in [[ancient Greece]], as in other societies of the time. Some Ancient Greek writers (including, most notably, [[Aristotle]]) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in [[Socratic dialogues]]; the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;J.M. Roberts. ''The New Penguin History of the World''. p.176–177, 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most activities were open to slaves except politics, which was reserved for citizens. The principal use of slaves was in agriculture, but hundreds of slaves were also used in stone quarries or mines, and perhaps two per household were domestic servants. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, with average of three or four slaves per household, except in poor families.

Modern [[historiography|historiographical]] practice distinguishes between [[Personal property|chattel]] slavery (personal possession, where the slave was regarded as a piece of property as opposed to a mobile member of society) versus land-bonded groups such as the [[penestae]] of [[Thessaly]] or the [[Sparta]]n [[helots]], who were more like medieval [[serfdom|serfs]] (an enhancement to real estate). The chattel helot is an individual deprived of liberty and forced to submit to an owner, who may buy, sell, or lease them like any other chattel.

The academic study of slavery in ancient Greece is beset by significant methodological problems. Documentation is disjointed and very fragmented, focusing primarily on the city-state of [[Athens]]. No treatises are specifically devoted to the subject, and jurisprudence was interested in slavery only as much as it provided a source of revenue. [[Ancient Greek comedy|Greek comedies]] and [[Greek tragedy|tragedies]] represented stereotypes, while [[iconography]] made no substantial differentiation between slaves and [[Artisan|craftsmen]].

==Terminology==

The ancient Greeks had several words to indicate slaves, which leads to textual ambiguity when they are studied out of their proper context. In [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Theognis of Megara]], the slave was called {{lang|grc|δμώς}} (''dmōs'').&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|δμώς}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term has a general meaning but refers particularly to war prisoners taken as [[War looting|booty]]&lt;ref&gt;For instance ''[[Odyssey]]'' 1:398, where [[Telemachus]] mentions "the slaves that goodly Odysseus won for [him]".&lt;/ref&gt; (in other words, property). During the classical period, the Greeks frequently used {{lang|grc|ἀνδράποδον}} (''andrapodon''),&lt;ref&gt;Used once by Homer in ''[[Iliad]]'' 7:475 to refer to prisoners taken in war; the line was athetized by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] following [[Zenodotus]] and [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]], see Kirk, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; (literally, "one with the feet of a man") as opposed to {{lang|grc|τετράποδον}} (''tetrapodon''), "quadruped" or livestock.&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|ἀνερ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most common word for slaves is {{lang|grc|δοῦλος}} (''doulos''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2328156 Definition] from [[LSJ]].&lt;/ref&gt; used in opposition to "free man" ({{lang|grc|ἐλεύθερος}}, ''eleútheros''); an earlier form of the former appears in [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] inscriptions as ''do-e-ro'', "male slave" (or "servant", "bondman"; Linear B: {{lang|gmy|𐀈𐀁𐀫}}), or ''do-e-ra'', "female slave" (or "maid-servant", "bondwoman").&lt;ref&gt;Mycenean transliterations can be confusing and do not directly reflect pronunciation; for clarification see the article about [[Linear B]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[verb]] {{lang|grc|δουλεὐω}} (which survives in Modern Greek, meaning "work") can be used metaphorically for other forms of dominion, as of one city over another or parents over their children.&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|δοῦλος}}. See also Mactoux (1981).&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the term {{lang|grc|οἰκέτης}} (''oiketēs'') was used, as meaning "one who lives in house", referring to household servants.&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|οἰκος}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other terms used to indicate slaves were less precise and required context: 
:* {{lang|grc|θεράπων}} (''therapōn'') – At the time of [[Homer]], the word meant "squire" ([[Patroclus]] was referred to as the ''therapōn'' of [[Achilles]]&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', 16:244 and 18:152.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Meriones (mythology)|Meriones]] that of [[Idomeneus]]&lt;ref&gt;''Iliad'', 23:113.&lt;/ref&gt;); but during the classical age, it meant "servant".&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|θεράπων}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* {{lang|grc|ἀκόλουθος}} (''akolouthos'') – literally, "the follower" or "the one who accompanies". Also, the [[diminutive]] {{lang|grc|ἀκολουθίσκος}}, used for [[page (servant)|page]] boys.&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|ἀκόλουθος}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* {{lang|grc|παῖς}} (''pais'') – literally "child", used in the same way as "[[houseboy]]",&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|παῖς}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also used in a derogatory way to call adult slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, p.137.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* {{lang|grc|σῶμα}} (''sōma'') – literally "body", used in the context of emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;Chantraine, s.v. {{lang|grc|σῶμα}} (''sōma'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of slavery==
[[File:Aias Kassandra Louvre G458.jpg|thumb|left|Women as plunder of war: [[Ajax the Lesser]] taking [[Cassandra]], tondo of a [[red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] by the [[Kodros Painter]], c. 440-430 BC, [[Louvre]].]]

Slaves were present through the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]], as documented in numerous tablets unearthed in [[Pylos]] 140. Two legal categories can be distinguished: "slaves (εοιο)"&lt;ref name="Garlan, p.32"&gt;Garlan, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;  and "slaves of the god (θεοιο)", the god in this case probably being [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref name="Garlan, p.32"/&gt; Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land; their legal status is close to that of freemen. The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The names of common slaves show that some of them came from [[Kythira|Kythera]], [[Chios]], [[Lemnos]] or [[Halicarnassus]] and were probably enslaved as a result of [[piracy]]. The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and freemen were common and that slaves could work and own land. It appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between a free individual and a slave but rather if the individual was in the palace or not.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mele, pp.115–155&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There is no continuity between the Mycenaean era and the time of [[Homer]], where social structures reflected those of the [[Greek dark ages]]. The terminology differs: the slave is no longer ''do-e-ro'' (doulos) but ''dmōs''.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Iliad]], slaves are mainly women taken as booty of war,&lt;ref&gt;For instance [[Chryseis]] (1:12–3, 29–30, 111–5), [[Briseis]] (2:688–9), Diomede (6:654–5), Iphis (6:666–8) and Hecamede (11:624–7).&lt;/ref&gt; while men were either ransomed&lt;ref&gt;See in the ''Iliad'' the pleas of [[Adrastus]] the Trojan (1:46–50), the sons of [[Antimachus (disambiguation)|Antimachus]] (11:131–5) and [[Lycaon (mythology)|Lycaon]] (21:74–96), all begging for mercy in exchange of a ransom.&lt;/ref&gt; or killed on the battlefield. In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the slaves also seem to be mostly women.&lt;ref&gt;There are 50 of them in [[Odysseus|Ulysses]]' house (22:421) and in [[Alcinous]]' house (7:103).&lt;/ref&gt; These slaves were servants&lt;ref&gt;Before his fight with Achilles, [[Hector]] predicts for his wife [[Andromache]] a life of bondage and mentions weaving and water-fetching (6:454–8). In the ''Odyssey'', servants tend the fire (20:123), prepare the suitors' feast (1:147), grind wheat (7:104, 20:108–9), make the bed (7:340–2) and take care of the guests.&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes concubines.&lt;ref&gt;In the ''Iliad'', Chryseis sleeps with [[Agamemnon]], Briseis and Diomede with [[Achilles]], Iphis with [[Patroclus]]. In the ''Odyssey'', twelve female servants sleep with the suitors (20:6–8) against [[Euryclea]]'s direct orders (22:423–425).&lt;/ref&gt; There were some male slaves, especially in the ''Odyssey'', a prime example being the [[swineherd]] Eumaeus. The slave was distinctive in being a member of the core part of the ''oikos'' ("family unit", "household"): [[Laertes]] eats and drinks with his servants;&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', 16:140–1.&lt;/ref&gt; in the winter, he sleeps in their company.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', 11:188–91.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''dmōs'' is not considered pejorative, and [[Eumaeus]], the "divine" swineherd,&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'', 14:3.&lt;/ref&gt; bears the same [[Epithets in Homer|Homeric epithet]] as the Greek heroes.&lt;ref name="G41"&gt;Garlan, p.43.&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery remained, however, a disgrace. Eumaeus himself declares, "Zeus, of the far-borne voice, takes away the half of a man's virtue, when the day of slavery comes upon him".&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 17:322–323. Online version of [http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/homer/odyssey.html Butcher-Lang 1879 translation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220090030/http://www.robotwisdom.com/jaj/homer/odyssey.html |date=2006-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G41" /&gt;
 
It is difficult to determine when slave trading began in the archaic period. In ''[[Works and Days]]'' (8th century BC), [[Hesiod]] owns numerous ''dmōes''&lt;ref&gt;For instance ''Works and Days'', 405.&lt;/ref&gt; although their status is unclear. The presence of ''douloi'' is confirmed by lyric poets such as [[Archilochus]] or [[Theognis of Megara]].&lt;ref name="G41"/&gt; According to epigraphic evidence, the homicide law of [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]] (c. 620 BC) mentioned slaves.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|κατὰ ταὐτὰ φόνοθ δίκας εἷναι δοῦλον κτείναντι ἢ ἐλεὐτερον}}." Dareste, Haussoulier and Reinach, 4, 5, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Solon'', 1:6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solon]] (c. 594-593 BC) forbade slaves from practising gymnastics and pederasty. By the end of the period, references become more common. Slavery becomes prevalent at the very moment when Solon establishes the basis for Athenian democracy. Classical scholar [[Moses Finley]] likewise remarks that Chios, which, according to [[Theopompus]],&lt;ref&gt;Apud Athenaeus, 6:265bc = [[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|FGrH]] 115, fgt.122.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first city to organize a slave trade, also enjoyed an early democratic process (in the 6th century BC). He concludes that "one aspect of Greek history, in short, is the advance hand in hand, of freedom ''and'' slavery."&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), pp.170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic role==
{{see also|Economy of ancient Greece}}
[[File:Amphora olive-gathering BM B226.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Agriculture of ancient Greece|Agriculture]], a common use for slaves, [[black-figure]] [[neck amphora|neck-amphora]] by the [[Antimenes Painter]], [[British Museum]]]]
All activities were open to slaves with the exception of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; For the Greeks, politics was the only occupation worthy of a citizen, the rest being relegated wherever possible to non-citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; It was status that was of importance, not occupation.
 
The principal use of slavery was in [[Agriculture of ancient Greece|agriculture]], the foundation of the Greek economy. Some small landowners might own one slave, or even two.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.149.&lt;/ref&gt; An abundant literature of manuals for landowners (such as the [[Oeconomicus|''Economy'']] of [[Xenophon]] or that of [[Pseudo-Aristotle]]) confirms the presence of dozens of slaves on the larger estates; they could be common labourers or foremen. The extent to which slaves were used as a labour force in farming is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Jameson argues in favour of a very large use of slaves; Wood (1983 and 1988) disputes it.&lt;/ref&gt; It is certain that rural slavery was very common in Athens, and that ancient Greece did not know of the immense slave populations found on the Roman ''[[latifundia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slave labour was prevalent in [[Mining|mines]] and [[Quarry|quarries]], which had large slave populations, often leased out by rich private citizens. The [[strategos]] [[Nicias]] leased a thousand slaves to the silver mines of [[Laurium]] in [[Attica]]; Hipponicos, 600; and Philomidès, 300. Xenophon&lt;ref name="XREV"&gt;''Poroi'' (''On Revenues''), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that they received one [[obolus]] per slave per day, amounting to 60 [[drachma]]s per year. This was one of the most prized investments for Athenians. The number of slaves working in the Laurium mines or in the mills processing ore has been estimated at 30,000.&lt;ref name="L916"&gt;Lauffer, p.916.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon suggested that the city buy a large number of slaves, up to three state slaves per citizen, so that their leasing would assure the upkeep of all the citizens.&lt;ref name="XREV" /&gt;
 
Slaves were also used as craftsmen and [[tradesperson]]s. As in agriculture, they were used for labour that was beyond the capability of the family. The slave population was greatest in workshops: the shield factory of [[Lysias]] employed 120 slaves,&lt;ref&gt;Demosthenes, 12:8–19.&lt;/ref&gt; and the father of [[Demosthenes]] owned 32 cutlers and 20 bedmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobos'', 11:9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves were also employed in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was [[Batman (military)|batman]] to the [[hoplite]]. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread baking and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), pp.151–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Population===
[[File:NAMA Cheval &amp; esclave éthiopien.jpg|thumb|left|An [[Ethiopia]]n slave attempts to break in a horse, date unknown, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]] 
It is difficult to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, given the lack of a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC,&lt;ref name="L916" /&gt; on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BC, [[Thucydides]] remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the [[Decelea|war of Decelea]], mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of [[Demosthenes]],&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp.76–79.&lt;/ref&gt; corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant [[Demetrius Phalereus]] ordered&lt;ref&gt;Ctesicles, apud Athenaeus 6:272c.&lt;/ref&gt; a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 [[metic]]s and 400,000 slaves. The orator [[Hypereides]], in his ''Against Areistogiton'', recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)]], which corresponds to the figures of [[Ctesicles]].&lt;ref&gt;Ctesicles was the author of a history preserved as two fragments in the [[Athenaeus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the literature, it appears that the majority of free Athenians owned at least one slave. [[Aristophanes]], in ''[[Plutus (play)|Plutus]]'', portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 252a26–b15.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of [[Lysias]] ''For the Invalid'', a cripple pleading for a pension explains "my income is very small and now I'm required to do these things myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me."&lt;ref&gt;Lysias, ''For the invalid'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus&lt;ref&gt;Athenaeus, 6:264d.&lt;/ref&gt; cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. [[Plato]], owner of five slaves at the time of his death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'', 9:578d–e.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Thucydides estimates that the isle of [[Chios]] had proportionally the largest number of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydide, 8:40, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources of supply===
{{slavery| expanded= Historical}}
There were four primary sources of slaves: war, in which the defeated would become slaves to the victorious unless a more objective outcome was reached; [[piracy]] (at sea); banditry (on land); and international trade.

====War====
By the rules of war of the period, the victor possessed absolute rights over the vanquished, whether they were soldiers or not.&lt;ref&gt;See Ducrey for further reading.&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement, while not systematic, was common practice. [[Thucydides]] recalls that 7,000 inhabitants of Hyccara in [[Sicily]] were taken prisoner by [[Nicias]] and sold for 120 [[Talent (weight)|talents]] in the neighbouring village of [[Catania]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, 6:62 and 7:13.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise in 348 BC the population of [[Olynthus]] was reduced to slavery, as was that of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] in 335 BC by [[Alexander the Great]] and that of [[Mantineia]] by the [[Achaean League]].&lt;ref name="G57"&gt;Garlan, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of Greek slaves was a constant source of discomfort for free Greeks. The enslavement of cities was also a controversial practice. Some generals refused, such as the [[Sparta]]ns [[Agesilaus II]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Life of Agesilaus'', 7:6.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Callicratidas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Xenophon]], ''Hellenica'', 1:6, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities passed accords to forbid the practice: in the middle of the 3rd century BC, [[Miletus]] agreed not to reduce any free [[Knossos|Knossian]] to slavery, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="G57" /&gt; Conversely, the emancipation by ransom of a city that had been entirely reduced to slavery carried great prestige: [[Cassander]], in 316 BC, restored Thebes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]], 19:53,2.&lt;/ref&gt; Before him, [[Philip II of Macedon]] enslaved and then emancipated [[Stageira]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Alexander'', 7:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piracy and banditry====
[[Piracy]] and banditry provided a significant and consistent supply of slaves,&lt;ref&gt;The Greeks made little differentiation between pirates and bandits, both being called ''lēstai'' or ''peiratai''. Brulé (1978a), p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; though the significance of this source varied according to era and region.&lt;ref&gt;See Ormerod, Brulé (1978b) and Gabrielsen for further reading.&lt;/ref&gt; Pirates and brigands would demand ransom whenever the status of their catch warranted it. Whenever ransom was not paid or not warranted, captives would be sold to a trafficker.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain areas, piracy was practically a national specialty, described by Thucydides as "the old-fashioned" way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, 1:5, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the case in [[Acarnania]], [[Crete]], and [[Aetolia]]. Outside of Greece, this was also the case with [[Illyria]]ns, [[Phoenicia]]ns, and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]]. During the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic period]], [[Cilicia]]ns and the mountain peoples from the coasts of [[Anatolia]] could also be added to the list. [[Strabo]] explains the popularity of the practice among the Cilicians by its profitability; [[Delos]], not far away, allowed for "moving myriad slaves daily".&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 14:5, 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The growing influence of the [[Roman Republic]], a large consumer of slaves, led to development of the market and an aggravation of piracy.&lt;ref&gt;Brulé (1978a), p.6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1st century BC, however, the Romans largely eradicated piracy to protect the Mediterranean trade routes.&lt;ref&gt;Brulé (1978a), pp.6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slave trade====
There was slave trade between kingdoms and states of the wider region. The fragmentary list of slaves confiscated from the property of the mutilators of the ''[[Herma]]i'' mentions 32 slaves whose origins have been ascertained: 13 came from [[Thrace]], 7 from [[Caria]], and the others came from [[Cappadocia]], [[Scythia]], [[Phrygia]], [[Lydia]], [[Syria]], [[Ilyria]], [[Macedon]] and [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett and Pippin (1956), p.278 and Pritchett (1961), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt; Local professionals sold their own people to Greek slave merchants. The principal centres of the slave trade appear to have been [[Ephesus]], [[Byzantium]], and even faraway [[Tanais]] at the mouth of the [[Don River, Russia|Don]]. Some "barbarian" slaves were victims of war or localised piracy, but others were sold by their parents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], 5:6; [[Flavius Philostrates (Philostratos), Greek Philosopher|Philostratus II]], ''[[Life of Apollonius Tyana]]'', 18:7, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a lack of direct evidence of slave traffic, but corroborating evidence exists. Firstly, certain nationalities are consistently and significantly represented in the slave population, such as the corps of Scythian archers employed by Athens as a police force—originally 300, but eventually nearly a thousand.&lt;ref&gt;Plassart, pp.151–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the names given to slaves in the [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedies]] often had a geographical link; thus ''Thratta'', used by [[Aristophanes]] in ''[[The Wasps]]'', ''[[The Acharnians]]'', and ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', simply signified ''Thracian woman''.&lt;ref&gt;During the Classical and [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic]] periods, it was the master who named the slave; this could be the master's name, an ethnic name as mentioned above, a name from their native area (Manes for Lydian, Midas for a Phrygian, etc.), a historical name (Alexander, Cleopatra, etc.). In short, a slave could carry practically any name, but barbarian names could only be given to slaves. Masson, pp.9—21.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the nationality of a slave was a significant criterion for major purchasers; the ancient advice was not to concentrate too many slaves of the same origin in the same place, in order to limit the risk of revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Laws'', 777cd; Pseudo-Aristotle, ''Economics'', 1:5.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also probable that, as with the Romans, certain nationalities were considered more productive as slaves than others.
 
The price of slaves varied in accordance with their ability. Xenophon valued a Laurion miner at 180 [[drachma]]s;&lt;ref name="XREV" /&gt; while a workman at major works was paid one [[drachma]] per day. Demosthenes' father's cutlers were valued at 500 to 600 [[drachma]]s each.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Price was also a function of the quantity of slaves available; in the 4th century BC they were abundant and it was thus a buyer's market. A tax on sale revenues was levied by the market cities. For instance, a large helot market was organized during the festivities at the temple of [[Apollo]] at [[Actium]]. The Acarnanian League, which was in charge of the logistics, received half of the tax proceeds, the other half going to the city of Anactorion, of which Actium was a part.&lt;ref&gt;Circa 216 BC. ''Inscriptiones Graecae'' IX 1², 2, 583.&lt;/ref&gt; Buyers enjoyed a guarantee against [[latent defect]]s; the transaction could be invalidated if the bought slave turned out to be crippled and the buyer had not been warned about it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hypereides]], ''Against Athenogenes'', 15 and 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural growth===
[[File:Funerary stele Louvre Ma4498.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Funerary stele for two young children and their pedagogue, killed in an earthquake, [[Nicomedia]], 1st century BC, [[Louvre]]]]
Curiously, it appears that the Greeks did not "breed" their slaves, at least during the Classical Era, though the proportion of houseborn slaves appears to have been rather large in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and in [[manumission inscriptions at Delphi]].&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the cause of this was natural; mines, for instance, were exclusively a male domain. On the other hand, there were many female domestic slaves. The example of African slaves in the [[Southern United States|American South]] on the other hand demonstrates that slave populations can multiply.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon advised that male and female slaves should be lodged separately, that "…nor children born and bred by our domestics without our knowledge and consent—no unimportant matter, since, if the act of rearing children tends to make good servants still more loyally disposed, cohabiting but sharpens ingenuity for mischief in the bad."&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', IX. Trans [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext98/econm10.txt H. G. Dakyns], accessed 16 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation is perhaps economic; even a skilled slave was cheap,&lt;ref&gt;Pritchett and Pippin, pp.276–281.&lt;/ref&gt; so it may have been cheaper to purchase a slave than to raise one.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.58. Finley (1997), p.154–155 remains doubtful.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, childbirth placed the slave-mother's life at risk, and the baby was not guaranteed to survive to adulthood.&lt;ref name="G58"&gt;Garlan, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[House slave|Houseborn slaves]] (''oikogeneis'') often constituted a privileged class. They were, for example, entrusted to take the children to school; they were "[[Pedagogy|pedagogues]]" in the first sense of the term.&lt;ref name="C203"&gt;Carlier, p.203.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them were the offspring of the master of the house, but in most cities, notably Athens, a child inherited the status of its mother.&lt;ref name="G58" /&gt;

==Status of slaves==
The Greeks had many degrees of enslavement. There was a multitude of categories, ranging from free citizen to chattel slave, and including [[Penestae]] or [[helots]], disenfranchised citizens, freedmen, bastards, and [[metic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; The common ground was the deprivation of civic rights.
 
[[Moses Finley]] proposed a set of criteria for different degrees of enslavement:&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), pp.165–89.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Right to own property
:* Authority over the work of another
:* Power of punishment over another
:* Legal rights and duties (liability to arrest and/or arbitrary punishment, or to litigate)
:* Familial rights and privileges (marriage, inheritance, etc.)
:* Possibility of social mobility (manumission or emancipation, access to citizen rights)
:* Religious rights and obligations
:* Military rights and obligations (military service as servant, heavy or light soldier, or sailor)

===Athenian slaves===
[[File:NAMA Loutrophoros Polystratos.jpg|thumb|left|Funerary [[loutrophoros]]; on the right a bearded slave carries his master's shield and helm, 380–370 BC, [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]]]] 
Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time.&lt;ref name="G47"&gt;Garlan, p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antiphon]], ''First Tetralogy'', 2:7, 4:7; Demosthenes, ''Against Pantenos'', 51 (2) and ''Against Evergos'', 14, 15, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma.&lt;ref name="C203" /&gt; With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture.&lt;ref&gt;For instance [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]], ''Against Leocrates'', 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was [[Themistocles]]'s Persian slave [[Sicinnus]] (the counterpart of [[Ephialtes of Trachis]]), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] and helped Athenians in the [[Battle of Salamis]]. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest ({{lang|grc|δίκη βλάβης}} / ''dikē blabēs'').&lt;ref name="C203" /&gt; Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen ({{lang|grc|γραφὴ ὕβρεως}} / ''graphē hybreōs''); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess ({{lang|grc|ὕβρις}} / ''[[hubris]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, ''Against Timarchus'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isocrates]] claimed that "not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0144%3Aspeech%3D12%3Asection%3D181 |title= Isocrates, Panathenaicus, section 181 |author= George Norlin (ed.) |website= Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate= 6 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the master's power over his slave was not absolute.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Draco (lawgiver)|Draco]]'s law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: "was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?"&lt;ref&gt;Lycurgus, ''Against Leocrates'', 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a {{lang|grc|δίκη φονική}} (''dikē phonikē''), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood.&lt;ref name="M213"&gt;Morrow, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC, the suspect was judged by the [[Palladion]], a court which had jurisdiction over [[unintentional homicide]];&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Constitution of the Athenians'', 57:3.&lt;/ref&gt; the imposed penalty seems to have been more than a fine but less than death—maybe exile, as was the case in the murder of a Metic.&lt;ref name="M213" /&gt;
[[File:Mines 1.jpg|thumb|right|Slaves working in a mine of [[Laurium]]]]

However, slaves did belong to their master's household. A newly-bought slave was welcomed with nuts and fruits, just like a newly-wed wife.&lt;ref name="G47" /&gt; Slaves took part in most of the civic and family cults; they were expressly invited to join the banquet of the ''Choes'', second day of the [[Anthesteria]],&lt;ref name="B259"&gt;Burkert, p.259.&lt;/ref&gt; and were allowed initiation into the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].&lt;ref name="G47" /&gt; A slave could claim asylum in a temple or at an altar, just like a free man. The slaves shared the gods of their masters and could keep their own religious customs if any.&lt;ref name="B259" /&gt;

Slaves could not own property, but their masters often let them save up to purchase their freedom,&lt;ref&gt;Carlier, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt; and records survive of slaves operating businesses by themselves, making only a fixed tax-payment to their masters. Athens also had a law forbidding the striking of slaves: if a person struck what appeared to be a slave in Athens, that person might find himself hitting a fellow-citizen, because many citizens dressed no better. It astonished other Greeks that Athenians tolerated back-chat from slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Old Oligarch, ''Constitution of the Athenians'', 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Athenian slaves fought together with Athenian freemen at the [[battle of Marathon]], and the monuments memorialize them.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, 1:29, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was formally decreed before the [[battle of Salamis]] that the citizens should "save themselves, their women, children, and slaves".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Themistocles'', 10:4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves had special sexual restrictions and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] relationships ("''A slave shall not be the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash.''"), and they were forbidden from the [[palaestra]]e ("''A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools.''"). Both laws are attributed to Solon.&lt;ref&gt;Aeschines, ''Against Timarchos'' 1.138–139&lt;/ref&gt; Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a ''paidagogos'', to escort the boy in his travels.

The sons of vanquished foes would be enslaved and often forced to work in male brothels, as in the case of [[Phaedo of Elis]], who at the request of [[Socrates]] was bought and freed from such an enterprise by the philosopher's rich friends.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of the Philosophers,'' 2.105&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, it is attested in sources that the rape of slaves was prosecuted, at least occasionally.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Kroll "Knabenliebe" in Pauly-Wissowa, ''Realencyclopaedie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft,'' vol. 11, cols. 897–906 [http://www.well.com/user/aquarius/kroll-pederasty.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slaves in Gortyn===
[[File:Gortys law inscription.jpg|thumb|right|A fragment of the [[Gortyn code]] in [[Gortyn]], [[Crete]]]]
In [[Gortyn]], in Crete, according to a [[Gortyn code|code]] engraved in stone dating to the 6th century BC, slaves (''doulos'' or ''oikeus'') found themselves in a state of great dependence. Their children belonged to the master.&lt;ref&gt;Lévy (1995), p.178.&lt;/ref&gt; The master was responsible for all their offences, and, inversely, he received amends for crimes committed against his slaves by others.&lt;ref name="F200"&gt;Finley (1997), p.200.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Gortyn code, where all punishment was monetary, fines were doubled for slaves committing a misdemeanour or felony. Conversely, an offence committed against a slave was much less expensive than an offence committed against a free person. As an example, the rape of a free woman by a slave was punishable by a fine of 200 [[stater]]s (400 [[drachm]]s), while the rape of a non-virgin slave by another slave brought a fine of only one obolus (a sixth of a drachm).&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves did have the right to possess a house and livestock, which could be transmitted to descendants, as could clothing and household furnishings.&lt;ref name="F200" /&gt; Their family was recognized by law: they could marry, divorce, write a testament and inherit just like free men.&lt;ref&gt;Lévy (1995), p.179.&lt;/ref&gt;

===A specific case: debt slavery===
Prior to its interdiction by [[Solon]], Athenians practiced debt enslavement: a citizen incapable of paying his debts became "enslaved" to the creditor.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Constitution of the Athenians'', See also 1:2 and Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'', 13:2.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of this dependency is a much controversial issue among modern historians: was it truly slavery or another form of bondage? However, this issue primarily concerned those peasants known as "hektēmoroi"&lt;ref&gt;Literally, "six-parters" or "sixthers", because they owed either one-sixth or five-sixths (depending on the interpretation) of their harvest. See Von Fritz for further reading.&lt;/ref&gt; working leased land belonging to rich landowners and unable to pay their rents. In theory, those so enslaved would be liberated when their original debts were repaid. The system was developed with variants throughout the [[Near East]] and is cited in the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Deuteronomy]], 15:12–17.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Solon put an end to it with the {{lang|grc|σεισάχθεια}} / ''[[seisachtheia]]'', liberation of debts, which prevented all claim to the person by the debtor and forbade the sale of free Athenians, including by themselves. [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' quotes one of Solon's poems: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;And many a man whom fraud or law had sold&lt;br&gt;
Far from his god-built land, an outcast slave,&lt;br&gt;
I brought again to Athens; yea, and some,&lt;br&gt;
Exiles from home through debt’s oppressive load,&lt;br&gt;
Speaking no more the dear Athenian tongue,&lt;br&gt;
But wandering far and wide, I brought again;&lt;br&gt;
And those that here in vilest slavery (''douleia'')&lt;br&gt;
Crouched ‘neath a master’s (''despōtes'') frown, I set them free.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Constitution of the Athenians]]'' 12:4. Trans. by [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/athenian/ Sir Frederic Kenyon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222140728/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/athenian/ |date=2008-02-22 }}, accessed 15 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though much of Solon's vocabulary is that of "traditional" slavery, servitude for debt was at least different in that the enslaved Athenian remained an Athenian, dependent on another Athenian, in his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this aspect which explains the great wave of discontent with slavery of the 6th century BC, which was not intended to free all slaves but only those enslaved by debt.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; The reforms of Solon left two exceptions: the guardian of an unmarried woman who had lost her virginity had the right to sell her as a slave,&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''Life of Solon'' 23.2.&lt;/ref&gt; and a citizen could "expose" (abandon) unwanted newborn children.&lt;ref&gt;Brulé (1992), p.83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manumission===
The practice of [[manumission]] is confirmed to have existed in [[Chios]] from the 6th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.79.&lt;/ref&gt; It probably dates back to an earlier period, as it was an oral procedure. Informal emancipations are also confirmed in the classical period. It was sufficient to have witnesses, who would escort the citizen to a public emancipation of his slave, either at the [[Theatre of Ancient Greece#Theatre Structure and Layout|theatre]] or before a public tribunal.&lt;ref name="G80"&gt;Garlan, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; This practice was outlawed in Athens in the middle of the 6th century BC to avoid public disorder.&lt;ref name="G80" /&gt;

The practice became more common in the 4th century BC and gave rise to inscriptions in stone which have been recovered from shrines such as [[Delphi]] and [[Dodona]]. They primarily date to the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, and the 1st century AD. Collective manumission was possible; an example is known from the 2nd century BC in the island of [[Thasos]]. It probably took place during a period of war as a reward for the slaves' loyalty,&lt;ref&gt;Dunant and Pouilloux, pp.35–37, no.173.&lt;/ref&gt; but in most cases the documentation deals with a voluntary act on the part of the master (predominantly male, but in the Hellenistic period also female).

The slave was often required to pay for himself an amount at least equivalent to his street value. To this end they could use their savings or take a so-called "friendly" loan ({{lang|grc|ἔρανος}} / ''eranos'') from their master, a friend or a client like the [[hetaera]] [[Neaira (hetaera)|Neaira]] did.&lt;ref&gt;Demosthenes, ''Against Neaira'', 59:29–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emancipation was often of a religious nature, where the slave was considered to be "sold" to a deity, often Delphian [[Apollo]],&lt;ref&gt;See Foucart for further reading.&lt;/ref&gt; or was consecrated after his emancipation. The temple would receive a portion of the monetary transaction and would guarantee the contract. The manumission could also be entirely civil, in which case the magistrate played the role of the deity.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The slave's freedom could be either total or partial, at the master's whim. In the former, the emancipated slave was legally protected against all attempts at re-enslavement—for instance, on the part of the former master's inheritors.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.83.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, the emancipated slave could be liable to a number of obligations to the former master. The most restrictive contract was the ''paramone'', a type of enslavement of limited duration during which time the master retained practically absolute rights.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt;

In regard to the city, the emancipated slave was far from equal to a citizen by birth. He was liable to all types of obligations, as one can see from the proposals of [[Plato]] in ''The Laws'':&lt;ref&gt;''Laws'', 11:915 a–c.&lt;/ref&gt; presentation three times monthly at the home of the former master, forbidden to become richer than him, etc. In fact, the status of emancipated slaves was similar to that of [[metic]]s, the residing foreigners, who were free but did not enjoy a citizen's rights.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spartan slaves===
[[Sparta]]n citizens used [[helot]]s, a dependent group collectively owned by the state. It is uncertain whether they had chattel slaves as well. There are mentions of people manumitted by Spartans, which was supposedly forbidden for helots, or sold outside of [[Lakonia]]: the poet [[Alcman]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Herakleides Lembos]], fgt. 9 Dilts and [[Suda|Suidas]], s.v. {{lang|grc|Ἀλκμάν}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a Philoxenos from Cytherea, reputedly enslaved with all his fellow citizens when his city was conquered, later sold to an Athenian;&lt;ref&gt;Suidas, s.v. {{lang|grc|Φιλόξενος}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a Spartan cook bought by [[Dionysius the Elder]] or by a king of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], both versions being mentioned by Plutarch;&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Lycurgus'', 12:13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the famous Spartan nurses, much appreciated by Athenian parents.&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Lycurgus'', 16:5; ''Life of Alcibiades'', 5:3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some texts mention both slaves and helots, which seems to indicate that they were not the same thing. [[Plato]] in ''[[Alcibiades I]]'' cites "the ownership of slaves, and notably helots" among the Spartan riches,&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|…ἀνδραπόδων κτήσει τῶν τε ἄλλων καὶ τῶν εἱλωτικῶν}}", ''Alcibiades I'', 122d.&lt;/ref&gt; and Plutarch writes about "slaves and helots".&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|grc|…δοὐλοις καὶ Εἴλωσι}}", ''Comp. Lyc. et Num.'', 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, according to Thucydides, the agreement that ended the 464 BC revolt of helots stated that any Messenian rebel who might hereafter be found within the [[Peloponnese]] was "to be the slave of his captor", which means that the ownership of chattel slaves was not illegal at that time.

Most historians thus concur that chattel slaves were indeed used in the Greek city-state of Sparta, at least after the Lacedemonian victory of 404 BC against Athens, but not in great numbers and only among the upper classes.&lt;ref&gt;Oliva, pp.172–173; Ducat, p.55; Lévy (2003), pp.112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; As was in the other Greek cities, chattel slaves could be purchased at the market or taken in war.

==Slavery conditions==
[[File:Black slave Louvre Br361.jpg|thumb|right|Black captive with tied hands, [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[musée du Louvre]]]] 
It is difficult to appreciate the condition of Greek slaves. According to [[Aristotle]], the daily routine of slaves could be summed up in three words: "work, discipline, and feeding".&lt;ref&gt;''Economics'', 1344a35.&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophon's advice is to treat slaves as domestic animals, that is to say punish disobedience and reward good behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Economics'', 13:6.&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Aristotle prefers to see slaves treated as children and to use not only orders but also recommendations, as the slave is capable of understanding reasons when they are explained.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', I, 3, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek literature abounds with scenes of slaves being flogged; it was a means of forcing them to work, as were control of rations, clothing, and rest. This violence could be meted out by the master or the supervisor, who was possibly also a slave. Thus, at the beginning of [[Aristophanes]]' ''[[The Knights]]'' (4–5), two slaves complain of being "bruised and thrashed without respite" by their new supervisor. However, Aristophanes himself cites what is a typical old saw in [[ancient Greek comedy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"He also dismissed those slaves who kept on running off, or deceiving someone, or getting whipped. They were always led out crying, so one of their fellow slaves could mock the bruises and ask then: 'Oh you poor miserable fellow, what's happened to your skin? Surely a huge army of lashes from a whip has fallen down on you and laid waste your back?'"&lt;ref&gt;''Peace'', v.743–749. Trans. [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/aristophanes/peace.htm Ian Johnston], 2006, accessed 17 May 06.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The condition of slaves varied very much according to their status; the mine slaves of Laureion and the ''[[prostitution in ancient Greece|pornai]]'' (brothel prostitutes) lived a particularly brutal existence, while public slaves, craftsmen, tradesmen and bankers enjoyed relative independence.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.147.&lt;/ref&gt; In return for a fee ({{lang|grc|ἀποφορά}} / ''apophora'') paid to their master, they could live and work alone.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; They could thus earn some money on the side, sometimes enough to purchase their freedom. Potential emancipation was indeed a powerful motivator, though the real scale of this is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient writers considered that Attic slaves enjoyed a "peculiarly happy lot":&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, p.210. See Plato, ''The Republic'', 8:563b; Demosthenes, ''[[Third Philippic]]'', 3; Aeschines, ''Against Timarchos'', 54; Aristophanes, ''[[Assemblywomen]]'', 721–22 and [[Plautus]], ''Stichus'', 447–50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pseudo-Xenophon]] deplores the liberties taken by Athenian slaves: "as for the slaves and Metics of Athens, they take the greatest licence; you cannot just strike them, and they do not step aside to give you free passage".&lt;ref&gt;''Constitution of the Athenians'', I, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This alleged good treatment did not prevent 20,000 Athenian slaves from running away at the end of the [[Peloponnesian War]] at the incitement of the Spartan garrison at [[Attica]] in [[Decelea]].&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides (7:27).&lt;/ref&gt; These were principally skilled artisans (''kheirotekhnai''), probably among the better-treated slaves. The title of a 4th-century comedy by [[Antiphanes (comic poet)|Antiphanes]], ''The Runaway-catcher'' ({{lang|grc|Δραπεταγωγός}}),&lt;ref&gt;Apud Athenaeus, 161e.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that slave flight was not uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Cartledge, p.139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, there are no records of a large-scale Greek slave revolt comparable to that of [[Spartacus]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.180.&lt;/ref&gt; It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning.&lt;ref&gt;Finley (1997), p.162–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], ''On the Murder of Herodes'', 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views of Greek slavery==
===Historical views=== &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Gorean]] --&gt;
[[File:Actor slave Louvre CA265.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction of a slave seated on an altar, looking at the purse he is about to steal, c. 400–375 BC, [[Louvre]]]]

Very few authors of antiquity call slavery into question. To [[Homer]] and the pre-classical authors, slavery was an inevitable consequence of war. [[Heraclitus]] states that "War is the father of all, the king of all ... he turns some into slaves and sets others free".&lt;ref&gt;Heraclitus, frag.53.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle also felt this way, stating "the law by which whatever is taken in war is supposed to belong to the victors."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/greek-slaves.asp|title=The Politics- On Slavery|author=Aristotle|website=Internet History Sourcebooks|access-date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does also state that it might have a few issues though,”For what if the cause of war be unjust?”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If the war was because of an unfair or incorrect reason, should the victors of that war be allowed to take the losers as slaves?

During the classical period the main justification for slavery was economic.&lt;ref&gt;Mactoux (1980), p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; From a philosophical point of view, the idea of "natural" slavery emerged at the same time; thus, as [[Aeschylus]] states in ''[[The Persians]]'', the Greeks "[o]f no man are they called the slaves or vassals",&lt;ref&gt;''The Persians'', v.242. Trans. ed. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aesch.+Pers.+1 Herbert Weir Smyth], accessed 17 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Persian people|Persians]], as [[Euripides]] states in ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'', "are all slaves, except one"—the [[Great King]].&lt;ref&gt;''Helen'', v.276.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] theorizes about this latent idea at the end of the 5th century BC. According to him, the temperate climate of [[Anatolia]] produced a placid and submissive people.&lt;ref&gt;Hippocratic corpus, ''Of Airs, Waters, and Places'' (''Peri aeron hydaton topon''), 23.&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation is reprised by [[Plato]],&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'', 4:435a–436a.&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Aristotle]] in ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 7:1327b.&lt;/ref&gt; where he develops the concept of "natural slavery": "for he that can foresee with his mind is naturally ruler and naturally master, and he that can do these things with his body is subject and naturally a slave."&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 1:2, 2. Trans. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0058&amp;query=book%3D%231 H. Rackham], accessed 17 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to an animal, a slave can comprehend reason but "…has not got the deliberative part at all."&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 1:13, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alcidamas]], at the same time as Aristotle, took the opposite view, saying: "''nature'' has made ''nobody'' a slave".&lt;ref&gt;John D. Bury and Russell Meiggs (4th ed. 1975): A History of Greece to the Death of Alexander the Great. New York: St. Martin's Press, page 375&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, the concept that all men, whether Greek or barbarian, belonged to the same race was being developed by the [[sophism|Sophists]]&lt;ref&gt;For instance [[Hippias|Hippias of Elis]] apud Platon, ''[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]'', 337c; [[Antiphon (person)|Antiphon]], ''Pap. Oxyr.'', 9:1364.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus that certain men were slaves although they had the soul of a freeman and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;An idea already expressed by [[Euripides]], ''Ion'', 854–856frag.831.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle himself recognized this possibility and argued that slavery could not be imposed unless the master was better than the slave, in keeping with his theory of "natural" slavery.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 1:5, 10.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sophists concluded that true servitude was not a matter of status but a matter of spirit; thus, as [[Menander]] stated, "be free in the mind, although you are slave: and thus you will no longer be a slave".&lt;ref&gt;Menander, frag. 857.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea, repeated by the [[stoicism|Stoics]] and the [[Epicurianism|Epicurians]], was not so much an opposition to slavery as a trivialization of it.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.130.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Greeks could not comprehend an absence of slaves. Slaves exist even in the "[[wiktionary:Cloudcuckooland|Cloudcuckooland]]" of Aristophanes' ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' as well as in the ideal cities of Plato's ''Laws'' or ''Republic''.&lt;ref&gt;''Republic'', 10:469b ''sq.'' and 470c.&lt;/ref&gt; The utopian cities of [[Phaleas of Chalcedon]] and [[Hippodamus of Miletus]] are based on the equal distribution of property, but public slaves are used respectively as craftsmen&lt;ref&gt;Apud Aristotle, ''Politics'', 1267b.&lt;/ref&gt; and land workers.&lt;ref&gt;Apud Aristotle, ''Politics'', 1268a.&lt;/ref&gt; The "reversed cities" placed women in power or even saw the end of private property, as in ''[[Lysistrata]]'' or ''[[Assemblywomen]]'', but could not picture slaves in charge of masters. The only societies without slaves were those of the [[Golden Age]], where all needs were met without anyone having to work. In this type of society, as explained by Plato,&lt;ref&gt;''Politics'', 271a–272b.&lt;/ref&gt; one reaped generously without sowing. In Telekleides' ''Amphictyons''&lt;ref&gt;Apud [[Athenaeus]], 268 b–d.&lt;/ref&gt; barley loaves fight with wheat loaves for the honor of being eaten by men. Moreover, objects move themselves—dough kneads itself, and the jug pours itself. Similarly, Aristotle said that slaves would not be necessary "if every instrument could accomplish its own work... the shuttle would weave and the plectrum touch the lyre without a hand to guide them", like the legendary constructs of Daedalus and Hephaestus.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politics'', Book 1 Part 4&lt;/ref&gt; Society without slaves is thus relegated to a different time and space. In a "normal" society, one needs slaves. Aristotle argues that slaves are a necessity though, saying "Property is part of the household,&amp;nbsp;... For no man can live well or indeed live at all, unless he be provided with necessaries."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also argues that slaves are the most important part of the property as they "take precedence of all the instruments."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This would suggest that at least some slaves would be treated well for the same reason one would take great care of their most important tools. By viewing slaves as tools of a household, it creates another reason for acceptance of slavery. Aristotle says "indeed the use of slaves and of tame animals is not very different," showing as well that at least in part, some slaves were thought of no higher than the common tamed animals in use at the time. Antiphon viewed slaves as a bit more than common animals or tools. On the topic of a man killing his own slave, he says that the man should "purify himself and withhold himself from those places prescribed by law, in the hope that by doing so he will best avoid disaster."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/greek-slaves.asp|title=On the Choreutes|author=Antiphon|access-date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that there still is some sense of inappropriateness in killing a slave, even one owned by the killer.

Punishment of slaves would have been swift and harsh. Demosthenes viewed punishment for slaves as acceptable in the form of physical harm or injuries for all that they may have done wrong, stating "the body of a slave is made responsible for all his misdeeds, whereas corporal punishment is the last penalty to inflict on a free man."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/greek-slaves.asp|title=Against Timocrates|author=Demosthenes|website=Internet History Sourcebooks|access-date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was spoken about in legal proceedings, suggesting that it would have been a widely accepted way of treating slaves.

Slavery in Greek antiquity has long been an object of [[apologetics|apologetic]] discourse among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of [[colonialism|colonial]] slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus [[Henri-Alexandre Wallon]] in 1847 published a ''History of Slavery in Antiquity'' among his works for the [[Abolitionism in France|abolition of slavery]] in the [[French colonial empires|French colonies]].

In the 19th century, a politico-economic discourse emerged. It concerned itself with distinguishing the phases in the organisation of human societies and correctly identifying the place of Greek slavery. The influence of [[Marx]] is decisive; for him the ancient society was characterized by development of private ownership and the dominant (and not secondary as in other pre-capitalist societies) character of slavery as a [[mode of production]].&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[positivism|Positivists]] represented by the historian [[Eduard Meyer]] (''Slavery in Antiquity'', 1898) were soon to oppose the [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory. According to him slavery was the foundation of Greek democracy. It was thus a legal and social phenomenon, and not economic.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current historiography developed in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, it saw in slavery the conditions for the development of elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2011, Greek slavery remains the subject of historiographical debate, on two questions in particular: can it be said that ancient Greece was a "slave society", and did Greek slaves comprise a [[social class]]?&lt;ref&gt;Garlan, p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]] of [[Germany]] bestows the '''Sofia Kovalevskaya Award''' every two years.  [[Sofia Kovalevskaya]] (1850–1891) was the first major Russian female [[mathematician]], who made important contributions to [[mathematical analysis]], [[differential equations]] and [[mechanics]], and the first woman appointed to a full [[professorship]] in [[Northern Europe]]. This prestigious award named in her honor is given to promising young academics to pursue their line of research in the sciences or arts and humanities. The foundation encourages applications from all areas of the academy so long as the investigator received a Ph.D. in the last six years and may be categorized as "top flight" by their publications and experience as commensurate with age.

There have been 59 awards since the inception of the Sofia Kovalevskaya Award in 2002. Individual awards may total up to 1.6 million Euro each. Funds are awarded to build and lead a team of researchers for a five-year period within a German host institution. The award is arguably one of the most prestigious and innovative awards in the world and is designed to foster long-term connections between Germany and world class young talent.

&lt;!-- The next round of award winners, up to eight in total, will be announced in late March 2010. In the last round there were approximately 75 applicants and eight awards available, therefore the success rate of each application was around 10-15%. The next application period begins in 2011 and the number of awards will be announced nearer to the Autumn of 2011. --&gt;

The 1959 Soviet Union census reported populations in 126 [[nationality]] ([[ethnic group]]) categories, in comparison to only 97 categories in the 1939 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_nation.php |title=Демоскоп Weekly - Приложение. Справочник статистических показателей |publisher=Demoscope.ru |date=2007-05-27 |accessdate=2013-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The nationality categories reported in the census were based on a recoding from verbatim responses to a question on nationality.

'''Swami Jnanananda''' born as '''Bhupathiraju Lakshminarasimha Raju''' (December 5, 1896 - September 21, 1969) was an Indian Yogi and Nuclear Physicist.

==Early childhood==
He was born in a village in [[West Godavari]] district of [[Andhra Pradesh]] on 5 December 1896. After primary schooling, he joined in the Taylor High School, [[Narsapuram]]. His father, Rama Raju, was interested in Vedic and scholarly pursuits. His large collection of books and scriptures gave his son an opportunity to study them at an early age. Swami Jnanananda was married by his father in 1916 but, inspired by the life of Gouthama [[Buddha]], he renounced worldly pleasures and went to Lumbini, in Nepal. He has traveled many pilgrim centres in India for about 10 years.

==Philosopher==
He spent around 10 years in the Himalayas and practised [[Yoga]] and studied Vedic Literature. He went to [[Germany]] with an interest in Physics. He studied Mathematics and Physics at [[Dresden]]. He took up research in High Tension and X-Ray Physics at [[Charles University]], [[Prague]]. He was christened as Swami Jnanananda by his guru, [[Swami Purnananda]]. He went to Germany in 1927 to deliver religious discourses and to get his religious works printed. His lectures attracted the attention of Prof. Dember at the [[Dresden University of Technology|Dresden University]].

==Scientist==
The Einstein's theory of relativity caught the attention of the swamiji. He requested Prof. Dember and successfully completed the undergraduate course in two years in 1929. He gave over 150 lectures on different subjects in yoga. His major work, `Purna Sutras', delivered in Germany were printed during this period.

He went to [[Czechoslovakia]] to work at the [[Charles University]] with Prof. Dolshek for about three years. His research at the university led to the development of precise methods in X-Ray spectroscopy for which he was awarded a D.Sc. in 1936.

He has shifted to England and joined [[University of Liverpool]] under [[Sir James Chadwick]] during the World War II. He has worked in [[Nuclear Physics]], Spectroscopy of Beta Radiations and received his Ph.D. He continued his research on Beta Ray spectroscopy in the United States with a number of radioactive isotopes at the [[Michigan University]]. He completed his book on ''High Vacuum''.

==Back to India==
He returned to [[India]] in 1947 and joined as senior scientific officer at the [[National Physical Laboratory, India|National Physics Laboratory]] in Delhi. He met with an accident at Bhimavaram in 1954 was admitted to the [[King George Hospital, Visakhapatnam|King George Hospital]] in [[Visakhapatnam]]. On the request of Vice-Chancellor of [[Andhra University]], he joined the Physics Department for developing nuclear physics facilities in 1954. Nuclear Physics as a separate Department was started on July 1, 1956. He was promoted as Professor and Head of the Department. He continued in that position till 1965. The University authorities named the laboratory as "Swami Jnanananda Laboratories of Nuclear Research".

'''Taranchi''' is a term denoting the [[Muslim]] sedentary population living in oases around the [[Tarim Basin]] in today's [[Xinjiang]], whose native language is [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[Karluks|Karluk]], and whose ancestral heritages include [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] and [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] populations of Tarim and the later [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] peoples such as the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghurs]], [[Karluks]], [[Yagma|Yaghmas]], [[Chigils]], [[Basmyl]]s and lastly, the [[Mongols|Mongolic]] tribes of the [[Chagatai Khanate]].

==Name==
The same name &amp;ndash; which simply means 'a farmer' in [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]] &amp;ndash; can be extended to agrarian populations of the [[Ferghana Valley]] and oases of the entire [[Central Asian]] [[Turkestan]]. Although the Tarim Basin (with such oases as [[Kashgar]], [[Kumul (city)|Kumul]], [[Khotan]] and [[Turpan]]) is the agrarian '''Taranchi'''s' traditional homeland, they have during the [[Qing]] period on [[China]], migrated to regions that are now [[Urumqi]] and [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]]. Many Taranchis were encouraged to settle in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili valley]] alongside sedentary [[Xibe people|Xibe]] garrisons and the nomadic [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] by the [[Qing]] military governors after the conquest of the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]]s by the Chinese. In the [[multiethnic]] Muslim culture of [[Xinjiang]], the term Taranchi is considered contradistinctive to [[Sart]], which denotes towns dwelling traders and craftsmen. It of course excluded the ruling classes of the oases Muslim states, often called [[Moghol]]/[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] or [[Dolan people|Dolan]] because of the [[Uysyn|Doglat]] [[Mongol]] origin of the [[Chagatai khans|Chagatay]]-[[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] dynasties. However, from a modern perspective, Taranchi, [[Sart]] and [[Moghol]] Dolans cannot be considered three distinctive ethnic groups, but rather three different [[social class|classes]] or [[castes]] in the same [[cultural]]-[[Natural language|linguistic]] zone that was [[Chagatai language|Chagatay]]-[[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]].

In the early 20th century, the [[geopolitical]] [[The Great Game|Great Game]] between [[Russia]] and [[Great Britain]] resulted in the division of Central Asia among modern [[nation-states]]. All oases farmers native to [[Xinjiang]] became part of [[Uyghur people|Uyghur nationality]] by 1934. While most [[Sart]]s of oases or Ili Valley towns became part of the Uyghur nationality, those with particularly strong ties to regions west of [[Xinjiang]] became Uzbeks. Sometimes such divisions are very arbitrary, because [[Kashgar]]is can be as distinctive from [[Turpan]]liks as they are from [[Andijan]]liks.{{fact|date=November 2017}}

==History==
{{main article|Zunghar Genocide|Migration to Xinjiang}}

The Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the [[Prophet Muhammad]], had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan Buddhists]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Zunghar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.

Khoja Afaq asked the 5th Dalai Lama when he fled to Lhasa to help his Afaqi faction take control of the Tarim Basin (Kashgaria).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA86#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dzungar leader Galdan was then asked by the Dalai Lama to restore Khoja Afaq as ruler of Kashgararia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Khoja Afaq collaborated with Galdan's Dzungars when the Dzungars conquered the Tarim Basin from 1678-1680 and set up the Afaqi Khojas as puppet client rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA50&amp;dq=1640+zunghar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=geATVPuYMc3jsATdoYLgBQ&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=1640%20zunghar&amp;f=false ed. Starr 2004], p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DpeQhJ3hcwsC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Kim 2008, p. 117]&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama blessed Galdan's conquest of the Tarim Basin and Turfan Basin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=1640+zunghar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D5MUVLvoLbKHsQTElgI&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=1640%20zunghar&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

67,000 patman (each patman is 4 piculs and 5 pecks) of grain 48,000 silver ounces were forced to be paid yearly by Kashgar to the Dzungars and cash was also paid by the rest of the cities to the Dzungars. Trade, milling, and distilling taxes, corvée labor,saffron, cotton, and grain were also extracted by the Dzungars from the Tarim Basin. Every harvest season, women and food had to be provided to Dzungars when they came to extract the taxes from them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA92 Millward 2007], p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Dzungars levied the traditional nomadic Alban poll tax upon the Muslims of Altishahr, the Muslims viewed it as the payment of [[jizyah]] (a tax traditionally taken from non-Muslims by Muslim conquerors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Saintly Brokers: Uyghur Muslims, Trade, and the Making of Qing Central Asia, 1696--1814|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpeQhJ3hcwsC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-1-109-10126-3|pages=175–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the Qing dynasty of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu Bannermen carried out the Zunghar genocide, nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.

The [[Qing dynasty]] conquered the [[Zunghar Khanate]] in 1759 and thereafter perpetrated wholesale massacres and the [[Zunghar Genocide]] on the native [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongol]] population. The dynasty consolidated their authority by settling Han Chinese, Hui, and Taranchi (Uyghur) emigrants in the Dzungar (Zunghar) lands of [[Dzungaria]], together with a [[Manchu]] Qing garrison of [[Eight banners|Bannermen]]. The Han, Hui, and Taranchi (Uyghurs) worked as farmers on state farms in the region to supply the Manchu garrison with food. The Qing put the whole region under the rule of a [[General of Ili]] , headquartered at the fort of [[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] (the so-called "Manchu Kuldja", or Yili), {{convert|30|km}} west of [[Ghulja]] (Yining). The Qing [[Qianlong Emperor]] conquered the Jungharian (Dzungarian) plateau and the Tarim Basin, bringing the two separate regions, respectively north and south of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains, under his rule as Xinjiang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Newby 2005], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The south was inhabited by Turkic Muslims (Uyghurs) and the north by Junghar Mongols (Dzungars).&lt;ref name="Newby 2005"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KTmO416hNQ8C&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Newby 2005], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dzungars were also called "Eleuths" or "Kalmyks".

Xinjiang at this time did not exist as one unit. It consisted of the two separate political entities of Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin (Eastern Turkestan).&lt;ref name="Michell 1870"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=reBFF3fWjPAC&amp;pg=RA1-PA2&amp;dq=Dzungaria+migrants&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jhfuUpn3MZXMsQTWu4DIAg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dzungaria%20migrants&amp;f=false Michell 1870], p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 1847"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SV9AAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Martin 1847], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ik4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA554#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fisher 1852], p. 554.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KGlJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA681#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume 23'' 1852], p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt; There was the Zhunbu (Dzungar region) and Huibu (Muslim region).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Dzungaria or Ili was called Zhunbu 準部 (Dzungar region) Tianshan Beilu 天山北路 (Northern March), "Xinjiang" 新疆 (New Frontier),&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Dzongarie, Djoongaria,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6MysOTiETbsC&amp;pg=PA122#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Bulletin de la Section de géographie, Volume 10'' 1896], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Soungaria,&lt;ref name="Bridgman &amp; Williams 1837"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l5VCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Bridgman &amp; Williams 1837], p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AQAAMAAJ 1837, p. 273"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6is7AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Chinese Repository, Volume 5'' 1837], p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; or "Kalmykia" (La Kalmouquie in French).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CghUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mentelle, Edme; Brun, Malte 1804, p. 144.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CghUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA160#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Mentelle, Edme; Brun, Malte 1804, p. 160.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was formerly the area of the [[Zunghar Khanate]] 準噶爾汗國, the land of the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]].

The Chinese Repository said that "Neither the natives nor the Chinese appear to have any general name to designate the Mohammedan colonies. They are called Kashgar, Bokhára, Chinese Turkestan, &amp;c., by foreigners, none of which seem to be very appropriate. They have also been called Jagatai, after a son of Genghis khan, to whom this country fell as his portion after his father’s death, and be included all the eight Mohammedan cities, with some of the surrounding countries, in one kingdom.

=== Zunghar Genocide ===
{{main article|Zunghar Genocide}}

The [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] (or Zunghar), [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]] who lived in an area that stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern [[Kazakhstan]] and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]] (most of which is located in present-day [[Xinjiang]]), were the last [[nomadic empire]] to threaten China, which they did from the early 17th century through the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Chapters 3–7 of {{Harvnb|Perdue|2005}} describe the rise and fall of the Dzungar empire and its relations with other Mongol tribes, the [[Qing dynasty]], and the [[Russian empire]].&lt;/ref&gt; After a series of inconclusive military conflicts that started in the 1680s, the Dzungars were subjugated by the [[Manchu]]-led [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911) in the late 1750s.
Clarke argued that the Qing campaign in 1757–58 "amounted to the complete destruction of not only the Zunghar state but of the Zunghars as a people."{{sfn|Clarke|2004|p=37}}  After the [[Qianlong Emperor]] led Qing forces to victory over the Zunghar Oirat (Western) Mongols in 1755, he originally was going to split the Zunghar Empire into four tribes headed by four Khans, the Khoit tribe was to have the Zunghar leader [[Amursana]] as its Khan. Amursana rejected the Qing arrangement and rebelled since he wanted to be leader of a united Zunghar nation. Qianlong then issued his orders for the genocide and eradication of the entire Zunghar nation and name, Qing [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha (Eastern) Mongols]] enslaved Zunghar women and children while slaying the other Zunghars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;dq=Zunghar+genocide&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jedWU7DIBqe2sASikoG4DA&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Zunghar%20genocide&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qianlong Emperor issued direct orders for his commanders to "massacre" the Zunghars and "show no mercy", rewards were given to those who carried out the extermination and orders were given for young men to be slaughtered while women were taken as spoils.

The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Dzungaria in Xinjiang, Mongolia, and other areas as "China") in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi ethnic state. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] explicitly commemorated the Qing conquest of the Zunghars as having added new territory in Xinjiang to "China", defining China as a multi ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas in "China proper", meaning that according to the Qing, both Han and non-Han peoples were part of "China", which included Xinjiang which the Qing conquered from the Zunghars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140325231543/https://webspace.utexas.edu/hl4958/perspectives/Zhao%20-%20reinventing%20china.pdf Zhao 2006], pp. 11,12, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Qing were done conquering Dzungaria in 1759, they proclaimed that the new land which formerly belonged to the Zunghars, was now absorbed into "China" (Dulimbai Gurun) in a Manchu language memorial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEHtUunnIIvksASBzIEQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun%20land&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iT7tUsrhM4bhyQH_04HYBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA503&amp;dq=steppes+mountains+rivers+Dzungar+unified+with+china&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5UHtUuvvCcu_sQStu4HYBw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=steppes%20mountains%20rivers%20Dzungar%20unified%20with%20china&amp;f=false Elliott 2001], p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing expounded on their ideology that they were bringing together the "outer" non-Han Chinese like the Inner Mongols, Eastern Mongols, Oirat Mongols, and Tibetans together with the "inner" Han Chinese, into "one family" united in the Qing state, showing that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase "Zhong Wai Yi Jia" 中外一家 or "Nei Wai Yi Jia" 內外一家 ("interior and exterior as one family"), to convey this idea of "unification" of the different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=Dulimbai+gurun+land&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jEHtUunnIIvksASBzIEQ&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Dulimbai%20gurun%20land&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Xinjiang people were not allowed to be called foreigners (yi) under the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qianlong Emperor rejected earlier ideas that only Han could be subjects of China and only Han land could be considered as part of China, instead he redefined China as multiethnic, saying in 1755 that "There exists a view of China (zhongxia), according to which non-Han people cannot become China's subjects and their land cannot be integrated into the territory of China.

==== Consequences of the Genocide in Xinjiang's demographics ====
The Qing "final solution" of genocide to solve the problem of the [[Dzungar people]], made the Qing sponsored settlement of millions of Han Chinese, Hui, Turkestani Oasis people (Taranchi Uyghurs) and Manchu Bannermen in Dzungaria possible, since the land was now devoid of Dzungars.&lt;ref name="Zungar2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kbpG8QEguXEC&amp;pg=PT183&amp;dq=1640+zunghar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=geATVPuYMc3jsATdoYLgBQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=1640%20zunghar&amp;f=false Tamm 2013],&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dzungaria]]n basin, which used to be inhabited by (Zunghar) Mongols, is currently inhabited by Kazakhs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bEzNwgtiVQ0C&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Tyler 2004], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In northern Xinjiang, the Qing brought in Han, Hui, Uyghur, Xibe, and Kazakh colonists after they exterminated the Zunghar Oirat Mongols in the region, with one third of Xinjiang's total population consisting of Hui and Han in the northern are, while around two thirds were Uyghurs in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GXj4a3gss8wC&amp;pg=PA243#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ed. Starr 2004], p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; In Dzungaria, the Qing established new cities like Urumqi and Yining.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The Qing were the ones who unified Xinjiang and changed its demographic situation.&lt;ref name="Liu &amp; Faure 1996"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The depopulation of northern Xinjiang after the Buddhist Öölöd Mongols (Dzungars) were slaughtered, led to the Qing settling Manchu, Sibo (Xibe), Daurs, Solons, Han Chinese, Hui Muslims, and Turkic Muslim Taranchis in the north, with Han Chinese and Hui migrants making up the greatest number of settlers. Since it was the crushing of the Buddhist Öölöd (Dzungars) by the Qing which led to promotion of Islam and the empowerment of the Muslim Begs in southern Xinjiang, and migration of Muslim Taranchis to northern Xinjiang, it was proposed by Henry Schwarz that "the Qing victory was, in a certain sense, a victory for Islam".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Xinjiang as a unified, defined geographic identity was created and developed by the Qing. It was the Qing who led to Turkic Muslim power in the region increasing since the Mongol power was crushed by the Qing while Turkic Muslim culture and identity was tolerated or even promoted by the Qing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FW8SBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Liu &amp; Faure 1996], p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qing gave the name Xinjiang to Dzungaria after conquering it and wiping out the Dzungars, reshaping it from a steppe grassland into farmland cultivated by Han Chinese farmers, 1 million mu (17,000 acres) were turned from grassland to farmland from 1760-1820 by the new colonies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iXVHL2mYajAC&amp;pg=PA192#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marks 2011], p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Settlement of Dzungaria with Han and Uyghurs ===
After Qing dynasty defeated the Dzungar Oirat Mongols and exterminated them from their native land of Dzungaria in the genocide, the Qing settled Han, Hui, Manchus, Xibe, and Taranchis (Uyghurs) from the Tarim Basin, into Dzungaria. Han Chinese criminals and political exiles were exiled to Dzhungaria, such as [[Lin Zexu]]. Chinese Hui Muslims and Salar Muslims belonging to banned Sufi orders like the [[Jahriyya]] were also exiled to Dzhungaria as well. In the aftermath of the crushing of the [[1781 Jahriyya rebellion]], Jahriyya adherents were exiled.

The Qing enacted different policies for different areas of Xinjiang. Han and Hui migrants were urged by the Qing government to settled in Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang, while they were not allowed in southern Xinjiang's Tarim Basin oases with the exception of Han and Hui merchants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jRhHphtBg-QC&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Clarke 2011], p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where more Han Chinese settled like in Dzungaria, the Qing used a Chinese style administrative system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA101#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manchu Qing ordered the settlement of thousands of Han Chinese peasants in Xinijiang after 1760, the peasants originally came from Gansu and were given animals, seeds, and tools as they were being settled in the area, for the purpose of making China's rule in the region permanent and a fait accompli.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/312949?seq=17 Perdue 1996], p. 773.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taranchi was the name for Turki (Uyghur) agriculturalists who were resettled in Dzhungaria from the Tarim Basin oases ("East Turkestani cities") by the Qing dynasty, along with Manchus, Xibo (Xibe), Solons, Han and other ethnic groups in the aftermath of the destruction of the Dzhunghars.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&amp;pg=PA351#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Perdue 2009], p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Perdue 2009], p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J4L-_cjmSqoC&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=They+included+Manchu,+Chinese,+and+Mongolian+bannermen,+Cha-+hars,+surviving+Zunghars,+Torghuts+returned+from+the+Volga,+tribal+Man-+chus+such+as+the+Xibo+and+Daghurs,+and+Green+Standard+Chinese+troops+from+Gansu+and+Shaanxi.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QbpNU9WCM4OPyASNsoGgCg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=They%20included%20Manchu%2C%20Chinese%2C%20and%20Mongolian%20bannermen%2C%20Cha-%20hars%2C%20surviving%20Zunghars%2C%20Torghuts%20returned%20from%20the%20Volga%2C%20tribal%20Man-%20chus%20such%20as%20the%20Xibo%20and%20Daghurs%2C%20and%20Green%20Standard%20Chinese%20troops%20from%20Gansu%20and%20Shaanxi.&amp;f=false Perdue 2009], p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=Uyghur+anachronism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jJgRUYqFJYrn0QHql4DADQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Uyghur%20anachronism&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5p_rjMLgj_8C&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pollard 2011], p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OkAVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Xibo+Khalkas+Han+hui+Kazakh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uOFKU5DQDYzRsQTZjIGoAQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Xibo%20Khalkas%20Han%20hui%20Kazakh&amp;f=false Walcott 2013], p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C4hJAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=Taranchi+ili+transfer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KbZNU_etBvDJsQSWzICIBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Taranchi%20ili%20transfer&amp;f=false Journal of the North-China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, Volume 10 1876], p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jOA5NxDIbfYC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;dq=Taranchi+ili+transfer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KbZNU_etBvDJsQSWzICIBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Taranchi%20ili%20transfer&amp;f=false Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Professor of Chinese and Central Asian History at Georgetown University, James A. Millward wrote that foreigners often mistakenly think that [[Urumqi]] was originally a Uyghur city and that the Chinese destroyed its Uyghur character and culture, however, Urumqi was founded as a Chinese city by Han and Hui (Tungans), and it is the Uyghurs who are new to the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA133#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA134#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a few people try to give a misportrayal of the historical Qing situation in light of the contemporary situation in Xinjiang with Han migration, and claim that the Qing settlements and state farms were an anti-Uyghur plot to replace them in their land, Professor James A. Millward pointed out that the Qing agricultural colonies in reality had nothing to do with Uyghur and their land, since the Qing banned settlement of Han in the Uyghur Tarim Basin and in fact directed the Han settlers instead to settle in the non-Uyghur Dzungaria and the new city of Urumqi, so that the state farms which were settled with 155,000 Han Chinese from 1760-1830 were all in Dzungaria and Urumqi, where there was only an insignificant amount of Uyghurs, instead of the Tarim Basin oases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Han and Hui merchants were initially only allowed to trade in the Tarim Basin, while Han and Hui settlement in the Tarim Basin was banned, until the [[Muhammad Yusuf Khoja invasion]], in 1830 when the Qing rewarded the merchants for fighting off Khoja by allowing them to settle down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Qing+revise+policy+permanent+Chinese+settlement+Tarim&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tDA2U5z3NcTJsQTJooKwDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Qing%20revise%20policy%20permanent%20Chinese%20settlement%20Tarim&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Michell noted that as of 1870, there were many Chinese of all occupations living in Dzungaria and they were well settled in the area, while in Turkestan (Tarim Basin) there were only a few Chinese merchants and soldiers in several garrisons among the Muslim population.&lt;ref name="Michell 1870"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin 1847"/&gt;

The Oirat Mongol [[Kalmyk Khanate]] was founded in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, following the earlier migration of the [[Oirats]] from Zungharia through [[Central Asia]] to the steppe around the mouth of the [[Volga River]]. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire, which was then expanding to the south and east. The Russian Orthodox church pressured many [[Kalmyks]] to adopt Orthodoxy. In the winter of 1770–1771, about 300,000 Kalmyks set out to return to China. Their goal was to retake control of Zungharia from the [[Qing dynasty]] of China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tibetan-museum-society.org/java/arts-culture-Kalmyk-People.jsp The Kalmyk People: A Celebration of History and Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way many were attacked and killed by [[Kazakhs]] and [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], their historical enemies based on intertribal competition for land, and many more died of starvation and disease. After several grueling months of travel, only one-third of the original group reached [[Zungharia]] and had no choice but to surrender to the Qing upon arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?csp=17 History of Kalmykia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720192137/http://casestudies.lead.org/index.php?csp=17 |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These Kalmyks became known as Oirat [[Torghuts|Torghut]] Mongols. After being settled in Qing territory, the Torghuts were coerced by the Qing into giving up their nomadic lifestyle and to take up sedentary agriculture instead as part of a deliberate policy by the Qing to enfeeble them. They proved to be incompetent farmers and they became destitute, selling their children into slavery, engaging in prostitution, and stealing, according to the Manchu Qi-yi-shi.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6qFH-53_VnEC&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Dunnell 2004], p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Child slaves were in demand on the Central Asian slave market, and Torghut children were sold into this slave trade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MC6sAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA305#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 1998], p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taranchi revolted against the Qing dynasty during the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)|Dungan revolt]]. At first, they cooperated with the [[Dungans]], but turned on them, massacring the Dungans at [[Yining (city)|Kuldja]] and driving the rest through Talk pass to the Ili valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gitcAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA5-PA35&amp;dq=soviets+defeated+by+tungans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YuIiTPObAYSBlAe3scTHDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBjgK#v=snippet&amp;q=tungans%20taranchis%20massacred%20kuldja&amp;f=false|title=Accounts and papers of the House of Commons|author=Great Britain.

A lot of the Han Chinese and Chinese Hui Muslim population who had previously settled northern Xinjiang (Dzungaria) after the Qing genocide of the Dzungars, had died in the [[Dungan revolt (1862–77)]]. As a result, new Uyghur colonists from Southern Xinjiang (the Tarim Basin) proceeded to settle in the newly empty lands and spread across all of Xinjiang.

After Xinjiang was converted into a province by the Qing, the provincialisation and reconstruction programs initiated by the Qing resulted in the Chinese government helping Uyghurs migrate from southern Xinjiang to other areas of the province, like the area between Qitai and the capital, which was formerly nearly completely inhabited by Han Chinese, and other areas like Urumqi, Tacheng (Tabarghatai), Yili, Jinghe, Kur Kara Usu, Ruoqiang, Lop Nor, and the Tarim River's lower reaches.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during Qing times that Uyghurs were settled throughout all of Xinjiang, from their original home cities in the western Tarim Basin. The Qing policies after they created Xinjiang by uniting Zungharia and Altishahr (Tarim Basin) led Uyghurs to believe that the all of Xinjiang province was their homeland, since the annihilation of the Zunghars (Dzungars) by the Qing, populating the Ili valley with Uyghurs from the Tarim Basin, creating one political unit with a single name (Xinjiang) out of the previously separate Zungharia and the Tarim Basin, the [[Dungan revolt (1862–77)|war from 1864-1878]] which led to the killing of much of the original Han Chinese and Chinese Hui Muslims in Xinjiang, led to areas in Xinjiang with previously had insignificant amounts of Uyghurs, like the southeast, east, and north, to then become settled by Uyghurs who spread through all of Xinjiang from their original home in the southwest area. There was a major and fast growth of the Uyghur population, while the original population of Han Chinese and Hui Muslims from before the war of 155,000 dropped, to the much lower population of 33,114 Tungans (Hui) and 66,000 Han.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8FVsWq31MtMC&amp;pg=PA152#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Millward 2007], p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

A regionalist style nationalism was fostered by the Han Chinese officials who came to rule Xinjiang after its conversion into a province by the Qing, it was from this ideology that the later East Turkestani nationalists appropriated their sense of nationalism centered on Xinjiang as a clearly defined geographic territory.&lt;ref name="Liu &amp; Faure 1996"/&gt;

Mongols have at times advocated for the historical Oirat Dzungar Mongol area of Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang, to be annexed to the Mongolian state in the name of [[Pan-Mongolism]].

Legends grew among the remaining Oirats that Amursana had not died after he fled to Russia, but was alive and would return to his people to liberate them from Manchu Qing rule and restore the Oirat nation. Prophecies had been circulating about the return of Amursana and the revival of the Oirats in the Altai region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6J6T2uz1KSoC&amp;pg=PA27#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Znamenski 2011], pp. 27, 28, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qbILAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Ja+Lama+made+a+journey+to+Tibet.6+On+this+journey+he+frequently+let+people+sec+that+he+had+money,+including+gold+coins.+In+spite+of+...+Ja+Lama+appeared+in+Mongolia+and+made+anrj-Manchu+propaganda+for+the+independence+of+the+Mongols.&amp;dq=Ja+Lama+made+a+journey+to+Tibet.6+On+this+journey+he+frequently+let+people+sec+that+he+had+money,+including+gold+coins.+In+spite+of+...+Ja+Lama+appeared+in+Mongolia+and+made+anrj-Manchu+propaganda+for+the+independence+of+the+Mongols.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HK3_U5nTDo2_ggTEjIGgAg&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA Universität Bonn.

Ja Lama told the Oirat remnants in Xinjiang: "I am a mendicant monk from the Russian Tsar's kingdom, but I am born of the great Mongols. My herds are on the Volga river, my water source is the Irtysh. There are many hero warriors with me. I have many riches. Now I have come to meet with you beggars, you remnants of the Oirats, in the time when the war for power begins. Will you support the enemy? My homeland is Altai, Irtysh, Khobuk-sari, Emil, Bortala, Ili, and Alatai. This is the Oirat mother country. By descent, I am the great-grandson of Amursana, the reincarnation of Mahakala, owning the horse Maralbashi. I am he whom they call the hero Dambijantsan.

The part Buryat Momgol [[Baikal Cossacks|Transbaikalian Cossack]] Ataman [[Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov|Grigory Semyonov]] declared a "Great Mongol State" in 1918 and had designs to unify the Oirat Mongol lands, portions of Xinjiang, Transbaikal, Inner Mongolia, Outer Mongolia, Tannu Uriankhai, Khovd, Hu-lun-pei-erh and Tibet into one Mongolian state.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zMrx5Rw5n0AC&amp;pg=PA316&amp;dq=pan+mongol+oirat&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8W6TU_m2BuSF8AGFooG4CA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6wEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=pan%20mongol%20oirat&amp;f=false Paine 1996], pp. 316-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Turkic peoples of the [[Yining County|Ili region]] of Xinjiang had close cultural, political, and economic ties with Russia and then the Soviet Union. Many of them were educated in the Soviet Union and a community of Russian settlers lived in the region.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1801">The '''Ukrainians in Armenia''' are people of full or partial ethnic [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] origin who reside in [[Armenia]].

== Origins ==
The first [[Ukrainians]] in [[Armenia]] came in the mid 19th century after the migration to [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]] by “the [[Cossack]]s from [[Little Russia|Minor Russia]]” to seal the Empire’s Southern borders. The main activity of the migrants was agriculture and livestock.

{{cquote|According to the 1989 Census, living in Armenia were 8.3 thousand Ukrainians. However, with regard to the migrational processes of the last decade, today that number has perhaps been reduced by half.&lt;ref&gt;Garnik Asatryan and Victoria Arakelova, ''[http://www.hra.am/file/minorities_en.pdf The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5p1nNCzwD?url=http://www.hra.am/file/minorities_en.pdf |date=2010-04-16 }}'', [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], Yerevan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Ukrainian community organisations ==
*  Federation of Ukrainians of Armenia "Ukraine" ({{lang-uk|Федерація Українців Вірменії «УКРАЇНА»}}), which publishes a Ukrainian-Armenian language newspaper ''Dnipro-Slavutych'' ({{lang-uk|"Дніпро-Славутич"}}).
* Vocal and dance ensembles: "Dnipro", "Dzvinochok", "Verbychenka", "Malyatko"
* "Ukraina" Benevolent Fund

The '''Yarahmadzai''' ('''Shahnavazi''') is a Baloch tribe from the [[Iranian Balochistan]], the main population of the tribe is settled in an area called Sarhad in the city of [[Khash, Iran|Khash]].  The population of the Yarahmadzais are about 30,000 and they are divided into three big factions (Sohrabzai, Hossenzai and Rahmetzai).&lt;ref&gt;Black Tents of Baluchistan ({{ISBN|978-1-56098-810-6}}) by Salzman Philip Carl&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The origin of the tribe is from the hills of Sibi (located in [[East Balochistan]]) the same place where [[Mir Chakar Khan Rind]] (The great Baloch king) comes from they migrated to the Sarhad plateau somewhere during the beginning of the 18th century and since then they have expanded, increased and becoming one of the most prominent and powerful tribes of Sarhad. Before the arrival of the Yarahmadzais the area (Taftan/khash) was organized and controlled by the Kurds. The Kurds were originally sent to the Sarhad of Baluchistan by Shah Abbas the great as a part of his policy of weakening dangerous baloch tribes by removing them from their local territories.  As the Yarahmadzai tribe established themselves in Sarhad the tribe grew larger, and become more powerful and more ambitious they were a big threat to the hokomats (representatives of the rulers) established in Iranian/Baluchistan as well in south (Bampur) as north (Taftan/Khash). The Yarahmadzai unlike the other tribes (particularly in southern Baluchistan) never recognized the hakoms (governed as agents of the crown they received support and encouragement from the crown) of the hokomats  as leaders to whom they would serve. Instead they established their own political leader, the Sardar who was a representative for the tribe, several disputes occurred between the Yarahmadzais and the Kurds which resulted in one time that the Kurds where driven out from Sarhad and they lost the control of the area to the Yarahmadzais.&lt;ref&gt;Tribe and State in Iran and Afghanistan Richard Tapper, Page 270-282&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Percy Molesworth Sykes]] the Yarahmadzai became the most influential tribe under the notorious [[Sardar Jiand Khan]] of Sarhad where 50 families controlled over 1,000 families; next in importance were the Rekis who aggregate over 600 families.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Thousand Miles in Persia or Eight Years in Iran ({{ISBN|1430485973}}) by Percy Molesworth Sykes, page 107, 131, 230&lt;/ref&gt; The major economic profit of the tribe was from predatory raiding of livestock, goods and slaves outside Sarhad, mostly from Kerman and Jiroft area.

===The British Campaign in 1916===
During [[World War I]], the Yarahmadzais disturbed the lines of communication of the British frontier and raided their goods, this gave some concerns to the British forces and the fact that the Germans have through Turkish agents supplied the Sarhadi tribes with weapon and promised them that the Germans have converted to Islam in order to let the Sarhadi tribes show allegiance with them. The British knew that the Sarhad route was very important for their purpose and to keep the control over India.&lt;ref&gt;The raiders of the Sarhad: being the account of a campaign of arms and bluff against the brigands of the Persian-Baluchi border during the great war, General Reginald Dyer&lt;/ref&gt; The mission to prevent the tribes from raiding fell on General Reginald Dyer. The three major tribes who performed raids and disturbed the British line were the Yarahmadzais, Gamshadzais and Ismaelzais even known as [[Damanis]].

According to [[Reginald Dyer]] he went to Sarhad with a small troop and he managed to keep the sarhadi tribes in line with account of campaign of arms and bluffs. Dyer used a lot of spies to obtain information about the movements of the Yarahmadzai tribe and their plans, one of the spies who Dyer was very proud over was Ido Khan Reki(Rigi) who contributed very well. 
Juma Khan the tribal chief of the Ismaelzais decided to surrender when he heard about the plans of Dyer, while Sardar Jiand Khan and Halil Khan (Chief of the Gamshadzai) decided to resist against the British forces. Several battles occurred between Dyer and the Damanis (Yarahmadzai, Gamshadzai) Jiand lost his son and Gamshadzais chief (Khalil Khan) got killed during one of the battles.

In a documentary that was made about baloch tribes and sardars, the late tribal leader Sardar Khan Mohammad recounts [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PrR5m4YUfM  ] from what he has been told about what happened during one of the last battles his tribe had against the British.

He tells about when Jiand khan and his son got arrested and they (British garrison) were on their march to Quetta to bring them (the hostage) into captivity when they suddenly got ambushed by the Yarahmadzais and Gamshadzais in an area called Nalak (a narrow passage nearby Khash). They managed to free them and in the battle two of the yarahmadzais lost their life’s while the losses for Dyer was devastating. Dyer himself was not present in the battle but after what happened he never showed up in sarhad. He never mentioned the battle of Nalak in his book instead he wrote about how they have succeeded and weakened the sarhadi tribes and that an agreement was reached with the Yarahmadzais and Gamshadzai after that the two tribes sent letters to Dyer to allow them returning to their home.

The story about what happened during Dyers campaign lacks credibility in Sarhad, that was one of the reasons that [[Abdol Hossein Yadegari]] an baloch intellectual (he died in an accident 2006) decided to make a research about what really happened in Dyers Campaign.
Abdol Hossein Yadegari translated Dyers book with additional comments based on his research, his [http://www.adinehbook.com/gp/product/6005404470/ref=sr_2_1000_2/212-8246785-5342315 work] was published posthumously in [[persian language|Persian]].

Not much record exist what Sarhad was after Dyer but from what was heard and been told among the tribesmen the raiding continued, or like Coleridge Kennard describes it "Just as we are preparing for the night a jambaz rider arrives from the desert to announce that a balochi raiding army, a very powerful one a thousand men ride in it is close to his heels, marching from Khwash under Shasavar Khan (Yarahmadzai)"&lt;ref&gt;Suhail 1927 Kennard, Coleridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacification of Sarhad===
In 1921 [[Reza Khan]] who was a member of the [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] performed a coup by taking the control over Teheran and establishing his own government with dissolution of the previous. This occurred during a time were Persia became a battlefield between Soviet and Britain, Britain used Persia to perform attacks on Russia to being able to reverse the Revolution (Russian Revolution).&lt;ref&gt;[[Reza Khan]].&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of Britain Reza Khan managed to establish his power and one of his first tasks were to secure the borders by starting the pacification of Persia.
After a series of campaign against Azeris, Qashqais, Turkmens and the Lurs the last region remained to be pacified and brought under control of central government was Baluchistan.

The pacification of western Baluchistan started (1928) in the south were the army of Reza Khan's successfully defeated [[Dost Mohammad Khan Baloch|Dost Mohammad Khan’s]] of [[Bampur]], but the real battle was left for Reza Khan army to defeat the Damanis. The battle with Damanis proved to be more difficult than expected, Dyer's campaign had strengthen the tribes of Damanis in warfare they were well prepared for the army of Reza Khan. The Ismaelzais led by Juma Khan resisted from Shuro( West of Zahedan ) while the Yarahmadzai led by Jiand Khan (by then aged ninety years old) resisted from Khwash area. As reported by Nigel Colett&lt;ref&gt;The Butcher of Amritsar by Nigel Collett.&lt;/ref&gt; Jiand khan was leading the resistance until he got arrested and was replaced by his nephew (Shaswar Khan) who became the head of the tribe and continued to lead the resistance. The war lasted for 6 years from 1928-1934. [[Philip Carl Salzman]] summarizes &lt;ref&gt;The Anthropology of real life, events in Human Experience by Philip Carl Salzman.&lt;/ref&gt; the pacification of western Baluchistan "Reza Shah then turned his attention to the most remote region claimed to be part of Iran, Baluchistan. An army was sent in 1928 and succeeded, with the help of artillery and primitive bombing from early aircraft, in pacifying all of Baluchistan, except for the Sarhad. Led by the Yarahmadzai, who had earlier fought the British, the sarhadi tribes resisted successfully, until finally settling and accepting the suzerainty of the Persian crown in 1935". The Yarahmadzais were defeated but not forcibly settled. As result of the pacification the Yarahmadzai lost their tribal name and becoming the Shah Navazi(Shah strokers) while Ismaeilzais becoming Shah Baksh(Shahs Pardon).

'''Yuri Anufrievich Ivanov '''(born 1956 in [[Ust-Kamenogorsk]], [[Kazakh SSR]] - about 1989), known as the "'''Ust-Kamenogorsk Maniac'''", was a [[Soviet]] rapist and [[serial killer]]. In the span fo 13 years (with a break), he raped and killed 16 girls and women. He committed his crimes in Ust-Kamenogorsk, in the area of the "Combine of silk fabrics" factory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.meta.kz/novosti/kazakhstan/814276-gromkie-prestupleniya-sovetskogo-vremeni-ust-kamenogorskiy-manyak.html|title=Громкие преступления советского времени: Усть-каменогорский маньяк}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Ivanov worked as driver. He was married, and his own daughter was married as well. Once he returned home from work a day earlier and found out his wife with a lover. After this, he developed a hatred for certain women, vowing to kill those who cheated on their husbands. During the investigation, Ivanov said that he talked long with a lot of women, learning about their opinions towards men: if the woman spoke ill of her husband or men as a whole, he killed her. He would rape and subsequently choke his victims. After the murder, as a rule, he would take some of deceased's personal belongings.

He was eventually sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for attempted rape. In the colony Ivanov also worked as a driver, and with the opportunity to travel beyond the colony, he committed several crimes while still serving time.

From 1977 to 1987, Ivanov did not kill, as his personal life was again adjusted. But after he broke up with his partner in 1986, he returned to his criminal way of life. In 1987, he killed a 16-year-old girl. At the crime scene, an aluminum button and a hair sample were found that did not belong to the victim. An ambush was set up at the murder scene, and on the next day, when the maniac came back, he was arrested. Under the pressure of evidence (two of his cohabitants, to whom he had given items from the victims, gave the police a purse with his fingerprint, and his jacket lacked an aluminum button). Ivanov confessed to the murder of 16 women and girls with rape, and 14 rapes without murders. Ivanov perfectly remembered all the events of many years with the slightest detail, showing all the crime scenes almost without error. He said that he remembered the faces of his victims, and to prove this, the investigators devised a unique experiment - "identification of the contrary": they showed him photos of different women, so he would determine which of them he had raped or killed. Ivanov pointed at his victims without any mistake. For the murder of one of these women, committed in 1974, the victim's husband was convicted. By that time he had served most of the term - 7 out of 12 years. The verdict against him was later abolished, and the murder correctly imputed to Ivanov.

Ivanov himself asked for the [[death penalty]], and in 1989, he was sentenced to death. Before the execution he asked to arrange a meeting with his daughter, but she flatly refused to come to her father. Soon after, Ivanov was [[executed by firing squad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://old.express-k.kz/show_article.php?art_id=36998|title=Камера на всю жизнь}}&lt;/ref&gt;
