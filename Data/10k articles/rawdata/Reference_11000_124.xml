[[File:Molokhovets1.JPG|thumb|The 1917 edition of the cookbook]]
'''''A Gift to Young Housewives''''' ({{lang-rus|Пода́рок молоды́м хозя́йкам|r=Podarok molodym khozyaykam}}) is a [[Russian literature|Russian]] [[cookbook]] written and compiled by Elena Ivanovna Molokhovets (née Burman; {{lang|ru|Елена Ивановна Молоховец}}). It was the most successful book of its kind in the 19th and early 20th-century in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Russian Review]]|title=Classic Russian Cooking: Elena Molokhovets' A Gift to Young Housewives|author=Christian, David|volume=53|issue=2|date=April 1994|authorlink=David Christian (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molokhovets revised the book continually between 1861 and 1917, a period of time falling between the [[Emancipation reform of 1861|emancipation of the serfs]] and the [[Russian Revolution|Communist Revolution]]. The book was well known in Russian households during publication and for decades afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Salt: A World History|pages=174–175|author=Kurlansky, Mark|year=2002|authorlink=Mark Kurlansky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classic Russian cooking==
The original series went through more than 20 editions and sold more than 295,000 copies. The book gave instructions for elaborate dishes like [[suckling pig]], [[Madeira cake]], and [[hazel grouse]]. Other recipes included soups, [[fritter]]s, [[torte]]s, mushrooms, [[aspic]]s, [[mousse]]s, and dumplings. There were also instructions on making [[jam]], [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]], and [[vodka]]. Although the number of recipes varied by edition, there were as many as 3,218 in the 1897 edition.&lt;ref name="visson"&gt;{{cite journal|date=Summer 1995|pages=431–432|author=Visson, Lynn|journal=[[Slavic Review]]|title=Review of ''Classic Russian Cooking: Elena Molokhovets' a Gift to Young Housewives''|volume=52|issue=2|authorlink=Lynn Visson|doi=10.2307/2501632}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1904 (24th) edition contained 4163 recipes.&lt;ref&gt;Podarok molodym khozyaikam, Elena Molokhovets, St. Petersburg, 1904&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to recipes, the book covered cooking techniques, utensils and cooking equipment, stoves and ovens, household management, relations with servants, menus for [[feast day]]s, and nutrition; it also gave time- and money-saving hints.&lt;ref name="visson" /&gt;

==Public reception==
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet era]], the book, written for the middle class and aristocrats, was condemned as "[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] and decadent", mainly because of its aristocratic tone and obvious disparagement of the lower classes. The book, for instance, says that "fresh [[Rutilus|roach]] is not very tasty and barely useful; it is, therefore, best used to feed the servants."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it was mostly outdated for the 20th century, as it did not include usage of modern kitchen equipment: [[refrigerator]]s, [[electric power|electric]] and [[natural gas|gas]] [[oven]]s, etc. 

In the [[Great Patriotic War|post-war]] [[Soviet Union|USSR]], a time when people dealt with food shortages, long lines, and a scarcity of the necessary ingredients, cookbooks were mostly seen as a laughable anachronism.&lt;ref name="visson" /&gt; For example, one recipe for [[babka (cake)|babka]] called for ingredients such as 60 to 70 eggs, which few people could afford at that time. But as life got better the need for cookbooks and complex recipes rose. In [[1952 in literature|1952]], ''[[The Book of Tasty and Healthy Food]]'' was published to replace the outdated ''Gift'' as an everyday cookbook.

Recently it has been regarded as a historical record, its recipes offering a glimpse into traditional Russian cooking even if politically incorrect by modern standards.  For example, [[Andrew Whitley]] uses the book to inform his description of historical bread making processes and adapts some of its old recipes with modern techniques. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | title = Bread Matters }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joyce Toomre==
[[Joyce Toomre]] adapted and translated recipes and other content from the various editions into a 1992 book published as ''Classic Russian Cooking: Elena Molokhovets' a Gift to Young Housewives''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39406">[[File:Duchess of Cornwall, Prince of Wales - NIH-crop.jpg|thumb|[[Charles, Prince of Wales]], in 2005]]
The '''"black spider" memos''' are [[letter (message)|letter]]s and [[Memorandum|memo]]s written by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], to British government ministers and politicians over the years. As the modern British monarch remains politically neutral by tradition, the letters are controversial because of Prince of Wales' position as the eldest child of the British monarch [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[heir apparent]] to the British throne.

The letters are sent by Charles in a private capacity, but concerns have been raised that they may represent the exercise of undue influence over British government ministers. Charles has described himself as a "meddling prince".{{cn|date=November 2018}} Issues about which Charles has expressed public views include farming, genetic modification, global warming, social deprivation, planning and architecture. The content of the "black spider" letters, named after Charles' distinctive handwriting, was known only anecdotally and from memoirs and leaks, until 13 May 2015 when the [[Information Tribunal]] ordered the release of most of the correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/prince-of-wales-correspondence-with-government-departments#documents|title=Prince of Wales correspondence with government departments|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
These events were set in motion in 2010, when ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Rob Evans made an application under British [[Freedom of Information]] legislation to see the Prince's 2004 and 2005 letters to ministers. After several legal cases the application was eventually refused by the Attorney General [[Dominic Grieve]] in October 2012, and the case was the subject of an appeal in the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] which, in March 2015, ruled against the government's decision, and allowed for the later publication of the letters.

Reaction to the memos upon their release was largely supportive of Charles, with little criticism of him.&lt;ref name="post"/&gt; The memos were variously described in the press as "underwhelming"&lt;ref name= "Spector"/&gt; and "harmless"&lt;ref name=royalsigh/&gt; and that their release had "backfired on those who seek to belittle him",&lt;ref name="TelegMay15" /&gt; with reaction from the public also supportive.&lt;ref name=blair&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=Joe|title='Black spider' memos: Prince Charles successfully badgered Blair over health rules|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/black-spider-memos-prince-charles-successfully-badgered-blair-over-health-rules-1501214|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=IB Times|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Charles' letters are written by hand before being sent to be typed up.&lt;ref name=Teleg26Sep02&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1408279/Black-spider-letters-catch-Charles-in-web-of-controversy.html|title='Black spider' letters catch Charles in web of controversy|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=26 September 2002|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the letters are returned to Charles to sign, he often adds additional comments in flowing black or red ink across the page using underlining and exclamation marks. It is these additions and his distinctive spirally handwriting that have given his letters their nickname.&lt;ref name=Teleg26Sep02/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTJan11&gt;{{cite news |url=http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/11/black-spider-memos|title=Black Spider Memos|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 January 2011|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Spector"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spector|first1=Dina|title=There are 3 reasons why Britain might be completely underwhelmed by Prince Charles' black spider memos|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-may-be-disappointing-2015-5|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=Business Insider|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles has written to ministers on the understanding that his remarks are private.&lt;ref name=Teleg26Sep02/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardJul13&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/09/prince-charles-letters-mps-private-court|title=Prince Charles's letters to ministers to remain private, court rules|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=9 July 2013|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Letters to ministers have also been sent from the Prince's charities, foundations and campaign groups.&lt;ref name=GuardSep10&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/14/prince-charles-letters-ministers-adviser|title=Prince Charles letters go to top of ministers' in-trays, says ex-adviser|author=Caroline Davies|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=14 September 2010|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These letters have been described as "advocacy correspondence", written by the Prince to advance the work of his charities or in an attempt to promote his views.&lt;ref name=BBCMar14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26544124|title=Attorney general's block on Prince Charles's letters ruled unlawful|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal private secretary to the Prince of Wales, Sir [[Michael Peat]], said in 2007 that the Prince "...is always very careful to ensure he is not politically contentious or party political, and as far as I am aware even his most ardent critic has never suggested he is."&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt;

==The "dissident" prince==
In 2006, the former deputy private secretary and press adviser to the Prince of Wales, [[Mark Bolland]], said that the Prince had referred to himself as a "dissident" who worked against the prevailing political consensus.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt; Concerning Charles's views, Bolland said that he "...routinely meddled in political issues and wrote sometimes in extreme terms to ministers, MP's and others in positions of political power and influence...The prince used all the means of communication at his disposal, including meetings with ministers and others, speeches and correspondence with leaders in all walks of life and politicians. He was never party-political, but to argue that he was not political was difficult...These letters were not merely routine and non-controversial...but written at times in extreme terms...containing his views on political matters and individual politicians at home and abroad and on international issues...I remember on many occasions seeing in these day files letters which, for example, denounced the elected leaders of other countries in extreme terms, and other such highly politically sensitive correspondence."&lt;ref name=GuardFeb06&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/feb/22/royalsandthemedia.themonarchy|title=Charles the political dissident, as revealed by his former aide|author=Stephen Bates|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 February 2006|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a spokesperson for the Prince said that his role as a [[privy counsellor]] gave him the right to communicate confidentially with ministers on matters that concern him, adding that communication between the Prince and ministers should be treated as private and confidential on all sides.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt; In 2002, the Prince's office issued a statement defending his right to privately correspond with government ministers.&lt;ref name=TelegSep02&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1408282/Charles-defends-political-letters.html|title=Charles defends political letters|author=Caroline Davies|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=26 September 2002|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 statement said that the Prince "...takes an active interest in all aspects of British life and believes that as well as celebrating success, part of his role must be to highlight problems and represent views in danger of not being heard...this role can only be fulfilled properly if complete confidentiality is maintained...It is proper and right that he should take an interest in British life. It is not about exerting undue pressure or campaigning privately."&lt;ref name=TelegSep02/&gt;

In 2008, the Prince's friend and biographer, [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], said that royal aides had informally started to consider redefining the role of the monarch to allow a future King Charles "...to speak out on matters of national and international importance in ways that at the moment would be unthinkable".&lt;ref name=GuardJun10&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/25/chelsea-barracks-trial-prince-charles|title=Chelsea barracks trial shines light on Prince Charles's interference|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 June 2010|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 'Cumbrian farmer letter' and letters to Blair and Irvine==
A letter from Charles to the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was leaked on the day of the [[Countryside Alliance]]'s 'Liberty and Livelihood' protest march in September 2002.&lt;ref name=Teleg22Sep02&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1407953/Prince-Charles-tells-Blair-Farmers-are-being-treated-worse-than-blacks-or-gays.html|title=Prince Charles tells Blair: 'Farmers are being treated worse than blacks or gays'|author=Josie Clarke|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=22 September 2002|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the letter, Charles associated himself with the views of a farmer from [[Cumbria]], who, complaining of the British government's treatment of rural workers said that "If we, as a group, were black or gay we would not be victimised or picked on."&lt;ref name=Teleg22Sep02/&gt; Charles also wrote that if rural people were "any other minority" the government would make greater efforts to protect them. The government was also blamed for "destroying the countryside".&lt;ref name=Teleg22Sep02/&gt; Charles was believed to have written the letter in April 2002, and advisers were said to have attempted to persuade him not to send it, and suggested that Charles raise the issue with Blair when next they met.&lt;ref name=Teleg26Sep02/&gt; It was not known who "[[News leak|leaked]]" the letter, with speculation falling on a variety of sources including [[10 Downing Street]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], sources close to the Charles's household, or the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Member of Parliament [[Nicholas Soames]].&lt;ref name=Teleg26Sep02/&gt; The allegation was denied by 10 Downing Street and Soames.&lt;ref name=Teleg26Sep02/&gt;

==2004-05 letters: FOI campaign by ''The Guardian''==
In 2010, Rob Evans, a journalist for ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper, applied under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] to see copies of correspondence between Charles and ministers in seven government departments. The government refused to grant the request.&lt;ref name=GuardJun10/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardOct12&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/oct/16/attorney-general-blocks-prince-charles-letters|title=Attorney general blocks disclosure of Prince Charles letters to ministers|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 October 2012|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministerial recipients of the letters and the dates which they were received were also deemed to be secret by the government.&lt;ref name=GuardMar14/&gt; The 27 letters concerned were written between September 2004 and April 2005.&lt;ref name=GuardMar14/&gt; ''The Guardian'''s challenge was the first of its kind to attempt to obtain royal correspondence.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

Evans wished to see letters between the Charles and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Department of Health, the Department for Children, the Department for Education, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Northern Ireland Office and the Cabinet Office.&lt;ref name=GuardMar14/&gt;

=== 2009: Further letters revealed, Prime Ministerial block on disclosure ===
In addition to the letters sent in 2004 and 2005 sought by ''The Guardian'', the same paper had revealed in 2009 that Charles had written directly to eight government ministers since 2006.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/dec/16/prince-charles-letters-to-ministers|title=Prince Charles faces fresh meddling claim over letters to ministers|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=16 December 2009|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]], the [[Department for International Development]], [[HM Treasury]], the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], the [[Department for Work and Pensions]], the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]], the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]], and the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] all received personal letters from Charles between 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt; The government refused to release the content of the letters sent between 2006 and 2009.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt;

In addition to Charles's letters, his advisers had also written to five government departments&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt; and to members of the cabinet seeking to bring the government's policy into line with Charles's beliefs on matters such as the building of hospitals and [[Eco-towns|ecotown]] design. Aides from the Charles's architectural charity had written to the then [[Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government]], [[Hazel Blears]], urging the government to adopt his positions on ecological design and planning.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt; The [[Secretary of State for Health]], [[Patricia Hewitt]], also received letters from Charles's aides, who recommended the adoption by hospital trusts of design techniques devised by his architectural charity.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt; The [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], [[Andy Burnham]], also received letters concerning the sustainable increase of the housing supply in a way "which provides support for the [prince's] Foundation's mission to promote timeless and ecological ways of planning, designing and building".&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt;

In December 2009, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] ordered a block on the disclosure of correspondence sent to ministers by members of the royal family at the same time as the information commissioner, Christopher Graham, blocked the release of an earlier set of correspondence which involved Prime Minister Blair.&lt;ref name=GuardDec09/&gt;

===2010: Initial FOI appeal===
At the FOI appeal tribunal in September 2010, Paul Richards, a former special adviser to the former communities secretary [[Hazel Blears]] and health secretary [[Patricia Hewitt]], said that it was clear to him that Charles regularly corresponded with ministers and these letters went "to the top of the pile" and are "treated with great reverence."&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt; This is in contrast to letters from ordinary citizens, which "...go through a centralised mailroom and which are normally dealt with by departmental staff and rarely seen by ministers or their advisers."&lt;ref name=Teleg18Sep12/&gt; Richards had been a special adviser from 2005–09 and said that Charles wrote on issues including planning applications and government health policy.&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt; Richards believed that lobbying from Charles had contributed to a £1.1m grant awarded to his [[Foundation for Integrated Health]].&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt; Richards believed that the grant arose after "behind-the-scenes lobbying" from Charles, and occurred at the same time as a reception hosted by the prince at his London residence, [[Clarence House]], attended by at least one health minister and an adviser to Prime Minister Blair.&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt;

Richards said that Charles had complained to education secretary [[Ed Balls]] about changes to the primary school syllabus and had lobbied [[Yvette Cooper]] over the design of [[Eco-towns|ecotown]]s.&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt;
[[File:Holmead Walk - Poundbury - geograph.org.uk - 1023297.jpg|thumb|240px|Housing in the village of [[Poundbury]], Dorset.]]
Charles had written to Blears after she had suggested that [[Poundbury]], in Dorset, a village built according to the prince's architectural precepts, was "little more than a royal ego trip".&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt; The letter from Charles subsequently invited Blears to Poundbury, with Richards describing the letter as "...treated with great reverence and went straight to the top of the pile in the red box containing the minister's business for the day, over and above letters from other ministers and even cabinet papers."&lt;ref name=GuardSep10/&gt;

The appeal also heard evidence from Rodney Brazier, a professor of [[constitutional law]] at [[Manchester University]], who said that Charles corresponds with ministers "to a much greater extent than his predecessors".&lt;ref name=GuardSep1610&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/16/prince-charles-foi-tribunal-adjourned|title=Prince Charles's letters to ministers stay secret as appeal is adjourned|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|author=Owen Bowcott|date=16 September 2010|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brazier said that the quantity of Charles's letter writing amounted to a "constitutional innovation" but that he considered the process to be part of "the apprenticeship convention" served by the heir to the throne, in which Charles educates himself in the nature of state affairs.&lt;ref name=GuardSep1610/&gt;

The hearing was subsequently adjourned until 2011 for reasons that the panel "could not go into".&lt;ref name=GuardSep1610/&gt;

===2010: FOI amendment===
The Freedom of Information Act was amended in 2010 to provide more protection over the communications with senior members of the British royal family, communications with the monarch, the heir to the throne and second in line to the throne would all be subject to an absolute exemption for twenty years or five years after the death of the individual, whichever occurs later.&lt;ref name=GuardSep102&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/13/charles-letters-freedom-information-act|title=Royal pressure 'led to FoI ban on disclosure of lobbying by Charles'|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 September 2010|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teleg18Sep12/&gt; The changes were described as the "Prince Charles amendment" by [[Tony Wright (Great Yarmouth MP)|Tony Wright]] MP.&lt;ref name=GuardSep102/&gt;

===2012: Successful Upper Tribunal appeal, Attorney General's veto===
In September 2012 the [[Upper Tribunal#Administrative Appeals Chamber|Administrative Appeals Chamber]] of the [[Upper Tribunal]], in a unanimous decision, ruled that the letters should be published, overturning the previous ruling of information commissioner from 2010.&lt;ref name=BBCSep12&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19638253|title=Prince Charles letters to government must be published|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=18 September 2012|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals chamber found that the commissioner had given "insufficient weight to the public interest", when he chose to deny the disclosure of the letters, and found that it was in the public interest "for there to be transparency as to how and when Prince Charles seeks to influence government".&lt;ref name=BBCSep12/&gt; The tribunal also found evidence of "Prince Charles using his access to government ministers, and no doubt considering himself entitled to use that access, in order to set up and drive forward charities and promote views, but not as part of his preparation for kingship...Ministers responded, and no doubt felt themselves obliged to respond, but again not as part of Prince Charles's preparation for kingship."&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt; The tribunal also ruled that "it was fundamental" that Charles's lobbying "cannot have constitutional status" and must not be protected from disclosure.&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt; In evidence given to the tribunal, Stephen Lamport, who was the private secretary to the Prince of Wales from 1993 to 2002 said that Charles will stop writing to ministers were he to be crowned King, and that his letters formed part of his "apprenticeship convention", in which the "cardinal principle" of not commenting on public policy did not apply to him while heir.&lt;ref name=Teleg18Sep12/&gt; Lamport believed that if what the Prince "...says or writes to ministers were not to be confidential their exchanges would be 'bland and denuded' of any useful content" and that Charles viewed the "urging of opinions" to government ministers to be part of his role as heir.&lt;ref name=Teleg18Sep12/&gt;
[[File:Dominic Grieve.jpg|thumb|[[Dominic Grieve]], [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], 2010–14]]
The Upper Tribunal's decision was subsequently vetoed in October 2012 by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales]], [[Dominic Grieve]], who was supported in his decision by the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt; The attorney general's veto placed an absolute block on the publication of the letters, which Grieve described as containing the "particularly frank" and "most deeply held personal views and beliefs" of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt; Grieve detailed the letters as containing "...remarks about public affairs which would in my view, if revealed, have had a material effect upon the willingness of the government to engage in correspondence with the Prince of Wales, and would potentially have undermined his position of political neutrality....my decision is based on my view that the correspondence was undertaken as part of the Prince of Wales's preparation for becoming king. The Prince of Wales engaged in this correspondence with ministers with the expectation that it would be confidential. Disclosure of the correspondence could damage the Prince of Wales's ability to perform his duties when he becomes king."&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt; Grieve concluded his justification of his veto by stating that "It is a matter of the highest importance within our constitutional framework that the monarch is a politically neutral figure able to engage in confidence with the government of the day, whatever its political colour."&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt; Grieve also said that any perception that Charles had disagreed with Blair's government "would be seriously damaging to his role as future monarch because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king".&lt;ref name=GuardMar14/&gt; ''The Guardian'' announced their intention to challenge the attorney general's veto in the [[High Court of Justice]].&lt;ref name=GuardOct12/&gt;

===2013: ''The Guardian'''s legal challenge dismissed===
''The Guardian'''s challenge to the attorney general's veto in the High Court was dismissed by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], [[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]], accompanied by Lord Justice Davis and Justice Globe in July 2013. Lord Judge found the attorney general had acted in the public interest in a "proper and rational way".&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

The ability of government ministers to issue a veto under the FoI act and override a decision that had been reached by judges raised "troublesome concerns" for Lord Judge.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; The veto means that potentially a ruling by the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] could be overridden.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

This legal situation was described by Lord Judge as a "'constitutional aberration". Lord Judge wrote that barristers could find no equivalent in any other British law, and that it was "an understatement to describe the situation as unusual".&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; Lord Judge added that the necessary safeguards for the constitutionality of the process were guaranteed by the ability to challenge the ministerial override in court.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt; ''The Guardian'' announced their decision to appeal against the High Court's decision.&lt;ref name=GuardJul13/&gt;

===2014: Appeal court rules attorney general's decision unlawful===
In March 2014 the three judges of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales#Civil Division|Civil Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], under the [[Master of the Rolls]], [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]], heard ''The Guardian'''s appeal against the High Court decision, and ruled that the attorney general's 2012 decision to block the publication of the letters was unlawful. The court ruled that the attorney general's veto on the letters publication should be quashed as Grieve had "no good reason" for overriding the Upper Tribunal's decision and that Grieve had acted in a way incompatible with European law.&lt;ref name=BBCMar14/&gt;

Lord Dyson said that Grieve had "no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision of the Upper Tribunal reached after six days of hearing and argument" adding that Grieve "could point to no error of law or fact in the [tribunal's] decision and the government departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it."&lt;ref name=BBCMar14/&gt; In addition, Lord Dyson ruled that Grieve's veto was unlawful under European commission law. Grieve was also ordered at the appeal to pay ''The Guardian'''s legal costs of £96,000. The government also delayed disclosure of amount of money spent on legal proceedings in their attempts to resist publication of the letters.&lt;ref name=GuardMar14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/12/attorney-general-unlawful-prince-charles-letters|title=Prince Charles letters: attorney general acted unlawfully, say senior judges|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 March 2014|accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grieve announced his decision to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, with his spokesperson saying that he was appealing to "protect the important principles which are at stake in this case... [his] argument is that it is better to pretend Charles is impartial than to prove he is not." Following the judgement, the editor of ''The Guardian'', [[Alan Rusbridger]], said that Charles was a "powerful person" who should be "above politics". Rusbridger said that "...if the Prince of Wales is going to try and influence public policy in a particularly frank way then I don't think he is acting as a private citizen and therefore like any other lobby group there ought to be transparency about what he's trying to do."&lt;ref name=BBCMar14/&gt;

===2014: Supreme Court hearing===
The Supreme Court heard the case on the black spider memos on 24 and 25 November 2014, before [[David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury|Lord Neuberger]] and six other senior judges.&lt;ref name=GuardNov14&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/21/legal-battle-prince-charles-letters-supreme-court-government-ministers|title=Legal battle over Prince Charles' letters reaches supreme court|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=21 November 2014|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the first day of the hearing, James Eadie QC, acting for the government, said that it had been acceptable for the attorney general to veto the Upper Tribunal's (UT) decision, stating that "It is clear that parliament decided...that the highest level of government should be permitted to have the final say as to whether information, the disclosure of which it considered to be damaging to the public interest, should be disclosed." Eadie said that parliament had given the attorney general the  power to override rulings by the UT "to protect the public interest where real and significant issues arise".&lt;ref name=GuardNov2414&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/24/prince-charles-letters-minister-veto-publication-lawful-supreme-court|title=Prince Charles letters: minister's veto of publication was lawful, court told|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 November 2014|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day of the hearing, Dinah Rose QC, acting for ''The Guardian'' said that in contrast to the UT, Grieve was "...neither independent nor impartial but is a member of the government which is seeking to prevent disclosure of the documents. He has not conducted any hearing, or heard representations by [the Guardian]." Additionally Grieve had not identified any error by the UT and had simply disagreed with its conclusions for "...reasons which had already been advanced by the government departments, considered and rejected by the tribunal." Rose said that Grieve's use of the veto "significantly undermines the rule of law and the principle of the separation of powers".&lt;ref name=GuardNov2514&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/25/attorney-general-prince-charles-letters-court|title=Attorney general's rejection of ruling on Charles letters was unlawful, court told|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015: Supreme Court verdict and publication===
The Supreme Court dismissed the Attorney General's appeal on 26 March and by a majority of 5 to 2 'considered that the Attorney General was not entitled to issue a certificate under section 53 of FOIA'. Clarence House expressed disappointment.&lt;ref name=Guardian20150326&gt;{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Rob|title=Supreme court clears way for release of secret Prince Charles letters|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/26/supreme-court-clears-way-release-secret-prince-charles-letters-black-spider-memos|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=The Guardian|date=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were subsequently published by the [[Cabinet Office]] on 13 May 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.uk/government/collections/prince-of-wales-correspondence-with-government-departments|title=Cabinet Office: Prince of Wales correspondence with government departments|work=www.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The reception of the memos met with little criticism, and public support for the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name="post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles, the toothfish and the toothless 'black spider' letters|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/14/prince-charles-and-the-disappointing-black-spider-letters/|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Glover (columnist)|Stephen Glover]] writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' felt that the letters were "generally about as controversial as back copies of ''The Beano''. There is nothing in them of which the Prince of Wales need feel ashamed, though a handful of republicans will inevitably try to make hay. The man that emerges is one already familiar to us — someone who cares deeply about a wide range of subjects, many of which might slip below the radar of ministers, and is impressively knowledgeable about all of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glover|first1=Stephen|title=STEPHEN GLOVER: To my shock, these rather eccentric letters make me admire the meddling Prince more|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-3080861/STEPHEN-GLOVER-shock-eccentric-letters-make-admire-meddling-Prince-more.html|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=''[[The Daily Mail]]''|date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dina Spector of ''[[Business Insider]]'' called the publication of the memos "underwhelming" and gave three reasons why Britain would feel the same way. According to her, firstly, Charles and his staff were reportedly "sanguine" about the decision to publish the letters and there were claims by those who had read the letters that they were mostly harmless. Additionally, even if they did contain some damaging material, the letters would be published with some redactions to avoid naming third parties. Furthermore, fewer than 10 of the 27 published letters were personally authored by Charles and all of them are typed out rather than handwritten in the "black spider" handwriting.&lt;ref name= "Spector"/&gt;

Historian [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] wrote in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that the publication of the Charles' letters "backfired on those who seek to belittle him, and revealed the idiocy of the human rights industry". Roberts further felt the memos exposed the Charles' "passion and dignity".&lt;ref name=TelegMay15&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Andrew|title=All the 'black spider memos' expose is the passion and dignity of Prince Charles|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/11604099/All-the-black-spider-memos-expose-is-the-passion-and-dignity-of-Prince-Charles.html|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Simon Jenkins]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote, "The black spiders are harmless creatures compared with the multimillion-pound tarantulas of big-time political pressure, uncharted and undisclosed."&lt;ref name=royalsigh&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Simon|title=The black spider memos: a royal sigh of woe at a world gone to the dogs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/13/black-spider-memos-prince-charles|accessdate=23 May 2015|publisher=Guardian|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''The Guardian'' stated that "The letters show that behind that curtain, most of the time, Prince Charles behaves more as a bit of a bore on behalf of his good causes than as any sort of wannabe feudal tyrant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/13/guardian-view-prince-charles-black-spider-letters|title=The Guardian view on the Charles letters: self-indulgence on an industrial scale|publisher=Guardian|date=13 May 2015 |accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarence House]] issued a statement defending Charles, saying that he cared deeply about the country and had tried to use his unique position to help others. Furthermore, it stated that he had raised issues of public concern, and tried to find practical ways to address them. It also defended Charles' right to communicate privately stating that the publication of his letters "inhibits his ability to express the concerns and suggestions" put forward to him by people at meetings and engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2015051325190/clarence-house-responds-prince-charles-letters/ |title=Clarence House responds to publication of Prince Charles' private letters |publisher=[[Hello (magazine)|Hello]] |date=13 May 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4890">The '''CEDICT''' project was started by Paul Denisowski in 1997 and is maintained by a team on mdbg.net (a website registered for the purpose by [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] Dennis Vierkant) under the name CC-CEDICT, with the aim to provide a complete [[Chinese language|Chinese]] to [[English language|English]] dictionary with pronunciation in [[pinyin]] for the Chinese characters.

== Content ==

CEDICT is a [[text file]]; other programs (or simply [[Microsoft Notepad|Notepad]] or [[egrep]] or equivalent) are needed to search and display it. This project is considered a standard Chinese-English reference on the Internet and is used by several other Chinese-English projects.  The [[Han unification|Unihan Database]] uses CEDICT data for most of its information about character compounds, but this is auxiliary and is explicitly not a part of the main Unicode database [http://unicode.org/charts/unihan.html].

Features:
* [[Traditional Chinese]] and [[Simplified Chinese]]
* Pinyin (several pronunciations)
* American English (several)
* {{As of|2016|2|14}}, it had 114,087 entries [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cc-cedict] in [[UTF-8]].

The basic format of a CEDICT entry is:
 Traditional Simplified [pin1 yin1] /American English equivalent 1/equivalent 2/
 漢字 汉字 [han4 zi4] /Chinese character/CL:個|个/

Example of a simple egrep search:
 $ egrep -i 有勇無謀 cedict.txt
 有勇無謀 有勇无谋 [you3 yong3 wu2 mou2] /bold but not very astute/

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6298">__NOTOC__
The '''Center for Human Dignity''' is the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]]-planned [[Museum of Tolerance]] over [[Mamilla Cemetery]] at the center of West [[Jerusalem]] between [[Zion Square]] and the neighbourhood of [[Mamilla]].

The project was re-designed on a more modest scale than originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mynetjerusalem.co.il/article/206172 Projected we missed: The Museum of Tolerance]&lt;/ref&gt; and construction is still continuing in 2017 and the museum is expected to open in 2018.

==Design==
The first design for the Center was originally designed by [[Frank Gehry]],&lt;ref name="Frank Gehry steps down from Museum of Tolerance project"&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/frank-gehry-steps-down-from-museum-of-tolerance-project-1.261496 "Frank Gehry steps down from Museum of Tolerance project", ''[[Haaretz]]'', Jan. 15, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; was to include a museum, a theater, a conference hall, a library, and an educational center. The design of the Center had been seen as unique for [[Israel]] and, as such, has been met with many opponents and proponents.

The center was subsequently designed, on a more modest scale, by the Yigal Levy architects' office in Jerusalem in cooperation with the Aedas British-Singapore architectural firm
&lt;gallery widths="300px" heights="300px"&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Building==
Those who are in favor of the Center, including former [[List of mayors of Jerusalem|Jerusalem mayor]] [[Uri Lupolianski]], maintain that it will bring tourists to the city, while its opponents (excluding the Muslim gravesite objection) argue that it will stand out and draw attention away from the traditional architecture of neighboring streets and that of the city in general. Former deputy mayor of Jerusalem [[Meron Benvenisti]] has said that the museum's "geometric forms that can't be any more dissonant to the environment in which it is planned to put this alien object."&lt;ref&gt;Meron Benvenisti, “A Museum of Tolerance in a City of Fanatics,” Haaretz Dec 5, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location controversy === 
The museum's continued building on the ground of a Muslim cemetery has faced criticism from both Israeli and American Jews.  Gershon Baskin at the Israel Palestine Research center has been critical of the museum as a moral failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcri.org/files/cityoftolerance.html "Gerson Baskin, Encountering Peace: A city of tolerance, not a Museum of Tolerance, Jerusalem Post, Nov. 4, 2008"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113124606/http://www.ipcri.org/files/cityoftolerance.html |date=November 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Mamilla Cemetery]] contained the graves of many important Islamic saints and scholars, as well as several Mamluk tombs.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem Quarterly"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/ViewArticle.aspx?id=297 |title=The Mamilla Cemetery: A Buried History |author=Asem Khalidi |volume=37 |date=Spring 2009 |journal=[[Jerusalem Quarterly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWC asserts that the cemetery was long ago deconsecrated by Islamic leaders, and that secular Arab leaders prior to the creation of the State of Israel had planned various development projects there.&lt;ref name="Jerusalem deconstructed"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/jerusalem-post/mi_8048/is_20080222/jerusalem-deconstructed/ai_n47382495/pg_7/?tag=content;col1 |title=Jerusalem deconstructed |author=Gil Zohar and Gail Lichtman |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=February 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has in turn been challenged in the Israeli legal system, but the argument was rejected by Israel's [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]].

After controversy concerning its location on an ancient [[Islam|Muslim]] burial site came to head, its construction was frozen by a [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]] order issued in February 2006.&lt;ref name="Walla!"&gt;[http://news.walla.co.il/?w=//863929 "Supreme Court freezes construction of Tolerance Museum"], ''[[Walla!]]'', February 23, 2006 {{he icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, the Israeli Supreme Court decided to allow construction to proceed, noting that this corner of the cemetery had been transformed into a parking lot&lt;ref name="nytd"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershner|first1=Isabel|title=Museum Creates New Jerusalem Divide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/11/world/middleeast/11jerusalem.html|accessdate=18 June 2017|work=New York Times|date=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; "as long ago as the 1960s" and that Jerusalem has been inhabited for roughly 4,000 years, and many ancient sites have been built over.&lt;ref name="SWC Press Release"&gt;[http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441467&amp;ct=6355245 "SWC Press Release"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Construction had been stayed several times by the courts before allowing it to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hadassah.org/news/content/per_hadassah/archive/2004/04_DEC/art.asp Hadassah on Museum of tolerance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916054903/http://www.hadassah.org/news/content/per_hadassah/archive/2004/04_DEC/art.asp |date=2009-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/825662.html Zandberg on lack of transparency]&lt;/ref&gt; In autumn, 2008, the Israeli Supreme Court cleared "the way for L.A.'s Simon Wiesenthal Center to build a Holy Land counterpart to its Museum of Tolerance on Pico Boulevard."&lt;ref&gt;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2008/10/a-frank-gehry-d.html "Israeli court OKs Museum of Tolerance's controversial branch"], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muslim groups who initiated the legal action which resulted in the Supreme Court order to freeze all construction had been undergoing [[mediation]] with representatives of the Center. Former Supreme Court president [[Meir Shamgar]] serves as mediator.&lt;ref name="Walla!"/&gt; As of 2017, the museum is under construction.

The '''Colombian Declaration of Independence''' refers to the events of [[July 20]], [[1810]], in [[Bogotá|Santa Fe de Bogota]], in the Spanish colonial [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. They resulted in the establishment of a [[Junta (Spanish American Independence)|Junta de Santa Fe]] that day.  The experience in self-government eventually led to the creation of the [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Gran Colombia]].

== Political background ==
{{See also|Peninsular war}}
Spain was ruled by a typical [[enlightened absolutism|enlightened absolutist monarch]], promoting culture and Christianity, and allowing some expression of the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], in the country and its colonies, while at the same time maintaining strong political control. {{clarify|date=July 2015}} However, the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies in the Americas]] were forbidden to trade with other countries and their colonies, such as [[Great Britain]] and [[British North America]], and the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and [[New France]]. Spain was their only source of goods and merchandise, although it was unable to fulfill the trade demands of its colonies. Furthermore, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]'s support for the [[American Revolutionary War|independence of the United States]] generated new taxes, causing unrest in Spain's colonies in the Americas, such as the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)]] and the [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]]. Another major tension was the policy of excluding [[Criollo people|Criollos]], or locally born whites, from public administration.

[[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] (reigned 1788–1808) was not very interested in exercising political power, leaving such duties to his ministers, especially the disliked [[Manuel Godoy]]. Charles IV was more interested in pursuing the arts and science and gave little importance to the American colonies.

The development that precipitated the events of July 20, 1810, was the crisis of the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]] caused by the 1808 [[Abdications of Bayonne|abdications]] of Charles IV and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] forced by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in favor of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]]. The ascension of King Joseph initially had been cheered by Spanish ''[[afrancesado]]s'' (literally, "Frenchified"), usually elites and important statesmen who believed that [[collaborationism|collaboration]] with France would bring modernization and liberty to Spain. An example of Joseph's policies was the abolition of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. However, the general population rejected the new king and opposition, led by the priesthood and patriots, became widespread after the French army's first examples of repression (such as the executions of May 3, 1808, in Madrid) became widely known.
[[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpg|thumb|right|Francisco Goya: ''[[The Third of May 1808]]'']] 
Eventually an emergency government in the form of a [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Supreme Central Junta]] was formed in Spain. Most of the authorities in the Americas swore allegiance to the new Supreme Central Junta.
a
===Memorandum of Offences===
[[File:Camilo Torres.JPG|thumb|right|Camilo Torres]]
{{See also|Constitutional history of Colombia#Memorandum of Offences (Memorial de Agravios): 1809}}
The Supreme Central Junta ordered the election of one representative from each of the main cities of the Spanish American viceroyalties by their ''[[cabildo (council)|cabildo]]s'' (municipal governments). These included primary cities in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], [[Viceroyalty of Perú]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], and [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]], and the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]], [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico]], [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], [[Captaincy General of Chile]], [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]], and the [[Spanish East Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;Royal Order of the Central Junta of January 22, 1809, defined the overseas kingdoms as "the viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]], [[Viceroyalty of Perú|Perú]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]], and the independent captaincies general of the island of [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], [[Captaincy General of Chile]], [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]], and the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]]." The [[Royal Audiencia of Quito]] and [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]] ([[Upper Peru]]) were considered by this decree to be parts of the Viceroyalties of New Granada and Peru, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the ''cabildos'' were to draft instructions for the representative to present to the Supreme Central Junta.

The Memorandum of Offences (''Memorial de Grievances'') was drafted by [[Camilo Torres Tenorio]] in his capacity as legal advisor to the Santa Fe de Bogotá ''cabildo''. In it he criticized the Spanish Monarchy's policy of excluding Criollos from high posts in the Americas and alleging their rights to govern in their homelands as "the offspring of the [[conquistador]]es". Furthermore, he proposed equality between Spanish Americans and Spaniards as the basis for maintaining the unity of the Spanish Monarchy:
::"''[There are no] other means to consolidate the union between America and Spain [but] the just and competent representation of its people, without any difference among its subjects that they do not have because of their laws, their customs, their origins, and their rights. Equality! The sacred right of equality. Justice is founded upon that principle and upon granting everyone that which is his. […] [T]he true fraternal union between European Spaniards and Americans… can never exist except upon the basis of justice and equality. America and Spain are two integral and constituent parts of the Spanish Monarchy… Anyone who believes otherwise does not love his [[Homeland|patria]]… Therefore, to exclude the Americans from such representation, in addition to being the greatest injustice, would arouse distrust and jealousy, and would forever alienate their desires for such a union…''" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Rodríguez O | first =Jaime E. | title =the Independence of Spanish America | publisher = Cambridge University | year =1998 | location = New York | pages = 70–71 | isbn =0-521-62673-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And finally, Torres defended the right of the Viceroyalty of New Granada to establish a junta given the political circumstances. Although the draft expressed many of common sentiments of Criollos at the time and probably was discussed by prominent members of the capital's society, it was never adopted by the ''cabildo''. It would be published for the first time only in 1832.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title =Proceso histórico del 20 de Julio de 1810 - Documentos| publisher =Banco de la República | series= Publicaciones conmemorativas del Sesquicentenario de la Independencia Nacional| year = 1960| location = Bogotá| url = http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/historia/julio20/sec2b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Bushnell | first =David | authorlink =David Bushnell (historian) | title = The Making of Modern Colombia: A Nation in Spite of Itself | publisher =University of California | year = 1993 | location = Berkeley | page = 35 | isbn = 0-520-08289-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The first juntas===
As the military situation in Spain deteriorated, many Spanish Americans desired to establish their own juntas, despite their formal declarations of loyalty to the Supreme Central Junta. A movement to set up a junta in neighboring [[First Republic of Venezuela#Antecedents|Caracas in 1808]] was stopped by the Captain-General with arrests of the conspirators. In the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]] (present day Bolivia) juntas were established in [[Chuquisaca Revolution|Charcas (May 25)]] and [[La Paz revolution|La Paz (July 1809)]].

More importantly to events in New Granada, in the neighboring [[Royal Audiencia of Quito]]—a territory under the auspices of the [[Viceroy of New Granada]]— a group of Criollos led by Juan Pío Montúfar, the second Marquis of Selva Alegre, established the autonomous [[Luz de América|junta Luz de América]] on August 10, swearing loyalty to Ferdinand VII, but rejecting the viceregal authorities. Viceroy [[Antonio José Amar y Borbón]] considered this a rebellious act, and fearing for similar developments in New Granada, ordered military action to put down the junta in conjunction with the [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroy of Peru]].

===Dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta===
{{main|Foolish Fatherland|}}
In mid-1810 news arrived that the Supreme Central Junta had dissolved itself in favor of a [[regency (government)|regency]]. In response to the new political crisis, Spaniards and Criollos in the Americas established juntas that continued to swear allegiance to King Ferdinand VII.

The next incident happened in [[Caracas]], on April 19, 1810.  The ''mantuanos'', (the rich, criollo elite of colonial Venezuela) together with military and eclessiatic authorities, declared autonomy, again swearing loyalty to Ferdinand VII, but rejecting the viceroyalty.  The [[Cadiz]] Board of government decided to order the destitution of Amar y Borbon, sending a notification with the royal visitor [[Antonio Villavicencio]], who arrived in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] on May 8.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lynch (historian)|Lynch, John]] (2006). ''Simón Bolívar. A Life'', New Haven: [[Yale University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-300-11062-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22 in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena de Indias]], the Cartagena Board of government was created with similar terms to the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the anniversary of July 20, 1810, it is important to bring up relevant opinions and judgment of its historical character which, after all is said and done, are being dogmatically consecrated by "law" or "decree." In an unpublished letter to the Mayor of [[Coromoro]], dated in [[San Gil]] on January 13, 1841, General [[Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera]]  answered an invitation to celebrate the 20th of July by stating: “Mr. Municipal Chief: To answer your kind letter, I must tell you, that I have never recognized as a magistrate, as a public or private man the national anniversary or revolutionary event which took place in Bogotá on July 20, 1810. If the first pronouncement made in the ancient New Kingdom of Granada has to be celebrated as a memorable anniversary, it corresponds to the one which occurred in Quito in 1809. But if we limit ourselves to what is the territory of Colombia today, the deposition of the Governor of [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], Brigadier Montes, and the establishment of a provisional government in that city on May 22, 1810, which had great political influence in the entire viceroyalty—and was followed by Pamplona on July 4, 1921 and by Socorro on July 10, 1930—should be celebrated. The Legislature of the State of Cartagena was the first one with the character of public representation and officially proclaimed the independence from Spain on November 11, 1811. Mr. Municipal Chief, the public men who still live and are among the founders of the Republic must rectify the facts which we have witnessed so that history cannot be adulterated. Thus, I will conclude manifesting that I will not contribute to celebrate a holiday which does not commemorate the main event of our political generation or our independence. T. C. de Mosquera."{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after, same scenarios surged in [[Santiago de Cali]], [[Socorro, Santander|Socorro]] and [[Pamplona, Colombia|Pamplona]].  Finally, Bogota, the central [[cathedra]] of the Viceroyalty rebelled on July 20.  Initially, the government board declared to Amar y Borbón as president, but shortly after, on July 25, he was deposed and arrested. The spark for this was the flower vase incident at local businessman José González Llorente's Bogota residence on the morning of the 20th.

===Flower vase incident ===
On the morning of July 20, 1810, Joaquin Camacho went to the residence of the Viceroy [[Antonio José Amar y Borbón]], requesting response on an application for the establishment of a governing board in Bogota, the viceregal capital, in similar lines to those already established in other cities. The refusal of the Viceroy to grant the request, coupled with his arrogance, made to proceed to join the fray with the excuse of the loan of a vase. {{clarify|date=July 2015}}

Luis Rubio then went to visit the businessman José González Llorente to borrow the vase, to use it in a dinner for the visiting royal commissioner Antonio Villavicencio, but Llorente refused to lend the vase with a haughty attitude. In light of this, and as was planned on the previous day, the "criollos" took the vase and broke it to provoke Llorente and thus raised tempers of the people against the Spanish. The "criollos" knew Llorente, being a merchant, would refuse to lend the vase, first because it was for sale and second because he would not lend any objects to the "criollos" to meet fellow "criollos". {{clarify|date=July 2015}}

Subsequently, a group of Venezuelans, among whom was Francisco José de Caldas, made an oath of submission to Spain and the Regency Council. In response, Antonio Morales Caldas scolded him for prompting a turbulent response from the people, who tried to attack Llorente. The mayor of Santa Fe de Bogota, José Miguel Pey, tried to calm the people attacking Llorente, while Jose Maria Carbonell encouraged people to join the protest. That afternoon, a Junta was formed (later called the People's Junta) with José Acevedo as chairman, but the crowds were angered by the Viceroy's decision to be nominated for president, which he accepted. Among the shocked crowds were members of the local militia battalion commanded by Antonio Baraya.

===Junta &amp; Seville Regency Council===
Later, a rally called by Juan Sámano, a Spanish Army officer, would lead to the Junta being reorganized (Acevedo had earlier urged the people to help charge him for [[Lèse-majesté|lese-majesty]]). The next day, July 21, the Junta ordered the arrest of Viceroy Aman y Borbón and his officials, and also for his resignation from the Junta presidency. On the 25th Aman was forced to resign and was arrested. Five days later, July 26, the Junta declared that its ties to the Seville Regency Council were finally cut, therefore the Junta officially declared the independence of what is now Colombia from Spanish rule and the rule of the Regency Council. Bogota would be the first city of the colony to break its ties with Spain, followed by more provincial capitals in the coming months.

'''Commuter worker''' is a term used in the [[United States]] for residents of [[Mexico]] who [[Commuting|commute]] across the [[Mexico – United States border]] to work in the United States. The United States Congress has not authorized commuting, but the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in the 1970s that the [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] process can be used by Mexicans to obtain jobs in the United States while maintaining residences in Mexico.

A 1992 study by San Diego Dialogue, a research institute at the [[University of California, San Diego]], estimated that there are 40,000 commuter workers in the [[San Diego]] area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8751">A '''comparison of [[baseball]] and [[softball]]''' can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.

[[Fastpitch softball]] is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational [[sports league|league]]s where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).

{{ProgLangCompare}}
String [[Function (computer science)|functions]] are used in computer [[programming language]]s to manipulate a [[String (computer science)|string]] or query information about a string (some do both).

Most programming languages that have a string [[datatype]] will have some string functions although there may be other low-level ways within each language to handle strings directly. In object-oriented languages, string functions are often implemented as properties and methods of string objects. In functional and list-based languages a string is represented as a list (of character codes), therefore all list-manipulation procedures could be considered string functions. However such languages may implement a subset of explicit string-specific functions as well.

For function that manipulate strings, modern object-oriented languages, like [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] have immutable strings and return a copy (in newly allocated dynamic memory), while others, like [[C (programming language)|C]] manipulate the original string unless the programmer copies data to a new string. See for example [[#Concatenation|Concatenation]] below.

The most basic example of a string function is the &lt;code&gt;length(string)&lt;/code&gt; function. This function returns the length of a [[string literal]].

:e.g. &lt;code&gt;length("hello world")&lt;/code&gt; would return 11.

Other languages may have string functions with similar or exactly the same syntax or parameters or outcomes. For example, in many languages the length function is usually represented as ''[[Len (programming)|len]](string)''.  The below list of common functions aims to help limit this confusion.

==Common string functions (multi language reference)==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
String functions common to many languages are listed below, including the different names used.  The below list of common functions aims to help programmers find the equivalent function in a language. Note, string [[concatenation]] and [[regular expressions]] are handled in separate pages. Statements in [[guillemets]] (« … ») are optional.
&lt;!-- When giving literal examples please say the language you are using as different languages use different syntax. please list in alpha order. --&gt;

! Description
| Compares two strings to each other.  If they are equivalent, a zero is returned. Otherwise, most of these routines will return a positive or negative result corresponding to whether string&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is [[lexicographical order|lexicographically]] greater than, or less than, respectively, than string&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The exceptions are the Scheme and Rexx routines which return the index of the first mismatch, and Smalltalk which answer a comparison code telling how the receiver sorts relative to string parameter.

Tests if two strings are equal. See also [[#Compare (relational operator-based, Boolean result)|#Compare]] and [[#Compare (integer result)|#Compare]]. Note that doing equality checks via a generic [[#Compare (integer result)|Compare with integer result]] is not only confusing for the programmer but is often a significantly more expensive operation; this is especially true when using "[[String (computer science)#Representations|C-strings]]".

===Find character===

{| class="wikitable"

! Definition 
| &lt;code&gt;find_character(''string'',''char'')&lt;/code&gt; returns integer
|-
! Description
| Returns the position of the start of the first occurrence of the character ''char'' in ''string''. If the character is not found most of these routines return an invalid index value – -1 where indexes are 0-based, 0 where they are 1-based – or some value to be interpreted as Boolean FALSE. This can be accomplished as a special case of [[#Find]], with a string of one character; but it may be simpler or more efficient in many languages to locate just one character. Also, in many languages, characters and strings are different types, so it is convenient to have such a function.

| &lt;string&gt;.split(''separator''[, ''limit'']) splits a string on separator, optionally only up to a limited number of substrings
|-
! Description
| Splits the given string by occurrences of the separator (itself a string) and returns a list (or array) of the substrings. If ''limit'' is given, after ''limit'' – 1 separators have been read, the rest of the string is made into the last substring, regardless of whether it has any separators in it. The Scheme and Erlang implementations are similar but differ in several ways. JavaScript differs also in that it cuts, it does not put the rest of the string into the last element. [https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp See the example here]. The Cobra implementation will default to whitespace. Opposite of ''join''.

| Returns a substring of ''string'' between starting at ''startpos'' and ''endpos'', or starting at ''startpos'' of length ''numChars''.  The resulting string is truncated if there are fewer than ''numChars'' characters beyond the starting point. ''endpos'' represents the index after the last character in the substring. Note that for variable-length encodings such as [[UTF-8]], [[UTF-16]] or [[Shift-JIS]], it can be necessary to remove string positions at the end, in order to avoid invalid strings.

'''Other languages'''

In languages without a built-in trim function, it is usually simple to create a custom function which accomplishes the same task.

====AWK====
In [[AWK]], one can use regular expressions to trim:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="awk"&gt;
 ltrim(v) = gsub(/^[ \t]+/, "", v)
 rtrim(v) = gsub(/[ \t]+$/, "", v)
 trim(v)  = ltrim(v); rtrim(v)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

or:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="awk"&gt;
 function ltrim(s) { sub(/^[ \t]+/, "", s); return s }
 function rtrim(s) { sub(/[ \t]+$/, "", s); return s }
 function trim(s)  { return rtrim(ltrim(s)); }
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====C/C++====
There is no standard trim function in C or C++. Most of the available string libraries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.and.org/vstr/comparison |title=String library comparison |publisher=And.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; for C contain code which implements trimming, or functions that significantly ease an efficient implementation. The function has also often been called '''EatWhitespace''' in some non-standard C libraries.

In C, programmers often combine a ltrim and rtrim to implement trim:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

void rtrim(char *str)
{
  char *s;
  s = str + strlen(str);
  while (--s &gt;= str) {
    if (!isspace(*s)) break;
    *s = 0;
  }
}

void ltrim(char *str)
{
  size_t n;
  n = 0;
  while (str[n] != '\0' &amp;&amp; isspace((unsigned char)str[n])) {
    n++;
  }
  memmove(str, str + n, strlen(str) - n + 1);
}

void trim(char *str)
{
  rtrim(str);
  ltrim(str);
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The [[open-source software|open source]] C++ library [[Boost library|Boost]] has several trim variants, including a standard one:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boost.org/doc/html/string_algo/usage.html#id2742817 |title=Usage – 1.54.0 |publisher=Boost.org |date=2013-05-22 |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;boost/algorithm/string/trim.hpp&gt;
trimmed = boost::algorithm::trim_copy("string");
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Note that with boost's function named simply &lt;code&gt;trim&lt;/code&gt; the input sequence is modified in-place, and does not return a result.

Another [[open-source software|open source]] C++ library [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] has several trim variants, including a standard one:&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qstring.html#trimmed]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802041055/http://doc.trolltech.com/4.5/qstring.html#trimmed |date=August 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="cpp"&gt;
#include &lt;QString&gt;
trimmed = s.trimmed();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The [[Linux kernel]] also includes a strip function, &lt;code&gt;strstrip()&lt;/code&gt;, since 2.6.18-rc1, which trims the string "in place". Since 2.6.33-rc1, the kernel uses &lt;code&gt;strim()&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;strstrip()&lt;/code&gt; to avoid false warnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dankamongmen |url=https://github.com/dankamongmen/sprezzos-kernel-packaging/blob/master/changelog |title=sprezzos-kernel-packaging/changelog at master · dankamongmen/sprezzos-kernel-packaging · GitHub |publisher=Github.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Haskell====
A trim algorithm in [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="haskell"&gt;
 import Data.Char (isSpace)
 trim      :: String -&gt; String
 trim      = f . f
    where f = reverse . dropWhile isSpace
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

may be interpreted as follows: ''f'' drops the preceding whitespace, and reverses the string. ''f'' is then again applied to its own output. Note that the type signature (the second line) is optional.

====J====

The trim algorithm in [[J (programming language)|J]] is a [[functional programming|functional]] description:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="j"&gt;
     trim =. #~ [: (+./\ *. +./\.) ' '&amp;~:
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

That is: filter (&lt;code&gt;#~&lt;/code&gt;) for non-space characters (&lt;code&gt;' '&amp;~:&lt;/code&gt;) between leading (&lt;code&gt;+./\&lt;/code&gt;) and (&lt;code&gt;*.&lt;/code&gt;) trailing (&lt;code&gt;+./\.&lt;/code&gt;) spaces.

====JavaScript====
There is a built-in trim function in JavaScript 1.8.1 (Firefox 3.5 and later), and the ECMAScript 5 standard. In earlier versions it can be added to the String object's prototype as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="javascript"&gt;
String.prototype.trim = function() {
  return this.replace(/^\s+/g, "").replace(/\s+$/g, "");
};
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Perl====
Perl 5 has no built-in trim function. However, the functionality is commonly achieved using [[regular expression]]s.

Example:
 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
$string =~ s/^\s+//;            # remove leading whitespace
$string =~ s/\s+$//;            # remove trailing whitespace
 &lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
or:
 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
$string =~ s/^\s+|\s+$//g ;     # remove both leading and trailing whitespace
 &lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
These examples modify the value of the original variable &lt;code&gt;$string&lt;/code&gt;.

Also available for Perl is '''StripLTSpace''' in &lt;code&gt;String::Strip&lt;/code&gt; from [[CPAN]].

There are, however, two functions that are commonly used to strip whitespace from the end of strings, &lt;code&gt;chomp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chop&lt;/code&gt;: 
* &lt;code&gt;[http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chop.html chop]&lt;/code&gt; removes the last character from a string and returns it.
* &lt;code&gt;[http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/chomp.html chomp]&lt;/code&gt; removes the trailing newline character(s) from a string if present. (What constitutes a newline is [http://perldoc.perl.org/perlvar.html $INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR] dependent).

In [[Perl 6]], the upcoming major revision of the language, strings have a &lt;code&gt;trim&lt;/code&gt; method.

Example:
 &lt;syntaxhighlight lang="perl"&gt;
$string = $string.trim;     # remove leading and trailing whitespace
$string .= trim;            # same thing
 &lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Tcl====
The [[Tcl]] &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; command has three relevant subcommands:  &lt;code&gt;trim&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;trimright&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;trimleft&lt;/code&gt;.  For each of those commands, an additional argument may be specified:  a string that represents a set of characters to remove—the default is whitespace (space, tab, newline, carriage return).

Example of trimming vowels:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="tcl"&gt;
set string onomatopoeia
set trimmed [string trim $string aeiou]         ;# result is nomatop
set r_trimmed [string trimright $string aeiou]  ;# result is onomatop
set l_trimmed [string trimleft $string aeiou]   ;# result is nomatopoeia
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====XSLT====
[[XSL Transformations|XSLT]] includes the function &lt;code&gt;normalize-space(''string'')&lt;/code&gt; which strips leading and trailing whitespace, in addition to replacing any whitespace sequence (including line breaks) with a single space.

Example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="xml"&gt;
&lt;xsl:variable name='trimmed'&gt;
   &lt;xsl:value-of select='normalize-space(string)'/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
XSLT 2.0 includes regular expressions, providing another mechanism to perform string trimming.

Another XSLT technique for trimming is to utilize the XPath 2.0 &lt;code&gt;substring()&lt;/code&gt; function.

{{Reflist|refs=
&lt;ref name="at1"&gt;the index can be negative, which then indicates the number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="at2"&gt;the index can '''not''' be negative, use '''*-N''' where N indicate the number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="substr2"&gt;''&lt;code&gt;startpos&lt;/code&gt;'' can be negative, which indicates to start that number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="substr3"&gt;''&lt;code&gt;endpos&lt;/code&gt;'' can be negative, which indicates to end that number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="substr4"&gt;''&lt;code&gt;numChars&lt;/code&gt;'' can be negative, which indicates to end that number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="substr5"&gt;''&lt;code&gt;startpos&lt;/code&gt;'' can '''not''' be negative, use ''* - startpos'' to indicate to start that number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="substr6"&gt;''&lt;code&gt;numChars&lt;/code&gt;'' can '''not''' be negative, use ''* - numChars'' to indicate to end that number of places before the end of the string.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8768">The '''Composition of Connacht''', or '''Composition of Connaught and Thomond''', was a 1585 agreement between, on the one hand, the [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic and Gaelicised]] chiefs of [[Connacht]] and [[Thomond]] and, on the other hand, the English [[Dublin Castle administration]] of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], which replaced the multiple existing levies with a single tax on land holdings. The Composition was a form of [[surrender and regrant]], a part of the [[Tudor reconquest of Ireland]]. The English leaders were Sir [[John Perrot]], as [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and Sir [[Richard Bingham (soldier)|Richard Bingham]], as [[Lord President of Connaught|Governor of the Presidency of Connacht]].

Connacht was made a Presidency in 1569 and divided into [[counties of Ireland|counties]] afterwards, but the county administration did not function efficiently until the Composition. In 1577, Lord Deputy [[Henry Sidney]] instigated a first Composition, which collapsed when President [[Nicholas Malby]] died. Under the 1585 Composition, the "countries" ([[cantred]]s or [[trícha cét]]s) of the chiefs became [[barony (Ireland)|baronies]] of the counties. The counties affected by the composition included [[County Clare|Clare]], which, under the name [[Thomond]], was part of the Presidency of Connaught from 1569 until about 1600.{{#tag:ref|About 1600 Clare was removed from the presidency of Connaught and made a presidency in its own right under the Earl of Thomond. When [[Henry O'Brien, 5th Earl of Thomond]] died in 1639, Lord Deputy [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]] decreed Clare should return to the presidency of Munster, but the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] delayed this until [[Restoration (England)|the Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Falkiner |first=Caesar Litton |title=The Counties of Ireland: An Historical Sketch of Their Origin, Constitution, and Gradual Delimitation |date=29 November 1902 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Section C |volume=24|pages=184–5 |jstor=25502712 |authorlink=Caesar Litton Falkiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="n"}}

==Charges==
Prior to the composition, a landholder was liable to pay various charges: to the English a [[cess]] to cover the cost of the garrisons; and to the Gaelic chief [[coyne and livery]] for his private army, and "cuttings" and "coshery" for his household. These were to be replaced with a fixed annual rent of 10 [[Shilling (Irish coin)|shilling]]s per quarter{{#tag:ref|A quarter, notionally 120 [[Irish acre]]s, varied in size depending on land quality, and usually approximated the [[townland]]s standardised in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/places/naming_land/land_measures.htm|title=Land Measures; Surveys and Sources|last=Mac Mahon|first=Michael|work=Naming the Land: Reflections on Co.Clare Place-Names|publisher=Clare County Library|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group="n"}} of inhabited land payable to the Presidency, plus a variable Composition rent payable to the local chief. Some lands, termed "freedoms", were exempt from Composition rent.

==Title==
The Composition book recorded the names of the holders of many quarters, together with the amount of rent to which they would be liable. Later generations assumed that this amounted to a proof of [[Title (property)|title]] to the land for the heirs of those named. This assumption was denied in the 1640s by [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford]], who instigated a reassignment of lands as part of the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]].

The following people were either members of the Commission, signatories of the composition, or both:

The '''Cristero Museum''' ({{lang-es|Museo Cristero}}) was the only museum in [[Mexico]] dedicated to the country's religious conflicts,{{which|date=December 2016}} which lasted from 1767 until the [[Cristero War]] in the 1900s. It is located in the city of [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]], in central Mexico. The museum was opened to the public on 20 March 2003. It was composed of five exhibition rooms with seven themes, through which the background of the conflicts between State power and Church power in Mexico was explained, up to the last impact of the [[Cristero War]]. The museum also housed the Captain Efrén Quesada Ibarra Historical Archive, a space dedicated to students and researchers, which housed the largest collection of printed documents and audiovisuals in the country.{{cn|date=December 2016}} It has been closed since around 2005 but the collection is said to still exist.{{who|date=December 2016}}{{clarify|date=December 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3314">A '''dependent-marking language''' has grammatical markers of [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[case government]] between the words of [[phrase]]s that tend to appear more on [[Dependent (grammar)|dependents]] than on [[head (linguistics)|head]]s. The distinction between [[head-marking language|head-marking]] and dependent-marking was first explored by Johanna Nichols in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;See Nichols (1986, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and has since become a central criterion in language typology in which languages are classified according to whether they are more head-marking or dependent-marking. Many languages employ both head and dependent-marking, but some employ [[Double-marking language|double-marking]], and yet others employ [[Zero-marking language|zero-marking]]. However, it is not clear that the head of a clause has anything to do with the head of a noun phrase, or even what the head of a clause is.

==In English==
[[English language|English]] has few inflectional markers of agreement and so can be construed as zero-marking much of the time. Dependent-marking, however, occurs when a singular or plural noun demands the singular or plural form of the demonstrative determiner ''this/these'' or ''that/those'' and when a verb or preposition demands the subject or object form of a personal pronoun: ''I/me'', ''he/him'', ''she/her'', ''they/them'', ''who/whom''. The following representations of [[dependency grammar]] illustrate some cases:&lt;ref&gt;Dependency grammar trees similar to the ones that appear here can be found en masse in Ágel et al. (2003/6).&lt;/ref&gt; 

:[[File:Dependent marking 1.png|Dependent marking 1]]

Plural nouns in English require the plural form of a dependent demonstrative determiner, and prepositions require the object form of a dependent personal pronoun.

==In German==
Such instances of dependent-marking are a relatively rare occurrence in English, but dependent-marking occurs much more frequently in related languages, such as [[German language|German]]. There, for instance, dependent-marking is present in most noun phrases. A noun marks its dependent determiner:

::[[File:Dependent marking 2.1.png|Dependent marking 2.1]]

The noun marks the dependent determiner in gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter) and number (singular or plural). In other words, the gender and number of the noun determine the form of the determiner that must appear. Nouns in German also mark their dependent adjectives in gender and number, but the markings vary across determiners and adjectives. Also, a head noun in German can mark a dependent noun with the genitive case.

'''''Deutsche Mythologie''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə mytoloˈɡiː|lang}}, ''Teutonic Mythology'') is a treatise on [[Continental Germanic mythology|Germanic mythology]] by [[Jacob Grimm]]. First published in Germany in 1835, the work is an exhaustive treatment of the subject, tracing the mythology and beliefs of the [[Germanic peoples|ancient Germanic peoples]] from their earliest attestations to their survivals in modern traditions, folktales and popular expressions.

The structure of the ''Deutsche Mythologie'' is fairly encyclopaedic. The articles and chapters are discursive of philological, historical, folkloristic, and poetic aspects of the pre-Christian Germanic religions. The sources are varied epochally and geographically. In many instances, Grimm cites the North and West Germanic variants of a religious entity; thus the entry on [[Thor]] is titled 'Donar, Thunar (Thôrr)'. Older Germanic words, particularly those concerning ritual, are often compared to Latin equivalents, as evident in the table of contents.

The English translation by Stallybrass (3 vols., with vol. 4, supplement), is based on the fourth edition.&lt;ref&gt;Stallybrass tr. {{Harvnb|Grimm|loc=Vol.1, p.vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historiographical importance==

The ''Deutsche Mythologie'' was an influential study; it has been called 'seminal, and largely unsurpassed'.&lt;ref&gt;Alaric Hall, ''Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity'', Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007; pbk repr. 2009), p. 12. See also David Elton Gay, 'Jacob Grimm and the Reconstructon of Estonian Religion and Mythology', in ''Constructing Nations, Reconstructing Myth: Essays in Honour of T. A. Shippey'', ed. by Andrew Wawn with Graham Johnson and John Walter, Making the Middle Ages, 9 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2007), pp. 343-55.&lt;/ref&gt; Previous studies of Germanic mythology had tended to focus strictly on gods, whereas Grimm 'examined the totality of Germanic religious experience, from the creation narratives of the ''Prose Edda'' to the superstitions of the German peasant'.&lt;ref&gt;George S. Williamson, ''The Longing for Myth in Germany: Religion and Aesthetic Culture from Romanticism to Nietzsche'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm was not given to overt discussions of method, but his study implies a set of 'buried theses' which were important to the development of scholarship on mythology: that the study of words as well as stories can reveal past belief-systems, and that 'just as [[Proto-Germanic language|Primitive Germanic]] word-forms could be "reconstructed" on a comparative basis, so could Primitive Germanic concepts, and the mythology in which they were embedded'.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt; Grimm also assumed a 'thesis of continuity', whereby later sources could be seen as representations of earlier culture, due to the historical continuities between the two.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (p. 24).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Grimm's mythological methods have also been criticised extensively. Unlike his linguistic methods for reconstructing past languages, they were unable to produce scientifically falsifiable results.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (pp. 17-18), citing K.-S. Kramer, 'Jacob Grimm und seine "volkskundliche Quellen": Zur Frage der Zeugniskraft von "Sitte und Sage" für die "Deutsche Mythologie" ', in ''Germanische Religionsgeschichte: Quellen und Quellenprobleme'', ed. by Heinrich Beck, Detlev Ellmers, and Kurt Schier (Berlin: De Gruyter, 1992), pp. 588-607.&lt;/ref&gt; His findings have been shown to have been shaped by his own political leanings: some of his claims in the ''Deutsche Mythologie'' related to his views on the proper borders of a [[Unification of Germany|Unified Germany]] and particularly the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]];&lt;ref&gt;Ian Wood, ''The Modern Origins of the Early Middle Ages'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 169-71.&lt;/ref&gt; others were shaped by his sometimes strident, anti-Catholic Protestant sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;George S. Williamson, ''The Longing for Myth in Germany: Religion and Aesthetic Culture from Romanticism to Nietzsche'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), pp. 98-112.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Deutsche Mythologie'' in fact implies a range of views on social questions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;He wanted to find a mythology which would not challenge the social structures of his own day, or would even reinforce the social structures which Grimm would have liked to see. It would accordingly have an organized pantheon of gods not dissimilar to the classical pantheon, with a clear sense of hierarchy [...] It would contain an element of philosophical profundity, centering on the concept of 'Fate' [...] There would be a healthy element of diversity in it, as shown by the eventually resolved rivalry of Æsir and Vanir pantheons [...] and not too much sign of an organised priestly class -- for Grimm was a Protestant [...] [G]ods and goddesses would also be respectably paired off and the latter would have strong connections with the household virtues [...] A strong element of nature-worship, especially of trees and groves, was also a desideratum.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in ''The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous'', ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (pp. 13-14), citing Wolf-Daniel Hartwich, ''Deutsche Mythologie: Die Erfindung einer nationalen Kunstreligion'' (Berlin: Philo, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24318">'''Dispute settlement''' or ''Dispute Settlement System'' (DSS) is regarded by the '''[[World Trade Organization]]''' ('''WTO''') as the central pillar of the multilateral [[international trade|trading system]], and as the organization's "unique contribution to the stability of the [[world economy|global economy]]".&lt;ref&gt;WTO [http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm "Understanding The WTO"], ''World Trade Organization'', accessed December 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A dispute arises when one [[WTO accession and membership|member country]] adopts a trade policy ''measure'' or takes some ''action'' that one or more fellow members considers to a breach of WTO agreements or to be a failure to live up to obligations. By joining the WTO, member countries have agreed that if they believe fellow members are in violation of trade rules, they will use the [[Dispute Settlement Body|multilateral system of settling disputes]] instead of taking action unilaterally — this entails abiding by agreed procedures—Dispute Settlement Understanding—and respecting judgments, primarily of the Dispute Settlement Board (DSB), the WTO organ responsible for adjudication of disputes.&lt;ref name="UnSD"&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/whatis_e/tif_e/disp1_e.htm Settling Disputes:a Unique Contribution], World Trade Organization&lt;/ref&gt; A former WTO Director-General characterized the WTO dispute settlement system as "the most active international adjudicative mechanism in the world today."&lt;ref&gt;S. Panitchpakdi, ''The WTO at ten'', 8&lt;/ref&gt; Chad P. Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics and Petros Mavroidis of Columbia Law School remarked on the 20th anniversary of the dispute settlement system that the system is "going strong" and that "there is no sign of weakening".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bown|first=Chad P.|last2=Mavroidis|first2=Petros C.|date=2017-04-01|title=WTO Dispute Settlement in 2015: Going Strong after Two Decades|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-trade-review/article/wto-dispute-settlement-in-2015-going-strong-after-two-decades/6D64F6E112E14F198F6E105E6EC573CD|journal=World Trade Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=153–158|doi=10.1017/S1474745616000604|issn=1474-7456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dispute Settlement Understanding==
{{quote |text = Prompt compliance with recommendations or rulings of the DSB is essential in order to ensure effective resolution of disputes to the benefit of all Members.|author=World Trade Organization|source=Article 21.1 of the '''DSU'''}}

In 1994, the WTO members agreed on the Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes or Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) (annexed to the "Final Act" signed in Marrakesh in 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Stewart-Dawyer, ''The WTO Dispute Settlement System'', 7&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to the rules detailed in the DSU, member states can engage in consultations to resolve trade disputes pertaining to a "covered agreement" or, if unsuccessful, have a WTO panel hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;A list of covered agreements is included in [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_09_e.htm#app_1 Appendix 1] to the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; The priority, however, is to settle disputes, through consultations if possible. By January 2008, only about 136  of the nearly 369 cases had reached the full panel process.&lt;ref name="UnSD" /&gt;

The operation of the WTO dispute settlement process involves the parties and third parties to a case and may also involve the DSB panels, the [[Appellate Body]], the WTO Secretariat, arbitrators, independent experts, and several specialized institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/disp_settlement_cbt_e/c3s1p1_e.htm WTO Bodies involved in the dispute settlement process], World Trade Organization&lt;/ref&gt; The General Council discharges its responsibilities under the DSU through the [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|Dispute Settlement Body]] (DSB).&lt;ref&gt;Article IV:3 of the WTO Agreement&lt;/ref&gt; Like the General Council, the DSB is composed of representatives of all WTO Members. The DSB is responsible for administering the DSU, i.e. for overseeing the entire dispute settlement process. It also has the authority to establish panels, adopt panel and Appellate Body reports, maintain surveillance of implementation of rulings and recommendations, and authorize the suspension of obligations under the covered agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Article 2.1 of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; The DSB meets as often as necessary to adhere to the timeframes provided for in the DSU.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_01_e.htm#article2A 2.3] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt;

==From complaint to final report==
If a member state considers that a measure adopted by another member state has deprived it of a benefit accruing to it under one of the covered agreements, it may call for consultations with the other member state.&lt;ref name="L152"&gt;A.F. Lowenfeld, ''International Economic Law'', 152&lt;/ref&gt; If consultations fail to resolve the dispute within 60 days after receipt of the request for consultations, the complainant state may request the establishment of a Panel. It is not possible for the respondent state to prevent or delay the establishment of a Panel, unless the DSB by [[consensus]] decides otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_03_e.htm#article6A 6.1] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; The panel, normally consisting of three members appointed ''[[ad hoc]]'' by the Secretariat, sits to receive written and oral submissions of the parties, on the basis of which it is expected to make findings and conclusions for presentation to the DSB. The proceedings are confidential, and even when private parties are directly concerned, they are not permitted to attend or make submissions separate from those of the state in question.&lt;ref name="L153"&gt;A.F. Lowenfeld, ''International Economic Law'', 153&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes can also arise under [[Non-violation nullification of benefits claims]].&lt;ref&gt;Faunce TA, Neville W and Anton Wasson A. Non Violation Nullification of Benefit Claims: Opportunities and Dilemmas in a Rule-Based WTO Dispute Settlement System in Bray M (ed) Ten Years of WTO Dispute Settlement: Australian Perspectives. Office of Trade Negotiations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.Commonwealth of Australia. 123-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The final version of the panel's report is distributed first to the parties; two weeks later it is circulated to all the members of the WTO. In sharp contrast with other systems, the report is required to be adopted at a meeting of the DSB within 60 days of its circulation, unless the DSB by consensus decides not to adopt the report or a party to the dispute gives notice of its intention to appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_06_e.htm#article16A 6.1] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; A party may appeal a panel report to the standing Appellate Body, but only on issues of law and legal interpretations developed by the panel. Each appeal is heard by three members of the permanent seven-member Appellate Body set up by the Dispute Settlement Body and broadly representing the range of WTO membership. Members of the Appellate Body have four-year terms. They must be individuals with recognized standing in the field of law and international trade, not affiliated with any government. The Appellate Body may uphold, modify or reverse the panel's legal findings and conclusions. Normally appeals should not last more than 60 days, with an absolute maximum of 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_07_e.htm#article17A 17] of the DSU.&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility for appeal makes the WTO dispute resolution system unique among the judicial processes of dispute settlement in general [[public international law]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Panizzon, ''Good Faith in the Jurisprudence of the WTO'', 275&lt;/ref&gt;

Members may express their views on the report of the Appellate Body, but they cannot derail it. The DSU states unequivocally that an Appellate Body report shall be adopted by the DSB and unconditionally accepted by the parties, unless the DSB decides by consensus within thirty days of its circulation not to adopt the report.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_07_e.htm#article17A 17.14] of the DSU.&lt;/ref&gt; Unless otherwise agreed by the parties to the dispute, the period from establishment of the panel to consideration of the report by the DSB shall as a general rule not exceed nine months if there is no appeal, and twelve months if there is an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_07_e.htm#article20 20] of the DSU.&lt;/ref&gt;

==WTO Appellate Body==
The WTO Appellate Body of judges was first established in 1995. While a full complement consists of seven judges, the Appellate Body can hear an appeal with a minimum of three. The full term for an Appellate Body judge's appointment lasts four years with the a possibility of a reappointment for a second term.&lt;ref name="cigion_Bacchus_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cigionline.org/articles/trump-threatening-rule-law-whats-stake |title=Trump is Threatening the Rule of Law — What's at Stake? |date=July 12, 2018 |access-date=July 23, 2018|first=James |last=Bacchus |work=[[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] |location=[[Waterloo, Ontario]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By July 2018, there were only four judges remaining, as others had completed their 4-year terms and the term for one of these judges ends later in 2018. According to an article by the Waterloo, Ontario-based independent think tank [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] (CIGI)—supported by the Canadian federal government, the [[Office of the United States Trade Representative]], which is seeking WTO reforms, has blocked any re-appointments.&lt;ref name="cigion_Bacchus_2018"/&gt;

The Appellate Body is designated with a level of authority, pertaining to procedural issues. The Appellate Body has been met with much criticism, as it is said to have the potential to threaten the balance and exacerbate existing inequalities. The Appellate Body has accomplished several significant reforms; broadened access of third parties in appellate proceedings, opened the door to ''[[amicus curiae]]'' submissions by private individuals, and endorsed private counsels to represent governments. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=James|date=August 2004|title=Inequality in international trade? Developing countries and institutional change in WTO dispute settlement|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4177510?socuuid=2ec5a635-1892-4dff-940c-1c9627e37d89&amp;socplat=email|journal=Review of International Political Economy|volume=11|pages=542-573|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
The DSU addresses the question of compliance and retaliation&lt;!-- in unprecedented for the GATT strictness--&gt;. Within thirty days of the adoption of the report, the member concerned is to inform the DSB of its intentions in respect of implementation of the recommendations and rulings. If the member explains that it is impracticable to comply immediately with the recommendations and rulings, it is to have a "reasonable period of time" in which to comply. This reasonable amount of time should not exceed 15 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/Legal%20Guide_WTO%20Dispute%20resolution.pdf |title=A4ID Legal Guide: Dispute Resolution at the WTO |author=Baker McKenzie |publisher=Advocates for International Development |year=2013 |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If no agreement is reached about the reasonable period for compliance, that issue is to be the subject of binding arbitration; the arbitrator is to be appointed by agreement of the parties. If there is a disagreement  as to the satisfactory nature of the measures adopted by the respondent state to comply with the report, that disagreement is to be decided by a panel, if possible the same panel that heard the original dispute, but apparently without the possibility of appeal from its decision. The DSU provides that even if the respondent asserts that it has complied with the recommendation in a report, and even if the complainant party or the panel accepts that assertion, the DSB is supposed to keep the implementation of the recommendations under surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_08_e.htm#article21 21] of the DSU.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation and retaliation==
If all else fails, two more possibilities are set out in the DSU:
*If a member fails within the "reasonable period" to carry out the recommendations and rulings, it may negotiate with the complaining state for a mutually acceptable compensation. Compensation is not defined, but may be expected to consist of the grant of a concession by the respondent state on a product or service of interest to the complainant state.&lt;ref name="DSU22.2"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_08_e.htm#article22 22.2] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt;
*If no agreement on compensation is reached within twenty days of the expiry of the "reasonable period", the prevailing state may request authorization from the DSB to suspend application to the member concerned of concessions or other obligations under the covered agreements.&lt;ref name="DSU22.2" /&gt; The DSU makes clear that retaliation is not favored, and sets the criteria for retaliation.&lt;ref name="DSU22.3"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_08_e.htm#article22 22.3 and 22.4] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to prior GATT practice, authorization to suspend concessions in this context is semi-automatic, in that the DSB "shall grant the authorization [...] within thirty days of the expiry of the reasonable period", unless it decides by consensus to reject the request.&lt;ref name="DSU22.6"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_08_e.htm#article22 22.6] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; Any suspension or concession or other obligation is to be temporary. If the respondent state objects to the level of suspension proposed or to the consistency of the proposed suspension with the DSU principles, still another arbitration is provided for, if possible by the original panel members or by an arbitrator or arbitrators appointed by the Director-General, to be completed within sixty days from expiration of the reasonable period.&lt;ref name="DSU22.6" /&gt;

While such "retaliatory measures" are a strong mechanism when applied by economically powerful countries like the [[United States]] or the United Kingdom or organisations like the  [[European Union]], when applied by economically weak countries against stronger ones, they can often be ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Obijiofor Aginam, ''Food Safety, South-North Asymmetries, and the Clash of Regulatory Regimes'', 40 Vand. J. Transnat'l L. 1099, 1112 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not the complainant has taken a measure of retaliation, surveillance by the DSB is to continue, to see whether the recommendations of the panel or the Appellate Body have been implemented.&lt;ref name="DSU22.8"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_08_e.htm#article22 22.8] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing countries==
Like most of the agreements adopted in the Uruguay Round, the DSU contains several provisions directed to developing countries.&lt;ref name="L174"&gt;A.F. Lowenfeld, ''International Economic Law'', 174&lt;/ref&gt; The Understanding states that members should give "special attention" to the problems and interests of developing country members.&lt;ref name="DSU4.10"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_02_e.htm#article4 4.10] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; Further, if one party to a dispute is a developing country, that party is entitled to have at least one panelist who comes from a developing country.&lt;ref name="DSU8.10"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_04_e.htm#article8 8.10] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; If a complaint is brought against a developing country, the time for consultations (before a panel is convened) may be extended, and if the dispute goes to a panel, the deadlines for the developing country to make its submissions may be relaxed.&lt;ref name="DSU12.10"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_06_e.htm#article12 12.10] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the Secretariat is authorized to make a qualified legal expert available to any developing country on request. Formal complaints against [[least developed countries]] are discouraged, and if consultations fail, the Director-General and the Chairman of the DSB stand ready to offer their good offices before a formal request for a panel is made.&lt;ref name="DSU24"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_09_e.htm#article24 24] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; As to substance, the DSU provides that the report of panels shall "explicitly indicate" how account has been taken of the "differential and more favorable treatment" provisions of the agreement under which the complaint is brought. Whether or not a developing country is a party to a particular proceeding, "particular attention" is to be paid to the  interests of the developing countries in the course of implementing recommendations and rulings of panels.&lt;ref name="DSU12.11"&gt;Article [http://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/analytic_index_e/dsu_06_e.htm#article12 12.11] of the DSU&lt;/ref&gt; In order to assist developing countries in overcoming their limited expertise in WTO law and assist them in managing complex trade disputes, an [[Advisory Centre on WTO Law]] was established in 2001. The aim is to level the playing field for these countries and customs territories in the WTO system by enabling them to have a full understanding of their rights and obligations under the WTO Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;K. Van der Borght, ''The Advisory Center on the WTO Law'', 723-728&lt;/ref&gt;

==WTO bias==
President Trump raised concerns that the WTO's Dispute Settlement System (DSS) was biased against the US. Economists Jeffry Frieden and Joel Trachtman found that the United States wins the vast majority of disputes it brings against other countries, winning "more than the average when it is complainant". Other countries lose most of the cases brought against the US, losing "less than the average when it is [the] respondent". Frieden and Trachtman explain that the US would only bring cases to the DSS when their cases are "relatively clearly justified by the law".&lt;ref name="econofact_Frieden_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://econofact.org/u-s-trade-policy-going-it-alone-vs-abiding-by-the-world-trade-organization |title=U.S. Trade Policy: Going it Alone vs. Abiding by the World Trade Organization |first1=Jeffry |last1=Frieden |first2=Joel |last2=Trachtman |date=June 15, 2018 |access-date=July 14, 2018 |publisher=EconoFact}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing of trade disputes==
In their 2017 article published in the [[Journal of International Economics]], the authors examined WTO disputes filed by the United States between 1995 and 2014. They developed a theoretic model to explain the regularity with which incumbent presidential candidates filed trade disputes involving industries in swing states in the year prior to presidential elections.&lt;ref name="inecon_Conconia_2017"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Suspiciously timed trade disputes |first1=Paola |last1=Conconia |first2=David |last2=DeRemer |first3=Georg |last3=Kirchsteiger |first4=Lorenzo |last4=Trimarchi |first5=Maurizio |last5=Zanardi |doi=10.1016/j.jinteco.2016.12.001 |journal=[[Journal of International Economics]] |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/inecon/v105y2017icp57-76.html |access-date=July 14, 2018 |volume=105 |date=March 2017 |pages=57–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Draped Reclining Figure, 1952–53''''' is a bronze sculpture by [[Henry Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!373132~!0#focus "Draped Reclining Figure, (sculpture)"].

==Examples==
The sculpture, catalogued as "LH 336", was cast in an edition of four (or "3+1"; one being retained by the artist). The artist's copy was given to the [[Henry Moore Foundation]] and is on display in their sculpture garden around his old house at [[Perry Green, Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/pg/interactive-tours/virtual-perry-green/sculpture/2 Henry Moore Foundation, LH 336]&lt;/ref&gt;   Other copies in the edition are in the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in Washington, D.C.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;objectNumber=66.3634 Smithsonian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531200642/http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;objectNumber=66.3634 |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/in_depth.asp?key=33&amp;subkey=102&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum Ludwig]] in [[Cologne, Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/hmf/search/results?query=LH+336&amp;x=19&amp;y=11&amp;section= Henry Moore Foundation, LH 336 search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The work was a precursor to later draped figures. According to the artist's foundation, it "successfully added the contours of natural forms as well as a distinct hint of classicism to the repose of his figures, yet preserved that sense of immutability conveyed by the Mexican [[Chacmool]] figures that had so profoundly influenced the younger artist."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore.org/works-in-public/world/uk/castleford/civic-centre/working-model-for-draped-reclining-figure-1976-79 Henry Moore Foundation, LH 705]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''enemy of the state''' is a person accused of certain [[crime]]s against the [[State (polity)|state]], such as [[treason]]. Describing individuals in this way is sometimes a manifestation of [[political repression]]. For example, an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime may purport to maintain [[national security]] by describing social or political [[dissident]]s as "enemies of the state." In other cases, the individual in question may have in fact endangered the country and/or its population.

'''The world's most valuable sports teams''', as ranked annually by the American magazine ''[[Forbes]]'', include teams from [[association football]], [[American football]], [[baseball]], and [[basketball]].

In 2016, the [[Dallas Cowboys]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) simultaneously became both the first team to surpass $4 billion in value and the first non-association football team to top the ranking since its inception in 2010. [[Manchester United]] (2010–12) and [[Real Madrid]] (2013–15) have previously each been named the most valuable team three times.

'''Eugene Nicholas Kiniski''' (November 23, 1928 – April 14, 2010) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] athlete who played [[American football|football]] for the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] and later was a successful [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] recognized as a multiple-time World Heavyweight Champion. "Canada's Greatest Athlete", as he billed himself for promotional purposes, was born in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name=oww&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/g/gene-kiniski.html|title=Gene Kiniski profile|publisher=OWOW|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=p211&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 211, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Bronko Nagurski]] before him, Kiniski was one of the first World Champions in professional wrestling to have a previous background in football.  He is the father of professional wrestler [[Kelly Kiniski]] and [[Amateur wrestling|international amateur]]/professional wrestler [[Nick Kiniski]].

==Early life==
One of six children of local politician [[Julia Kiniski]], who emigrated from Poland, Kiniski grew up in Edmonton. At the age of seventeen he was over six feet tall. Kiniski wrestled and played football at St. Joseph's High School. In March 1947, he entered the annual Edmonton School's Boxing and Wrestling Tournament at Westglen gymnasium. Due to his size, he was the lone heavyweight competing.&lt;ref name=p212&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 212, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kiniski captured the attention of [[Annis Stukus]], a scout for the [[Edmonton Eskimos]], of the then [[Canadian Football League West Division|Western Interprovincial Football Union]] in 1949, (which later merged with the [[Canadian Football League East Division|Interprovincial Rugby Football Union]] to form the [[Canadian Football League]]). Along with Kiniski, wrestlers [[Al Oeming]] and [[Stu Hart]] were at the training camp as well. Two of his Eskimos teammates were future wrestlers [[Wilbur Snyder]] and [[Joe Blanchard]].

Kiniski secured himself a spot on the defensive line and his play earned him a scholarship to the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; He was enrolled there from September 18, 1950 to January 26, 1952 and played on the defensive line for Bob Winslow. Rod Fenton recruited Kiniski into professional wrestling in Arizona in 1952.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt;

Kiniski returned to Edmonton to play football for the Eskimos, and he suffered a torn kneecap in the team's first game against Saskatchewan in August 1952. He retired from football in 1953 to resume wrestling full-time. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career ===
After retiring from football, Kiniski trained with [[Dory Funk]] and Tony Morelli for a wrestling career, eventually making his pro debut on February 13, 1952 in [[Tucson, Arizona]], where he defeated Curly Hughes.&lt;ref name=Kiniski&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/vancenevada/01KiniskiGene.txt Gene Kiniski career record at Vance Nevada's Wrestling Career Records Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Kiniski's first exposure on television was in Southern California in 1954 alongside other wrestlers such as [[Wilbur Snyder]] and [[Bobo Brazil]]. One year later, he teamed up with [[John Tolos]] to win his first major championship, the International TV Tag Team title, in [[Los Angeles]], then challenged NWA World Champion [[Lou Thesz]] in November 1954.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; As an emerging talent, Kiniski got the opportunity to wrestle [[Lou Thesz]] at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium|Olympic Auditorium]] on November 3, 1954. Kiniski lost in two straight falls.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt;

From there, Kiniski ventured to [[San Francisco]] and teamed with [[Lord James Blears]] to win the territory's version of the NWA World Tag Team title three times in 1955; after that, he went to [[Texas]] and, wrestling as Gene Kelly, captured the [[NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship]] in 1956.

=== Toronto and Montreal ===
Kiniski began wrestling in his native [[Canada]] for the first time in November 1956, debuting for [[Toronto]]'s [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]]. His first main-event match in the territory took place at [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] in January 1957, when he teamed with [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] against [[Whipper Billy Watson]] and [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]] and saw the beginning of a lengthy feud with Watson that spanned across Canada; the Kiniski-Watson feud gained national exposure due to their matches sometimes being seen on [[CBC Television]]. He also challenged NWA World Heavyweight titleholders Watson, Thesz and [[Dick Hutton]] for the title on several occasions between 1955 and 1957.

In 1957, Kiniski competed in Montreal and Toronto. His feuds with [[Whipper Billy Watson]], [[Eric Holmback|Yukon Eric]], [[Édouard Carpentier]], and Pat O'Connor pushed his career further.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt;

Gene captured the British Empire title from O'Connor on May 2, 1957, and the Montreal version of the world title from Carpentier on June 12, 1957. Kiniski headlined a wrestling card at Delormier stadium in Montreal, where he dropped the Montreal world title to [[Killer Kowalski]] on July 17, 1957 in front of 21,000 fans.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; In 1959, Kiniski teamed with [[Don Leo Jonathan]], "The Mormon Giant" to win the Canadian Open Tag Team Championship.

=== Championship runs ===
Kiniski joined the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) in 1960 and defeated AWA World Champion [[Verne Gagne]] to win the title on July 11, 1961, also capturing the AWA World Tag Team title twice with [[Hard Boiled Haggerty]].&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; The title reign lasted less than a month. Kiniski won another title in West Texas a year later.

In 1962, Kiniski began what became the peak period of his career when he went to [[Vancouver]] to join [[NWA: All-Star Wrestling]]. Early on, he won the NWA British Empire Heavyweight title twice and the Pacific Coast Tag Team title three times, and he challenged again for the NWA World title, taking on Rogers in a main event at [[Empire Stadium (Vancouver)|Empire Stadium]] in Vancouver on July 30, 1962 (Rogers beat Kiniski to retain his title), and Thesz in 1963. He made Vancouver his home base while also making appearances in other promotions throughout North America and in [[Japan]], particularly a lengthy stint in the [[WWE#World Wide Wrestling Federation|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF) in 1964; while there, he challenged WWWF Champion [[Bruno Sammartino]] several times. Kiniski wrestled Sammartino on November 16, 1964 at [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; Thinking that he had pinned Sammartino in the second fall, Kiniski took the belt and left the ring. Despite being counted out, Kiniski kept the title until a rematch on December 14 settled the matter of who was the real champion.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt;

He also went to [[Dick the Bruiser]]'s [[Indianapolis]]-based [[World Wrestling Association]] in December 1965 and captured its World Heavyweight title, holding it for four months. A few weeks later, Kiniski earned the opportunity to contend for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] World Heavyweight title.

The pinnacle of Kiniski's career finally came on January 7, 1966, when he defeated Thesz to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]] in front of 11,612 fans at the Kiel Auditorium in [[St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=p212/&gt;

=== Heel champion ===
Compared to Thesz, Kiniski was a heel and was very comfortable in his role as a "bad guy" world champion.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; As world champion, Kiniski wrestled many well-known luminaries. These included [[Bobo Brazil]], Dick the Bruiser, [[Johnny Valentine]], [[Bill Watts]], [[Édouard Carpentier]], Pat O'Connor, and the Funks, Terry and Dory, Jr., respectively.

He travelled worldwide to defend his title during his three-year reign as champion, including making frequent stops back in Vancouver to defend his title in NWA All Star, taking on challengers such as Lou Thesz, [[Don Leo Jonathan]], [[Dutch Savage]], Bill Dromo, Bearcat Wright, John Tolos, Chris Tolos, [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[William Calhoun|Haystacks Calhoun]], Bobby Shane, [[Dean Higuchi]], Tex McKenzie and Paddy Barrett in the promotion.

After stops in Honolulu, Tokyo, and becoming the first World Champion to appear in Los Angeles in more than 11 years in November 1968, Kiniski was exhausted. At the 1968 NWA Convention, Kiniski announced that it was time to step down. He agreed to lose the championship to [[Dory Funk, Jr.]], and eventually went down to a spinning toehold on February 11, 1969 in Tampa.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; However, he later claimed in a WWE DVD release that the manner of his loss was accidental, as he submitted early to the toehold believing that the match was a two out of three falls encounter.

=== Into the 1970s ===
The NWA World title loss was not the end of the line, however, as Kiniski continued winning championships in NWA All Star and elsewhere. He won the NWA Missouri Heavyweight title from [[Terry Funk]] in St. Louis on March 16, 1973, while back in Vancouver, he won the Pacific Coast Heavyweight title seven times from 1970 to 1979, and won the Canadian Tag Team title ten times between 1963 and 1976, and in Japan, he captured the NWA International Heavyweight title in 1970.&lt;ref name=p212/&gt; He also got involved in the promotional side of the business when he joined forces with [[Sandor Kovacs]] and [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] promoter [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]] to acquire the Vancouver territory in the late 1960s; that, combined with Kiniski's NWA World title reign at the time, helped make Vancouver a wrestling hotbed for several years, until Kovacs sold his share in the promotion to [[Al Tomko]] in 1977. Kiniski retained his ownership stake in NWA All Star until around 1983.

Kiniski also wrestled for several months in 1970 and 1971 as a masked wrestler, "The Crimson Knight", on local TV (KPLR-TV) matches in St. Louis, Missouri. The storyline continued through numerous attempts to unmask the Knight (his mask was sewn onto his tights, making an easy removal impossible) before he was finally unmasked and revealed to be Kiniski.

=== Late career ===
Kiniski remained involved in the sport for a few more years, teaming periodically with his sons, Kelly and Nick, refereeing the main event of the inaugural NWA [[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]] (Ric Flair vs. NWA World Champion [[Harley Race]] in a steel cage) in 1983, and later promoting events for [[Stampede Wrestling]] and the AWA in Vancouver while occasionally stepping into the ring. His final matches as an active wrestler took place in [[Winnipeg]]'s [[International Wrestling Alliance|West Four Wrestling Alliance]] on February 25, 1992, defeating [[Bob Brown (wrestler)|"Bulldog" Bob Brown]], Bob Ryan and Randy Rudd in singles matches, teaming with [[Chris Jericho]] and [[Lance Storm]] to battle Brown, [[Don Callis|The Natural]] and Gerry Morrow to a no-contest in a six-man match, and being the last man eliminated by Morrow in a battle royal to fill the vacant [[WFWA Canadian Heavyweight Championship]] at a WFWA TV taping in Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocities.com/canadianwrestlemedia/1990.htm Vance Nevada's Canadian Wrestling Results Archive] (February 25, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSRceO0M9FY Classic Battle Royal from 1992 featuring young Chris Jericho and Gene Kiniski's final match]&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as the cornerman for Dory Funk Jr. in a match between Funk and [[Nick Bockwinkel]] (with Verne Gagne) at [[Slamboree 1993]]. He was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]] in 1996, and into the [[George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame|Tragos/Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] in [[Newton, Iowa]] in 2004. In 2000, he was the interim president (commissioner) of [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s Pacific Wrestling Federation title governing body, but only while they searched for a permanent replacement for Lord James Blears and to present the vacant [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]] to the winner of a tournament. The winner turned out to be [[Genichiro Tenryu]]; Kiniski left thereafter, and in 2001 the permanent PWF president was announced as [[Stan Hansen]], who had competed in the tournament and lost to Tenryu in the semifinals.

== Acting career ==
In addition to his sports pursuits, Kiniski went into acting on occasion, appearing in the 1978 [[Sylvester Stallone]] movie ''[[Paradise Alley]]'', as well as ''[[Double Happiness (film)|Double Happiness]]'' (which also starred [[Sandra Oh]]) and the made-in-Vancouver cult film ''[[Terminal City Ricochet]]'' (with former ''[[The Big Valley|Big Valley]]'' regular [[Peter Breck]]), playing a bit role as a policeman. On the TV side, he appeared as one of the wrestling legends interviewed on [[The Comedy Network]] series ''Wrestling with the Past'', and he served as a commercial pitchman in several TV ads aired in the Vancouver area.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|oN-VF9aFNII|Gene Kiniski commercial for Parker's Mattress City}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made an appearance on an episode of the [[CBUT-DT|CBUT]] arts and entertainment magazine show ''Zero Avenue'' in 1993, discussing art with host/interviewer Christine Lippa in a Vancouver-area art gallery.

== Death ==
On April 4, 2010, [[Jim Ross]] reported on his blog that Kiniski had "taken a turn for the worse and is battling to stay alive. 'Big Thunder's' cancer has spread to his brain and some speculate that is just a matter of time [before he dies]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/Other_News_4/article_40412.shtml Pro Wrestling Torch: Other News: Wrestling legend Gene Kiniski battling to stay alive]&lt;/ref&gt; Kiniski died on April 14, 2010, aged 81, at his home in [[Blaine, Washington]]. A celebration of his life was held on April 25, 2010 at Kiniski's Reef in Point Roberts, USA, where Gene often appeared at his son's Nick's tavern.

A '''Gjenganger''' ({{lang-no|Gjenganger}}, ''{{lang|no|Attergangar}}'' or ''{{lang|no|Gjenferd}}''; {{lang-da|Genganger}} or ''{{lang|da|Genfærd}}''; {{lang-sv|Gengångare}}) is the term for a [[revenant (folklore)|revenant]], the spirit or [[ghost]] of a deceased from the grave, in  [[Scandinavian folklore]]. ''{{lang|no|Gjenganger}}'' has two parts, the prefix is related to "again" or "against", "towards" (compare {{lang-de|gegenüber}}, ''{{lang|de|gegen}}'') and ''{{lang|no|í gegn}}'' ('against'), from ''{{lang|no|í}}'' ('in, on') and ''{{lang|no|gegn}}'' ('straight, direct') &lt;ref&gt;http://german.stackexchange.com/questions/23950/etymology-of-weiter-and-wieder&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-and-etymology-of-the-words-attergangar-gjenganger-and-wiederg%C3%A4nger&lt;/ref&gt; and ''{{lang|no|ganger}}'' which comes from a word meaning 'foot' or 'walker', thus it means "walking again" as in "walking after death". The form ''{{lang|no|attergangar}}'' comes from ''{{lang|no|atter}}'' meaning 'after' and originating from ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|[[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/afteraz|afteraz]]}}'' meaning "of, away from" but adding the contrastive suffix ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|-teros}}'', in essence meaning "after walking", "walking away from in contrast with close by", again implying walking after death.

== Causes ==
A ''gjenganger'' could have several reasons to return from the afterlife. Murdered people could seldom sleep peacefully in their graves. The same went for their murderers. People who had committed suicide often came back as ''gjengangere'', because Christian tradition held that "self-killers" were fit neither for heaven nor hell. At other times, people came back from the grave because they had left something undone. Most often they needed someone to help them do this, before they could finally be at peace.

== Characteristics ==
The biggest difference between modern ghosts and the ''gjenganger'' is that the ''gjenganger'' in the Scandinavian tradition took on an entirely [[Human body|corporeal]] form. It normally had no spectre-like qualities whatsoever. In older traditions the ''gjenganger'' was also very malicious and violent in nature, coming back from the grave to torment its family and friends. In the way they acted, and in the extensive precautions their relatives took to make sure they stayed in their graves, ''gjengangere'' are more akin to eastern-European [[vampires]] than modern-day ghosts.

== Viking Age ==
This tradition of the violent ''gjenganger'' goes back to the [[Viking age]], where they are present in many of the Icelandic sagas, among others: [[Grettis saga]], [[Eyrbyggja saga]] and [[The Saga of Eric the Red]]. In this tradition, the ''gjenganger'' was a mortal creature. An example of this is Grettir slaying the ''gjenganger'' Glámr with his sword. These Viking-age ''gjengangere'' were often called ''[[draugr]]'', and the two are likely to be different names for the same phenomenon.

==Up until circa 1900 ==
In slightly newer tradition, the ''gjenganger'' remains a violent [[entity]], though in a less direct way, now becoming more of a disease-spreader. These ''gjengangere'' would attack people with their so-called ''dødningeknip'' (dead man's pinch). This would result in the living persons skin becoming sunken and blue where the gjenganger had pinched them, and this often led to disease and death for the afflicted person. The pinch was often administered when the person was asleep. Both the ''[[huldrefolk]]'' and ''[[nøkken]]'' were also accused of doing the same, using bites instead of pinches, often aimed at the victims face. This belief in beings attacking people in their sleep was used as a warning against going to sleep in specific places (near the graveyard, mountains or water respectively).

In later Swedish folklore, a distinction is made between the traditional ''gjenganger'', in Swedish called ''gengångare'', and another type of ghost known as ''gast''. Whereas the ''gengångare'' looked virtually identical to a living human, the ''gast'' was known to be  transparent and/or skeletal in appearance, sometimes it also had sharp fangs and claws, thus making it impossible to see who the phantom had been while alive. And whereas the Swedish version of the ''gengångare'' (unlike its counterparts in other Scandinavian countries) were usually said to be rather harmless, it was the ''gast'' who was known to cause diseases. They were also known to cause accidents and scare people for no apparent reason other than that they enjoyed doing so.

== Protection and prevention ==
People had numerous ways of both defending themselves against the ''gjenganger'', and stopping people from becoming one in the first place. A few of them are mentioned here:
* Crucifixes and Christian incantations to ward off the ''gjenganger''.
* Painting symbols, especially the cross, with tar above your door was said to ward off all kinds of supernatural powers.
* When a person was buried, the coffin was carried over the church wall instead of through the gate (to stop him from coming back)
* For the same reason, the coffin was carried three times around the church before being buried.
* The shovels used to dig the grave were left behind, often on the grave itself in the shape of a cross.
* If the coffin was carried to church on a sleigh or other wooden transport, the transport should be left behind to rot, or be used by poor people as firewood.
* Perhaps the oldest example we have of an attempt to stop someone from coming back as a ''gjenganger'', is a [[runic]] inscription from the 6th century. It was written on the inside of the grave, facing the dead and reads:

:''New Norwegian:''
::For Birginga riste broren runer
::Kjære syster mi, skån meg!

:''English:''
::For Birginga, the brother carved runes
::My dear sister, spare me!

A tradition that deserves special mention is that of the "''[[varp]]''". A ''varp'' is a pile of stones or twigs which often marks a place where someone has died. It was believed that when you passed this place, you should throw another stone/twig on the ''varp'', to commemorate what had happened there. Doing so would sometimes bring luck on your further travels, while not doing so would result in bad luck and dangerous accidents. Many of these ''varps'' have now disappeared, especially the ones made out of twigs. But in a few places the ''varp'' is marked with a sign or something similar, and the tradition is kept alive to this day, though in a much looser, and often joking, manner.

== Modern perception ==
Ever since spiritualism came to Scandinavia around the beginning of the 20th century, the perception of the ''gjenganger'' has been gradually altered. Today it mostly compares with the modern perception of ghosts, most often being [[Non-physical entity|ethereal]] in form, and non-violent in nature. The word ''gjenganger'' is seemingly being used less and less, the contemporary word ''spøkelse'' (ghost) having mostly taken over. Where ''gjenganger'' does occur, it may be treated simply as a synonym for ghost, and the corresponding verbal phrase ''gå igjen'' (walk again) is just one way of saying "haunt" with reference to ghosts.

'''GlobeXplorer''' (Now part of DigitalGlobe Inc. (NYSE:DGI)) was an online spatial data company that compiled and distributed aerial photos, satellite imagery, and map data from their online spatial archives.  Based in Walnut Creek, CA, GlobeXplorer has been credited as the first company to establish a business around compiling and distributing online aerial and [[satellite imagery]].

==Products==

GlobeXplorer’s primary products were the ImageAtlas viewer and ImageBuilder web developer toolkit. They also provide ImageConnect extensions and web services for [[GIS]] and [[Computer-aided design|CAD]].

===History===

GlobeXplorer was founded in 1999 by Rob Shanks, Michael Fisher, Chris Nicholas, and Paul Smith (former executives at HJW GeoSpatial, Inc.) through partnerships with [[Sun Microsystems]], [[NASA]], and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]. It grew from a NASA EOCAP project of HJW's to place ready-made orthophotography online, and an internal project of Sun Microsystems and Oracle to counter the Microsoft "Terraserver" technology demonstration. The EOCAP project concluded with the creation of  an 'earth imagery' searchable website in 1998. HJW was acquired by [[Harrods]] of London, who provided financial backing to spin out the online effort into GlobeXplorer, which launched its public website in September 2000.  An article entitled "Now you, too, can be a Spy" appeared on the front page of the Wall Street Journal's business section, and traffic reached nearly 4 million page views the first day. In 2005, GlobeXplorer acquired AirPhotoUSA, one of the nation’s leading providers of aerial imagery. Previous owner Stewart Title (STC) sold the company to Digital Globe in early January 2007.

GlobeXplorer's defensible core competence was its ability to meter custom profiles of content for consumers and pay royalties to providers based on 512x512 "standard image units" (SIU). This was accomplished through content hosting, delivery via APIs and application plugins, and
building a custom billing system modeled around TELCO call rating and inter-bank settlement accounting. Beyond imagery, the billing system also supported metering of vector data and usage of floating license tokens for programs such as Arc/INFO, PCI and ERDAS.

Another pioneering aspect was using the Sun GRID Engine to perform CPU intensive operations, particularly color balancing and JPEG2000 compression, on its server farm. This was in keeping with the design philosophy of establish a "commercial DAAC", on a par with the USGS EROS data center, that could perform distributed batch processing across federated supercomputing sites using the Globus framework.

===Prominent customers===

In addition to its own website, GlobeXplorer's imagery and property data was licensed to [[Ask.com]], [[Zillow.com]], [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]], Reply.com, and the Germany-based [[Map24]].com, as well as inside various professional real estate services like [[CoStar]], eNeighborhoods, and Rappatoni MLS. It also provided [[Mapquest]] with imagery in 2001 and 2002.

===Partner relationships===

GlobeXplorer obtains its content through online distribution relationships with about 30 of the world’s top acquirers of aerial, satellite, and property data.

'''''It's Such a Beautiful Day''''' is an [[Experimental film|experimental]] [[black comedy]]-[[Drama (genre)|drama]] [[animated film]] directed, written, animated, and produced by [[Don Hertzfeldt]] as his first [[feature film]]. The film is divided into three chapters and follows the story of a stick-figure man named Bill, who struggles with his failing memory and [[absurdism|absurdist]] visions, among other symptoms of an unknown neurological illness, implied to be brain cancer. The film employs both offbeat humor and serious philosophical musings. It received critical acclaim and won numerous awards.

== Plot ==
Bill is a young man whose daily routines, perceptions, and dreams are illustrated onscreen through multiple split-screen windows, which are in turn narrated (by [[Don Hertzfeldt]]). The Narrator subtly explains that Bill is suffering from a problematic memory disorder, which interferes with his seemingly mundane life. Bill often has meetings with his unnamed ex-girlfriend, and had been recently referred to a clinic for his condition. On a visit to the clinic, Bill's doctor recommends that Bill have a new batch of medication, after his recent treatment didn't yield any positive results. It is unknown if Bill did take the new medication, as he undergoes a hallucinatory experience the next morning and then stays awake the following night. The next day Bill suffers more hallucinations, seeing monsters and ripping his own head open.

Bill is then shown lying down in an alleyway. To recuperate, Bill's mother comes to take care of him, though he attacks her when she comes at him with a pair of scissors. Bill is then taken to hospital, where his health fluctuates, confusing his doctor. Bill's doctor concludes that Bill is not going to die, wherein his mother removes all the flowers from the hospital room and returning a casket meant for him. Bill then goes back to work.

The film flashes back to Bill's childhood, with the Narrator explaining the death of Bill's half-brother Randall. Randall was in the "special" class at school, having aluminium hook arms and "a brain as misshapen as his legs". On a school trip at the seaside, Randall chased a gull and disappeared into the sea. After Randall's death, Bill's mother soon became fiercely protective of Bill and rarely left home. The Narrator then explains the details of Bill's stepfather leaving the house for good and Bill's mother rocking on the spot in front of the door afterwards. The Narrator also details the history of Bill's family, with many of them suffering from various diseases, such as [[polio]] and [[yellow fever]]. Many of Bill's family members were apparently killed by trains, and one—his great-great-uncle—was outcast from town and "died in the field one summer morning while dreaming of the moon."

A few days after leaving the hospital, Bill receives a call telling him that his mother had died; she was hit by a train after skipping her medication and launching into a fit of senile hysterics. After the funeral, Bill goes through his mother's old belongings, finding a physician's note strongly recommending that she never have a child. 

Bill sees his doctor once again, who unexpectedly finds nothing wrong with him. On his way to lunch, Bill suffers a seizure and collapses to the ground. During the seizure, various memories of his infancy and childhood flash before him, including an encounter with someone on a beach. Bill is again taken to hospital, where he is frequently visited by his ex-girlfriend. Bill's new doctor questions him, revealing that Bill cannot remember basic information about his life, such as his address or what month it is. He also cannot remember the name of his ex-girlfriend. Bill has surgery, after which he is asked various questions and shown photographs that appear irregular or nonsensical.

Bill's doctor explains to his ex-girlfriend that Bill is having trouble understanding past-tense and present-tense, and it is implied that many of Bill's childhood memories and family history could have been confabulated. Bill is allowed to go home for family care, but when he arrives home, no one is there to take care of him. Bill starts to repeat and then forget various tasks, such as buying food and taking walks, and does not seem to understand that he is ill. Bill's doctor explains that he doesn't have long to live.

Bill's outlook on life starkly changes; he marvels at the night sky and notices details of insignificant objects that amaze him. This change is complemented by a change in the film's animation: full-color photography is merged into the scenery. Bill rents a car and drives into the night, blindly following his instincts without knowing where he will end up. Arriving at a house, the Narrator reveals that it is in fact Bill's childhood home. Bill's uncle, who may have followed him, gives him an address to where Bill can find his real father, who Bill has not seen since childhood.

Going to a nursing home, Bill finds his father chair bound; neither of them remember who the other is or why they are there. When Bill leaves, he tells his father that he is forgiven, causing Bill's father to cry. The Narrator explains that they will never see each other again. Bill continues driving on, more frenzied now, and stops in a forest. He lies down underneath a tree, and the Narrator states, "It's such a beautiful day." The screen cuts to black.

The Narrator, breaking character, realizes that Bill may die there and stubbornly refuses to believe that he will. Bill is then shown walking away from the forest. The Narrator explains that Bill has become immortal and travels the world, learning everything there is to know, yet death remains a complete mystery to him. Bill outlives the human race, surpassing the next inhabitants of the Earth who revere him as a god. He continues living until the Earth is destroyed by the Sun, continuing even when that has gone as well. Floating in space, Bill observes the stars going out, until the screen cuts to black.

==Release==

The three chapters of the film were originally produced and released independently as animated short films, captured entirely on 35mm film with in-camera special effects.

The first installment, ''[[Everything Will Be OK]]'', was released in 2006 and won the 2007 [[Sundance Film Festival]] Grand Prize for Short Film. The second installment, ''[[I Am So Proud of You]]'' was released in 2008. The third and final chapter of the trilogy, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', shares the same name as the feature-length movie and was released in 2011 to similar acclaim, including the Audience Award from the Ottawa International Animation Festival.

In 2015, Hertzfeldt began a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Kickstarter]] for a [[Blu-Ray]] release consisting of both the feature version of ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'', as well as his 2015 short, ''[[World of Tomorrow (film)|World of Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref name=BlurayAV&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Danette|title=Get Involved, Internet: Fund a Blu-ray release of Don Hertzfeldt’s World Of Tomorrow|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/get-involved-internet-fund-blu-ray-release-don-her-222556|website=AVClub|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the campaign, backers had raised more than seven times the needed amount.&lt;ref name=BlurayAV/&gt;

==Critical response==
''It's Such a Beautiful Day''  received wide acclaim from film critics. On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds [[list of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|an approval rating of 100%]] based on 29 reviews, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 8.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A collection of three shorts by Don Hertzfeldt, ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' is an impossibly dense and affecting piece of animated art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Such a Beautiful Day (2012)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/its_such_a_beautiful_day|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film holds a score of 90/100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 7 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/its-such-a-beautiful-day-2012 |title=It's Such a Beautiful Day Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of the trilogy, Steven Pate of ''The Chicagoist'' wrote, "There is a moment in each installment of Don Hertzfeldt's masterful trilogy of animated shorts where you feel something in your chest. It's an unmistakably cardiac event, the kind that great art can elicit when something profound and undeniably true is conveyed about the human condition. That's when you say to yourself: are stick figures supposed to make me feel this way? In the hands of a master, yes. And Hertzfeldt is to stick figures what Franz Liszt was to planks of ebony and ivory and what Ted Williams was to a stick of white ash: someone so transcendentally expert that to describe what they do in literal terms is borderline demeaning."&lt;ref name="chicagoist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicagoist.com/2012/02/28/cult_animator_don_hertzfeldt_at_the.php|title=Don Hertzfeldt at the Music Box|work=Chicagoist|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=28 February 2012|last=Pate|first=Steven|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150819222030/http://chicagoist.com/2012/02/28/cult_animator_don_hertzfeldt_at_the.php|archivedate=19 August 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Los Angeles Film Critics Association named it their runner-up for Best Animated Feature Film of the year, behind ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''. Indiewire ranked Hertzfeldt the 9th best Film Director of the Year in its annual poll (tied with [[Wes Anderson]]), and film critics for ''The A.V. Club'' ranked the film #8 on their list of the Best Films of 2012. Slate Magazine named ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' their pick for Best Animated Feature Film of 2012.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In the United Kingdom, the film was ranked #3 on Time Out London's list of the 10 Best Films of 2013, and #4 on The London Film Review's list of the same. In 2014, ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' ranked ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' #16 on their list of the "100 Best Animated Movies Ever Made." Critic Tom Huddleston described it as "one of the great outsider artworks of the modern era, at once sympathetic and shocking, beautiful and horrifying, angry and hilarious, uplifting and almost unbearably sad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Huddleston|first1=Tom|title=The 100 best animated movies: the list|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/movies/100-best-animated-movies-list#tab_panel_9|website=Time Out|accessdate=19 August 2015|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, ''The Film Stage'' critics ranked the film #1 on their list of the "Best Animated Films of the 21st Century (So Far)."  &lt;ref name="filmstage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thefilmstage.com/features/the-50-best-animated-films-of-the-21st-century-thus-far/ |title=The 50 Best Animated Films of the 21st Century Thus Far}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, three critics polled by [[BBC]] as part of an international  poll ranked ''It's Such a Beautiful Day'' as one of the greatest films since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films-who-voted |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films: Who voted? |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|a type of series of books that contain case law}}
{{about|law reports in general|the law report published by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting|Law Reports}}
[[File:Unitedstatesreports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[United States Reports]], the official reporter of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]]]
'''{{lang-en-GB|Law reports|label=none}}''' or '''{{lang-en-US|reporters|label=none}}''' are series of books that contain [[Legal opinion|judicial opinions]] from a selection of [[case law]] decided by [[court]]s. When a particular judicial opinion is referenced, the law report series in which the opinion is printed will determine the [[case citation]] format.

In the United States, the term ''reporter'' was originally used to refer to the individual persons who actually compile, edit, and publish such opinions.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''A History of American Law'', 3rd ed. (New York: Touchstone, 2005), 241-242.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Reporter of Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States]] is the person authorized to publish the Court's cases in the bound volumes of the ''[[United States Reports]]''. In [[American English]], ''reporter'' also denotes the books themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Elias et al., ''Legal Research: How to Find &amp; Understand the Law'', 16th ed. (Berkeley: Nolo, 2012), 158.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Commonwealth English|Commonwealth]], these are described by the plural term '''law reports''', the title that usually appears on the covers of the periodical parts and the individual volumes.

In [[common law]] countries, court opinions are legally binding under the rule of ''{{lang|la|[[stare decisis]]}}'' ([[precedent]]). That rule requires a court to apply a legal principle that was set forth earlier by a court of a superior (sometimes, the same) jurisdiction dealing with a similar set of facts.  Thus, the regular publication of such opinions is important so that everyone—[[lawyer]]s, [[judge]]s, and laymen can all find out what the law is, as declared by judges.

==Official and unofficial case law reporting==
'''Official''' law reports or reporters are those authorized for publication by [[statute]] or other governmental ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |authorlink=http://www.law.harvard.edu/ 
 |title=Harvard Law School Library, ''One-L Dictionary'', definition for "Official Publications" 
 |url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/library/services/research/guides/united_states/basics/one_l_dictionary.php 
 |accessdate=2008-06-02 
 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430094404/http://www.law.harvard.edu/library/services/research/guides/united_states/basics/one_l_dictionary.php

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Governments designate law reports as official to provide an authoritative, consistent, and authentic statement of a jurisdiction's [[primary authority|primary law]]. Official case law publishing may be carried out by a government agency, or by a commercial entity. '''Unofficial''' law reports, on the other hand, are not officially sanctioned and are published as a commercial enterprise. In [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] (see below), official reports are called '''authorised''' reports - unofficial are referred to as '''unauthorised''' reports.

For the publishers of unofficial reports to maintain a [[competitive advantage]] over the official ones, unofficial reports usually provide helpful research aids (e.g., summaries, indexes), like the editorial enhancements used in the [[West American Digest System]]. Some commercial publishers also provide court opinions in [[Full text search|searchable]] [[online database]]s that are part of larger fee-based, online [[legal research]] systems, such as [[Westlaw]], [[Lexis-Nexis]] or Justis.

Unofficially published court opinions are also often published before the official opinions, so [[lawyer]]s and [[law journals]] must cite the unofficial report until the case comes out in the official report. But once a court opinion is officially published, [[case citation]] rules usually require a person to cite to the official reports.

==Contents of a good law report==
[[File:A headnote.png|thumb|300px|The headnote from the leading English case ''Wilkinson v. Downton'' [1897] 2 QB 57.]]
A good printed law report in traditional form usually contains the following items:
* The citation reference.
* The name of the case (usually the parties' names).
* Catchwords (for information retrieval purposes).
* The [[headnote]] (a brief summary of the case, the holding, and any significant case law considered). However, a headnote is not part of the decision rendered. Headnotes occasionally contain misinterpretations of the law in judgments of lower courts, and are not regarded as part of an official judgment or precedent. 
* A recital of the facts of the case (unless appearing in the judgment).
* A note of the arguments of counsel before the judge.  (This is often omitted in modern reports.)
* The judgment (a verbatim transcript of the words used by the judge to explain his or her reasoning).

==Open publication on the Internet==
The development of the [[Internet]] created the opportunity for courts to publish their decisions on [[Web site]]s.  This is a relatively low cost publication method compared to paper and makes court decisions more easily available to the public (particularly important in [[common law]] countries where court decisions are major [[sources of law]]). Because a court can post a decision on a Web site as soon as it is rendered, the need for a quickly printed case in an unofficial, commercial report becomes less crucial. However, the very ease of internet publication has raised new concerns about the ease with which internet-published decisions can be modified after publication, creating uncertainty about the validity of internet opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Liptak|first=Adam|date=May 24, 2014|title=Final Word on U.S. Law Isn't: Supreme Court Keeps Editing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/final-word-on-us-law-isnt-supreme-court-keeps-editing.html|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229124345/http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/25/us/final-word-on-us-law-isnt-supreme-court-keeps-editing.html|archivedate=February 29, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decisions of courts from all over the world can now be found through the [[WorldLII]] Web site, and the sites of its member organizations.  These projects have been strongly encouraged by the [[Free Access to Law Movement]].

Many [[law library|law librarians]] and academics have commented on the changing system of legal information delivery brought about by the rapid growth of the [[World Wide Web]]. [[Professor]] [[Bob Berring]] writes that the "primacy of the old paper sets &lt;nowiki&gt;[print law reports]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is fading, and a vortex of conflicting claims and products is spinning into place".&lt;ref name="Berring"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Berring |first=Bob |author-link=Bob Berring |title=Chaos, Cyberspace and Tradition: Legal Information Transmogrified |journal=Berkeley Technology Law Journal |volume=12 |pages=189 at 200–203 |date=Spring 1997 |url=http://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol12/12_1_Symposium/12-berkeley-tech-l-j-0189-0212.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911230011/http://btlj.org/data/articles2015/vol12/12_1_Symposium/12-berkeley-tech-l-j-0189-0212.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, [[Legal opinions|court decisions]] posted on the Web expand access to the [[law]] beyond the specialized [[law library]] collections used primarily by [[lawyers]] and [[judge]]s. The general public can more readily find court opinions online, whether posted on Web-accessible [[databases]] (such as the [[Judiciary of Hong Kong|Hong Kong Judiciary]] public access site, above), or through general Web [[search engines]].

Questions remain, however, on the need for a uniform and practical [[Case citation|citation format]] for cases posted on the Web (versus the standard volume and page number used for print law reports).&lt;ref name="Berring" /&gt; Furthermore, turning away from the traditional "official-commercial" print report model raises questions about the accuracy, authority, and reliability of case law found on the Web.&lt;ref name="Berring" /&gt; The answer to these questions will be determined, in large part, through changing government [[Knowledge policy|information policies]], and by the degree of influence exerted by commercial database providers on global legal [[information market]]s.

==Design and cultural references==
Reports usually come in the form of sturdy hardcover books with most of the design elements on the [[spine (book)|spine]] (the part that a lawyer would be most interested in when searching for a case).  The volume number is usually printed in large type to make it easy to spot.  [[Gold leaf]] is traditionally used on the spine for the name of the report and for some decorative lines and bars.

In lawyer [[portrait]]s and [[advertisement]]s, the rows of books visible behind the lawyer are usually reports.

==History and case reporting (by country)==

===Canada===
Each [[Provinces and territories of Canada#Provinces|province]] in [[Canada]] has an official reporter series that publishes [[Court system of Canada#Superior-level courts of the provinces and territories|superior court]] and [[Court system of Canada#Appellate courts of the provinces and territories|appellate court]] decisions of the respective province. The federal courts, such as the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]], [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]], and [[Tax Court of Canada|Tax Court]], each have their own reporter series. The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] has its own Reporter series, the [[Supreme Court Reports (Canada)|Supreme Court Reports]].

There are also general reporters, such as the long-running Dominion Law Reports, that publishes cases of national significance.

===United Kingdom===

====Supreme Court of the United Kingdom====
The [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court]] publishes on its own website the court's judgments after they have been handed down, together with the [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting|ICLR]] summary (or "headnote").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/index.html|title=Decided cases - The Supreme Court|first=The Supreme|last=Court|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624041108/https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/index.html|archivedate=2016-06-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====England and Wales====
[[File:English Reports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A few volumes of the English Reports at a [[law library]]]]
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], beginning with the reports of cases contained in the [[Year Books]] ([[Edward II of England|Edward II]] to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]) there are various sets of reports of cases decided in the higher English courts down to the present time. Until the nineteenth century, both the quality of early reports, and the extent to which the judge explained the facts of the case and his judgment, are highly variable, and the weight of the precedent may depend on the reputations of both the judge and the reporter. Such reports are now largely of academic interest, having been overtaken by statutes and later developments, but binding precedents can still be found, often most cogently expressed.&lt;ref&gt;* W. T. S. Daniel, ''History of the Origin of the Law Reports'' (London, 1884)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, the nonprofit [[Incorporated Council of Law Reporting]] (ICLR) for England and Wales was founded, and it has gradually become the dominant publisher of reports in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It has compiled most of the best available copies of pre-1866 cases into the ''[[English Reports]]''. Post-1865 cases are contained in the ICLR's own ''[[Law Reports]]''. Even today, the UK government does not publish an official report, but its courts have promulgated rules stating that the ICLR reports must be cited when available.&lt;ref&gt;[[Igor Judge, Baron Judge|Lord Judge]] [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|CJ]], ''Practice Direction (Citation of Authorities)'' [http://www.iclr.co.uk/learning-zone/practice-direction-citation-of-authorities-2012/ [2012&amp;#93; 1 WLR 780] [6].&lt;/ref&gt; Historical practice, which may still apply where no other report is available, permitted parties to rely on any report 'with the name of a barrister annexed to it.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacQueen QC|first=John Fraser (ed.)|date=12 June 1863|title=Speech of the [[Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury|Lord Chancellor]] on the revision of the law|page=9|location=London|publisher=W. Maxwell|quote=The reports are published without any judicial control or sanction, nor is there any provision to secure correctness or security against error, but as soon as a report is published of any case with the name of a barrister annexed to it the report is accredited, and may be cited as an authority before any tribunal.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====English maritime law=====
While maritime cases often have a contract or tort element and are reported in the standard volumes, the standard source for maritime cases is the Lloyd's Law Reports, which covers matters including [[maritime law|maritime matters]] such as [[carriage of goods by sea]], [[international trade law]], and [[admiralty law]].

====Scotland====
The [[Session Cases]] report cases heard in the Court of Session and [[Scotland|Scottish]] cases heard on appeal in the [[House of Lords]]. The [[Justiciary Cases]] report from the [[High Court of Justiciary]]. Those two series are the most authoritative and are cited in court in preference to other report series, such as the ''[[Scots Law Times]]'', which reports [[sheriff court]] and lands tribunal cases in addition to the higher courts. The law reports service of [[Scotland]] is supplemented by other reports such as the Scottish Civil Case Reports and Green's Weekly Digest.

===United States===
[[File:Pacific Reporter.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The ''[[Pacific Reporter]]'', a part of West's National Reporter System]]
In each [[U.S. state|state]] of the [[United States]], there are published reports of all cases decided by the courts having appellate jurisdiction going back to the date of their organization.  There are also complete reports of the cases decided in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] and the inferior [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] having [[appellate jurisdiction]] since their creation under the [[United States Constitution]].  The early reporters were unofficial as they were published solely by private entrepreneurs, but in the middle of the 19th century, the U.S. Supreme Court and many [[state supreme court]]s began publishing their own official reporters.

In the 1880s, the [[Thomson West|West Publishing Company]] started its [[National Reporter System]] (NRS), which is a family of regional reporters, each of which collects select state court opinions from a specific group of states.  The National Reporter System is now the dominant unofficial reporter system in the U.S., and some smaller states have discontinued their own official reporters and certified the appropriate West regional reporter as their official reporter.  West and its rival, [[LexisNexis]], both publish unofficial reporters of U.S. Supreme Court opinions.  West also publishes the [[West American Digest System]] to help lawyers find cases in its reporters.  West digests and reporters have always featured a "Key Numbering System" with a unique number for every conceivable legal topic.
[[File:State law reports.png|thumb|left|250px|Map of the U.S., showing areas covered by the Thomson West National Reporter System state law reports.]]

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] does not publish an official reporter for the federal courts at the circuit and district levels (the sole exception is the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]]).  However, just as the UK government uses the ICLR reporters by default, the U.S. courts use the unofficial West federal reporters for cases after 1880, which are the ''[[Federal Reporter]]'' (for courts of appeals) and the ''[[Federal Supplement]]'' (for district courts).  Both the ''Federal Reporter'' and the ''Federal Supplement'' are part of the NRS and include [[headnote]]s marked with West key numbers.  For cases prior to 1880, U.S. courts use ''[[Federal Cases]]''.  West's NRS also includes several unofficial state-specific reporters for large states like [[California]].  The NRS now numbers well over 10,000 volumes; therefore, only the largest law libraries maintain a full hard copy set in their on-site collections.

Some government agencies use (and require attorneys and agents practicing before them to cite to) certain unofficial reporters that specialize in the types of cases likely to be material to matters before the agency.  For example, for both patent and trademark practice, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] requires citation to the [[United States Patents Quarterly]] (USPQ).&lt;ref&gt;''Citation of authority'', [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxr_41_12.htm 37 C.F.R. § 42.12(a)(2)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713223357/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/appxr_41_12.htm |date=2007-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Citation of Decisions and Office Publications'', [http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/0700.htm#_T70505 Trademark Manual of Examination Procedures  § 705.05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324035310/http://tess2.uspto.gov/tmdb/tmep/0700.htm |date=2008-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, both Westlaw and LexisNexis also publish a variety of official and unofficial reporters covering the decisions of many federal and state administrative agencies which possess [[quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] powers. A recent trend in American states is for [[bar association]]s to join a [[consortium]] called [[Casemaker]]. Casemaker gives members of a state [[bar (law)|bar]] access to a computerized [[legal research]] system.

===Australia===
{{main list|List of Law Reports in Australia}}
[[File:Commonwealth Law Reports.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Volumes of the Commonwealth Law Reports]]
The [[Commonwealth Law Reports]] are the authorised reports of decision of the [[High Court of Australia]]. The [[Federal Court Reports]] are the authorised reports of decisions of the [[Federal Court of Australia]] (including the Full Court). Each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] has a series of authorised reports, e.g. the Victorian Reports, of decisions of the superior courts of the state or territory.

The [[Australian Law Reports]] are the largest series of unauthorised reports although there are several others general reports and reports relating to specific areas of the law, e.g. the Australian Torts Reports publish decisions from any state or federal court relating to [[Australian tort law|tort law]]. The [[NSW Law Reports]]  are published by the [[Council of Law Reporting for New South Wales]] and cover the [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]]. The [[Victorian Reports]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.victorianreports.com.au|title=Victorian Reports|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510100026/https://www.victorianreports.com.au/|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are published by Little William Bourke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.littlewilliam.com.au|title=Little William Bourke|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510095848/https://www.littlewilliam.com.au/|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the [[Council of Law Reporting in Victoria]] and cover the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]].

===New Zealand===
{{main|New Zealand Law Reports}}
The New Zealand Law Reports (NZLR) are the authorised reports of the [[New Zealand Council for Law Reporting]] and have been published continuously since 1883. The reports publish cases of significance from the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]], [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]] and [[Supreme Court of New Zealand]]. The reports, which were initially sorted by volume, are sorted by year. Three volumes per year are now published, with the number of volumes having increased over time from one, to two and now to three. The reports do not focus on any particular area of law, with subject specific reports filling this niche. There are approximately 20 privately published report series focusing on specialist areas of law. Some areas are covered by more than one report series - such as employment, tax and family law.

===Ireland===
Most Irish law reports are contained in ''The Irish Reports'' (IR), published by the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for Ireland. Other reports are contained in the ''Irish Law Reports Monthly'' (ILRM) and various online collections of court decisions.

===Bangladesh===

In Bangladesh, the law reports are published according to the provisions of the Law Reports Act, 1875. There are many law reports now in Bangladesh. The Law Messenger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmessenger-bd.simplesite.com/|title=Editorial Team, Judges Name &amp; Others|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170416125232/http://lawmessenger-bd.simplesite.com/|archivedate=2017-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an internationally standard law report which started publication in 2016. It is the first law journal in Bangladesh which specifically publishes law decisions of Supreme Court of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan only. Mainstream Law Reports (MLR)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlrbd.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154913/http://www.mlrbd.com/ |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most-cited law journal and it ranks among the country's most-cited law reviews of any kind. Published monthly, the MLR provides timely treatment of significant developments in law through articles contributed by judges, leading scholars and practitioners. Another popular law report is the Dhaka Law Reports, which started publication in 1948. Bangladesh Legal Decisions is published under the authority of the Bangladesh Bar Council. The other law reports include Bangladesh Law Chronicles, Law Guardian, Bangladesh Law Times.

The online law report in Bangladesh is Chancery Law Chronicles, which now publishes verdicts of Supreme Court of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clcbd.org|title=Chancery Law Chronicles - Online Database of Bangladesh Laws|first=S.M. Saidur|last=Rahman|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107025053/http://www.clcbd.org/ |archivedate=2010-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Supreme Court of Bangladesh was established in 1972, its online law report is Supreme Court Online Bulletin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov.bd/|title=Home : Supreme Court of Bangladesh|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221130931/http://supremecourt.gov.bd/|archivedate=2010-12-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it initially published a law report, containing the judgments, orders and decisions of the Court. The decisions of the lower judiciary were not reported in any law report.

===India===
[[File:isclr.jpg|right|220px|thumb|An issue of the ''Indian Supreme Court Law Reporter'']]
The Supreme Court Reports (SCR) is the official reporter for Supreme Court decisions. In addition, some private reporters have been authorised{{by whom|date=November 2017}} to publish the Court's decisions.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Pakistan===
Pakistan inherited a common law system upon independence from Great Britain in 1947, and thus its legal system relies heavily on law reports.

The most comprehensive law book is the "Pakistan Law Decisions" (PLD), which contains judgments from the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]], the various provincial High Courts, the Service, Professional and Election Tribunals as well as the superior courts of territories such as Azad Kashmir. PLD is augmented by other books, most notably the "Yearly Law Reports" (YLR), and the "Monthly Law Digest" (MLD).

The Supreme Court also has its own law book, the "Supreme Court Monthly Review" (SCMR), which lists more recent cases that the appex court heard.

In addition, there are books dealing with specific areas of law, such as the "Civil Law Cases" (CLC), which as the name suggests deals with Civil cases; the "Pakistan Criminal Law Journal" (PCrLJ), which reports Criminal Cases; and the "Pakistan Tax Decisions" (PTD), on the Income Tax tribunal cases and their appeals.

===Kenya===
Kenya's first output of law reports was in the form of volumes under the citation E.A.L.R (East African Law Reports). They were first published between 1897 and 1905. Seven of these volumes were compiled by the Hon Mr Justice R. W. Hamilton, who was then the Chief Justice of the Protectorate and the reports covered all courts of different jurisdictions.

The 1922-1956 period saw the emergence of some twenty-one volumes of the [[Kenya Law Reports]] (under the citation K.L.R). These reports included the decisions of the High Court only and were collated, compiled and edited by different puisne judges and magistrates.

Then came the period covering 1934 to 1956 which saw the birth of the famous Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa Law Reports (E.A.L.R). These reports comprised twenty-three volumes altogether which were also compiled by puisne judges and magistrates, a Registrar of the High Court and a Registrar of the [[Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa]]. These volumes reported the decisions of the then Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa and of the Privy Council. They covered only those appeals filed from the territories.

The East Africa Law Reports (cited as E.A.) were introduced in 1957 and were published in nineteen consecutive volumes until 1975. These reports covered decisions of the Court of Appeal for East Africa and the superior courts of the constituent territories, namely, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Aden, Seychelles and Somaliland. They were published under an editorial board consisting of the Chief Justices of the Territories and the presiding judge of the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa. Following the collapse of the East African Community, under whose auspices the reports were published, the reports went out of publication.

The period before the resumption of the East Africa Law Reports saw sporadic and transitory attempts at law reporting. Firstly, with the authority of the then Attorney-General, six volumes named the New Kenya Law Reports covering the period between and including the years 1976 to 1980 were published by the East African Publishing House Ltd. These reports included the decisions of the High Court and [[Court of Appeal of Kenya]] and were compiled by the Late Hon Mr Justice S. K. Sachdeva and were edited by Mr Paul H Niekirk and the Hon Mr Justice Richard Kuloba, a judge of the [[High Court of Kenya]]. The publication of these reports ceased when the publishing house folded them up ostensibly on account of lack of funds.

Later, two volumes of what were known as the Kenya Appeal Reports were published for the period 1982-1992 by Butterworths, a private entity, under the editorship of The Hon Chief Justice [[Allan Robin Winston Hancox|A.R.W. Hancox]] (hence the pseudonym “Hancox Reports”) who had the assistance of an editorial board of seven persons. These reports, as their name suggested, included only the decisions of the [[Court of Appeal of Kenya]] selected over that period.

Law reports relating to special topics have also been published. Ten volumes of the Court of Review Law Reports covering the period 1953 to 1962 and including the decisions on customary law by the African Court of Review were published by the Government Printer. There was no editorial board and it is not known who the compilers of these reports were. Their apocryphal origin notwithstanding, they were commonly cited by legal practitioners and scholars.

In 1994, the Kenyan Parliament passed the National Council for Law Reporting Act, 1994 and gave the Council the exclusive mandate of:
“publication of the reports to be known as the Kenya Law Reports which shall contain judgments, rulings and opinions of the superior courts of record and also undertake such other publications as in the opinion of the Council are reasonably related to or connected with the preparation and publication of the Kenya Law Reports” (section 3 of the Act).

The Kenya Law Reports are the official law reports of the Republic of Kenya which may be cited in proceedings in all courts of Kenya (section 21 of the Act).

===Hong Kong===
Cases of Hong Kong are predominantly published in the Hong Kong Law Reports and Digests (HKLRD), Hong Kong Cases (HKC), and the Hong Kong [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]] Reports (HKCFAR). Some specialist series are available including the Hong Kong Family Law Reports (HKFLR), Hong Kong Public Law Reports (HKPLR) and Conveyancing and Property Reports (CPR). [[Chinese languages|Chinese-language]] judgments are published in the Hong Kong Chinese Law Reports and Translation (HKCLRT). The Hong Kong Law Reports and Digests were published as the Hong Kong Law Reports (HKLR) until 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5808">'''Lucy Toulmin Smith''' (1838–1911) was an Anglo-American antiquarian and librarian, known for her first publication of the [[York Mystery Plays]] and other early works.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36151 |title= Smith, Lucy Toulmin (1838–1911), literary scholar and librarian |last=Porter |first=D. S. |year=2004 |work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Lucy Toulmin Smith was born at [[Boston]], Massachusetts, USA, on 21 November 1838, of English parents, [[Joshua Toulmin Smith]] and his wife Martha. Lucy was the eldest child of a family of three daughters and two sons. In 1842 the Toulmin Smiths returned to England and settled in [[Highgate]], Middlesex. She was educated at home, and went on to assist her father in editing his journal the ''Parliamentary Remembrancer'' (1857 – 65). After his death she completed his volume ''English Gilds'', adding her own introduction.&lt;ref name=orlando&gt;[http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=smitlu Cambridge Orlando article]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently she edited many other important early documents, in some cases also translating from the French. She was a close friend of [[Mary Kingsley]] and helped her in her literary work. She collaborated with many scholars of all nationalities, such as [[James Gairdner]]. She also contributed to the girls' magazine ''[[Atalanta (magazine)|Atalanta]]'', edited by [[L. T. Meade]], who was the wife of her brother Alfred.&lt;ref name = ODNB/&gt;

In 1893 [[Harris Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester College]] opened new buildings in [[Oxford]]. The library housed valuable collections of books, but had no librarian, until in September 1894 Lucy Toulmin Smith was appointed. In addition to the ordinary running of the library, she took pains to build up collections of special relevance to the college's nonconformist heritage. Thus she completed [[James Martineau]]'s set of the papers of the [[Metaphysical Society]] (1869 – 80). Likewise she built up almost complete runs of periodicals of interest to [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] as the annual reports of the [[British and Foreign Unitarian Association]], and the unitarian journal ''The Inquirer''. Meanwhile, her own scholarly work continued with numerous publications.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

She died in Oxford on 18 December 1911.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=orlando/&gt;

'''''Margaret's Museum''''' is a 1995 [[United Kingdom|British]]–[[Canada|Canadian]] dark drama film, directed by [[Mort Ransen]] and based on [[Sheldon Currie]]'s novel ''[[The Glace Bay Miners' Museum]]''.

==Plot==
Set in the 1940s in [[Cape Breton Island]], [[Nova Scotia]], it tells the story of a young girl living in a coal mining town where the death of men from accidents in "the pit" (the mines) has become almost routine. Margaret MacNeil ([[Helena Bonham Carter]]) has already lost her father and an older brother and for her, life alone would be preferable to marrying a mine worker—that is until the charming Neil Currie ([[Clive Russell]]) shows up. Against the wishes of her hard-bitten mother ([[Kate Nelligan]]) they marry, but before long financial woes lead to his doing what every other uneducated young man does in the town: take a job underground. His death in the mine, along with her younger brother, drives Margaret to a [[mental breakdown]] and in her surreal world she decides to create a "special" [[museum]] to the memories of all those who have died as a result of the horrific mining conditions.

== Cast ==
* [[Helena Bonham Carter]]: Margaret MacNeil
* [[Clive Russell]]: Neil Currie
* [[Craig Olejnik]]: Jimmy MacNeil
* [[Kate Nelligan]]: Catherine MacNeil
* [[Kenneth Welsh]]: Angus MacNeil
* [[Andrea Morris]]: Marilyn

==Production notes==
Part of ''Margaret's Museum'' was filmed in the UK. It carried significance in the local area of [[Newtongrange]], Scotland as the screen debut of local TV celebrity David MacBeath, who appeared as an extra in the film.

'''''Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum''''' (M.M.M.M.) is [[Tally Hall (band)|Tally Hall's]] debut studio album. Their previous recordings were all independently produced and distributed demos. All of the tracks on the album are fleshed-out, finished versions of their demo tracks, with the exception of "Haiku," which is a completely new song. The album gets its name from a [[Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum|museum of mechanized curiosities]] that is located in [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]].

The album was officially re-released on September 12, 2006 under the Quack! Media label.&lt;ref name=MTV.com&gt;Article about Tally Hall, including video clip of band's segment that was featured on MTV {{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/tally_hall/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529214300/http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/tally_hall/ |archivedate=2013-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This re-release coincided with additional publicity on [[MTV]], national distribution in all major retail stores, and various other TV appearances including ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]''.&lt;ref name=MTV.com /&gt; The music video for "Good Day" was first shown at Tally Hall's two Ann Arbor concerts, on September 23, 2006.

Tally Hall was later signed with [[Atlantic Records]] and was approved to go back and touch-up ''Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum'' at [[Stratosphere sound|Stratosphere Sound Recording Studios]] in NYC. The first single (Good Day) from the new version of M.M.M.M. was released February 26, 2008.  The new version of the album was released on April 1, 2008. This release also included a [[vinyl LP]] pressing of the album.

The '''Mosaic Fragment with Man Leading a Giraffe''' is a [[mosaic]] from the 5th century CE is now held in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The piece is [[Byzantine]] and originated in northern Syria or Lebanon. Mosaics of this type were commonly used to decorate wealthy family villas.

== Background ==


=== Creation ===
Mosaics have a long history throughout the Mediterranean and later elsewhere. The ''Mosaic Fragment with Man Leading a Giraffe'' at the Art Institute of Chicago originated in either [[Syria]] or [[Lebanon]]. This region is rich with mosaics, an art form which uses small pieces of glass, stone, or any other hard colored material, referred to as “[[tesserae]]," to create larger images made up of these pieces created with stone in mortar. Rather than being created by a single artist, mosaic compositions were often designed by a patron and executed by multiple artisans from a single “workshop.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ws5IAQAAIAAJ|title=Ancient mosaics|last=Ling|first=Roger|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|isbn=0691004048|location=|pages=|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|8}}

=== Development ===
The earliest known mosaics are from [[Mesopotamia]] and date to the 3rd millennium BCE, consisting of pieces of colored stones, shells, and ivory, and further examples of “paved” paths with stone and shells existed throughout Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Iran: Visual Arts: history of Iranian Tile, Iran Chamber Society, http://www.iranchamber.com/art/articles/tile_history1.php.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mosaics overall are most commonly found in places of wealth, such as the aforementioned palaces and temples. Later, during the [[Hellenistic]] period (323 BCE-31 BCE), the popularity of mosaics surged and they were found throughout personal villas from Africa to Britain. Many of the most famous mosaics are located in northern Africa and Syria, two of the richest [[provinces]] of the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;“Mosaic,” Ancient History Encyclopedia, http://www.ancient.eu/Mosaic/.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of these date from the 2nd to the 7th century CE, into which the piece at the Art Institute of Chicago fits well from the 5th century.

=== Function ===
Mosaics are found in the [[Levant]] after Roman tradition brought the style along with their control.  They were most commonly used to decorate floors due to their durability, and most mosaics discovered today are found in relatively intact condition, including the primary example here. Of course, these floors would have been durable without the presence of mosaic decoration, but the desire to enhance the appearance of spaces was paramount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|10}} Other pieces within the Roman provinces of the Levant which resemble the Art Institute mosaic are in an African style, such as that in [[Cilicia]], Turkey from the 3rd c. AD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|58}} Both of these styles resemble the ''Man Leading a Giraffe'' mosaic, alluding to a connection in location, influence, or both. Scenes of animals in mosaics throughout the Levant were common in the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Fradkin, Arlene. “Animal Figures in the Basilical Building Mosaics at Roman Sepphoris, Lower Galilee, Israel”. Near Eastern Archaeology 62.4 (1999): 233–239.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Syria Lebanon Locator.PNG|left|thumb|250x250px|Syria and Lebanon]]

=== Cultural Influence ===
The [[mosaic]] fragment was part of a much larger composition which covered the floor of a wealthy family [[villa]]. A related object from the same donor and region also specifies that the room within which the floor was located was likely semipublic, such as a reception or dining room.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Museum label, Mosaic Fragment with Man Leading a Giraffe, Chicago, Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; The text suggests that this image was once among several other examples of exotic animals, which [[giraffes]] were considered to be at that time since they were non-native to the [[Mediterranean]] region and were often only seen while being paraded around at public events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Giraffes were collected by Romans beginning with the first one being brought to [[Rome]] by [[Julius Caesar]] in 46 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, Natural History, VIII.69&lt;/ref&gt; Since the region in which this object originated had experienced Roman control prior to the making of the piece, this is a likely influence and possible reason for this particular image’s creation.

== Provenance ==
[[File:Art Institute of Chicago Front.jpg|thumb|280x280px|The Art Institute of Chicago]]
The ''Mosaic Fragment with Man Leading a Giraffe'' is a museum piece located in Gallery 153, the Ancient and Byzantine Gallery, at the Art Institute of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Institute of Chicago Annual Report 1993-4.&lt;/ref&gt; It is still in some ways used in its original intended way, aesthetic representation, but it has lost its function as a structural element. The piece is near the back corner of its gallery with like objects. Gallery 153 is arranged chronologically and so this work “belongs” in this location according to its place in time, and has an interactive iPad beside its display case to entice visitors to stop.

The work was a gift in 1993 from a Mrs. Robert B. Mayer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1989, just a few years before the accession of this particular piece, the donations of the Mayer family were discussed in an article in the ''Los Angeles Times''. Robert B. Mayer was a founding member of the [[Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art]] and a member of the purchasing committee for the Art Institute.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He and his wife Beatrice “Buddy” Mayer travelled the world, collect art. Mrs. Mayer worked with children in Israel, and this particular mosaic fragment may have come into the Mayers’ possession because they had fallen in love with mosaics from the Middle Eastern region.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Barbara. "A Private Audience with the Masters: Two Dickinsonians take care of Chicago’s art treasures." Dickinson Magazine, Winter 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Mayer died in 1974 and his collection of about 2,000 items was left to his wife . She established a program which actively loaned items from her private collection to colleges and museums, and she later sold several of the contemporary art pieces for millions of dollars.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Muchnic, Suzanne. “Two Major Chicago Art Collections on Christie’s Fall Sales Schedule.” Los Angeles Times, Sept 7, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Destruction ==
Due to the fact that many of these works survive into the present, they are available for the modern collector. While it is uncertain how this particular work was acquired and first sold, the fact that it is no longer attached to the structure it once belonged to means it was at some point removed. The removal of mosaics and other related art forms such as [[frescoes]] is extremely destructive. Because the works are permanently affixed to the structural elements they belong to, they must be cut away from their surfaces and broken into various pieces and would require extensive [[Art restoration|restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rose, “From Cyprus to Munich.” Archaeology (April 20, 1998). http://archive.archaeology.org/online/features/cyprus/.&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments then enter the art market permanently removed from their original context, often anonymously through art dealers.&lt;ref&gt;MacKenzie, Simon and Tess Davis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4728">[[Image:Ostromirovo.jpg|thumb|280px|The Ostromir Gospels, written in the [[Church Slavonic]] with many spellings reflecting the East Slavic recension, is famous for its brilliant miniatures. The opening of the [[Gospel of Saint John]], with his [[Evangelist portrait]].]]

The '''Ostromir Gospels''' (Russian: Остромирово Евангелие) is the oldest dated [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] book.  (Archeologists have dated the [[Novgorod Codex]], a wax writing tablet with excerpts from the Psalms, discovered in 2000, to an earlier time range, but unlike the Ostromir Gospels it does not contain an explicit date.).  The Ostromir Gospels was created by [[deacon]] Gregory for his patron, [[Posadnik]] [[Ostromir]] of [[Novgorod]], in 1056 or 1057 (the year 6564, in his dating system), probably as a gift for a monastery.

== The book ==

The book is an [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]] [[lectionary]] containing only feast-day and Sunday readings. It is written in a large [[uncial]] hand in two columns on 294 parchment sheets of the size 20 x 24&amp;nbsp;cm.  Each page contains eighteen lines.  The book is concluded by the scribe's notice about the circumstances of its creation.  

Three full page [[evangelist portrait]]s survive, by two different artists, and many pages have decorative elements.  The close resemblance between this and the equivalent pages in the [[Mstislav Lectionary]] suggests they are both based on a common prototype, now lost. The two artists who produced the evangelist portraits were both heavily influenced by Byzantine models, but the style of the portraits of Saints Mark and Luke seems to derive from Byzantine enamelled plaques rather than manuscripts.  

[[Image:OstromirGospel.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Ostromir Gospel]]
More early Russian manuscripts have survived from Novgorod, which was never occupied by the [[Mongol]]s, than any other centre.&lt;ref&gt;Popova, Olga, ''Russian Illuminated Manuscripts'', Thames &amp; Hudson, London (or Braziller NY), 1984, nos 1-5, &amp; pp 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later history==
It is thought that the book was taken from one of Novgorod monasteries to the personal collection of the Russian tsars in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], where it was first registered in 1701. [[Peter the Great]] ordered it to be taken to [[St. Petersburg]], where there was no mention of it until 1805, when it was discovered in the dressing room of the late [[Catherine the Great]].

The Gospels were deposited in the [[Imperial Public Library]] in [[St Petersburg]], where it remains. [[Alexander Vostokov]] was the first to study it in depth, demonstrating that the [[Church Slavonic]] of the manuscript reflects the [[Old East Slavic]] linguistic background of the scribe. The first facsimile edition was published under Vostokov's supervision in 1843. 

In 1932, the gem-studded book-cover induced a plumber to break into a case, remove and steal the binding, and hide the parchments behind a bookcase. Although the book was quickly recovered, no replacement binding has been provided to date.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4241">A '''Quick Start Guide''' or '''Quickstart guide (QSG)''' is in essence a shortened version of a [[User guide|manual]], meant to make a buyer familiar with his [[Product (business)|product]] as soon as possible.  This implies the use of a concise step based approach that allows the buyer to use a product without any delay, if necessary including the relevant steps needed for installation. A Quick Start Guide, or QSG for short, focuses on the most common instructions, often accompanying such instructions with easy-to-understand [[Illustration|illustrations]].&lt;ref name=”Tips”&gt; [http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2008/12/31/quick-reference-guide-formats-tips-for-finding-attractive-layouts/ "Quick Reference Guide Formats: Tips for Finding Attractive Layouts." Dec 31, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=”Sweet”&gt; [http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2009/04/10/quick-reference-guides-short-and-sweet-documentation/ "Quick Reference Guides: Short and Sweet Documentation." April 10, 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of a QSG can vary significantly from product to product and from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, it could be a single A4 sheet, a folded card or a booklet consisting of only a few pages.&lt;ref name=”Tips” /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Sweet” /&gt;
[[Image:Sample quick start guide (radio).jpg|thumb|link=https://www.manualise.com/en/examples-quick-start-guides/#example|250px|A sample quick start guide for a radio]]

==Background ==
Quick Start Guides are becoming more popular by the day, mainly because of the growing complexity of consumer products such as television sets, cell phones, cars and software applications. This growing complexity has led to manuals that are constantly growing in size, making them less attractive to read. &lt;ref name=”Sweet” /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Poetry”&gt; [http://www.idratherbewriting.com/2008/07/06/quick-reference-guides-the-poetry-of-technical-writing/ "Quick Reference Guides: The Poetry of Technical Writing." July 6, 2008.] &lt;/ref&gt;
A QSG should solve this problem: not only by focusing on the most basic instructions, but also by using visual information that is easy to understand. This approach should save time on the part of the user, giving him less stress while at the same time contributing to his self-confidence.&lt;ref name=”Sweet” /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Poetry” /&gt; As a result, users may conclude that using a product is not as difficult as they initially might have thought, hopefully leading to a growing willingness to tackle more complex tasks and, thus, exploring the product to the fullest of its extent.&lt;ref name=”Sweet” /&gt; 
==Relevance==
When [[Industrial design|designing]] a QSG, the most important question is how to filter out the most basic instructions that are the most useful to the average user.&lt;ref name=”Sweet” /&gt;&lt;ref name=”Poetry” /&gt; The answer to this question primarily depends on two things: the ability of the [[Technical writer|QSG writer]] to place himself in the shoes of the user and the product itself. As for the latter: a product that basically only needs some instructions to install it properly after which it functions continuously, is relatively easy to ‘capture’ in a QSG. Also, products that offer a broad variety of tasks of which in reality only a few really matter, lend themselves for a QSG.&lt;ref name=”Poetry” /&gt; An example of such a product would be a [[Application software|software application]]. If the main tasks in such an application would be not more than a handful, then a QSG on a double-sided card could be an effective solution. If tasks would become more complicated of nature, one can refer to the complete manual.

==Requirements==
The requirements for setting up a Quick Start Guide are not set in stone. It is up to the technical writer to become familiar with the mindset of the user, as well as with the character of the product. This being said, there is indeed a legal obligation, namely to refer to the complete manual (see the international IEC-82079 standard). Also, it is imperative to include [[Safety|instructions for safe use]] of the product in any QSG.

== History ==
The Rigler Deutsch Index was characterized as a cooperative, ground-breaking effort. Before its creation, sound recordings on the 78 rpm format were typically uncataloged and difficult to locate, as it was unclear where assets were held—although some collections were organized by label name, matrix number, etc.&lt;ref name=FontesArtisMusicae-MusicArchives-2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bucknum|first1=Mary Russell|title=Music Sound Archives in the United States|journal=Fontes Artis Musicae|date=October 2001|volume=48|issue=4|pages=381–390|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,cpid&amp;custid=nypl&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=9059826&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=1 June 2015|issn=0015-6191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rigler Deutsch Index was created by the Associated Audio Archivists Committee (AAA)&lt;ref name=ARSC-AAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Associated Audio Archivists (AAA) Committee (ARSC)|url=http://www.arsc-audio.org/committees/aaa-committee.html|website=[[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]]|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OperaNews-ARSCProfile-1996&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=David|title=Knights of the Grail:The Association for Recorded Sound Collections is Devoted to Safeguarding the Sounds of the Past|journal=[[Opera News]]|date=October 1996|volume=61|issue=4|pages=26–28|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=cookie,ip,url,cpid&amp;custid=nypl&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=9610242826&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=1 June 2015|issn=0030-3607}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]] (ARSC) in 1984.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-ResearchProjects-1988&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKee|first1=Elwood|title=ARSC/AAA, Fifteen Years of Cooperative Research|journal=ARSC Journal|publisher= [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]]|date=1988|volume=20|issue=1|pages=3–13|url=http://www.arsc-audio.org/journals/v20/v20n1p3-13.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAA Committee is made up of elected members from each of the participating institutions. This committee conducts large research projects that provide solutions that are critically needed within the library and archive world, like the Rigler Deutsch Index project.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-ResearchProjects-1988 /&gt;

As the institutions met to see if they had overlapping holdings—and cataloged records—the need for a shared solution became clear. Funding from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] was obtained to start a series of planning and organization meetings in October 1976. These meetings led to the publication of an initial planning study by the [[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]] that was conducted in 1978&lt;ref name=ARSC-ProjectStudy-1978&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowles|first1=Garrett H.|title=A union catalog of commercially issued pre-:LP" classical music and spoken word sound recordings : a planning study|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1011149|website=[[Stanford University]]|publisher=[[Association for Recorded Sound Collections]]|accessdate=1 June 2015|date=28 August 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[Yale University]]'s preliminary bibliography of journals that would be used in the project, also from 1978.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-YaleStudy-1978&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren Jr.|first1=Richard|title=A Preliminary Bibliography of Published Basic Source Materials and Guides to Dates of Recording for Pre-LP Classical Music and Spoken Word Sound Recordings|journal=ARSC Journal|date=1978|volume=10|issue=2/3|pages=163–166|url=http://www.arsc-audio.org/journals/v10/v10n2-3p163-166.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One outcome of this process was the creation of ''Rules for Archival Cataloging of Sound Recordings,'' as traditional cataloging methods did not meet all of the needs for recorded sound.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-ResearchProjects-1988 /&gt; Another was the publication of ''A Discotopology Primer,'' that was used to guide cataloging and classification of the project.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-DiscotopologyPrimer-&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eick|first1=Barbara|last2=Wolff Pritchard|first2=Gretchen|last3=Warren, Jr.|first3=Richard|title=A Discotopology Primer|journal=ARSC Journal|date=1981|volume=13|issue=1|pages=4–19|url=http://www.arsc-audio.org/journals/v13/v13n1p4-19.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding was made easier by the fact that the University of Maryland had received a Ford Foundation grant and had successfully completed a project for its [[International Piano Archives]], where they used an automated system to create microfilm and an index of its holdings.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-ResearchProjects-1988 /&gt;

Philanthropist [[Lloyd Rigler|Lloyd E. Rigler]] provided financial support&lt;ref name=NYTimes-Rigler-Obit-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Lloyd E.

Rigler became involved in the project out of an interest in creating a library of opera recordings. He had reached out to David Hall at what was then called New York Public Library's Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives, had learned of AAA's efforts, and agreed to provide matching funds for the Rigler Deutsch Index.&lt;ref name=ARSCJournal-ResearchProjects-1988 /&gt;

== Digitization ==
[[File:DiscImage06.jpg|thumbnail|right|Sample of original disc images]]
Efforts to digitize this resource as an asset available online were not initially successful.&lt;ref name=TechnicalServicesQuarterly-AudioColl-2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorimer|first1=Nancy|title=Unlocking Historical Audio Collections: Collaborative Cataloging and Batch Searching of 78 rpm Recordings|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07317131.2011.597682|journal=Technical Services Quarterly|date=January 2012|volume=29|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.1080/07317131.2011.597682}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial transfer of information to [[RLIN]] and then to [[OCLC]] resulted in a loss of bibliographic metadata and location information.

The original efforts involved taking two images of each side of the 78 rpm disc: one image was used to capture metadata from the disc label and the other image was used to capture the etched number (an alphanumeric string) that is found on 78 rpm discs. Information from these original images were then recorded and put on 16mm microfilm and/or microfiche in what is the current Rigler Deutsch Index. In total there were approximately 945 reels of 16mm film, representing 2.2 million disc images, that were put onto [[Microform#Cameras|COM (computer output microfilm)]]. Copies of this master set is held at the five repositories listed above.

=== Issues ===
While the information was successfully captured, the lack of context and training in cataloging recorded sound by those doing the input affected some data, so the Rigler–Deutsch Index is imperfect.&lt;ref name=Notes-RDI-1986 /&gt; The microfilm format is not very sharp and easy to read.

=== Potential solutions ===
Efforts are underway at [[Stanford University]] to provide pathways between the original capture, the Rigler Deutsch Index, and other available resources as well as [[OCLC]]'s databases in order to make the information available in a robust digital format.

The '''Sanamahi creation myth''' is the traditional creation myth of [[Sanamahism]], a religion of the [[Meitei people]] in [[Manipur]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Wakoklon Heelel Thilel Salai Amai Eelon Pukok PuYa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seven days of Creation==
After the creation of the Universe in which milky ways, stars, planets etc. are seen in it today, the Universal God Father, or Tingpalpa Mapu or Eepung Loinapa Apakpa (꯱') as the Kanglei Meetei call, began to think the creation of man, after creation of all living beings of the lower strata.

===Langmaiching, the first day===
The first day of the seven days week, the ancient Kanglei peoples called Langmaiching (Not Nongmaiching written since the days of Pamheiba Garivaniwaz in the 18th century A.D. The word/ concept Langmaiching was changed to Nongmaijing, a meaninglesss word to destroy the creation theory of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak). Langmaiching = Lang + mai + ching, ‘Lang’ here means a thing like a net catching, attracting things, ‘mai’ means human face, the front part of the Human Head, and ‘ching’ means ‘chingsinpa’ attracting. Therefore, Langmaiching means a point in vast Universe where the Universal God Father, attracting all elements composing the Human Body, started creating a man. This point of starting creation of man is the centre of the Human forehead, the ancient Kanglei Meetei call ‘Laipak’ means ‘God is clinging , God sticks permanently’. After the Universal God Father started the Human creation at the Laipak (forehead) of the Human body, he completely created the Human head, consisting the Head, the Hair, Forehead (Laipak) etc. of the Human Body. This is the first day of the week, Langmaiching (Sunday) of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak. Since the time of fully creating the Human head, the Universal God Father, the Tingpalpa Mapu or Eepung Loinapa Apakpa of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak stays at the Human forehead (Laipak) up to the death of the Human Being. This is why, the Kanglei Meetei Race call the Human body is a Laishang (temple) since the days of deep B.C.

===Ningthoukapa, the second day===
Ningthoukapa = Ning + thou + kapa, ‘Ning’ here means Ningpa, Khanpa of the Kanglei dialect, in English mind, thinking, ‘thou’ here means thoupa in Kanglei dialect and in  = English driving. Therefore, the Kanglei Meetei word/concept ‘Ningthou’ , King in English, means the God, the Universal GodFather. ‘kapa’ here means ascends, comes-up, in English. Therefore, the second day of the Kanglei peoples’ week, Ningthoukapa means the Universal God Father, who is the real Driver of Human mind, Human action, comes up (ascends) to the forehead (Laipak) of the Human body to stay there up to the death of the man.

===Leipakpokpa, the third day===
Leipakpokpa = Leipak + pokpa ‘Leipak’ actually means the Earth, but here means the Human body, ‘pokpa’ here means pokpa in the sense of Angang Pokpa, in English ‘giving birth’ as in the sense of child birth. The Kanglei Puya, the scripture of the Meetei Race calls the Human body as ‘Living Earth’. From this 3rd day of Kanglei peoples’ week, Leipakpokpa the Universal God Father who is residing in the Laipak (Forehead of the Human Body) begins to create the main human body part below the Head, from neck to other lower parts containing Heart, lungs, liver, kidney etc. This is the Third day of the Kanglei week, Leipakpokpa.

===Yumsakeisa/Imsakeisa, the fourth day===
Imsakeisa = Im + sa + keisa, here ‘Im’ means present word yum, meaning dwelling house, in English; ‘sa’ means sapa, meaning to build, to construct in English; ‘Keisa’ here means to build, to construct a Barn for storage of energy, elements composing of a human body to compensate the loss of these things in any eventuality of the Human Body. Why the 4th day of the week, Imsakeisa is so named? In the forehead (Laipak), the Universal God Father, Tingpalpla Mapu or Eepung Loinapa Apakpa, the first cause of   the Universe resides, whereas in the Human body in the Heart, the Taipang Palpa Mapu (Lord of the Earthly life, Jiba Atma of the Hindus) resides. In the forehead (Laipak), the Universal God Father in the symbol # (ONE), and in the Heart, the Universal God Father in the symbol W resides in the Human body. The human body as created by the God has certain things like Blood, Amino Acid etc. etc. So, the question of constructing a Barn arises in the Imsakeisa, the 4th day of the week.

===Sakonsen, the fifth day===
Sakonsen = Sa + kon + sen, ‘sa’ here means the animal body, here in the particular circumstances, the Human body; ‘kon’ means in Kanglei dialect ‘Konba’, Konbiba and in English to keep under care and protection; ‘sen’ means sennaba in Kanglei dialect and to keep under vigil of the Human body. On the 5th day of the week, Sakonsen the Universal God Father enters in the Heart of the Human Body to protect and to take care of the Human Body up to Death as Taipangpalpa Mapu (Lord of the Earthly life).

===Eelai, the sixth day===
Eelai = Ee + Lai, ‘Ee’ here means blood, Human blood; ‘Lai’ here means God, the Universal God Father. The Human blood is the Universal God Father, the Eepung Loinapa Himself When the Universal God Father comes to the Earth to create living beings for the first time, He comes in the symbol #(ONE), the dot ([) on the symbol # is called ‘Eelik’ means a drop of blood from His body, this Eelik ([), blood drop is the blood of every living beings on the Earth. This blood of the Universal God Father is put to the heart and to all parts of the human body, on Eelai (Friday).

===Thangcha, the seventh day===
Thangcha = Thang + cha, the ‘Thang’ here means in Kanglei Dialect Thangtharakpa, Pitharakpa, further means in English to send down, to drop down, etc.; the ‘cha’ here means Chata Nouta (the descendants), macha (the sons and daughters) of the Universal God Father. On this seventh day of the week of the Kangleicha Meetei Race, the Thangcha, the Universal God Father has completed the creation of a man and ready to send down on the Earth for further spread on the surface of the Earth.

==Constellation==
Corresponding to those seven days of the week of the Kanglei peoples, there is a constellation of seven stars in the sky, as described by the Puya, Wakoklon Heelel Thilel Salai Ama-ilon   Pukok which was written about 3500 years BP by the Kanglei Ancestors in Kangleipak: “8 ti Eenunglonna Thouwaimichak Apakpa Oipana Pu Ama Koukhale | Khununglonna Thouwaimichak pee malik sitapa Cheion Talet Haina Haikhale ||” Rough English translation of the above quotation: “The 8th , the group of stars forming a constellation (in the space), is known as Thouwaimichak Cheion Talet (Seven Stars which can became Human beings on the Earth.” In the above quotation, ‘Pu Ama’ , here ‘Pu’ means Grand Father, the oldest male person in a family is called ‘Pu’ , ‘Ama’ means one. Therefore, the seven stars group is a constellation, the group of the seven stars is known as “Thouwaimichak Cheion Talet” here Thouwaimichak (star in English) = Thou + wai + mi + chak, here ‘thou’ means to drive, ‘wai’ here means interaction between elements, ‘mi’ here means the God in the Human beings on the Laipak(forehead), and ‘chak’ here means Machak (elements forming the Human body). The concept of a ‘Thouwaimichak’ star is so complex in Kanglei Dialect. In the formation of a ‘Thouwaimichak’(a star), there are five elements Fire, Water, Air, Leipak (soil), Space. These five elements along with the ‘mi’ the God elements in the Human body. The five elements in the Human body is driven by the ‘mi’ to form a human body with mind and consciousness. This is the soul theory of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak. Soul consists of six elements according to the ancient Kangleipak, that is, Fire, Water, Air, Leipak (soil), Space and ‘mi’. The Meetei Race of Kangleipak has seven days of the week, since about 20,000 years B.P. as evidence by the Puya, the scripture of the Kanglei Meetei Peoples and Kangla Excavation 2009. The last day of the week is Thangcha’ On ‘Thangcha, the last day of the week, creation of Life ( a prototype of all living Beings) its completed and the God Father sent down to the Earth for further spread on the earth. The day of the week, the last day of the week, Thangcha is the day on which life was sent down by the Universal God Father to the Earth. The first Thangcha of the ‘Lamta Month’ the third month of the year is the first day on which the Life (from the Universal God Father) came to colonize the Malem (the Mother Earth) for the first time in the Life History of the Earth. ‘Cheion’ Cheion = Cha + i + on = here ‘cha’ means Descendants, ‘i’ means blood, ‘on’ means onba further means change into, ‘Talet’ means seven. Therefore, the seven stars forming the constellation (Pu Ama) consists of Everything, Every elements in them to become living beings (here Human beings). The human creation theory of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak is a theory of Extraterrestrial Origin of Life also. These seven days of the week of the Meetei Race of Kangleipak give birth of the 19 Kanglei Eeyeks including the cheising Eeyek Ama in the symbol # also. These seven days of the week are part and parcel of the Universal God Father, Ting Palpa Mapu Eepung Loinapa Apakpa, the Ancient Kanglei Forefathers said “The Kanglei Alphabets is the Universal God Father and Kanglei   Meetei Language is the mother."

== Koubru  , the first place for human habitation==
After  Godfather [[Eepung Loinapa Apakpa]] created humans under his guidance and makes people's settlement to the place where God's living place in Earth where there was many fruits,eatable can be found for living .

[[File:Vilhelm Pedersen, OLE LUKØJE, ubt.jpeg|thumb|[[Vilhelm Pedersen]] drew this representation of the Sandman for the fairytale "[[Ole Lukøje]]" (Mr. Sandman) by [[Hans Christian Andersen]].]]

The '''Sandman''' is a mythical character in Western and Northern European [[folklore]] who puts people to sleep and brings good dreams by sprinkling magical sand onto the eyes of people while they sleep at night, i.e. [[rheum]].

==Representation in traditional folklore==
The Sandman is a traditional character in many children's stories and books. In [[Scandinavian folklore]], he is said to sprinkle sand or dust on or into the eyes of the child at night to bring on sleep and dreams.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d93TAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA273&amp;lpg=PA273&amp;dq=Sandman+in+folklore&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7XEwEy2Rmk&amp;sig=czKaa5UN3_u5J_raaakRBLIeKFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg4pfP8ZnOAhXDVh4KHdNKCdM4MhDoAQgvMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Sandman%20in%20folklore&amp;f=false Walsh, William Shepard. "Sandman", ''Heroes and Heroines of Fiction, Classical Mediæval, Legendary'', J.B. Lippincott, 1915]&lt;/ref&gt; The grit or "sleep" ([[rheum]]) in one's eyes upon waking is the supposed result of the Sandman's work the previous night.

==Literature==
[[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] (1776–1822) a story in 1816 called ''[[The Sandman (short story)|Der Sandmann]]'', which showed how sinister such a character could be made. According to the protagonist's nurse, he threw sand in the eyes of children who wouldn't sleep, with the result of those eyes falling out and being collected by the Sandman, who then takes the eyes to his nest on the Moon and uses them to feed his children. The protagonist of the story grows to associate this nightmarish creature with the genuinely sinister figure of his father's associate, Coppelius. In Romanian folklore there is a similar character, Moș Ene (Ene the Elder).

[[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s 1841 folk tale ''[[Ole Lukøje]]'' introduced the Sandman, named Ole Lukøje, by relating dreams he gave to a young boy in a week through his magical technique of sprinkling dust in the eyes of the children. "Ole" is a Danish name and "Lukøje" means "close eye". Andersen wrote:
{{bq|1=There is nobody in the world who knows so many stories as Ole-Luk-Oie, or who can relate them so nicely. In the evening, while the children are seated at the table or in their little chairs, he comes up the stairs very softly, for he walks in his socks, then he opens the doors without the slightest noise, and throws a small quantity of very fine dust in their eyes, just enough to prevent them from keeping them open, and so they do not see him. Then he creeps behind them, and blows softly upon their necks, till their heads begin to droop. But Ole-Luk-Oie does not wish to hurt them, for he is very fond of children, and only wants them to be quiet that he may relate to them pretty stories, and they never are quiet until they are in bed and asleep. As soon as they are asleep, Ole-Luk-Oie seats himself upon the bed. He is nicely dressed; his coat is made of silken fabric; it is impossible to say of what color, for it changes from green to red, and from red to blue as he turns from side to side. Under each arm he carries an umbrella; one of them, with pictures on the inside, he spreads over the good children, and then they dream the most beautiful stories the whole night. But the other umbrella has no pictures, and this he holds over the naughty children so that they sleep heavily, and wake in the morning without having dreams at all.}}

In the Swedish translation he is called Jon or John Blund, and in Afrikaans, a language spoken in Southern Africa and related to Dutch, he is referred to as "Klaas Vakie".

'''Sir William Reynell Anson, 3rd Baronet''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|commas=on|PC|FBA|size=100%}} (14 November 1843 – 4 June 1914) was a British [[jurist]] and [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionist]] politician&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lundy |first=Darryl |url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p12336.htm |title= Rt. Hon. Sir William Reynell Anson, 3rd Bt. |publisher= The Peerage}}{{Unreliable source?|failed=y |date=September 2012}}&lt;!--Lundy is not a reliable source so cite Lundy's reliable source See [[WP:SAYWHEREYOUREADIT]]--&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Anson family]].

==Background and education==
Anson was born at [[Walberton]], [[West Sussex|Sussex]], the eldest son of Sir John William Hamilton Anson, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Elizabeth Catherine (née Pack). Educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], 1857–62,&lt;ref&gt;''National Dictionary of Biography, 1912-1921'', London : Oxford University Press, 1927, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Balliol College, Oxford]], 1862–66, he took a first class in both Classical Moderations, 1863, and Literae Humaniores ('Greats', a combination of philosophy and ancient history), 1866.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford University Calendar 1895'', Oxford : Clarendon Press, pp.177, 304.&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected to a [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowship]] of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls]] in the following year.

==Legal and political career==
In 1869, he was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]], and went on the home circuit until 1873, when he succeeded to the [[baronet]]cy. In 1874, he became Vinerian reader in [[English law]] at Oxford, a post attached to a Fellowship of All Souls College, which he held until he became, in 1881, [[Warden (college)|Warden]] of All Souls.&lt;ref name="vch"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Salter, H. E. |editor2=Lobel, Mary D. | title=A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3: The University of Oxford | publisher=[[Victoria County History]] | year=1954 | pages=173–193 | url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63880| chapter=All Souls College | accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anson identified himself both with local and university interests; he became an alderman of the city of [[Oxford]] in 1892, chairman of quarter sessions for the county in 1894, was [[Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University]] in 1898–1899, and Chancellor of the [[Diocese of Oxford]] in 1899. In that year he was returned, without opposition, as [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP)  for [[Oxford University (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford University]] in the [[Liberal Unionist]] interest, and consequently resigned the vice-chancellorship.

In Parliament, Anson preserved an active interest in education, being a member of the newly created consultative committee of the Board of Education in 1900, and in August 1902 he became the first [[Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Mr Balfour´s Ministry - full list of appointments |day_of_week=Saturday |date=9 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36842| }}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he held until 1905. He was made a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellor]] in 1911.

Anson took an active part in the foundation of a school of law at Oxford, and taught law to undergraduates of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], from 1886 to 1898.&lt;ref&gt;''National Dictionary of Biography, 1912-1921'', London : Oxford University Press, 1927, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; His volumes on ''The Principles of the English Law of Contract'' (1884, 11th ed. 1906), and on ''The Law and Custom of the Constitution'' in two parts, "The Parliament" and "The Crown" (1886–1892, 3rd ed. 1907, pt. 1 .vol. ii.), are standard works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alibris.co.uk/search/books/author/Anson,%20William%20Reynell,%20Sir Books by Sir William Reynell Anson], [[Alibris]].&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the [[honorary degree]] [[Legum Doctor|Doctor of Laws]] (LL.D.) from the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in February 1902, in connection with the 50th jubilee celebrations of the establishment of the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Saturday |date=1 March 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36704| }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Go Rin No Sho.gif|thumb|295px|right|''Go Rin no Sho'' [[calligraphy|calligraphed]] in [[Kanji]]. Musashi strove for as great a mastery in [[Japanese calligraphy]] as in swordsmanship.]]

{{Nihongo|'''''The Book of Five Rings'''''|五輪書|''Go Rin no Sho''}} is a text on [[kenjutsu]] and the [[martial art]]s in general, written by the Japanese swordsman [[Miyamoto Musashi]] around 1645.  There have been various translations made over the years, and it enjoys an audience considerably broader than only that of martial artists and people across [[East Asia]]: for instance, some foreign business leaders find its discussion of conflict and taking the advantage to be relevant to their work in a business context. The modern-day [[Hyoho Niten Ichi-ryu|Hyōhō Niten Ichi-ryū]] employs it as a manual of technique and philosophy.

Musashi establishes a "no-nonsense" theme throughout the text. For instance, he repeatedly remarks that technical flourishes are excessive, and contrasts worrying about such things with the principle that all technique is simply a method of cutting down one's opponent. He also continually makes the point that the understandings expressed in the book are important for combat on any scale, whether a one-on-one [[duel]] or a massive [[battle]]. Descriptions of principles are often followed by admonitions to "investigate this thoroughly" through practice rather than trying to learn them by merely reading.

[[Image:Musashi ts pic.jpg|thumb|right|[[Miyamoto Musashi]] in his prime, wielding two [[bokken]].]]

Musashi describes and advocates a two-sword fencing style ([[Kenjutsu#Nitōjutsu|nitōjutsu]]): that is, wielding both [[katana]] and [[wakizashi]], contrary to the more traditional method of wielding the katana two-handed.  However, he only explicitly describes wielding two swords in a section on fighting against many adversaries. The stories of his many duels rarely refer to Musashi himself wielding two swords, although, since they are mostly oral traditions, their details may be inaccurate.  Some suggest that Musashi's meaning was not so much wielding two swords "simultaneously", but rather acquiring the proficiency to (singly) wield either sword in either hand as the need arose.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} However, Musashi states within the volume that one should train with a long sword in each hand, thereby training the body and improving one's ability to use two blades simultaneously.

== The five books ==

[[Image:Kanjisenki.jpg|right]]

Although it is difficult to grasp it from the book, ''Go Rin No Sho'', these books are actually the teachings which Musashi preached to his students in his own [[dojo|dōjō]]. Though ideas are taken from other sources, the text is predominantly seminal.

The five "books" refer to the idea that there are different elements of battle, just as there are different physical elements in life, as described by [[Buddhism]], [[Shinto]], and other Eastern religions. The five books below are Musashi's descriptions of the exact methods or techniques which are described by such elements.

The term "Ichi School" is referred to in the book, ''Go Rin No Sho''. When referring to such books, it refers to "Niten No Ichi Ryu" or "Ni Ten Ichi Ryu", which literally translates to, "Two heaven, one school". Alternative translations include "Two Swords, One spirit", and "Two Swords, One Entity". The translation, "Two Swords, one Dragon" was thought to be a misinterpretation of the Kanji word ''Ryu''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

* The Book of Earth chapter serves as an introduction, and metaphorically discusses martial arts, leadership, and training as building a house.
* The Book of Water chapter describes Musashi's style, ''Ni-ten ichi-ryu'', or "Two Heavens, One Style".  It describes some basic technique and fundamental principles.
* The Book of Fire chapter refers to the heat of battle, and discusses matters such as different types of timing.
* The Book of Wind chapter is something of a pun, since the Japanese character can mean both "wind" and "style" (e.g., of martial arts).  It discusses what Musashi considers to be the failings of various contemporary schools of sword fighting.
* The Book of the Void chapter is a short epilogue, describing, in more esoteric terms, Musashi's probably [[Zen]]-influenced thoughts on consciousness and the correct mindset.

=== The Book of Earth&lt;ref&gt;''A Book of Five Rings'' by Miyamoto Musashi (translation from Japanese by Victor Harris), London: Allison and Busby, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; ===

The Earth book, according to ''Go Rin No Sho'', is mentioned as the book that refers expressly to the strategy taught by Musashi at the Ichi School. It is said to be how to distinguish the Way through "Sword-Fencing", or "Swordsmanship". The idea of strategy would be encouraged to be very astute in their study and strategy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things. As if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground ... These things cannot be explained in detail. From one thing, know ten thousand things. When you attain the Way of strategy there will not be one thing you cannot see. You must study hard.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon their mastery of the strategy and timing listed in the five books, Musashi states that you will be able to defeat ten men as easily as you could defeat one, and asks: "When you have reached this point, will it not mean that you are invincible?"

The strategies listed in this discipline or book relate to situations requiring different weapons and tactics, such as indoor weapons. Musashi states that the use of [[glaive]]-like [[naginata]] and [[spear]]s are purely for the field, whereas the longsword and accompanying short-sword can be used in most environments, such as on horseback or in fierce battle.

Musashi also remarks on the [[gun]] as having no equal on the battlefield, until swords clash, when it becomes useless. He does note that the gun had the disadvantage of being unable to see a bullet and adjust aim as one would with a bow. He writes, "The bow is tactically strong at the commencement of battle, especially battles on a moor, as it is possible to shoot quickly from among the spearmen. However, it is unsatisfactory in sieges, or when the enemy is more than forty yards away. For this reason there are nowadays few traditional schools of archery. There is little use for this kind of skill."

One of the principles of the Niten Ichi-ryū is that one should be versed in many weaponry skills. Musashi indicates that during battle you should not overuse one weapon—this is as bad as using the weapon poorly since it becomes easy for an enemy to find a weakness in your style after countless uses of the same weapon.

Timing, as explained by Musashi, is the core principle in strategy which is listed in the ''Earth Book''. The idea of timing as explained within the Earth book is that you must be able to adapt your strategy to timing with your skill, in that you must know when to attack and when not to attack.

In ''The Book of Five Rings'' he writes on timing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Timing is important in dancing and pipe or string music, for they are in rhythm only if timing is good. Timing and rhythm are also involved in the military arts, shooting bows and guns, and riding horses. In all skills and abilities there is timing.... There is timing in the whole life of the warrior, in his thriving and declining, in his harmony and discord. Similarly, there is timing in the Way of the merchant, in the rise and fall of capital. All things entail rising and falling timing. You must be able to discern this. In strategy there are various timing considerations. From the outset you must know the applicable timing and the inapplicable timing, and from among the large and small things and the fast and slow timings find the relevant timing, first seeing the distance timing and the background timing. This is the main thing in strategy. It is especially important to know the background timing, otherwise your strategy will become uncertain."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The Book of Water ===

The water book concerns [[strategy]], [[spirituality]] and philosophy. The meaning of ''water'' in relation to life is ''flexibility''. Water demonstrates natural flexibility as it changes to conform with the boundaries which contain it, seeking the most efficient and productive path. So also should one possess the ability to change in accordance with one’s own situation to easily shift between disciplines, methods, and options when presented with new information. A person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility.

The spiritual bearing in strategy, which Musashi writes about concerns your temperament and spirituality whilst in the midst of, or in formulation of a battle. Being a buddhist, most of what is written in the section concerning spirituality refers to principles of calmness, tranquility and spiritual balance;

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In strategy your spiritual bearing must not be any different from normal. Both in fighting and in everyday life you should be determined though calm.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This balance refers to what could be thought of as [[yin and yang]] within yourself. The over-familiarity or over-use of one weapon is discouraged by Musashi, as it would be seen to reveal your spirituality to your enemy. The idea is that a perfectly balanced spirit is also a perfectly balanced physical presence, and neither creates weakness nor reveals it to your enemy.

During battle, the spirituality and balance is something of which Musashi notes that you should take advantage. Since small people know the spirituality of big people, they can thus note differences and weaknesses between each other. This is something which seems easy, but it is said to change when you are on the battlefield, as then you must know to both adjust your spiritual balance according to what is around you, and to perceive the balance of those around you to take advantage accordingly.

Just as your spirit should be balanced, your various techniques be honed to a perfectly balanced demeanor. In terms of stance, much like balance within the trooper, Musashi notes that stance is an important part of strategy, or battle: ''Adopt a stance with the head erect, neither hanging down, nor looking up, nor twisted.'' This is part of what Musashi notes as ''[[wedging in]]''.

In regards to the gaze of someone, he notes that a person must be able to perceive that which is all around him without moving their eyeballs noticeably, which is said to be a skill which takes an enormous amount of practice to perfect. He notes that this is again one of the most important parts of strategy, as well as being able to see things which are close to you, such as the technique of an enemy. It is also used to perceive things far away, such as arriving troops or enemies, as that is the precursor to battle. You can then change your actions according to what you see.

==== Attitudes of swordsmanship ====

# Upper
# Middle
# Lower
# Right Side
# Left Side

The five attitudes of [[swordsmanship]] are referred to as the five classifications of areas for attack on the human body. These are areas which are noted for their advantages when striking at an enemy, and the strategist is said to think of them when in situations where, for any reason, you should not be able to strike them. Then his mind should adjust accordingly.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Your attitude should be large or small according to the situation. Upper, Lower and Middle attitudes are decisive. Left Side and Right Side attitudes are fluid. Left and Right attitudes should be used if there is an obstruction overhead or to one side. The decision to use Left or Right depends on the place.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As each is thought of as an attitude, it could be thought of that Musashi means to practice with each "attitude" so that you do not become over-reliant upon one, something which Musashi repeatedly notes as being worse than bad technique.

"No Attitude" refers to those strategists who do not go with the use of the "Five Attitudes" and prefer to simply go without the attitudes of the long sword to focus entirely on technique, as opposed to focusing on both technique and the five attitudes. This is similar to taking chances as opposed to making chances.

The attitude of "Existing - Non Existing", mixes the Five Attitudes with the Attitude of "No Attitude", meaning that the user of the longsword uses the techniques and principles of both at whichever moment he or she finds most opportune.

"In-One Timing" refers to the technique of biding your time until you can find a suitable gap in the enemies' defense, to which you will deliver one fatal blow to the enemy. Although this is said to be difficult, Musashi notes that masters of this technique are usually masters of the five attitudes because they must be perceptive of weaknesses. It is rumored that Musashi disgraced a former sword master by using such a technique with a [[Bokken]], but there are no descriptions mentioning "In one" timing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

"Abdomen Timing of Two" refers to [[feint]]ing an attack, then striking an enemy as they are retreating from the attack, hitting them in the abdomen with the correct timing of either two moves or two seconds. Although the technique seems relatively simple, Musashi lists this as one of the hardest techniques to time correctly.

"No Design, No Conception" refers to ''When word and actions are spontaneously the same''. Aside from this philosophical approach to the meaning, the technique is relatively simple to explain: if you are in a deadlock with the enemy, using the force from the cut, you push with your body and use the disciplines outlined in the ''Void Book'' to knock the enemy over.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''This is the most important method of hitting. It is often used. You must train hard to understand it.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"Flowing Water Cut" technique refers to if you come into a fight with an enemy of a similar level to you in swordsmanship. When attacking fast, Musashi notes that you will always be at stalemate, so like Stagnant water, you must cut as slowly as possible with your long sword. At the beginning of this technique you and your opponent will be searching for an opening within each other's defense. When your opponent either tries to push off your sword, or to hasten back as to disengage it, you must first expand your whole body and your mind. By moving your body first and then that of your sword, you will be able to strike powerfully and broadly with a movement that seems to reflect the natural flow of water. Ease and confidence will be attained when this technique is continuously practiced upon.

"Continuous Cut" refers to when you are again faced with stalemate within a duel, where your swords are clasped together. In one motion, when your sword springs away from theirs, Musashi says to use a continuous motion to slash their head, body, and legs.

"Fire and Stone's Cut" refers to when your swords clash together. Without raising your sword, you cut as strongly as possible. This means cutting quickly with hands, body, and legs.

"Red Leaves Cut" refers to knocking down the enemy's long sword in the spirit of the "No Design, No Conception" cut.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

=== The Book of Fire ===

The ''Fire Book'' refers to fighting methods unlike the specific fighting techniques listed in the ''Water Book''. It goes into a broader scope in terms of hints as to assess a situation, as well as specific situational instructions.

He notes obvious advantages of [[armor]] and preparedness before a duel or battle as it applies to one man or a whole group of men:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''As one man can defeat ten men, so can one thousand men defeat ten thousand. However, you can become a master of strategy by training alone with a sword, so that you can understand the enemy's stratagems, his strength and resources, and come to appreciate how to apply strategy to beat ten thousand enemies''.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The dependence of location according to the ''Go Rin No Sho'' is crucial. You must be in a place where man-made objects such as buildings, towers, castles, and such do not obstruct your view, as well as facing or standing in a position where the sun or moon does not affect your vision. This is purely so that your vision is focused on nothing but the enemy, and thus there is more concentration upon the enemy's stratagems. Musashi also seems to note the age old strategy of the [[High Ground]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''You must look down on the enemy, and take up your attitude on slightly higher places.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other kinds of tactics which of Musashi tells are way of ensuring that the enemy is at a disadvantage. Forcing yourself on the non-dominant side of a trooper is one way because the left side is difficult for a right-handed soldier. Other disadvantages, such as forcing enemies into footholds, swamps, ditches, and other difficult terrain, force the enemy to be uncertain of his situation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''These things cannot be clearly explained in words. You must research what is written here. In these three ways of forestalling, you must judge the situation. This does not mean that you always attack first; but if the enemy attacks first you can lead him around. In strategy, you have effectively won when you forestall the enemy, so you must train well to attain this.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Ken No Sen'' (Attacking) is the most obvious method of forestalling an enemy because a head-on collision forces both parties to a standstill. Although it is not mentioned, Musashi must have been well aware that this method would also be the most likely to have a higher death count than the others due to the sheer mass of enemies because more than one enemy could then attack a single soldier or trooper.

As the name suggests, ''Tai No Sen'' (Waiting for the Initiative) is invented for very opportunistic and decided battles between parties. The main idea being to feign weakness as to open a weak spot, or [[Achilles' heel]], in the opposing force, and then regrouping to exploit such a hole by attacking deep within the enemy's party. Although it is not mentioned, this would most likely be to kill the officer of the highest rank as an attempt to remove the tactical centre of a group of soldiers. A method particularly useful for Musashi or others, if attacking a general directly would signal the end of the battle upon his defeat.

Only a small amount of text is written about ''Tai Tai No Sen'' (Accompanying and Forestalling). Albeit very confusing, the idea of Tai Tai No Sen is circumventing an ambush or quick attack from the enemy by taking the initiative and attacking in full force. Musashi admits himself that this is a difficult thing to explain.

Although there are other methods, they are mostly situational methods relating to the crossing of rough terrain, and battling within such rough terrain. Although it spreads over two or more paragraphs, most information is common sense, relating to caution and avoidance of such situations.

The idea of timing, as with singular battles, is known as the most important part of attacking next to the skill of participants. However, the type of timing in this instance is somewhat different from the timing noted in ''The Ground Book'' since this variety of timing requires looking at the various physical factors which affect an enemy during battle, such as determining if strength is waning or rising within a group of troopers.

The idea of treading down the sword is a very simple technique. Squashing an enemy's attack before it starts by using a form of charging and then attacking under the veil of [[gunpowder]] smoke, and arrow fire, the initial attacks used when starting battles can be highly effective. Individually, it refers to attacking the enemy's sword, breaking it, removing it from play, and a technique of controlling it through direct blade on blade contact.

Just as Musashi mentions in his philosophical style, there is a cause for a collapse. As there is collapse within an enemy, such as waning in his numbers, Musashi notes that one must observe such events and use them to advantage.

He notes that an enemy's formation can fall if they lose rhythm. It was known that in such battles, drummers drummed a tune for their other fellow soldiers to march to; and, if the rhythm was lost, it led to a "collapse when their rhythm becomes deranged".

=== The Book of Wind ===

Whereas most of the information given in the previous books is useful in such a way that it could still be applicable today, this book is primarily concerned with the specific details about other strategies that existed at the time. The broader lesson from this book is that an important part of understanding your own way is to understand the way of your opponent as precisely as possible.

Musashi notes that although most schools have secret and ancient strategies, most forms are derivative of other martial arts. Their similarities and differences evolved through situational factors, such as indoor or outdoor dueling, and the style adapted to the school. He indicates that his appraisal may be one sided because the only school he had interest for was his own, and, in a way, he does not see parallels to his own creation and work. However, he still admits that without basic understanding of these alternate techniques, you will not be able to learn ''Ni Ten Ichi Ryu'', probably for reasons of finding the wrongs in other techniques, and righting them within yourself in ''Ni Ten Ichi Ryu''.

The main difference that Musashi notes between the Ichi School and other strategists and schools is that other schools do not teach the "broader" meaning of strategy. There is a strategy above sword-fencing: "Some of the world's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing, and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the body." The book has many paragraphs on the subject of other schools' techniques, and much of the text lists the ways that other schools do not conform to the ideals which he himself writes about in the ''Book of Five Rings'', such as footwork, sight, and over-reliance or over-familiarity with a weapon.

=== The Book of Void ===

Although short, the void book lists, philosophically, the nature of both human knowledge and other things. The void book expressly deals with "That which cannot be seen".

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"By knowing things that exist, you can know that which does not exist."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Book of Nothing'', according to Musashi, is the true meaning of the strategy of ''Ni Ten Ichi Ryu''. It seems very esoteric in nature because he emphasizes that you must learn to perceive that which you cannot understand or comprehend. He notes that in this Void, what can be comprehended are things which we do and see, such as the way of the warrior, martial arts, and ''Ni Ten Ichi Ryu''. At the same time, in the Void, things we do not do or see (which he calls ''Spirit'') are part of the information which we perceive on a conscious level, but with which we have no physical relationship. It is arguable whether Musashi is referring to religious spirituality or if he is actually explaining a way to live a life and to process thoughts.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the above quote, Musashi speaks of "virtue and no evil". This may mean "goodness and banishment of evil" or "purpose and non-existence of good and evil", and the exact meaning is open to debate.

Since Musashi is drawing upon classical Buddhist Five Element theory, Void in this case refers to Sunyata (in Pali), sometimes translated as "Emptiness," or "ether." Void, as such, is also empty of the sense of self (anatta), good and evil, wanting and non-wanting, and is the spiritual dynamic that forms the jumping off point to satori, enlightenment. Emptiness, and the establishing of the conditions that allow it to arise, is a common theme in Zen Buddhist meditation practice, which no doubt informed the perspective of the author.

== Philosophical methods ==

=== Crimson-Leaves Strike ===

With this method, you will cause your adversary's sword to drop through a strike from your sword, then bring yourself immediately back to a readiness to strike. This method is combined with 'The Strike of Nonthought', in which you will always strike with true force by swinging your sword toward the ground when your opponent's sword is about to drop.

=== Autumn Monkey's Body ===

With this method, you are to start off by assuming a posture in which you are not to use your hands. You are to think of getting your body close to your opponent before striking him. However, if you think of reaching out both of your hands, your body will remain distant. This is why you must always think of quickly getting your body close to the enemy. When you are distant, you will exchange blows of the sword, and it will be rather easy to move closer to your opponent ([[Thomas Cleary]] translates this technique as "Body of the Short-Armed Monkey".)

=== Blow Like a Spark from a Stone ===

If you are currently within a situation in which you and your opponent's [[sword]]s are to clash, you must strike extremely hard without raising your sword to any extent. This is ''The Blow Like a Spark from a Stone'' technique. If you are to perform this technique, you must first strike quickly with the three combined forces of your legs, your hands, and your body. This blow will be rather difficult to perform if you do not train at it frequently. If you diligently train yourself, you will be able to increase the overall force of the technique's impact.

=== Body of Lacquer and Paste ===

With this technique, one's objective is to get close to the opponent and stick to him. When one is to do this, one must first behave as though one had been strongly glued to him with one's feet, head, and body. It is generally known that during combat, most fighters will have a tendency to have their body hang back while their heads and feet are extended forward. One must attempt to paste one's body against the opponent's without leaving any area in which the bodies are not touching.

=== Chance-Opening Blow ===

When you first start off by striking, your opponent will try to parry by hitting or by blocking your sword. At this point in time, you need to completely equip yourself into the action of striking with your sword, and strike whenever you may see an opening, whether it may be the legs, arms, or head. Following the single way of the sword and performing a strike such as this is known as the Chance-Opening Blow. This technique will be useful at a moment while fighting, so it should be trained for, regularly.

=== Strike of Non-Thought ===

Your mind and body should be one with striking when you and your adversary are about to launch an attack. If this method is followed, your hand will attain movement through emptiness, with speed and power, without taking note of any point in which movement had begun.

"'''The Lazy Spinner'''" or "'''The Lazy Spinning Woman'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], tale number 128.  It is [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 1405.

==Synopsis==

A lazy woman did not like to spin and when she did, did not wind onto a reel, but left it on the [[bobbin]].  Her husband complained, and she said she needed a reel to do that, but when he went to cut one, she sneaked after and called out that whoever cut a reel would die. This put him off cutting it, but he still complained.  She then made some yarn and said it must be boiled. Then she put some [[tow]] in the pot instead and set her husband to watch.  After some time, he opened the pot, saw the tow, and thought he had ruined the yarn. From then on, the husband didn't dare complain.

The '''Wabash Alloys Locomotive''' is a [[GE Transportation Systems|GE]] 25-ton [[diesel-electric locomotive]] built in 1940-43. Little is known about its early life, but from around 1970, it worked at Wabash Alloys, a producer of aluminum alloys, at  [[Haskell, Arkansas]].

It eventually became surplus to the company's needs and they donated it to the [[Arkansas Railroad Museum]] at [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] on March 8, 2003.&lt;ref name="attw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ahpp" /&gt;

The 25-ton model was the smallest locomotive in the GE range in the 1940s and 50s.  It was designed for the small industrial user.  With {{convert|150|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|15000|lbf|kN|0|abbr=on}} of tractive effort, it could pull half a dozen loaded cars on the level.&lt;ref name=lc/&gt; Although the Arkansas nomination document asserts that "large [[Class I railroads]] would have used them for switching on light branch lines,"&lt;ref name="ahpp" /&gt; standard freight cars of the time were up to 70 tons (64t) gross weight, or 17.5 tons (16t) per axle, so there was little need for 12.5 ton (11t) per axle locomotives on railroads, even on light branch lines,&lt;ref name="ner" /&gt; but GE built hundreds of them for industrial users.&lt;ref name=2dsg/&gt;

It was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2007.

'''WikiCity Guides''' was an on-line publisher providing local content on places, events, and people which could be of interest to those associated with any of the 22,000 U.S. towns it covers.  It serves these communities much like a collection of city guides, yet as a wiki, any of its readers are allowed to contribute content. With nearly 13 million pages,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.WikiCity.com/wiki/Special:Statistics 13 million pages]&lt;/ref&gt; WikiCity Guides was ranked as the  [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_wikis largest wiki in the world] in terms of article count throughout much of 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_wikis largest wikis]&lt;/ref&gt; WikiCity Guides encourages, but does not require people to register to contribute.

==History==
WikiCity Guides began in 2009, and is led by Patrick Lazure and Rohit Keshwani. Each of the 22,154 towns follows a similar format, offering local news, a community calendar, free classified ads, a directory with links to most all local businesses, and local history. This project is also the first wiki to use [[Twitter]] as a tool to index content. WikiCity Guides was acquired by the [[Omaha World-Herald]] on October 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2009/10/28/omaha-world-herald-acquires-wikicity-local-wiki-network&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10423">A '''wildcard DNS record''' is a record in a [[DNS zone]] that will match requests for non-existent domain names. A wildcard DNS record is specified by using a "*" as the leftmost label (part) of a domain name, e.g. &lt;tt&gt;*.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;. The exact rules for when a wild card will match are specified in {{IETF RFC|1034}}, but the rules are neither intuitive nor clearly specified.  This has resulted in incompatible implementations and unexpected results when they are used.

==Definitions of DNS wildcards==
A wildcard DNS record in a [[zone file]] looks similar to this example:

 *.example.com.   3600 IN  MX 10 host1.example.com.

This wildcard DNS record will cause DNS lookups on domain names ending in &lt;tt&gt;example.com&lt;/tt&gt; that do not exist to have MX records synthesized for them. So, a lookup for the MX record for &lt;tt&gt;somerandomname.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; would return an MX record pointing to &lt;tt&gt;host1.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;.

Wildcards in the DNS are much more limited than other [[wildcard character]]s used in other computer systems.  Wildcard DNS records have a single "*" (asterisk) as the leftmost [[DNS label]], such as &lt;tt&gt;*.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;.  Asterisks at other places in the domain will not work as a wildcard, so neither &lt;tt&gt;*abc.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;abc.*.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; work as wildcard DNS records. Moreover, the wildcard is matched only when a domain does not exist, not just when there are no matching records of the type that has been queried for.  Even the definition of "does not exist" as defined in the search algorithm of {{IETF RFC|1034}} section 4.3.3 can result in the wildcard not matching cases that one might expect with other types of wildcards.

The original definition of how a DNS wildcard behaves is specified in {{IETF RFC|1034}} sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3, but only indirectly by certain steps in a search algorithm and as a result, the rules are neither intuitive nor clearly specified.  As a result, 20 years later, {{IETF RFC|4592}}, "The Role of Wildcards in the Domain Name System" was written to help clarify the rules.

To quote {{IETF RFC|1912}}, "A common mistake is thinking that a wildcard MX for a zone will apply to all hosts in the zone.  A wildcard MX will apply only to names in the zone which aren't listed in the DNS at all."  That is, if there is a wildcard MX for &lt;tt&gt;*.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;, and an A record (but no MX record) for &lt;tt&gt;www.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;, the correct response (as per {{IETF RFC|1034}}) to an MX request for &lt;tt&gt;www.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; is "no error, but no data"; this is in contrast to the possibly expected response of the MX record attached to &lt;tt&gt;*.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;.

==Example usages==
The following example is from {{IETF RFC|4592}} section 2.2.1 and is useful in clarifying how wildcards work. &lt;!-- Note: the IETF RFC copyright requires acknowledgements when extracting text from an RFC, do not remove this --&gt;

Say there is a [[DNS zone]] with the following resource records:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ORIGIN example.
example.                 3600 IN  SOA   &lt;SOA RDATA&gt;
example.                 3600     NS    ns.example.com.
example.                 3600     NS    ns.example.net.
*.example.               3600     TXT   "this is a wildcard"
*.example.               3600     MX    10 host1.example.
sub.*.example.           3600     TXT   "this is not a wildcard"
host1.example.           3600     A     192.0.2.1
_ssh.tcp.host1.example.  3600     SRV   &lt;SRV RDATA&gt;
_ssh.tcp.host2.example.  3600     SRV   &lt;SRV RDATA&gt;
subdel.example.          3600     NS    ns.example.com.
subdel.example.          3600     NS    ns.example.net.
&lt;/pre&gt;

A look at the domain names in a tree structure is helpful:

&lt;pre&gt;
example
├─ *
│  └─ sub
├─ host1
│  └─ tcp
│     └─ _ssh
├─ host2
│  └─ tcp
│     └─ _ssh
└─ subdel
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following responses would be synthesized from one of the wildcards in the zone:

{| class=wikitable
! Queried domain
! Queried RR type
! Results
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;host3.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| MX
| The answer will be a "host3.example. IN MX ..."
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;host3.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| A
| The answer will reflect "no error, but no data" because there is no "A" resource record (RR) set at &lt;tt&gt;*.example&lt;/tt&gt;.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;foo.bar.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| TXT
| The answer will be "foo.bar.example. IN TXT ..." because &lt;tt&gt;bar.example.&lt;/tt&gt; does not exist, but the wildcard does.
|}

The following responses would not be synthesized from any of the wildcards in the zone:

{| class=wikitable
! Queried domain
! Queried RR type
! Results
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;host1.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| MX
| No wild card will match because &lt;tt&gt;host1.example.&lt;/tt&gt; exists.  Instead you will get an answer of "no error, but no data". The wildcard MX record does not provide MX records for domains that otherwise exist.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;sub.*.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| MX
| No wild card will match because &lt;tt&gt;sub.*.example.&lt;/tt&gt; exists. The domain &lt;tt&gt;sub.*.example.&lt;/tt&gt; will never act as a wild card, even though it has an asterisk in it.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;_telnet.tcp.host1.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| SRV
| No wild card will match because &lt;tt&gt;tcp.host1.example.&lt;/tt&gt; exists (without data).
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;host.subdel.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| A
| No wild card will match because &lt;tt&gt;subdel.example.&lt;/tt&gt; exists and is a zone cut, putting &lt;tt&gt;host.subdel.example.&lt;/tt&gt; into a different [[DNS zone]].  Even if &lt;tt&gt;host.subdel.example.&lt;/tt&gt; does not exist in the other zone, a wild card will not be used from the parent zone.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;ghost.*.example.&lt;/tt&gt;
| MX
| No wild card will match because &lt;tt&gt;*.example.&lt;/tt&gt; exists, it is a wild card domain, but it still exists.
|}

The final example highlights one common misconception about wildcards.  A wildcard "blocks itself" in the sense that a wildcard does not match its own subdomains.  That is, &lt;tt&gt;*.example.&lt;/tt&gt;  does not match all names in the &lt;tt&gt;example.&lt;/tt&gt; zone; it fails to match the names below &lt;tt&gt;*.example.&lt;/tt&gt;. To cover names under &lt;tt&gt;*.example.&lt;/tt&gt;, another wildcard domain name is needed&amp;mdash;&lt;tt&gt;*.*.example.&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;mdash;which covers all but its own subdomains.

==In practice==
To quote from {{IETF RFC|4592}}, many DNS implementations diverge, in different ways, from the original definition of wildcards. Some of the variations include:

* With [[djbdns]], in addition to checking for wildcards at the current level, the server checks for wildcards in all enclosing superdomains, all of the way up to the root.{{Fact|date=May 2008|reason=I do not believe that djbdns will check outside the current zone.}} In the examples listed above, the query for &lt;tt&gt;_telnet._tcp.host1.example&lt;/tt&gt; for an MX record would match a wild card despite the domain &lt;tt&gt;_tcp.host1.example&lt;/tt&gt; existing.
* [[Microsoft DNS|Microsoft's DNS server]] (if configured to do so&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/regentry/46758.mspx?mfr=true Microsoft Corporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[MaraDNS]] (by default) have wildcards also match all requests for empty resource record sets; i.e., domain names for which there are no records ''of the desired type''.  In the examples listed above, the query for &lt;tt&gt;sub.*.example&lt;/tt&gt; for an MX record would match &lt;tt&gt;*.example&lt;/tt&gt;, despite &lt;tt&gt;sub.*.example&lt;/tt&gt; explicitly existing with only a [[TXT Record]].

=== Registrants ===
Wildcard domains are widely used by blogging websites that allow users to create sub-domains upon demand; e.g., sites such as [[WordPress]] or [[Blogspot]].  Another popular use is by Free [[Dynamic DNS]] websites that allow users to create a DNS name that changes to match their host IP as the IP address is changed periodically by their ISP's DHCP server.

=== New TLDs ===
New [[gTLD]]s are prohibited from publishing wildcards (or using equivalent name server mechanisms) by [https://newgtlds.icann.org/sites/default/files/agreements/agreement-approved-31jul17-en.html#_DV_M365 specification 6] of the [[ICANN]] New gTLD Base Registry agreement. However, ICANN's [https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2014-08-01-en Name Collision Occurrence Management Framework] [https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/name-collision-framework-30jul14-en.pdf (PDF]), explicitly requires new gTLDs to publish (for at least 90 days) special MX, SRV, TXT, and 127.0.53.53 A record wildcards that warn of potential name collisions due to use of relative domain names with [[Search domain|domain search paths]].

=== Registries/ISPs ===
Several [[domain name registrar]]s have, at various times, deployed wildcard records for the [[top-level domain]]s to provide a platform for advertising, most notably [[VeriSign]] for [[.com]] and [[.net]] with its (now removed) [[Site Finder]] system. The [[.museum]] TLD also had a wildcard record which has now been removed. {{As of|2018|03}}, top-level domains using a wildcard A record (other than 127.0.53.53) are [[.fm]], [[.la]], [[.ph]], [[.pw]], [[.vg]] and [[.ws]]. The [[Internationalized domain name|internationalized]] TLDs [[.中国]] (.xn--fiqs8s or .xn--fiqz9s for "China") and .გე (.xn--node for the [[Georgian scripts|Georgian]] letters for the Georgian country code "GE") also have wildcard A records. The &lt;code&gt;*.中国&lt;/code&gt; wildcard resolves to &lt;code&gt;ibaidu.com&lt;/code&gt; (flagged by Chrome as unsafe), and the  &lt;code&gt;*.გე&lt;/code&gt; wildcard resolves to a website of the [[.ge]] TLD.

It has also become common for ISPs to synthesize address records for typos, for the same person, a practice called [[Typosquatting#"Catchall" typosquatting|"catchall" typosquatting]], but these aren't true wild cards, but rather modified caching name servers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140521234605/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2008/04/when_monetizing_isp_traffic_go.html When Monetizing ISP Traffic Goes Horribly Wrong - Security Fix - From wayback machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ignoring wildcards from others===
The [[Internet Software Consortium]] produced a version of the [[BIND]] DNS software that can be configured to filter out wildcard DNS records from specific domains. Various developers have produced [[software patch]]es for [[BIND]] and for [[djbdns]].

Other DNS server programs have followed suit, providing the ability to ignore wildcard DNS records as configured.
