[[Image:Landscape in Sa Pa (Vietnam).jpg|320x320px|thumb|right|An example of advanced anthropization: the cultivation of [[rice]] in [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] in [[Vietnam]]]]

In [[geography]] and [[ecology]], '''anthropization''' is the conversion of open spaces, landscapes, and [[natural environment]]s by human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropic erosion is the process of human action degrading [[terrain]] and [[soil]].

An area may be classified as anthropized even though it looks natural, such as [[grassland]]s that have been [[Deforestation|deforested]] by humans. It can be difficult to determine how much a site has been anthropized in the case of [[urbanization]] because one must be able to estimate the state of the landscape before significant human action.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

== Cause ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
The earliest known stages of anthropization can be found as early as the Neolithic era and the basic farmland created in that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hypergeo.eu/spip.php?article312|title=Anthropization - Hypergéo|website=www.hypergeo.eu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
With the continually-growing population of humans, the land that the Earth provides has been appropriated over the years.  The ecological footprint created by anthropization is continually growing despite efficiency and technique improvements made in anthropization..

Whether anthropized or not, all land seldom a few [[Territorial claims in Antarctica|locations]] has been claimed.  Outside of the largely inhospitable [[Arctic Circle|Arctic]] and [[Antarctic Circle|Antarctic]] circles and large portions of other uninhabitable landscapes, much of the globe has been used or altered in some direct way by humans.  Land has been appropriated for many different reasons, but ultimately the outcome is typically a short-term benefit for humans.  An area is anthropized is some way to make land available for housing, to harvest the resources, to create space for some anthropological reason, or many other possibilities.

== Processes and effects ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Farm in Hainan 01.jpg|thumb|An example of land that has been appropriated for [[Horticulture|cultivation]] in [[Hainan]], [[China]].]]

=== Agriculture ===
The root of many early forms of civilization, [[agriculture]] has been a primary reason for anthropization. To cultivate food or breed animals, humans must alter land—till soil or build structures—to facilitate agriculture.  This can lead to [[soil erosion]] and [[pollution]] ([[pesticide]]s, [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, etc.), and subsequently [[habitat fragmentation]] and overall an increased [[ecological footprint]]. Agriculture and industry often overlap, and industry produces many of these effects too.

=== Urban development ===
Especially with approximately 7.5 Billion humans inhabiting the [[Earth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/|title=World Population Clock: 7.5 Billion People (2017) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; this typically aligns with an increase in residences worldwide.  Over the years, humans have built on land to meet their needs and wants. These actions range from small villages to massive factories, water parks, and apartments.  [[Urbanization]] and development of human residences can significantly affect the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Not only does the physical space of buildings fragment habitats and possibly endanger [[Endangered species|species]], but it fundamentally alters the habitat for any other living being.  For some species, this effect can be inconsequential, but for many this can have a dramatic impact.  The biosphere is very much interconnected, and this means that if one organism is affected, then as a result the other organisms within this ecosystem and food chain are also affected.  
[[File:Athabasca oil sands.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Athabasca oil sands|Athabasca]] oil sands are an example of anthropization as a result of the harvest and transport of a non-renewable resource, [[oil sands]].]]
As well, within the last century, any urbanized area requires roads for transportation.  This transportation is a continued source of pollution, and the roads can be a source of soil erosion.

=== Industry and technology ===
To support humans, industrial buildings and processes are apparently essential. Urban development and agriculture require that people produce, refined, or construct many things. Key to this is that factories require that people gather the materials they need to create a product. The wide range of products in this anthropological age use a plethora of substances that must be harvested or produced.  Many of these materials are [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable]] (e.g., fossil fuel, metal ores, etc.) and the harvest of these results in relatively permanent anthropization. For resources that depend on in high quantity, this can also mean temporary depletion or damage to the source of the resource (e.g., depletion or pollution of fresh water reserves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://puredrinkablewater.weebly.com/how-water-sources-are-being-depleted.html|title=How Water Sources are Being Depleted|website=PureDrinkableWater|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; improper or inefficient [[silviculture]], etc.).  Even sustainable or renewable industrial anthropization still affects the environment.  While the resource in question may not be in jeopardy, the harvest and processing can still change and damage the environment.

==== Science ====
Anthropization can also be a result of scientific endeavours.  This can manifest as construction of structures to aid in scientific discovery and observation.  This can range from structures such as [[Observatory|observatories]], or on the opposite scale the [[Large Hadron Collider]].  These and many other things are built and used to enhance knowledge of sciences. They do however require space and energy.

==== Energy ====
To power the ever-growing human race, energy is needed.  Power-harvesting structures are built to harness energy, such as dams, windmills, and nuclear reactors.  These sources of energy ultimately fuel the rest of anthropological activity and are essential in this way.  However many of these methods have consequences.  With dams, construction aside, they can cause flooding, habitat fragmentation, and other effects.  With nuclear reactors, they have a lasting effect in that typically a lifespan of one of these is around 50 years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nuclear-power-plant-aging-reactor-replacement-/|title=How Long Can a Nuclear Reactor Last?|last=Voosen|first=Paul|newspaper=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards the nuclear waste must be dealt with, and the structure itself must be shut down and cannot be used further.  To safely dispose of this even low-level waste can take hundreds of years, ranging upwards with increased radioactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. Tyler, David F. Hackett, and Carl Eric Wolfe. ''Living in the Environment''. 4th ed. Toronto: Nelson Education, 2017. 454-55. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  To produce and as a result of this production of energy, it requires a lot of anthropized land.

== Evolution of anthropization ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:All pyramids of Giza panorama 2.jpg|thumb|462x100px|An example of ancient anthropization; Giza pyramid complex, Egypt.]]

Changes in population directly effect anthropological impact—but changes in technology and knowledge have greatly changed anthropization throughout the [[Holocene]]. The tools and methods that humans use to anthropize have changed drastically.  For examples, the great [[pyramid]]s in [[Egypt]] were not constructed by some large machine, but instead by thousands of humans.  They were still able to build massive monuments, but the efficiency of their efforts and environmental damage is much different than today.  This shows that the environmental effect of modern anthropization is generally greater, not just because of the increase in population. Pollution and loss of [[biodiversity]] in Egypt was largely natural, not man-made, and anthropization existed on a much lower level.

As the human population of Earth increase, this anthropization will continue to evolve.

'''Archibald Knox''' (9 April 1864 in Cronkbourne&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/artists/aknox.htm Archibald Knox 1864-1933&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Tromode]], [[Isle of Man]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walshbrothers.co.uk/Update/Archibald_Knox.htm About Archibald Knox&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004339/http://www.walshbrothers.co.uk/Update/Archibald_Knox.htm |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 22 February 1933 in [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]), was a Manx designer of Scottish descent.  He is best known as being [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]]'s primary designer at the height of their success and influence upon UK and International design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archibaldknoxsociety.com/page_112136.html Chronology: Archibald Knox 1864-1933]&lt;/ref&gt; (to the extent that in Italy, Art Nouveau was known as Stile Liberty). Knox's pioneering and prolific work bridged the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], [[Celtic Revival]], [[Art Nouveau]], and [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecultureconcept.com/circle/archibald-knox-liberty-of-london-and-modernism/ Archibald Knox, Liberty of London &amp; Modernism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manxnationalheritage.im/news/celtic-style-exhibition-celebrates-150th-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-archibald-knox/ Celtic Style exhibition celebrates 150th anniversary of the birth of Archibald Knox]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox's hundreds of designs for Liberty made his style widely known,&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Tilbrook, The Designs of Archibald Knox for Liberty &amp; Co., 2000, p. 113, no. 95&lt;/ref&gt; (though not his name, as Liberty kept their designers anonymous). Most of his work for Liberty was for the [[Tudric]] (pewter) and Cymric (precious metals) ranges. The gravestone of Liberty's founder, [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]], was designed by Knox. 

His design talent covered a wide range of objects, ornamental and utilitarian, and included silver and [[pewter]] tea sets, jewellery, [[inkwell]]s, boxes, gravestones, watercolours, graphic designs, calligraphy, a house design, fonts and even [[bank cheques]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/art/artists/knox.xml?menu=artistlist Archibald Knox - Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185333/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/art/artists/knox.xml?menu=artistlist |date=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Family background==

Knox's father, William Knox, was living in [[Kilbirnie]] when he married Ann Carmichael from [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore Island]] in 1853. They had moved to the Isle Of Man in 1856 with their firstborn, Robert, where William "an exceptionally ingenious cabinet and machine-maker, joined Moore’s Tromode Works, makers of high quality herring nets and sailcloth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archibaldknoxsociety.com/page_112136.html Chronology: Archibald Knox 1864-1933&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; William's sister Margaret had been the first Knox to move to Man when she married a Manx fisherman, William Callister in 1856. William Knox later started his own firm "William Knox’s Engineering Works" and was joined in his enterprise by four of his sons - Archibald pursuing his own career in art. Besides running a successful steamboat and ferry business, the Knox family mechanised the local fishing fleet, were pioneers in industrial electric lighting on Man and introduced the first motor car to the island. Knox's engineering background may have influenced his design process in that his metalwork designs were produced in the style of ready-to-engineer blueprints.

==Education==

Archibald, the Knoxs' 5th child (and 5th son), started his schooling at St Barnabas Elementary School, and then attended [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] Grammar School. At the age of 16 in 1880 Knox enrolled at the newly-opened and innovative Douglas School of Art. The students there considered themselves 'venturesome modernists'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Tilbrook, Adrian J, 'Knox, The Early Years' in Stephen A Martin, Archibald Knox,, 2001 &lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Knox was awarded his Art Master's Certificate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; During his youth Knox developed a lifelong interest in [[Celtic art]], particularly the carved Celtic and Norse stone crosses on the Isle of Man which date from c.500AD to c.1200AD. In 1893 ''[[The Builder]]'' published Knox's article, 'Ancient Crosses in the Isle of Man'.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Archibald 'Ancient Crosses in the Isle of Man' in 'The Builder' 30 September 1896 pp. 243-246. (Includes sketches of the designs on Manx Crosses)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Knox starting teaching at Douglas School of Art in 1884, while still a student. In 1896 or 1897 Knox was working for / studying with the pioneering designer [[Christopher Dresser]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J Tilbrook, 'Influences and Designs', in Martin, S., 'Archibald Knox' (2001) p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 he started teaching at [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] School of Art where his friend A. J. Collister was principal, leaving with him for the [[Kingston University|Kingston School of Art]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="isle-of-man1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/artists/aknox.htm |title=Archibald Knox 1864-1933 |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |date=1933-02-22 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 Knox also began designing for the [[Silver Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Turner, 'Archibald Knox and the Silver Studio', in Martin, S., 'Archibald Knox' (2001) p.53 &lt;/ref&gt; Then, from 1900 to 1904 Knox returned to the Isle of Man, and produced over 400 designs directly for Liberty of London.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Tilbrook, The Designs of Archibald Knox for Liberty &amp; Co., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Then he returned to teach at [[Kingston University|Kingston Art School]] (and Wimbledon Art School 1906/7), again following his friend A. J. Collister.&lt;ref name="isle-of-man1"/&gt; 

Knox resigned from his post as Head of Design at Kingston School of Art in 1912 following criticism of his teaching. About twenty of his students also quit and set up the [[Knox Guild of Design and Crafts]]. Knox was the Master of the Guild and would return to Kingston to exhibit with them. In 1913 he spent a year in the United States, and on his return to Man acted as a censor of internees' letters during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knockaloe.org.uk/archibald-knox |title=Archibald Knox (1864-1933) &amp;#124; Knockaloe Virtual Museum and Archive |publisher=Knockaloe.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, after the War, he again took up teaching art at some of the Isle of Man's schools until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archibald-knox.com/ |title=Archibald Knox Biography - Infos - Art Market |publisher=Archibald-knox.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox also produced a variety of design work on the Island for publications, illuminations, and gravestones.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Martin (Ed.), Archibald Knox, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox's great late work was an illuminated manuscript titled 'The Deer's Cry'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Stephen A. Martin (Ed.), Archibald Knox, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each page is a complex interlaced illumination of a line of the prayer known as 'The Deer's Cry' or '[[Saint Patrick's Breastplate]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youblisher.com/p/824262-The-Deer-s-Cry-by-Archibald-Knox/ |title=The Deer's Cry by Archibald Knox &amp;#124; PDF to Flipbook |publisher=Youblisher.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.magnoliabox.com/search?q=deer%27s+cry&amp;type=product |title=Deer's cry posters &amp;#124; Deer's cry prints |publisher=Magnoliabox.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style, imagery, and colouring of each page reflects the content of each line of the prayer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iompost.com/our-news/press-releases/-isle-of-man-stamps-and-coins-celebrate-the-150th-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-archibald-knox-with-a-set-of-ten-stamps/ |title=Archibald Knox |publisher=IoM Post |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles and teaching methods==

Knox told his students a large number of maxims that give an insight into his design principles. Perhaps the primary one was
“Aim at order, hope for beauty”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox the Person |url=http://www.archibaldknoxforum.com/knox-the-person/ |title=Archibald Knox &amp;#124; Knox the Person |publisher=Archibaldknoxforum.com |date=2017-12-12 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox wrote on the blackboard for new students, “Never be ordinary, better be nothing than that”. Another maxim was, “Art is in everything if we choose to put it there”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox the Person |url=http://www.archibaldknoxforum.com/knox-the-person/ |title=Archibald Knox &amp;#124; Knox the Person |publisher=Archibaldknoxforum.com |date=2017-12-12 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Knox wrote to a student “Don’t slacken in your work: work and think – think and work: that is the royal road: there is no other through the forest of art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox the Person |url=http://www.archibaldknoxforum.com/knox-the-person/ |title=Archibald Knox &amp;#124; Knox the Person |publisher=Archibaldknoxforum.com |date=2017-12-12 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox had an innovate method of teaching art: he collected a set of three thousand glass slides, of examples of design work, to show his students. While showing these he encouraged the students to consider the design principles involved in each, and whether the design met the functional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary D.Wren 'New Light From Old Records - Archibald Knox's approach to his work', in Martin, S. (ed) (2001) 'Archibald Knox', Artmedia, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and commemoration==
[[File:The grave of Archibald Knox - geograph.org.uk - 92103.jpg|thumb|The grave of Archibald Knox in New Kirk Braddan cemetery]]
Knox died of heart failure in 1933 and was buried in [[Braddan]] Cemetery. His epitaph reads "Archibald Knox. Artist. A humble servant of God in the ministry of the beautiful".

Cadran Cottage, Ballanard Road in Douglas, remodelled c.1910 with design by Knox, was listed as a [[Isle of Man's Registered Buildings|Registered Building of the Isle of Man]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.im/media/632285/0500166regbldcadrancottage.pdf |title=Registered Building No. 166 / Cadran Cottage, Ballanard Road, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Cadran means quadrant on a sundial.

The first international touring exhibition of Knox's work was in 1996-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Martin,S.(2001)'Archibald Knox' Artmedia, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archibald Knox Society was founded in 2006. The aim of the Society is the education of the public worldwide in relation to all matters concerning the legacy of Knox.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.connect2charity.im/archibald-knox-society ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end the Society has given lectures, (including an international tour), published journals and helped to organise exhibitions.

To celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Knox's birth, the [[Isle of Man Post Office]] issued a set of 10 stamps featuring his designs, released in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iompost.com/stamps-coins/collection/archibald-knox-celtic-style-celebrating-the-150th-anniversary-of-his-birth/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322001905/https://www.iompost.com/stamps-coins/collection/archibald-knox-celtic-style-celebrating-the-150th-anniversary-of-his-birth/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 March 2014 |title=Archibald Knox Celtic Style Celebrating the 150th Anniversary of his Birth |publisher=[[Isle of Man Post Office]] |accessdate=21 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, an exhibition exploring the work of Knox and his Celtic contemporaries ("Celtic Style") was held at the House of Manannan, Peel, Isle of Man. A commemorative concert was held at Peel Cathedral featuring newly composed harp music and also including Manx Gaelic choir music. An exhibition of Knox's work was held at the 42nd [[Olympia Art &amp; Antiques Fairs|Olympia International Art &amp; Antiques Fair]] in London in 2014.

'''Architectural Engineering''', also known as '''Building Engineering''' or '''Architecture Engineering''', is the application of [[engineering]] principles and [[technology]] to [[building design]] and [[construction]]. Definitions of an '''architectural engineer''' may refer to:
* An engineer in the [[structural engineering|structural]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction.
* A [[Professional engineer|licensed engineering professional]] in parts of the [[United States]].
*Architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings.

==Engineering for designer==

===Structural engineering===

{{Main|Structural engineering}}
Structural engineering involves the analysis and design of the built environment (buildings, bridges, equipment supports, towers and walls). Those concentrating on buildings are sometimes informally referred to as "building engineers". Structural engineers require expertise in [[strength of materials]], [[structural analysis]], and in predicting [[structural load]] such as from weight of the building, occupants and contents, and extreme events such as wind, rain, ice, and [[seismic design]] of structures which is referred to as [[earthquake engineering]]. Architectural Engineers sometimes incorporate structural as one aspect of their designs; the structural discipline when practiced as a specialty works closely with architects and other engineering specialists.

===Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing (MEP)===
{{Main|Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing}}
[[File:MEP Room Virginia Tech.JPG|thumb|right|200px|MEP room in a building]]

[[Mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]] engineers are specialists, commonly referred to as ([[Mechanical, Electrical and Plumbing]]) when engaged in the building design fields. Also known as "[[building services engineering]]" in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.cibse.org/Building-Services/What-s-so-special-about-Building-Services-Engineer/Building-Services-Engineers-Bring-Buildings-to-Lif|website =  Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers|title = Building Services Engineers Bring Buildings to Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanical engineers often design and oversee the [[heating, ventilation and air conditioning]] (HVAC), [[plumbing]] and [[rain gutter]] systems. Plumbing designers often include design specifications for simple [[active fire protection]] systems, but for more complicated projects, [[fire protection engineering|fire protection engineers]] are often separately retained. Electrical engineers are responsible for the building's [[power distribution]], [[telecommunication]], [[fire alarm]], signalization, [[lightning protection]] and [[control systems]], as well as [[Architectural lighting design|lighting systems]].

==The architectural engineer (PE) in the United States==
{{Main|Architectural engineer (PE)}}
In many jurisdictions of the United States, the architectural engineer is a [[Professional engineer|licensed]] engineering professional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncees.org/Licensure.php |title=Licensure |publisher=NCEES |date= |accessdate=2013-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101230715/https://ncees.org/Licensure.php |archivedate=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually a graduate of an architectural engineering university program preparing students to perform whole-building design in competition with architect-engineer teams; or for practice in one of structural, mechanical or electrical fields of building design, but with an appreciation of integrated architectural requirements. 

Formal architectural engineering education, following the engineering model of earlier disciplines, developed in the late 19th century, and became widespread in the United States by the mid-20th century.  With the establishment of a specific "architectural engineering" [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]]ing registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003, architectural engineering became recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States. 

In most license-regulated jurisdictions, architectural engineers are not entitled to practice architecture unless they are also licensed as architects, and may be restricted from the practice of structural engineering on specific types of higher importance buildings such as hospitals.  Regulations and customary practice vary widely by region or city.

==The architect as architectural engineer{{anchor|Architect}}==
{{See also|Architect#Professional requirements}}
In some countries, the practice of architecture includes planning, designing and overseeing the building's construction, and architecture, as a [[profession]] providing [[architect#Architects in practice|architectural services]], is referred to as "architectural engineering". In Japan, a "first-class architect" plays the dual role of architect and building engineer, although the services of a licensed "structural design first-class architect" are required for buildings over a certain scale.&lt;ref name=JapanInfoCenter&gt;{{cite web|title=Architects / Building Engineers in Japan|url=http://www.jaeic.or.jp/k-pamphlet_e20130507.pdf|publisher=The Japan Architectural Education and Information Center|accessdate=2014-08-16|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some languages, such as [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]], "architect" is literally translated as "architectural engineer". In some countries, an "architectural engineer" (such as the ''ingegnere edile'' in Italy) is entitled to practice [[architecture]] and is often referred to as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://architectplan.download/ Architecture Plan (in English)]&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2018}} These individuals are often also structural engineers. In other countries, such as Germany, Austria, Iran, and most of the Arab countries, architecture graduates receive an engineering degree (''Dipl.-Ing. – Diplom-Ingenieur'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx German Chamber of Architects] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427191023/http://www.bak.de/site/498/default.aspx |date=April 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, an "architect" has a technical university education and legal powers to carry out building structure and facility projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boe.es/buscar/act.php?id=BOE-A-1999-21567 "Ley de Ordenación de la Edificación" (Building Management Act)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, architects and engineers used to share the same accreditation process (Conselho Federal de Engenheiros, Arquitetos e Agrônomos (CONFEA) – Federal Council of Engineering, Architecture and Agronomy). Now the Brazilian architects and urbanists have their own accreditation process (CAU – Architecture and Urbanism Council). Besides traditional architecture design training, Brazilian architecture courses also offer complementary training in engineering disciplines such as structural, electrical, hydraulic and mechanical engineering. After graduation, architects focus in architectural planning, yet they can be responsible to the whole building, when it concerns to small buildings (except in electric wiring, where the architect autonomy is limited to systems up to 30kVA, and it has to be done by an Electrical Engineer), applied to buildings, urban environment, built cultural heritage, landscape planning, interiorscape planning and regional planning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 Resolução 1010/05 – Conselho Federal de Engenharia, Arquitetura e Urbanismo – CONFEA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515160635/http://www.confea.org.br/cgi/cgilua.exe/sys/start.htm?sid=1196 |date=May 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2007-2010/2010/Lei/L12378.htm LEI nº 12.378, de 2010 – Presidência da República]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece licensed architectural engineers are graduates from architecture faculties that belong to the Polytechnic University,&lt;ref&gt;[[Polytechnic (Greece)]]&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining an "Engineering Diploma". They graduate after 5 years of studies and are fully entitled architects once they become members of the Technical Chamber of Greece (TEE – Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.tee.gr/ Technical Chamber of Greece (Τεχνικό Επιμελητήριο Ελλάδος)&lt;!-- Bot generated title (+ human editing) --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role |title=Role &amp; Objectives |publisher=Technical Chamber of Greece |archivedate=2011-08-14 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814025131/http://portal.tee.gr/portal/page/portal/INTER_RELATIONS/english/role }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Technical Chamber of Greece has more than 100,000 members encompassing all the engineering disciplines as well as architecture.
A prerequisite for being a member is to be licensed as a qualified engineer or architect and to be a graduate of an engineering and architecture schools of a Greek university, or of an equivalent school from abroad.
The Technical Chamber of Greece is the authorized body to provide work licenses to engineers of all disciplines as well as architects, graduated in Greece or abroad. The license is awarded after examinations. The examinations take place three to four times a year. The Engineering Diploma equals a master's degree in ECTS units (300) according to the Bologna Accords.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bologna Process#Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Further|Engineer's degree}}
The architectural, structural, mechanical and electrical engineering branches each have well established educational requirements that are usually fulfilled by completion of a university program.
[[File:Air handling unit.JPG|thumb|225px|An [[air handling unit]] is used for the heating and cooling of air in a central location (click on image for legend). Bringing together knowledge of [[acoustic engineering]] and [[HVAC]] is one example of the multi-disciplined nature of architectural engineering]]

===Architectural engineering as a single integrated field of study===
{{Main|Building engineering education}}

What differentiates architectural engineering from architecture (architect) as a separate and single, integrated field of study, compared to other engineering disciplines, is its multi-disciplinary engineering approach. Through training in and appreciation of architecture, the field seeks integration of building systems within its overall building design. Architectural engineering includes the design of building systems including [[HVAC|heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC)]], plumbing, [[fire protection]], [[electrical]], [[lighting]], [[architectural acoustics]], and structural systems. In some university programs, students are required to concentrate on one of the systems; in others, they can receive a generalist architectural or building engineering degree.

'''Astronomical ceiling decoration''' in its earliest form can be traced to the Tomb of [[Senenmut]]
(Theban tomb no. 353), located at the site of [[Deir el-Bahri]], Egypt. The tomb and the ceiling decorations date back to the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]] of [[ancient Egypt]] (ca. 1473 B.C.).

==Discovery==
The tomb of [[Senemut]] was discovered during the 1925-1927 excavations directed by [[Herbert Winlock]] for the Egyptian Expedition
of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;Isis, Vol. 14, No. 2  (Oct., 1930), pp. 301-325&lt;/ref&gt;

The unearthing of the 10x12&amp;nbsp;ft. chamber yielded the two panels of what is now referred to as the Egyptian Celestial Diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 34,  (1997), pp. 143-161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Celestial Diagram==
The [[wikt:Special:Search/celestial|Celestial]] Diagram consisted of a northern and a southern panel which depicted circumpolar constellations in the form of discs; each divided into 24 sections suggesting a 24-hour time period, lunar cycles, and sacred deities of Egypt. Of the constellations present on the diagram, the only certainly identifiable was Meskhetyu with the [[Big Dipper]] because of the difficulty that arises when an attempt is made to match modern day constellations with the depictions made thousands of years ago by the ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Clagett, Marshall 1995"&gt;Clagett, Marshall. Ancient Egyptian Science. Vol. 2. Philadelphia: American Philos. Soc., 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Some of the main figures and stars seen in the diagram are [[Sirius]], [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]], [[Ursa Major]], [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] (may be depicted as hippopotamus with crocodile on its back),
*The four circles on the top right refer to the four months of [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]] (inundation) between July and October
*The two circles at the top left and the two below them refer to the season of [[Season of the Emergence|Peret]] (planting season) between November and February
* The four circles on the right refer to the season of [[Season of the Harvest|Shomu]] (harvesting season) between March and June

The map on the southern panel could well reflect a specific conjunction of planets in 1534 BCE around the longitude of Sirius. The four planets Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and Venus are relatively easily recognizable. The planet Mars is not included in the actual grouping and at first sight seems to be missing in the map. However, one explanation is that Mars is represented in the Senenmut map as an empty boat in the west. This may refer to the fact that Mars was retrograde and was not with the other planets (indeed, being in the west in the 1534 BCE conjunction). The reason for the boat being empty is perhaps in this backward movement (a well known phenomenon to the Egyptians) the position of Mars was not considered to be ”concrete”.&lt;ref name="Novakovic, Bojan 2008"&gt;Novakovic, Bojan. Publications of the Astronomical Observatory of Belgrade, vol. 85, p. 19-23. http://publications.aob.rs/85/pdf/019-023.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation for the missing Mars is proposed by Belmonte,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
″...the astronomical ceiling of the tomb of Senenmut is a gigantic copy of a papyrus draft of a celestial diagram that would have existed and used to be represented in [[water clock|clepsydrae]] (water clocks, as that of Karnak). Because of the lack of space, when moving the design from a conical to a flat surface, part of the decoration was lost.″&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Belmonte, and M. Shaltout, [https://www.academia.edu/4993866/The_astronomical_ceiling_of_senenmut_a_dream_of_mystery_and_imagination ''The astronomical ceiling of Senenmut: a dream of mystery and imagination''], in ″Lights and shadows in cultural astronomy″ : proceedings of the SEAC 2005: Isili, Sardinia, 28 June to 3 July, edited by Mauro Peppino Zedda and Juan Antonio Belmonte. Published by Associazione Archeofila Sarda, Isili, Italy, 2007., 145-154.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Significance==
[[File:Senenmout-constellations.jpg|thumb|Constellations on the astronomical ceiling of [[Senemut]] Tomb]]
Although the tomb had been unfinished and had sustained damage throughout the centuries, the ceiling yielded new information about astronomy, chronology, mythology, and religion in Egypt because of the incorporation of all these elements as a means of connecting the divine to the mortal world.

[[Egyptian astronomy]] consisted of the identification of the heavenly bodies in the sky and their connection with the deities that were believed to play a role in religious mythology and practice.&lt;ref&gt;The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, Vol. 18, No. 12, Part 1 (Nov. 1923), pp. 283-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical ceilings bore significant symbolism for the Egyptians as they combined divine religion with more earthly aspects of daily life such as agriculture and labor. The detailed depiction of astronomy and deities illustrates the Egyptians desire to understand the heavens and the attempt to apply that understanding to the gods that they believed influenced all aspects of life.

The assimilation of these elements insured that the Egyptian calendar would differ from the ancient calendars of the [[Sumer]]ians and the [[Babylonians]]. Otto Neugebauer suggests that the complexity of Egyptian calendars:
:"represents the peaceful coexistence of different methods of defining time moments and time intervals in different ways on different occasions."&lt;ref&gt;Current Anthropology Vol. 14, No. 4 (Oct. 1973), pp. 389-449&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of astronomical calendars was not limited to ceiling tombs as they appeared on coffin boards, water boards, temples, and various other surfaces and objects.&lt;ref name="Clagett, Marshall 1995"/&gt;

The '''Bandim Health Project''' works with population based health research in one of the world's poorest countries, [[Guinea-Bissau]] in West Africa.

The core of the project is a health and [[Demography|demographic surveillance]] system which registers more than 100,000 people in six suburbs of the capital [[Bissau]]. Furthermore, 182 representative clusters of 100 women and their children are followed in the rural areas. Information on health, diseases, immunisations, breast-feeding, etc. is collected, primarily focusing on women and children. Admissions to the country's sole [[Pediatrics|pediatric ward]] in the capital are recorded.

The Bandim Health Project is member of the INDEPTH Network of health and demographic surveillance sites in Africa, Asia and Oceania.

==History==
The Bandim Health Project was initiated in 1978 by Peter Aaby. The project is currently based on collaboration between the [[Ministry of Health]] in Guinea-Bissau, [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark, and researchers affiliated to The [[University of Southern Denmark]], as well as the [[University of Aarhus]], Denmark.

In 2012, the Danish National Research Foundation funded the establishment of the Center of Excellence, The Research Center for Vitamins and Vaccines (CVIVA) based on the Bandim Health Project and its research into [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects of vaccines]].

==Fields of research==
The Bandim Health Project works with population based health research, focusing on women and children. The project's fields of research include:
* '''[[Vaccine]]s''', both their specific effects on the targeted diseases, and in particular their potential [[non-specific effect of vaccines|non-specific effects]] on [[incidence (epidemiology)|morbidity]] and [[death|mortality]].
* '''Other [[health intervention]]s''', including assessment of the total impact on mortality of new interventions or changes in existing policies.
* '''[[Infectious disease]]s''', e.g. [[measles]], [[diarrhoea]], [[rotavirus]], [[respiratory infection]]s, [[malaria]], HIV, [[HTLV]], and [[Tuberculosis]].
* '''Nutrition''', including [[micronutrient]]s such as [[vitamin A]] supplementation, and [[breast-feeding]].
* '''[[Humanitarian aid]].

==Important results==
One of the most important findings was that a new [[measles vaccine]] used in [[Developing country|low-income countries]] was associated with a two-fold increase in mortality among girls. This discovery led to the withdrawal of the vaccine.&lt;ref name=WHO92&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WHO|title=Expanded programme on immunization (EPI). Safety of high titre measles vaccines.|journal=Wkly Epidemiol Rec|volume=67|pages=1992|pmid=1449986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Had it not been withdrawn, it could have cost at least ½ million additional female deaths per year in Africa alone.&lt;ref&gt;Aaby, P., et al. "Differences in female-male mortality after high-titre measles vaccine and association with subsequent vaccination with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis and inactivated poliovirus: reanalysis of West African studies." Lancet 361.9376 (2003): 2183–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aaby, P. "Being wrong in the right direction?" Lancet 364.9438 (2004): 984.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The organization==
The Bandim Health Project is led by Peter Aaby. The National Research Coordinator is Amabelia Rodrigues. Since the project's foundation in 1978, more than 700 [[scientific article]]s have been published, and more than 40 PhD or [[doctoral degree]]s and 13 [[Master's degree|Masters]] of International Health degrees have been obtained by researchers employed by the project.

===Affiliations===
Bandim Health Project is placed in Guinea-Bissau and also has a small department at [[Statens Serum Institut]] in Denmark. Bandim Health Project is also affiliated with [[University of Southern Denmark]], where Peter Aaby is an [[adjunct professor]] and Christine Benn holds a professorship in Global Health.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3729">The '''Beau Geste hypothesis''' in animal behaviour is the [[hypothesis]] which tries to explain why some [[Bird|avian]] [[species]] have such elaborate [[Bird vocalization|song repertoires]], for the purpose of [[Territory (animal)|territorial defence]]. The hypothesis' name comes from the 1924 book ''[[Beau Geste]]'', and was first coined by [[John Krebs, Baron Krebs|John Krebs]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="krebs"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krebs|first1=John R.|title=The significance of song repertoires: The Beau Geste hypothesis|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=May 1977|volume=25|pages=475–478|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(77)90022-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0003347277900227?via%3Dihub|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

The Beau Geste hypothesis which was coined by Krebs in 1977 to explain why various avian species have such large song repertories.&lt;ref name="krebs" /&gt; The hypothesis discusses that avian species utilize such large song repertories for potentially a number of reasons such as for territorial defence and to test the competition within a new habitat.&lt;ref name="Searcy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Searcy|first1=W A|last2=Andersson|first2=M|title=Sexual Selection and the Evolution of Song|journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics|date=November 1986|volume=17|issue=1|pages=507–533|doi=10.1146/annurev.es.17.110186.002451|jstor=2097007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the hypothesis comes from the book which was originally published in 1924 "Beau Geste".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Wren, P.C (1924). ''Beau Geste''.&lt;/ref&gt; The book tells the story of three English brothers which all enlisted in the [[French Foreign Legion]] and ended up in a desert battle against a [[Tuareg]] army. They were greatly outnumbered, and in order to create the illusion that they had more men then they actually had, they took whatever dead soldiers they could find and propped them up along the walls of the fortress.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

== Non-avian species ==
There has been mention of this hypothesis in places such as research into [[amphibian]] vocalizations in the ''[[Boophis madagascariensis]]'', an [[endemic]] species of [[tree frog]] found in [[Madagascar]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;1Narins 2lewis 3McClelland, 1P.M 2E.R 3B.E (March 2018). "Hyperextended call note repertoire of the endemic Madagascar tree frog Boophis madagascarensis". ''the zoological society of London''. '''250''': 283–298.&lt;/ref&gt; where the Beau Geste hypothesis is used to give one explanation of why the species has such a large vocal repertoire. There has been some support for the theory in that the frogs use a wide variety of songs to give the illusion to invading frogs that the territory they are trying to enter is already full of competing frogs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Beau Geste hypothesis has also been found to explain vocalizations within some [[cricket]] species such as the [[Ephippiger|bush cricket]], where males use a wide variety of songs to access the amount of competition which is in a given area.&lt;ref name="rebar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rebar|first1=Darren|last2=Barbosa|first2=Flavia|last3=Greenfield|first3=Michael D.|title=Acoustic experience influences male and female pre- and postcopulatory behaviors in a bushcricket|journal=Behavioral Ecology|date=2016|volume=27|issue=2|pages=434–443|doi=10.1093/beheco/arv171|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/27/2/434/2196514|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When males are present in an area with a large number of other males their vocal repertories are much smaller than when in an area with only a few males.&lt;ref name="rebar" /&gt;

The Nutritional Immunology and Molecular Medicine Laboratory (NIMML) was founded in 2002 to investigate fundamental mechanisms of gut enteric immunity, and identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets for inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. The center has   discovered the mechanism of action underlying the anti-inflammatory actions of   [[Conjugated linoleic acid]] in inflammatory bowel disease,  and the insulin sensitizing and anti-inflammatory effects of [[abscisic acid]].  Its Center for Modeling Immunity to Enteric Pathogens  Program is applying high performance computing techniques to model and simulate human immunology systems and help immunologists conduct quick in silico experiments to narrow down experimental design, validate their hypotheses and save significant time and laboratory cost.  The NIMML is collaborating with the Center for Global Health at University of Virginia, the Department of Gastroenterology and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and other medical schools and leading several human clinical trials on safer therapies for inflammatory and immune mediated diseases. It has recently established a partnership with the Division of Gastroenterology at the Carilion Clinic to launch a joint translational research program in inflammatory bowel diseases.

The '''Columbia Water Center''' ('''CWC''') was established in January 2008 as a branch of the [[Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]]. The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including [[water scarcity]], access, quality and climate risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/articles/view/2125 |title=The Earth Institute Water |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's stated mission is to "creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization," by combining "the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/about-us/|title=Columbia Water Center: About Us |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing [[hydrologists]], [[climatologists]], [[environmental engineer]]s, and [[water policy]] analysts. The Director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2757  |title=The Earth Institute Profiles: Upmanu Lall |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Gentine, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2328/Website/Pierre_Gentines_Homepage/Lab.html|title=Gentine Lab website|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/05/11/earth-water-and-sky-a-conversation-with-pierre-gentine-a-new-columbia-water-center-scientist/|title=Earth, Water and Sky –A Conversation with Pierre Gentine, a new Columbia Water Center Scientist|date=11 May 2011|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|publisher=State of the planet|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus.&lt;ref name="research themes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/  |title=The Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==Background==
The Earth Institute, under the leadership of [[Jeff Sachs]], is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2021|title=PepsiCo Foundation announces major new grant to the Earth Institute at Columbia University to promote global water sustainability |publisher=[[Earth Institute]]|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[PepsiCo]] Foundation awarded the [[Earth Institute]] $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall.  This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|title=Our planet sustainability efforts and goals|publisher=PepsiCo|accessdate=5 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001095523/http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, CWC has partnered with the [[Federal University of Ceará]] in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors.  In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents.

As part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area.&lt;ref name="CWC Article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/June/20100528161751kjleinad0.6077082.html |title=Columbia Water Center at Work Across Globe |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better [[irrigation]] technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains.  A key objective is to reduce the [[overdrafting|groundwater stress]] in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Circleofblue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/qa-upmanu-lall-gives-insight-to-indias-nexus-of-energy-food-and-water?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=Circle of Blue Water News|author=J. Carl Ganter |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the CWC has partnered with [[Punjab Agricultural University]] to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive [[Tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometers]] to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/May/20100528153333kjleinad0.4795191.html?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers.&lt;ref name="tensiometer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/11/17/%E2%80%9Csmall-is-also-beautiful%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-appropriate-technology-cuts-rice-famers%E2%80%99-water-use-by-30-percent-in-punjab-india/?CP.rss=true |title=‘Small is Also Beautiful’ – Appropriate Technology Cuts Rice Famers’ Water Use by 30 Percent in Punjab, India |publisher=blogs.ei.columbia.edu |author=Lakis Polycarpou |date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform [[subsidies in India|electricity subsidies]] to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers.&lt;ref name="WaterWideWeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |title=Incentives for Water Conservation in Gujarat |publisher=WaterWideWeb.org |author=Eryn-Ashlei Bailey |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502164844/http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |archivedate=2011-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work in Mali coincides with the [[Millennium Villages Project]]. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available.  Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, [[market forces]] and [[public-private partnership]]s.

==Current Research ==

In recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ America's Water]===

The America’s Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems.&lt;ref name="America's Water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=America's water |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piscesfoundation.org/partnering-with-academia-to-address-u-s-water-challenges/|title=Partnering with Academia to Address U.S. Water Challenges|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2017|last=Stoner|first=Nancy|publisher=Pisces Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/03/19/waking-up-to-americas-water-challenges/|title=Waking up to America’s Water Challenges|date=19 March 2015|publisher=State of the Planet|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ The Global Floods Initiative]===

The Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving  climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods.&lt;ref name="Global Floods Initiative 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Global floods initiative |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky" /&gt;

The initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El-Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions]===

The Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers.&lt;ref name="Data Analytics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Data analytics and multi-scale predictions |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/5115-2/|title=Predictions, Surface Energy, Plants: Understanding the Hydrologic Cycle|publisher=Columbia Water Center|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ Risk and Financial Instruments]===

Climate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools.&lt;ref name="Risk and Financial Instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Risk and finantial instruments |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ Water, Food, Energy Nexus]===

The Columbia Water Center  studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to  promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and [[groundwater pollution]] and saving energy from groundwater pumping.&lt;ref name="Water, Food, Energy Nexus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Water, food, energy nexus |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Circleofblue" /&gt;

[[Image:CODIT example 4 - Auró.JPG|right|thumb|Example of Compartmentalization, with radial and circular walling, in an [[Acer platanoides]] of 5 years]]

'''Compartmentalization Of Decay In Trees''' (CODIT), also known as Compartmentalization Of Disease In Trees by some, is a concept created by [[Alex Shigo|Dr. Alex Shigo]] after years of studying tree [[wood-decay fungi|decay]] patterns.  Though disputed upon its introduction in the late 1970s, the concept is now widely accepted by modern arboriculture and is referenced widely in publications including Shigo's 'Modern Arboriculture' and 'A New Tree Biology'.

==Theoretical background==
In keeping with the theory of [[spontaneous generation]], in which living things can develop from non-living things, scientists traditionally believed that tree decay led to fungal growth. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}  With the advent of [[germ theory]], however, [[Germany|German]] [[forester]] [[Robert Hartig]] in the early 20th century theorized the opposite was the case, and developed a new model for [[wood-decay fungi|tree decay]]: when trees are wounded, [[fungi]] infect the wounds, and the result is decayed wood.  Over time, the research of Shigo and others helped to expand this theory, leading to the modern concept of tree decay: when trees are wounded, many organisms, not just fungi, infect the wood at different times and in different ways; trees respond to these infections with both chemical and physical changes; discolored and decayed wood results, but is limited by compartmentalization.

==Process==
[[File:CODIT Model.svg|thumb|CODIT model walls labeled]]
According to CODIT, when a tree is wounded [[Cell (biology)|cells]] undergo changes to form "walls" around the wound, slowing or preventing the spread of disease and decay to the rest of the tree.

*'''Wall 1.'''  The first wall is formed by plugging up normally conductive [[vascular tissue]] above and below the wound.  This tissue runs up and down the length of the [[Plant stem|stem]], so plugging it slows the vertical spread of decay.  Tissues are plugged in various ways, such as with [[Tylosis (Botany)|tylosis]], polyphenolic deposits, anti-fungal substances and (in conifers) by the closure of the bordered pits linking vessel cells. This wall is the weakest.
*'''Wall 2.'''  The second wall is formed by the thick-walled, lignin-rich cells of the latewood [[growth ring]] interior and exterior to the wound, thus slowing the radial spread of decay.  This wall is the second weakest, and is continuous except where intersected by ray cells (see next section).
*'''Wall 3.'''  The third wall is formed by ray cells, which are groups of radiating cells oriented perpendicularly to the stem axis, dividing the stem into segments not entirely unlike the slices of a pie.  These groups of cells are not continuous and vary in length, height and thickness, forming a [[maze]]-like barrier to tangential spread of decay.  After wounding, some ray cells are also altered chemically, becoming toxic to some microorganisms.  This is the strongest wall at the time of wounding, prior to the growth of the fourth wall.
*'''Wall 4.'''  The fourth wall, known as the '''barrier zone''', is created by new growth of specialised woody tissue on the exterior of the tree, isolating tissue present at the time of infection from subsequent growth.  This is the strongest wall, and often the only one which can completely halt the spread of infection by closing the wound with new wood.  When only the fourth wall remains intact, the result is something most people have seen walking through the woods or in a park: a living tree with a completely rotted-out interior.  In such cases, all the tissue present at the time of injury has become infected, but new healthy tissue has been allowed to continue to grow outside of the fourth wall.

==Practical impact==
By increasing understanding of how trees respond to decay, CODIT has had many applications.  For example, [[arborists]] are frequently called upon to analyze the danger posed to people or property by a damaged or decaying tree.  By knowing how decay is likely to spread, such hazard tree analyses may be more accurate, thereby preventing unnecessary [[tree removal]], property damage, or injury.  For another example, in the production of [[maple syrup]] holes are drilled into a tree's vascular tissues, which necessarily damages the tree.  CODIT has helped farmers to better understand the effects of different tapping techniques and accordingly to change their methods to minimize damage and maximize production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313125348/http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/org/land/forestry/Fh/fhissues/logtatum2.htm "Minimizing Wounding/Discoloration in Northern Hardwood Stands"], Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, retrieved September 18, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Work done by Gilman et al. at the [[University of Florida]] shows that a wound's proximity to leaf mass greatly influences compartmentalization as well as wound closure.

'''Design objective''' (DO):  In [[telecommunication|communications]] systems, a desired performance characteristic for communications circuits and equipment that is based on engineering analyses, but (a) is not considered feasible to mandate in a [[standardization|standard]], or (b) has not been tested.  

DOs are used because applicable systems standards are not in existence. 

Examples of reasons for designating a performance characteristic as a DO rather than as a standard are (a) it may be bordering on an advancement in the state of the art, (b) the requirement may not have been fully confirmed by measurement or experience with operating circuits, and (c) it may not have been demonstrated that the requirement can be met considering other constraints, such as cost and size. 

A DO is sometimes established in a standard for developmental consideration. A DO may also specify a performance characteristic used in the preparation of specifications for development or [[procurement]] of new equipment or systems.

Design is the process of formulation of a plan for satisfaction of human needs

Dand is a graduate of the Media, Arts and Sciences program at the [[MIT Media Lab]].

== Early life ==
Dand was born in [[Nashik, India]] to parents who were plumbers and storytellers. Dand attributes his cross-disciplinary work to being trained as a plumber by his father and listening to stories and mythologies from his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/dhairya-dands-journey-from-nashik-to-mit-media-lab-a-dedication-to-hard-work/articleshow/34762675.cms | title=Dhairya Dand's journey from Nashik to MIT Media Lab a dedication to hard work  |publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Victoria Jubilee Technological Institute]] for an undergraduate in Computer Science and the [[Industrial Design Centre]] for courses in design. Dand later lived in Singapore, [[Phnom Penh]], Tokyo, London, [[Kampala]] before moving to the United States to study at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/30-under-30/dhairya-dand-blending-imagination-and-reality/39559/1 | title=Dhairya Dand: Blending imagination and reality |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hDHd6NsZKU

== Works ==

Dand's inventions range from sensorial interfaces, [[smart devices]], [[display technologies]], [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]], [[social systems]], [[prosthesis]], bio-based architecture, [[educational toys]], [[robotics|emotional robots]].

In SuperShoes, Dand created insoles that work on a tickling interface, they tickle the feet and guide the wearer across the city. The insoles talk to the smartphone for location, data and access to the users personality preferences. The insoles help with navigation, reminders, taking mindful breaks, discovering new places in a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3029610/mits-vibrating-supershoes-tell-you-where-to-walk | title= MIT's Vibrating Supershoes Tell You Where To Walk

In Programmable Hair, Dand made a contraption worn on the hair that allows the wearer to program their hairstyle, either by choosing from a library of hairstyles or by taking a picture of someone else's hairstyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uop2Rj6HI2s | title='Love, See, Do. Repeat', Dhairya Dand |publisher=TEDx Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Obake, Dand created a 2.5D elastic computer [[display technology]] that has shape memory. The display can be physically deformed, stretched, pulled, pushed. It remembers shapes and can self-actuate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativeapplications.net/openframeworks/obake-o-baa-keh-2-5d-interaction-gestures-to-manipulate-3d-surfaces/ | title='Obake' (o-baa-keh) – 2.5D interaction gestures to manipulate 3D surfaces|publisher=Creative Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/obake-is-an-elasticated | title=3D?

While in Seattle, Dand was part of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s secretive Concept Lab, where he is credited for key inventions and [[Amazon Alexa|Alexa]] devices. Some of his inventions which are public, involve invisible interfaces and using hand gestures to use the air as a medium for computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20170046037.PGNR.| title=Gestures for sharing data between devices in close physical proximity|publisher=USPTO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand's Cheers are alcohol aware ice-cubes that know how much the person is drinking. They change their colors depending on how much the person has consumed alcohol, they also strobe in response to the ambient music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/11/mit-student-invents-led-ice-cubes-that-track-how-much-youve-been-drinking/ | title=MIT Student Invents LED Ice Cubes That Track How Much You've Been Drinking|publisher=TIME Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2013/01/mit-student-invents-led-ice-cubes-to-track-alcohol-intake/ | title=MIT Student Invents LED Ice Cubes to Track Alcohol Intake |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/bestoftv/2013/01/18/vo-mit-smart-ice-cubes.dhairya-dand | title=Too much to drink?

Dand designed a bio-building that responds and reacts to its environment. During the day, cells in the building's 'membranes' open up, allowing for more ventilation; at night, they generate and conserve warmth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbesindia.com/article/30-under-30/dhairya-dand-blending-imagination-and-reality/39559/1 | title=Dhairya Dand: Blending imagination and reality |publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand's ThinkerToys are modular educational toys made from e-Waste which later led to an NGO called openTOYS. By plugging in these modules, a keyboard can be used as a piano, a mouse for language learning and speakers as storytelling devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/1/2916875/thinkertoy-educational-toys-opentoys-arduino | title=ThinkerToys repurpose old keyboards, mice, and monitors into educational toys |publisher=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2012/03/21/thinkertoys-turn-e-waste-into-fun-gadgetry/ | title=Thinkertoys Turn E-Waste into Fun Gadgetry |publisher=Make Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newatlas.com/thinkertoys-educational-toys-ewaste/21960/ | title=Using e-waste to create educational toys, with ThinkerToys |publisher=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of his early work was Lokshahi, which was a m-governance system for political transparency in rural India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/interview-dhairya-dand-moved-by-stories-driven-by-curiosities-2145335 | title=Dhairya Dand: Moved by stories, driven by curiosities |publisher=DNA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/dhairya-dands-journey-from-nashik-to-mit-media-lab-a-dedication-to-hard-work/articleshow/34762675.cms | title=Dhairya Dand's journey from Nashik to MIT Media Lab a dedication to hard work  |publisher=Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dand has also worked on several accessibility related inventions for emotional communication, autism and motor impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/f49p7l2c1nngp80/Jellow.pdf?dl=0 | title=Enablers for the Disabled |publisher=Times |format=PDF |access-date=January 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psfk.com/2014/09/media-consumption-device-mit-flip-shake.html | title=Media Consumption Device Lets You Flip and Shake to Alter News Perspectives |publisher=PSFK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drapery''' is a general word referring to [[cloth]]s or [[textile]]s ([[Old French]] ''[[wikt:draperie|draperie]]'', from [[Late Latin]] ''drappus''&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin" ''[[OED]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).  It may refer to cloth used for decorative purposes &amp;ndash; such as around windows &amp;ndash; or to the trade of retailing cloth, originally mostly for clothing, formerly conducted by drapers. 

In [[art history]], drapery refers to any cloth or textile depicted, which is usually clothing. The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the [[Renaissance]] adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles.  After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the [[grand manner]]; these are also known as draperies.
[[Image:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|280px|Fresco of [[Mithras]] and the Bull from the [[mithraeum]] at Marino, (3rd century CE)]]
For the Greeks, as [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] noted,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Young Johneey: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:245ff.&lt;/ref&gt; clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: "floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed.... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future." Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the [[Parthenon]], where "it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]". Undraped male figures, Clark observed, "were kept in motion by their flying cloaks."

'''Educational psychology''' is the branch of [[psychology]] concerned with the scientific study of human [[learning]]. The study of learning processes, from both [[cognitive]] and [[behavioral]] perspectives, allows researchers to understand individual differences in [[intelligence]], [[cognitive]] development, affect, [[motivation]], self-regulation, and self-concept, as well as their role in learning. The field of educational psychology relies heavily on quantitative methods, including testing and measurement, to enhance educational activities related to instructional design, classroom management, and assessment, which serve to facilitate learning processes in various educational settings across the lifespan.&lt;ref name=Snowman&gt;Snowman, Jack (1997). Educational Psychology: What Do We Teach, What Should We Teach?. "Educational Psychology", 9, 151-169&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. It is also informed by [[neuroscience]]. Educational psychology in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]], [[classroom management]], and student motivation. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks.&lt;ref name=lucas&gt;Lucas, J.L.; Blazek, M.A. &amp; Riley, A.B. (2005). The lack of representation of educational psychology and school psychology in introductory psychology textbooks. ''Educational Psychology'', 25, 347–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of educational psychology involves the study of [[memory]], conceptual processes, and individual differences (via cognitive psychology) in conceptualizing new strategies for learning processes in humans. Educational psychology has been built upon theories of [[operant conditioning]], [[Functional psychology|functionalism]], [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]], [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivism]], [[humanistic psychology]], [[Gestalt psychology]], and [[information processing]].&lt;ref name="Snowman"/&gt;

Educational psychology has seen rapid growth and development as a profession in the last twenty years.&lt;ref name=Farrell&gt;Farrell, P. (2010). School psychology: Learning lessons from history and moving forward. School Psychology International, 31(6), 581-598.&lt;/ref&gt; [[School psychology]] began with the concept of intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow the regular classroom curriculum in the early part of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt; However, "school psychology" itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt;

==History==

===Early years===
Educational psychology is a fairly new and growing field of study. Though it can date back as early as the days of Plato and Aristotle, it was not identified as a specific practice. It was unknown that everyday teaching and learning in which individuals had to think about individual differences, assessment, development, the nature of a subject being taught, problem solving, and transfer of learning was the beginning to the field of educational psychology. These topics are important to education and as a result it is important to understanding human cognition, learning, and social perception.&lt;ref name="Berliner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100-Year Journey Of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plato and Aristotle====

Educational [[psychology]] dates back to the time of [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] researched individual differences in the field of [[education]], training of the body and the cultivation of psycho-motor skills, the formation of good character, the possibilities and limits of moral [[education]]. Some other educational topics they spoke about were the effects of music, poetry, and the other arts on the development of individual, role of teacher, and the relations between teacher and student.&lt;ref name="Berliner"/&gt;  Plato saw knowledge as an innate ability, which  evolves through experience and understanding of the world. Such a statement has evolved into a continuing argument of [[nature]] vs. nurture in understanding conditioning and learning today. [[Aristotle]] observed the phenomenon of "association." His four laws of association included succession, contiguity, similarity, and contrast. His studies examined recall and facilitated learning processes.&lt;ref name=Lott&gt;[[Toomas Lott]] (2011). "Plato on the Rationality of Belief, Trames", 15, 339-364.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John Locke====

[[John Locke]] was considered one of the most influential philosophers in post-renaissance Europe in about mid 1600s. Locke was called "Father of English Psychology". One of Locke's most important works was written in 1690, named ''An Essay Concerning Human Understanding''. In this essay, he introduced the term "tabula rasa" meaning "blank slate." Locke explained that learning was primarily understood through experience only, and we were all born without knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.niu.edu/acad/psych/Millis/History/2003/locke.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He followed by contrasting Plato's theory of innate learning processes. Locke believed the mind was formed by experiences, not innate ideas. Locke introduced this idea as "empiricism," or the understanding that knowledge is only built on knowledge and experience.

In the late 1600s, John Locke advanced the hypothesis that people learn primarily from external forces.  He believed that the mind was like a blank tablet (tabula rasa), and that successions of simple impressions give rise to complex ideas through association and reflection.  Locke is credited with establishing "[[empiricism]]" as a criterion for testing the validity of knowledge, thus providing a conceptual framework for later development of experimental methodology in the natural and social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/history.html|title=The History of Educational Psychology|last=|first=|date=|website=cortland.edu|publisher=|access-date=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before 1890===
Philosophers of education such as Juan Vives, Johann Pestalozzi, Friedrich Fröbel, and Johann Herbart had examined, classified and judged the methods of education centuries before the beginnings of psychology in the late 1800s.

====Juan Vives====

[[Juan Vives]] (1493–1540) proposed induction as the method of study and believed in the direct [[observation]] and investigation of the study of [[nature]]. His studies focus of humanistic [[learning]], which opposed scholasticism and was influenced by a variety of sources including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[religion]], and [[history]].&lt;ref name=zimmerman2&gt;[[Barry Zimmerman|Zimmerman, B.J.]] &amp; [[Dale Schunk|Schunk, D.H.]] (Eds.) (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ, US: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first to emphasize that the location of the school is important to [[learning]].&lt;ref name=vives&gt;Vives, J, &amp; Watson, F. (1913). On education : a translation of the de tradendis disciplinis of juan luis vives . Cambridge : The University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the school should be located away from disturbing noises; the air quality should be good and there should be plenty of food for the students and teachers.&lt;ref name="vives"/&gt; Vives emphasized the importance of understanding individual differences of the students and suggested practice as an important tool for learning.&lt;ref name="vives"/&gt;

Vives introduced his educational ideas in his writing, "De anima et vita" in 1538. In this publication, Vives explores moral [[philosophy]] as a setting for his educational ideals; with this, he explains that the different parts of the soul (similar to that of Aristotle's ideas) are each responsible for different operations, which function distinctively. The first book covers the different "souls": "The Vegatative Soul;" this is the soul of [[nutrition]], growth, and reproduction, "The Sensitive Soul," which involves the five external senses; "The Cogitative soul," which includes internal senses and [[cognitive]] facilities. The second book involves functions of the rational soul: mind, will, and memory. Lastly, the third book explains the analysis of emotions.&lt;ref name=Casini&gt;[[Casini, Lorenzo]] (2010). "Quid sit anima": Juan Luis Vives on the soul and its relation to the body". Renaissance Studies, 24, 496- 517&lt;/ref&gt;

====Johann Pestalozzi====

[[Johann Pestalozzi]] (1746–1827), a Swiss educational reformer, emphasized the child rather than the content of the school.&lt;ref name=glover&gt;Glover, J, &amp; Ronning, R. (Ed.). (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; Pestalozzi fostered an educational reform backed by the idea that early education was crucial for children, and could be manageable for mothers. Eventually, this experience with early education would lead to a "wholesome person characterized by morality."&lt;ref name=Horlacher&gt;Horlacher, Rebekka (2011). Schooling as a means of popular education: Pestalozzi's method as a popular education experiment. "Paedagogica Historica": 47, 65-75&lt;/ref&gt; Pestalozzi has been acknowledged for opening institutions for education, writing books for mother's teaching home education, and elementary books for students, mostly focusing on the kindergarten level. In his later years, he published teaching manuals and methods of teaching.&lt;ref name=Horlacher/&gt;

During the time of [[The Enlightenment]], Pestalozzi's ideals introduced "educationalisation." This created the bridge between social issues and education by introducing the idea of social issues to be solved through education. Horlacher describes the most prominent example of this during The Enlightenment to be "improving agricultural production methods."&lt;ref name=Horlacher/&gt;

====Johann Herbart====

Johann Herbart (1776–1841) is considered the father of educational [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=hergenhahn&gt;Hergenhahn, B.R. (2009). An introduction to the history of psychology. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  He believed that [[learning]] was influenced by interest in the subject and the teacher.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; He thought that teachers should consider the students' existing mental sets—what they already know—when presenting new information or material.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; Herbart came up with what are now known as the formal steps. The 5 steps that teachers should use are:

# Review material that has already been learned by the student&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Prepare the student for new material by giving them an overview of what they are learning next&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Present the new material.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Relate the new material to the old material that has already been learned.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;
# Show how the student can apply the new material and show the material they will learn next.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;

===1890–1920===
There were three major figures in educational psychology in this period: William James, G. Stanley Hall, and John Dewey. These three men distinguished themselves in general psychology and educational psychology, which overlapped significantly at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berliner|first=David|title=The 100- Year Journey of Educational Psychology|url=http://www.wou.edu/~girodm/611/Berliner_100years.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====William James (1842–1910)====

[[File:William James, philosopher.jpg|thumb|upright|William James]]
The period of 1890–1920 is considered the golden era of educational psychology where aspirations of the new discipline rested on the application of the scientific methods of observation and experimentation to educational problems. From 1840 to 1920 37 million people immigrated to the United States.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; This created an expansion of elementary schools and secondary schools. The increase in immigration also provided educational psychologists the opportunity to use intelligence testing to screen immigrants at Ellis Island.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; [[Darwinism]] influenced the beliefs of the prominent educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Even in the earliest years of the discipline, educational psychologists recognized the limitations of this new approach. The pioneering American psychologist [[William James]] commented that: 
{{quote|Psychology is a science, and teaching is an art; and sciences never generate arts directly out of themselves. An intermediate inventive mind must make that application, by using its originality".&lt;ref name=james&gt;[[William James|James, W.]] (1983). ''Talks to teachers on psychology and to students on some of life's ideals''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. (Original work published 1899)&lt;/ref&gt;}}
James is the father of psychology in America but he also made contributions to educational psychology.  In his famous series of lectures ''Talks to Teachers on Psychology'', published in 1899, James defines education as "the organization of acquired habits of conduct and tendencies to behavior".&lt;ref name="james"/&gt;  He states that teachers should "train the pupil to behavior"&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; so that he fits into the social and physical world. Teachers should also realize the importance of habit and instinct. They should present information that is clear and interesting and relate this new information and material to things the student already knows about.&lt;ref name="james"/&gt; He also addresses important issues such as attention, memory, and association of ideas.

====Alfred Binet====

[[Alfred Binet]] published ''Mental Fatigue'' in 1898, in which he attempted to apply the experimental method to educational psychology.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  In this experimental method he advocated for two types of experiments, experiments done in the lab and experiments done in the classroom.  In 1904 he was appointed the Minister of Public Education.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; This is when he began to look for a way to distinguish children with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Binet strongly supported special education programs because he believed that "abnormality" could be cured.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  The Binet-Simon test was the first intelligence test and was the first to distinguish between  "normal children" and those with developmental disabilities.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  Binet believed that it was important to study individual differences between age groups and children of the same age.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also believed that it was important for teachers to take into account individual students strengths and also the needs of the classroom as a whole when teaching and creating a good learning environment.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also believed that it was important to train teachers in observation so that they would be able to see individual differences among children and adjust the curriculum to the students.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Binet also emphasized that practice of material was important.  In 1916 [[Lewis Terman]] revised the Binet-Simon so that the average score was always 100.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; The test became known as the Stanford-Binet and was one of the most widely used tests of intelligence.  Terman, unlike Binet, was interested in using intelligence test to identify gifted children who had high intelligence.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; In his longitudinal study of gifted children, who became known as the Termites, Terman found that gifted children become gifted adults.&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt;

====Edward Thorndike====

[[Edward Thorndike]] (1874–1949) supported the scientific movement in education. He based teaching practices on empirical evidence and measurement.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Thorndike developed the theory of [[instrumental conditioning]] or the law of effect.   The law of effect states that associations are strengthened when it is followed by something pleasing and associations are weakened when followed by something not pleasing. He also found that [[learning]] is done a little at a time or in increments, [[learning]] is an automatic process and all the principles of [[learning]] apply to all mammals. Thorndike's research with [[Robert Woodworth]] on the theory of transfer found that learning one subject will only influence your ability to [[learn]] another subject if the subjects are similar.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; This discovery led to less emphasis on learning the [[classics]] because they found that studying the classics does not contribute to overall general intelligence.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Thorndike was one of the first to say that individual differences in [[cognitive]] tasks were due to how many stimulus response patterns a person had rather than a general intellectual ability.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  He contributed word dictionaries that were [[scientifically]] based to determine the words and definitions used.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The dictionaries were the first to take into consideration the users maturity level.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  He also integrated pictures and easier pronunciation guide into each of the definitions.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Thorndike contributed [[arithmetic]] books based on [[learning theory (education)|learning theory]]. He made all the problems more realistic and relevant to what was being studied, not just to improve the general [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He developed tests that were standardized to measure performance in school related subjects.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; His biggest contribution to testing was the CAVD intelligence test which used a multidimensional approach to intelligence and the first to use a ratio scale.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; His later work was on programmed instruction, mastery learning and computer-based learning:
{{quote|If, by a miracle of mechanical ingenuity, a book could be so arranged that only to him who had done what was directed on page one would page two become visible, and so on, much that now requires personal instruction could be managed by print.&lt;ref name=thorndike&gt;[[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike, E.L.]] (1912). ''Education: A first book''. New York: MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====John Dewey====

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) had a major influence on the development of [[progressive education]] in the United States. He believed that the classroom should prepare children to be good citizens and facilitate creative intelligence.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He pushed for the creation of practical classes that could be applied outside of a school setting.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also thought that education should be student-oriented, not subject-oriented. For Dewey, education was a social experience that helped bring together generations of people. He stated that students learn by doing. He believed in an active mind that was able to be educated through observation, problem solving and enquiry. In his 1910 book ''How We Think'', he emphasizes that material should be provided in a way that is stimulating and interesting to the student since it encourages original thought and problem solving.&lt;ref name=Dewey&gt;Dewey J. (1910). How we think. New York  D.C. Heath &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also stated that material should be relative to the student's own experience.&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt;
{{quote|"The material furnished by way of information should be relevant to a question that is vital in the students own experience"&lt;ref name="Dewey"/&gt;}}

====Jean Piaget====

[[Jean Piaget]] (1896–1980) was one of the most powerful researchers in the area of developmental psychology during the 20th century. He developed the theory of [[cognitive]] development.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The [[theory]] stated that intelligence developed in four different stages. The stages are the sensorimotor stage from birth to 2 years old, the preoperational state from 2 years old to 7 years old, the concrete operational stage from 7 years old to 10 years old, and formal operational stage from 11 years old and up.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He also believed that learning was constrained to the child's cognitive development. Piaget influenced educational psychology because he was the first to believe that cognitive development was important and something that should be paid attention to in education.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  Most of the research on Piagetian theory was carried out by American educational psychologists.

===1920–present===
The number of people receiving a high school and college education increased dramatically from 1920 to 1960.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Because very few jobs were available to teens coming out of eighth grade, there was an increase in high school attendance in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The progressive movement in the United State took off at this time and led to the idea of [[progressive education]]. John Flanagan, an educational psychologist, developed tests for combat trainees and instructions in combat training.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  In 1954 the work of Kenneth Clark and his wife on the effects of segregation on black and white children was influential in the Supreme Court case [[Brown v. Board of Education]].&lt;ref name="hergenhahn"/&gt; From the 1960s to present day, educational psychology has switched from a behaviorist perspective to a more cognitive based perspective because of the influence and development of [[cognitive psychology]] at this time.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

====Jerome Bruner====

[[Jerome Bruner]] is notable for integrating [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s [[cognitive]] approaches into educational [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He advocated for [[discovery learning]] where teachers create a [[problem solving]] environment that allows the student to question, [[explore]] and experiment.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; In his book ''The Process of Education'' Bruner stated that the structure of the material and the [[cognitive]] abilities of the person are important in [[learning]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He emphasized the importance of the subject matter. He also believed that how the subject was structured was important for the student's understanding of the subject and it is the goal of the teacher to structure the subject in a way that was easy for the student to understand.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  In the early 1960s Bruner went to [[Africa]] to teach math and science to school children, which influenced his view as schooling as a [[cultural]] institution.  Bruner was also influential in the development of MACOS, Man a Course of Study, which was an educational program that combined [[anthropology]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The program explored human evolution and social behavior.  He also helped with the development of the head start program. He was interested in the influence of culture on education and looked at the impact of poverty on educational development.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

====Benjamin Bloom====

[[Benjamin Bloom]] (1903–1999) spent over 50 years at the [[University of Chicago]], where he worked in the department of education.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He believed that all students can learn. He developed [[taxonomy of educational objectives]].&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; The objectives were divided into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor. The cognitive domain deals with how we think.&lt;ref name=clark&gt;Clark, D. (n.d.). Bloom's taxonomy of learning domains. Retrieved from http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into categories that are on a continuum from easiest to more complex.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The categories are knowledge or recall, comprehension application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;  The affective domain deals with emotions and has 5 categories.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The categories are receiving phenomenon, responding to that phenomenon, valuing, organization, and internalizing values.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The psychomotor domain deals with the development of motor skills, movement and coordination and has 7 categories, that also goes from simplest to complex.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The 7 categories of the psychomotor domain are perception, set, guided response, mechanism, complex overt response, adaptation, and origination.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt; The taxonomy provided broad educational objectives that could be used to help expand the curriculum to match the ideas in the taxonomy.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;  The taxonomy is considered to have a greater influence internationally than in the United States. Internationally, the taxonomy is used in every aspect of education from training of the teachers to the development of testing material.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Bloom believed in communicating clear learning goals and promoting an active student. He thought that teachers should provide feedback to the students on their strengths and weaknesses.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Bloom also did research on college students and their problem solving processes. He found that they differ in understanding the basis of the problem and the ideas in the problem. He also found that students differ in process of problem solving in their approach and attitude toward the problem.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

====Nathaniel Gage====

[[Nathaniel Gage]] (1917 -2008) is an important figure in educational psychology as his research focused on improving teaching and understanding the processes involved in teaching.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; He edited the book ''Handbook of Research on Teaching'' (1963), which helped develop early research in teaching and educational psychology.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt; Gage founded the Stanford Center for Research and Development in Teaching, which contributed research on teaching as well as influencing the education of important educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="zimmerman2"/&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Behavioral===
[[Applied behavior analysis]], a research-based science utilizing behavioral principles of [[operant conditioning]], is effective in a range of educational settings.&lt;ref name=Alberto&gt;Alberto, P. &amp; Troutman, A. (2003) ''Applied behavior analysis for teachers'' (6th ed.). Columbus, OH, USA: Prentice-Hall-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, teachers can alter student behavior by systematically rewarding students who follow classroom rules with praise, stars, or tokens exchangeable for sundry items.&lt;ref name=mcgoey&gt;McGoey, K.E. &amp; DuPaul, G.J. (2000) Token reinforcement and response cost procedures: Reducing the disruptive behavior of preschool children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. ''School Psychology Quarterly'', 15, 330–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theodore&gt;Theodore, L.A.; Bray, M.A.; Kehle, T.J. &amp; Jenson, W.R. (2001) Randomization of group contingencies and reinforcers to reduce classroom disruptive behavior. ''Journal of School Psychology'', 39, 267–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the demonstrated efficacy of awards in changing behavior, their use in education has been criticized by proponents of [[self-determination theory]], who claim that praise and other rewards undermine [[intrinsic motivation]]. There is evidence that tangible rewards decrease intrinsic motivation in specific situations, such as when the student already has a high level of intrinsic motivation to perform the goal behavior.&lt;ref name=lepper&gt;[[Mark Lepper|Lepper, M. R.]]; Greene, D. &amp; [[Richard E. Nisbett|Nisbett, R.E.]] (1973). Undermining children's intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 28, 129–37.&lt;/ref&gt; But the results showing detrimental effects are counterbalanced by evidence that, in other situations, such as when rewards are given for attaining a gradually increasing standard of performance, rewards enhance intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name=cameron&gt;Cameron, J.; Pierce, W.D.; Banko, K.M. &amp; Gear, A. (2005). Achievement-based rewards and intrinsic motivation: A test of cognitive mediators. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 97, 641–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, W.D. &amp; Cameron, J. (2002). A summary of the effects of reward contingencies on interest and performance. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 3, 222–26. [http://www.baojournal.com ABO]&lt;/ref&gt; Many effective therapies have been based on the principles of applied behavior analysis, including [[pivotal response therapy]] which is used to treat autism spectrum disorders.

===Cognitive===
Among current educational psychologists, the cognitive perspective is more widely held than the behavioral perspective, perhaps because it admits causally related mental constructs such as [[trait theory|traits]], [[beliefs]], [[memories]], [[motivation]]s and [[emotion]]s.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} Cognitive theories claim that memory structures determine how information is [[perceive]]d, [[information processing|processed]], stored, [[information retrieval|retrieved]] and [[forgot]]ten. Among the memory structures theorized by cognitive psychologists are separate but linked visual and verbal systems described by [[Allan Paivio]]'s [[dual coding theory]]. Educational psychologists have used dual coding theory and [[cognitive load]] theory to explain how people learn from [[multimedia]] presentations.&lt;ref name=Mayer&gt;[[Richard E. Mayer|Mayer, R.E.]] (2001). ''Multimedia learning''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KrugDavisGlover1990.png|right|thumb|Three experiments reported by Krug, Davis and Glover&lt;ref name=krug&gt;Krug, D.; Davis, T.B.; Glover, J.A. (1990). Massed versus distributed repeated reading: A case of forgetting helping recall? ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 82, 366–71.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated the advantage of delaying a 2nd reading of a text passage by one week (distributed) compared with no delay between readings (massed).]]
The spaced learning effect, a [[cognitive]] phenomenon strongly supported by psychological research, has broad applicability within [[education]].&lt;ref name=dempster&gt;Dempster, F.N. (1989). Spacing effects and their implications for theory and practice. ''[[Educational Psychology Review]]'', 1, 309–30.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, students have been found to perform better on a test of knowledge about a text passage when a second reading of the passage is delayed rather than immediate (see figure).&lt;ref name=krug/&gt; Educational psychology research has confirmed the applicability to education of other findings from cognitive psychology, such as the benefits of using [[mnemonics]] for immediate and delayed retention of information.&lt;ref name=carney&gt;Carney, R.N. &amp; Levin, J.R. (2000). Fading mnemonic memories: Here's looking anew, again!  ''[[Contemporary Educational Psychology]]'', 25, 499–508.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Problem solving]], according to prominent cognitive psychologists, is fundamental to [[learning]]. It resides as an important research topic in educational psychology. A student is thought to interpret a problem by assigning it to a [[schema (psychology)|schema]] retrieved from long-term memory. A problem students run into while reading is called "activation." This is when the student's representations of the text are present during working memory. This causes the student to read through the material without absorbing the information and being able to retain it. When working memory is absent from the reader's representations of the working memory they experience something called "deactivation." When deactivation occurs, the student has an understanding of the material and is able to retain information. If deactivation occurs during the first reading, the reader does not need to undergo deactivation in the second reading. The reader will only need to reread to get a "gist" of the text to spark their [[memory]]. When the problem is assigned to the wrong schema, the student's attention is subsequently directed away from features of the problem that are inconsistent with the assigned schema.&lt;ref name=kalyuga&gt;Kalyuga, S.; Chandler, P.; Tuovinen, J. &amp; [[John Sweller|Sweller, J.]] (2001). When problem solving is superior to studying worked examples. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 93, 579–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The critical step of finding a mapping between the problem and a pre-existing schema is often cited as supporting the centrality of [[analogical]] thinking to problem solving.

====Cognitive view of intelligence====
[[File:Figural Relationships.svg|right|thumb|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test]]
Each person has an individual profile of characteristics, abilities and challenges that result from predisposition, learning and development. These manifest as individual differences in [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], [[creativity]], [[cognitive style]], [[motivation]] and the capacity to process information, communicate, and relate to others. The most prevalent disabilities found among school age children are [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[learning disability]], [[dyslexia]], and [[speech disorder]]. Less common disabilities include [[intellectual disability]], [[hearing impairment]], [[cerebral palsy]], [[epilepsy]], and [[blindness]].&lt;ref name=woolfolk/&gt;

Although theories of [[intelligence]] have been discussed by philosophers since [[Plato]], intelligence testing is an invention of educational psychology, and is coincident with the development of that discipline. Continuing debates about the nature of intelligence revolve on whether [[intelligence]] can be characterized by a single [[factor analysis|factor]] known as [[general intelligence factor|general intelligence]],&lt;ref name=spearman1904&gt;Spearman, C. (1904) "General intelligence" objectively determined and measured. ''American Journal of Psychology'', 15, 201–93.&lt;/ref&gt; multiple factors (e.g., [[Howard Gardner|Gardner's]] [[theory of multiple intelligences]]&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, Howard. (1983) ''Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;), or whether it can be measured at all. In practice, standardized instruments such as the [[Stanford-Binet IQ test]] and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children|WISC]]&lt;ref&gt;Wechsler, D. (1949). ''The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children.'' New York: Psychological Corp.&lt;/ref&gt; are widely used in economically developed countries to identify children in need of individualized educational treatment. Children classified as [[gifted]] are often provided with accelerated or enriched programs. Children with identified deficits may be provided with enhanced education in specific skills such as [[phonological awareness]]. In addition to basic abilities, the individual's personality [[trait theory|traits]] are also important, with people higher in [[conscientiousness]] and [[hope]] attaining superior academic achievements, even after controlling for intelligence and past performance.&lt;ref&gt;Day, L.; Hanson, K.; Maltby, J.; Proctor, C.L. &amp; Wood, A.M. (in press). [http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/alex.wood/hope_education.pdf Hope uniquely predicts objective academic achievement above intelligence, personality, and previous academic achievement.] ''Journal of Research in Personality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental===
{{Main|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Developmental psychology, and especially the psychology of cognitive development, opens a special perspective for educational psychology. This is so because education and the psychology of cognitive development converge on a number of crucial assumptions. First, the psychology of cognitive development defines human cognitive competence at successive phases of development. Education aims to help students acquire knowledge and develop skills which are compatible with their understanding and problem-solving capabilities at different ages. Thus, knowing the students' level on a developmental sequence provides information on the kind and level of knowledge they can assimilate, which, in turn, can be used as a frame for organizing the subject matter to be taught at different school grades. This is the reason why [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] was so influential for education, especially mathematics and science education.&lt;ref&gt;Furth, H.G. &amp; Wachs, H. (1975). ''Thinking goes to school: Piaget's theory in practice''. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the same direction, the [[neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] suggest that in addition to the concerns above, sequencing of concepts and skills in teaching must take account of the processing and [[working memory]] capacities that characterize successive age levels.&lt;ref&gt;Demetriou, A. &amp; Valanides, N. (1998). A three level of theory of the developing mind: Basic principles and implications for instruction and assessment. In R.J. Sternberg &amp; W.M. Williams (Eds.), ''Intelligence, instruction, and assessment'' (pp. 149–99). Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"&gt;Demetriou, A.; Spanoudis, G. &amp; Mouyi, A. (2010). A Three-level Model of the Developing Mind: Functional and Neuronal Substantiation. In M. Ferrari and L. Vuletic (Eds.), ''The Developmental Relations between Mind, Brain, and Education: Essays in honor of Robbie Case''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;
   
Second, the psychology of [[cognitive development]] involves understanding how [[cognitive]] change takes place and recognizing the factors and processes which enable cognitive competence to develop. [[Education]] also capitalizes on [[cognitive]] change, because the construction of knowledge presupposes effective teaching methods that would move the student from a lower to a higher level of understanding. Mechanisms such as reflection on actual or [[Mind|mental]] actions vis-à-vis alternative solutions to problems, tagging new concepts or solutions to symbols that help one recall and mentally manipulate them are just a few examples of how mechanisms of cognitive development may be used to facilitate learning.&lt;ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1985). ''Intellectual development: Birth to adulthood.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the psychology of cognitive development is concerned with individual differences in the organization of cognitive processes and abilities, in their rate of change, and in their mechanisms of change. The principles underlying intra- and inter-individual differences could be educationally useful, because knowing how students differ in regard to the various dimensions of cognitive development, such as processing and representational capacity, self-understanding and self-regulation, and the various domains of understanding, such as mathematical, scientific, or verbal abilities, would enable the teacher to cater for the needs of the different students so that no one is left behind.&lt;ref name="Demetriou, A. 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Case, R. (1992). The role of central conceptual structures in the development of children's mathematical and scientific thought. In A. Demetriou, M. Shayer, &amp; A. Efklides (Eds.), ''Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development: Implications and applications to education'' (pp. 52–65). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist===
{{Main|Constructivism (learning theory)|l1=Constructivism}}
Constructivism is a category of learning theory in which emphasis is placed on the agency and prior "knowing" and experience of the learner, and often on the social and cultural determinants of the learning process. Educational psychologists distinguish individual (or psychological) constructivism, identified with [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]], from [[social constructivism (learning theory)|social constructivism]]. A dominant influence on the latter type is [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s work on sociocultural learning, describing how interactions with adults, more capable peers, and cognitive tools are internalized to form mental constructs. Elaborating on Vygotsky's theory, [[Jerome Bruner]] and other educational psychologists developed the important concept of [[instructional scaffolding]], in which the social or information environment offers supports for learning that are gradually withdrawn as they become internalized.&lt;ref name="educational psychology"&gt;Seifert, Kelvin &amp; Sutton, Rosemary. ''[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Educational-Psychology.pdf Educational Psychology: Second Edition]''. Global Text Project, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Jean Piaget's Cognitive Development ====
Jean Piaget was interested in how an organism adapts to its environment. Piaget hypothesized that infants are born with a schema operating at birth that he called "reflexes". Piaget  identified four stages in cognitive development. The four stages are sensorimotor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage and formal operational stage.&lt;ref name=Huitt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huitt|first1=W|last2=Hummel |first2=J|title=Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development|journal=Educational Psychology Interactive|year=2003|url=http://www.edpsycinteractive.org/topics/cognition/piaget.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditioning and learning==

[[Image:Kugleramme.jpg|thumb|left|An [[abacus]] provides concrete experiences for learning abstract concepts.]]
To understand the characteristics of learners in [[child]]hood, [[adolescence]], [[adulthood]], and [[old age]], educational psychology develops and applies theories of human [[developmental psychology|development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/teaching-learning/index.aspx|title=Educational Psychology Promotes Teaching and Learning|website=apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often represented as stages through which people pass as they mature, developmental theories describe changes in mental abilities ([[cognition]]), social roles, moral reasoning, and beliefs about the nature of knowledge.

For example, educational psychologists have conducted research on the instructional applicability of [[cognitive development|Jean Piaget's theory of development]], according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children need to be taught using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur at the same time in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.&lt;ref name=woolfolk&gt;Woolfolk, A.E.; Winne, P.H. &amp; Perry, N.E. (2006). ''Educational Psychology'' (3rd Canadian ed.). Toronto, Canada: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget proposed a developmental theory of [[moral reasoning]] in which children progress from a naïve understanding of [[morality]] based on behavior and outcomes to a more advanced understanding based on intentions. Piaget's views of moral development were elaborated by [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg]] into a [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stage theory of moral development]]. There is evidence that the moral reasoning described in stage theories is not sufficient to account for moral behavior. For example, other factors such as [[modeling (psychology)|modeling]] (as described by the [[social cognitive theory of morality]]) are required to explain [[bullying]].

[[Rudolf Steiner]]'s model of [[child development]] interrelates physical, emotional, cognitive, and moral development&lt;ref name="uwe.ac.uk RR645 1.5 Findings"&gt;Woods, Ashley and Woods, [http://www.dfes.gov.uk/research/data/uploadfiles/RR645.pdf ''Steiner Schools in England'', University of West of England, Bristol: Research Report RR645], section 1.5, "Findings from the survey and case studies"&lt;/ref&gt; in developmental stages similar to those later described by [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Y. Nordlund, "Art Experiences in Waldorf Education," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Missouri-Columbia, May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental theories are sometimes presented not as shifts between qualitatively different stages, but as gradual increments on separate dimensions. Development of [[epistemological]] beliefs (beliefs about knowledge) have been described in terms of gradual changes in people's belief in: certainty and permanence of knowledge, fixedness of ability, and credibility of authorities such as teachers and experts. People develop more sophisticated beliefs about knowledge as they gain in education and maturity.&lt;ref name=cano&gt;Cano, F. (2005). Epistemological beliefs and approaches to learning: Their change through secondary school and their influence on academic performance. ''British Journal of Educational Psychology'', 75, 203–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motivation===
[[Motivation]] is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behavior. Motivation can have several impacting effects on how students learn and how they behave towards subject matter:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Omrod|first=Jeanne|title=Educational Theme: Motivation in the Classroom|url=http://www.greeneeducationfoundation.org/documents/GEF_2012-2013_Educational_Theme.pdf|publisher=Green Education Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Provide direction towards goals
* Enhance cognitive processing abilities and performance
* Direct behavior toward particular goals
* Lead to increased effort and energy
* Increase initiation of and persistence in activities

Educational psychology research on motivation is concerned with the [[volition (psychology)|volition]] or [[will (philosophy)|will]] that students bring to a task, their level of interest and [[intrinsic motivation]], the personally held [[goal setting|goals]] that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of [[attribution theory]] developed by [[Bernard Weiner]]&lt;ref name=weiner&gt;[[Bernard Weiner|Weiner, B.]] (2000). Interpersonal and intrapersonal theories of motivation from an attributional perspective. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 12, 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions of [[shame]] and [[embarrassment]] and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.&lt;ref name="weiner"/&gt;

The [[self-determination theory]] (SDT) was developed by psychologists [[Edward L. Deci|Edward Deci]] and Richard Ryan. SDT focuses on the importance of [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic and extrinsic motivation]] in driving human behavior and posits inherent growth and development tendencies. It emphasizes the degree to which an individual's behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. When applied to the realm of education, the self-determination theory is concerned primarily with promoting in students an interest in learning, a value of education, and a confidence in their own capacities and attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=Edward L.|title=Motivation and Education: The Self-Determination Perspective|journal=Educational Psychologist|year=1991|volume=26|issue=3 &amp; 4|pages=325–346|doi=10.1207/s15326985ep2603&amp;4_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivational theories also explain how [[goal theory|learners' goals]] affect the way they engage with academic tasks.&lt;ref name=elliot&gt;Elliot, A.J. (1999). Approach and avoidance motivation and achievement goals. ''Educational Psychologist'', 34, 169–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have ''mastery goals'' strive to increase their ability and knowledge. Those who have ''performance approach goals'' strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have ''performance avoidance'' goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence in the face of failure, preference for challenging tasks, [[creativity]] and [[intrinsic motivation]]. Performance avoidance goals are associated with negative outcomes such as poor [[attention|concentration]] while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and [[Anxiety (mood)#Test and performance|test anxiety]]. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some negative outcomes such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.&lt;ref name="elliot"/&gt;

[[Locus of control]] is a salient factor in the successful academic performance of students. During the 1970s and '80s, [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] did significant educational research studying locus of control as related to the academic achievement of students pursuing higher education coursework. Much of her educational research and publications focused upon the theories of [[Julian B. Rotter]] in regard to the importance of internal control and successful academic performance.&lt;ref name="Whyte80"&gt;Whyte, C. (1980). An Integrated Counseling and Learning Assistance Center. New Directions Sourcebook. Jossey-Bass, Inc. San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Whyte reported that individuals who perceive and believe that their hard work may lead to more successful academic outcomes, instead of depending on luck or fate, persist and achieve academically at a higher level. Therefore, it is important to provide education and counseling in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, C. (1978). Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen. ''Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance'', 6 (4), 198–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{broader|Educational technology}}
[[Image:BloomsCognitiveDomain.svg|right|thumb|[[Taxonomy of educational objectives|Bloom's taxonomy]] of educational objectives: categories in the cognitive domain&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, L.W. &amp; [[David Krathwohl|Krathwohl, D.R.]] (2001). ''A taxonomy for learning, teaching, and assessing: A revision of Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives''. New York, USA: Addison-Wesley Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Instructional design]], the systematic design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a [[taxonomy of educational objectives]] created by [[Benjamin Bloom]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; Bloom also researched [[mastery learning]], an instructional strategy in which learners only advance to a new learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;[[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom, B.S.]] (1984). The two sigma problem: The search for methods of group instruction as effective as one-to-one tutoring. ''Educational Researcher'', 13 (6), 4–16.&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that a combination of mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved in classroom instruction. [[Robert M. Gagné|Gagné]], another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of [[task analysis]] in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives&lt;ref name=gronlund&gt;Gronlund, N.E. (2000). ''How to write and use instructional objectives'' (6th ed.). Columbus, OH, USA: Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; connected by prerequisite relationships.
The following list of technological resources incorporate computer-aided instruction and intelligence for educational psychologists and their students: 
* [[Intelligent tutoring system]]
* [[Cognitive tutor]]
* [[Cooperative learning]]
* [[Collaborative learning]]
* [[Problem-based learning]]
* [[Computer-supported collaborative learning]]
* [[Constructive alignment]]

Technology is essential to the field of educational psychology, not only for the psychologist themselves as far as testing, organization, and resources, but also for students. Educational Psychologists whom reside in the K- 12 setting focus the majority of their time with Special Education students. It has been found that students with disabilities learning through technology such as IPad applications and videos are more engaged and motivated to learn in the classroom setting. Liu et al. explain that learning-based technology allows for students to be more focused, and learning is more efficient with learning technologies. The authors explain that learning technology also allows for students with social- emotional disabilities to participate in distance learning.&lt;ref name=Liu&gt;Liu, Gi Zen; Wu, No- Wei; Chen, Ye- Wen. Identifying Emerging Trends for implementing learning technology in special education. "Research in Development disabilities", 2013, 3618–3628&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Teaching===

[[Image:FinnGerberBoydZaharias2005.png|right|thumb|A class size experiment in the United States found that attending small classes for 3 or more years in the early grades increased high school graduation of students from low income families.&lt;ref name=finn&gt;Finn, J.D.; Gerber, S.B.; Boyd-Zaharias, J. (2005). Small classes in the early grades, academic achievement, and graduating from high school. ''Journal of Educational Psychology'', 97, 214–33.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Research on [[classroom management]] and [[pedagogy]] is conducted to guide teaching practice and form a foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of classroom management are to create an environment conducive to learning and to develop students' self-management skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher–student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behavior, and use counseling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems.&lt;ref name=emmer&gt;Emmer, E.T. &amp; Stough, L.M. (2001). Classroom management: A critical part of educational psychology with implications for teacher education. ''Educational Psychologist'', 36, 103–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Introductory educational psychology is a commonly required area of study in most North American teacher education programs. When taught in that context, its content varies, but it typically emphasizes learning theories (especially cognitively oriented ones), issues about motivation, assessment of students' learning, and classroom management. A developing [[b:Contemporary Educational Psychology|Wikibook about educational psychology]] gives more detail about the educational psychology topics that are typically presented in preservice teacher education.

===Counseling===

====Training====
In order to become an educational psychologist, students can complete an undergraduate degree in their choice. They then must go to graduate school to study education psychology, counseling psychology, and/ or school counseling. Most students today are also receiving their doctorate degrees in order to hold the "psychologist" title. Educational psychologists work in a variety of settings. Some work in university settings where they carry out research on the cognitive and social processes of human development, learning and education. Educational psychologists may also work as consultants in designing and creating educational materials, classroom programs and online courses.Educational psychologists who work in k–12 school settings (closely related are [[school psychologist]]s in the US and Canada) are trained at the [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] levels. In addition to conducting assessments, school psychologists provide services such as academic and behavioral intervention, counseling, teacher consultation, and crisis intervention. However, school psychologists are generally more individual-oriented towards students.&lt;ref name= Love&gt;Love, P. (2009). Educational psychologists: the early search for an identity. Educational Psychology In Practice, 25(1), 3-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many colleges and high schools are starting to teach students how to teach students in the classroom. In colleges educational psychology is starting to be a general education requirement.

====Employment outlook====
Employment for psychologists in the United States is expected to grow faster than most occupations through the year 2014, with anticipated growth of 18–26%. One in four psychologists are employed in educational settings. In the United States, the [[median]] [[salary]] for psychologists in primary and secondary schools is US$58,360 as of May 2004.&lt;ref name=OOH&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. ''Occupational Outlook Handbook''. 2006–07 Edition. Psychologists. retrieved from http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm on June 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Colleges offer and allow someone to obtain a PHD in educational Psychology.

In recent decades the participation of women as professional researchers in North American educational psychology has risen dramatically.&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Evans, J.; Hsieh, P.P. &amp; Robinson, D.H. (2005). Women's Involvement in educational psychology journals from 1976 to 2004. ''Educational Psychology Review'', 17, 263–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of research==
Educational psychology, as much as any other field of [[psychology]] heavily relies on a balance of pure [[observation]] and quantitative methods in [[psychology]]. The study of [[education]] generally combines the studies of [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[ethics]] with theoretical approaches. Smeyers and Depaepe explain that historically, the study of education and child rearing have been associated with the interests of policymakers and practitioners within the educational field, however, the recent shift to [[sociology]] and [[psychology]] has opened the door for new findings in education as a [[social science]]. Now being its own academic discipline, educational psychology has proven to be helpful for social science researchers.&lt;ref name=Smeyers&gt;Smeyers, Paul; Depaepe, Marc. The Lure of Psychology for Education and Educational Research. "The Journal of Educational Philosophy", (2012) 46, 315-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative research is the backing to most observable phenomena in [[psychology]]. This involves observing, creating, and understanding a distribution of data based upon the studies subject matter. Researchers use particular variables to interpret their data distributions from their research and employ statistics as a way of creating data tables and analyzing their data. [[Psychology]] has moved from the "common sense" reputations initially posed by Thomas Reid to the methodology approach comparing independent and dependent variables through natural [[observation]], [[experiment]]s, or combinations of the two. Though results are still, with statistical methods, objectively true based upon significance variables or p- values.&lt;ref name="Smeyers"/&gt;

[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|[[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
In philosophy, '''empiricism''' is a [[theory]] that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from [[Empirical evidence|sensory experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415546133|pages=129–38|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of several views of  [[epistemology]], the study of human knowledge, along with [[rationalism]] and [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Empiricism emphasises the role of [[empirical evidence]] in the formation of ideas, over the idea of [[innate idea]]s or [[traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. ''Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', 1748.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empiricism in the [[philosophy of science]] emphasises evidence, especially as discovered in [[experiment]]s. It is a fundamental part of the [[scientific method]] that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on ''[[A priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' reasoning, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], or [[revelation]].

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [[Falsifiability|falsification]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, M. (2006). Empiricism. In F. English (Ed.), Encyclopedia of educational leadership and administration. (pp. 338–39). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.

==Etymology==
The English term ''empirical'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἐμπειρία, ''empeiria'', which is cognate with and translates to the Latin ''experientia'', from which are derived the word ''experience'' and the related ''experiment''.

==History==

===Background===
{{Main|Empirical method}}

A central concept in  [[science]] and the [[scientific method]] is that it must be ''empirically'' based on the evidence of the senses. Both [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s use working [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that are [[testable]] by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. The term ''semi-empirical'' is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic [[axiom]]s, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results in order to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.

Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.&lt;ref&gt;Markie, P. (2004), "Rationalism vs. Empiricism" in Edward D. Zalta (ed.), ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; This view is commonly contrasted with [[rationalism]], which states that knowledge may be derived from [[reason]] independently of the senses. For example, [[John Locke]] held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and reasoning alone. Similarly [[Robert Boyle]], a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Luis E. (1981), ''From Descartes to Hume: Continental Metaphysics and the Development of Modern Philosophy'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engfer, Hans-Jürgen (1996), ''Empirismus versus Rationalismus? Kritik eines philosophiegeschichtlichen Schemas'', Padeborn: Schöningh.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main continental rationalists ([[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) were also advocates of the empirical "scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Stephen (1999), "British Sceptical Realism. A Fresh Look at the British Tradition", ''European Journal of Philosophy'', 7, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anstey, "[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/09/esp-is-best/ ESP is best]", ''[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ Early Modern Experimental Philosophy]'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early empiricism===
''[[Vaisheshika]]'' [[darsana]], founded by the ancient Indian philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], accepted perception and inference as the only two reliable sources of knowledge. This is enumerated in his work [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].

The earliest Western proto-empiricists were the [[Empiric school]] of ancient Greek medical practitioners, who rejected the three doctrines of the [[Dogmatic school]], preferring to rely on the observation of ''[[Phenomenalism|"phenomena"]]''.&lt;ref name=sini&gt;Sini, Carlo (2004), "Empirismo", in Gianni Vattimo et al. (eds.), ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("clean slate" or "blank tablet") connotes a view of mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words "white paper") on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have [[innate ideas]]. The image dates back to [[Aristotle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What the mind (''[[nous]]'') thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (''grammateion'') which bears no actual writing (''grammenon'');  this is just what happens in the case of the mind.  (Aristotle, ''[[On the Soul]]'', 3.4.430&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of [[potentiality and actuality]], and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the [[active intellect|active ''nous'']]. These notions contrasted with [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others).  Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than [[Plato]], and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (Latin for "nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses").

This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Jeffrey|title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book|last1=Long|first1=A.A.|last2=Sedley|first2=D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] Aristotle's theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed by [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] starting with [[Al Farabi]], developing into an elaborate theory by [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; and demonstrated as a [[thought experiment]] by [[Ibn Tufail]].&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt; For Avicenna ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]), for example, the ''tabula rasa'' is a pure potentiality that is actualized through [[education]], and knowledge is attained through "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]] in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts". The [[intellect]] itself develops from a [[passive intellect|material intellect]] (''al-'aql al-hayulani''), which is a [[potentiality]] "that can acquire knowledge to the [[active intellect]] (''al-[['aql]] al-fa'il''), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; So the immaterial "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.

In the 12th century CE the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muslim]] philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]] (known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West) included the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a ''tabula rasa'' to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through experience alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', was written by the Arab theologian and physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in the 13th century. It also dealt with the theme of empiricism through the story of a feral child on a desert island, but departed from its predecessor by depicting the development of the protagonist's mind through contact with society rather than in isolation from society.&lt;ref name="Roubi"&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'')&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] adopted the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] position that the senses are essential to mind into [[scholasticism]]. [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274), one of Aquinas' strongest intellectual opponents, offered some of the strongest arguments in favour of the Platonic idea of the mind.

===Renaissance Italy===
In the late [[renaissance]] various writers began to question the [[medieval]] and [[classical philosophy|classical]] understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and his friend [[Francesco Guicciardini]] initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the "effectual truth" instead. Their contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) said, "If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings."&lt;ref&gt;"Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chineseand Western Medical Illustration", Camillia Matuk, Journal of Biocommunication, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2006, [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (c. 1520 – 1591), father of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and the inventor of [[monody]], made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his ''Dialogo della musica antica e moderna'' (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for "experiment" was ''esperienza''. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. ''Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei''), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of '[[Pythagorean hammers|Pythagoras' hammers]]' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded "experience and demonstration" as the ''sine qua non'' of valid rational enquiry.

===British empiricism===
'''British empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of [[early modern philosophy]] and [[modern science]]. The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders [[Francis Bacon]], described as [[The Advancement of Learning|empiricist]], and [[René Descartes]], who is described as a rationalist. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.

In response to the early-to-mid-17th century "[[rationalism#Background|continental rationalism]]" [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) proposed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) a very influential view wherein the ''only'' knowledge humans can have is ''[[a posteriori]]'', i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a "blank tablet", in Locke's words "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for [[certainty]] of [[Descartes]].

[[File:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bishop George Berkeley]]]]
A generation later, the Irish [[Anglican]] bishop, [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual [[atheism]]. In response to Locke, he put forth in his ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things ''only'' exist either as a ''result'' of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)  In his text ''Alciphron'', Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen (1987) "Berkeley's Theory of Reality" in ''The Journal of the Limerick Philosophical Society'', [http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol1/berkel.html UL.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called [[subjective idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "George Berkeley", vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP2"/&gt;

The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of [[skepticism]].  Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition."&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_prob"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of Probability|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt; And,&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_nec"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of the Idea of a Necessary Connexion|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained: and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on."|Hume Section XIV "of the idea of necessary connexion in ''A Treatise of Human Nature''}}

Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: ''relations of ideas'' and ''matters of fact'' (see also [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. "that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving  some [[contingent]] observation of the world (e.g. "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's "ideas", in turn, are derived from their "impressions". For Hume, an "impression" corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt;

[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]'s empiricism led to numerous philosophical schools.]]
Hume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason.  Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated ''habits'', developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about [[scientific method]]—that of the [[problem of induction]].  Hume argued that it requires [[inductive reasoning]] to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt; Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.  Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by [[inductive reasoning]] that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.&lt;ref name=Hume1&gt;Hume, D. "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding", in Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 2nd edition, L.A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK, 1902 [1748].{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom.  Hume's lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.

===Phenomenalism===
{{Main|Phenomenalism}}
Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is ''rationally'' unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit.&lt;ref&gt;Morick, H. (1980), Challenges to Empiricism, Hackett Publishing, Indianapolis, IN.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an extreme empiricist theory known as [[phenomenalism]], anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi, Diego (2004), "Fenomenismo"', in [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Gaetano Chiurazzi (eds.), ''L'Enciclopedia Garzanti di Filosofia'', 3rd edition, Garzanti, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist—hence the closely related term [[subjective idealism]]. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences.  This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As [[John Stuart Mill]] put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the "permanent possibility of sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., "An Examination of Sir William Rowan Hamilton's Philosophy", in A.J. Ayer and Ramond Winch (eds.), British Empirical Philosophers, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, 1968.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for ''all'' meaningful knowledge including mathematics.  As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:

{{quote|[Mill] claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience; mathematical inference, generally conceived as deductive [and ''a priori''] in nature, Mill set down as founded on induction.  Thus, in Mill's philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas.  In his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological; we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those that logical and mathematical propositions assert. This is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known, but it has not found many defenders.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;}}

Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred (2005), "John Stuart Mill", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations.  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such "groups of permanent possibilities of sensation" might exist in the first place.  Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of "reality" that goes beyond mere "possibilities of sensation", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MEP6&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Phenomenalism", vol. 6, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the "gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all".&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;  Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.  It  fails to fully consider the structure and method of [[mathematical science]], the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name=MEP2&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Empiricism", vol. 2, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Axiomatic Method", vol. 5, pp. 188–89, 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Bolender, John (1998), "Factual Phenomenalism: A Supervenience Theory"', Sorites, no. 9, pp. 16–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.  The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no ''finite'' set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.  But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the [[Third Man Argument|third man]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah (2004), The Refutation of Phenomenalism, Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Roderick M. |date=September 9, 1948 |title=The Problem of Empiricism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=512–17 |jstor=2019108 |doi=10.2307/2019108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical empiricism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
Logical empiricism (also ''logical positivism'' or ''neopositivism'') was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from [[mathematical logic]] that had been developed by [[Gottlob Frege]]  and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Some of the key figures in this movement were [[Otto Neurath]], [[Moritz Schlick]] and the rest of the [[Vienna Circle]], along with  [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]].

The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the  methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all [[logical truth]]s are mere linguistic [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the ''analytic'' (a priori) and the ''synthetic'' (a posteriori).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein, Peter]], and [[Stephen Francis Barker|Barker, Stephen F.]] (1969), The Legacy of Logical Positivism: Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called [[verification principle]]. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Francesco (1986), Il neopositivismo logico, Laterza, Roma Bari.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of ''phenomenalism'' in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called ''protocol sentences'', for example, "''X'' at location ''Y'' and at time ''T'' observes such and such."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, Nicholas]] (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic–synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as [[Nelson Goodman]], [[W.V. Quine]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Richard Rorty]].  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant  among contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] such as [[Michael Dummett]] and other [[anti-realism|anti-realists]].

===Pragmatism===
In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] arose.  The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s.  James popularized the term "pragmatism", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of "pragmaticism".  Along with its ''[[pragmatic theory of truth]]'', this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and [[rationalism|rational]] (concept-based) thinking.

[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
Charles Peirce (1839–1914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today's empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/peirce/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Burch|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes' peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright.  Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation.  In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the "data-driven" strict-empiricist view.

Among Peirce's major contributions was to place [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.  To this, Peirce added the concept of [[abductive reasoning]].  The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today.  Peirce's approach "presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.  According to Peirce's doctrine of [[fallibilism]], the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Teddy (n.d.), "Empiricism", [http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714183655/http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm |date=2012-07-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]]]]
In his Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the "three cotary propositions of pragmatism" ([[Latin|L:]] ''cos, cotis'' whetstone), saying that they "put the edge on the [[pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]]".  First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street.  That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses.  Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of [[abductive reasoning|abductive inference]], its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique—in a word, incorrigible.  This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or "thisness"—what the [[Scholastics]] called its ''[[haecceity]]''—that stands beyond control and correction.  Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.  This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]] research, most recently for instance with the work of [[Irvin Rock]] on ''[[indirect perception]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin (1983), The Logic of Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin, (1997) Indirect Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term "[[radical empiricism]]" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism—though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed "directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support",&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1911), The Meaning of Truth.&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any [[value added]] by seeking [[supernatural]] explanations for [[nature|natural]] [[phenomena]].  James' "radical empiricism" is thus ''not'' radical in the context of the term "empiricism", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term "[[empirical]]". His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) modified James' pragmatism to form a theory known as [[instrumentalism]].  The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated.  Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that [[reality]] is determined by past experience.  Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience.  The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1906), Studies in Logical Theory.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in physical sciences as in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jsp.2011.0000 |title=What Experimentalism Means in Ethics |year=2011 |last1=Weber |first1=Eric Thomas |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=25 |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known ''a posteriori''.

[[File:Genes hox.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.8|[[Homology (biology)|Homologous]] [[hox gene|''hox'' genes]] in such different animals as [[insect]]s and [[vertebrate]]s control [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] and hence the [[Morphology (biology)|form]] of adult bodies. These genes have been [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] through hundreds of millions of years of [[evolution]].]]

'''Evolutionary developmental biology''' (informally, '''evo-devo''') is a field of [[biological research]] that compares the [[developmental biology|developmental processes]] of different [[organism]]s to [[inference|infer]] the [[phylogeny|ancestral relationships]] between them and how developmental processes [[evolution|evolved]].

The field grew from 19th-century beginnings, where [[embryology]] faced a mystery: [[zoology|zoologists]] did not know how [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] was controlled at the [[molecular genetics|molecular level]]. [[Charles Darwin]] noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, [[recombinant DNA]] technology at last brought embryology together with [[molecular genetics]]. A key early discovery was of [[homeotic gene]]s that regulate development in a wide range of [[eukaryote]]s.

The field is characterised by some key concepts, which took [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]] by surprise. One is [[deep homology]], the finding that dissimilar organs such as the eyes of [[insect]]s, [[vertebrate]]s and [[cephalopod]] molluscs, long thought to have evolved separately, are controlled by similar genes such as ''[[pax-6]]'', from the [[evo-devo gene toolkit]]. These genes are ancient, being [[conserved sequence|highly conserved]] among [[Phylum|phyla]]; they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Another is that species do not differ much in their structural genes, such as those coding for [[enzyme]]s; what does differ is the way that [[regulation of gene expression|gene expression is regulated]] by the toolkit genes. These genes are reused, unchanged, many times in different parts of the embryo and at different stages of development, forming a complex cascade of control, switching other regulatory genes as well as structural genes on and off in a precise pattern. This multiple [[pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] reuse explains why these genes are highly conserved, as any change would have many adverse consequences which [[natural selection]] would oppose.

New [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] features and ultimately new species are produced by variations in the toolkit, either when genes are expressed in a new pattern, or when toolkit genes acquire additional functions. Another possibility is the [[Neo-Lamarckism|Neo-Lamarckian]] theory that [[epigenetics|epigenetic changes]] are later [[genetic assimilation|consolidated at gene level]], something that may have been important early in the history of multicellular life.

{{further|History of evolutionary thought}}

===Recapitulation===
{{main|Recapitulation theory}}

A [[recapitulation theory]] of evolutionary development was proposed by [[Étienne Serres]] in 1824–26, echoing the 1808 ideas of [[Johann Friedrich Meckel]]. They argued that the embryos of 'higher' animals went through or recapitulated a series of stages, each of which resembled an animal lower down the [[great chain of being]]. For example, the brain of a human embryo looked first like that of a [[fish]], then in turn like that of a [[reptile]], [[bird]], and [[mammal]] before becoming clearly [[human]]. The embryologist [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] opposed this, arguing in 1828 that there was no linear sequence as in the great chain of being, based on a single [[body plan]], but a process of [[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in which structures differentiate. Von Baer instead recognised four distinct animal [[body plan]]s: radiate, like [[starfish]]; molluscan, like [[clam]]s; articulate, like [[lobster]]s; and vertebrate, like fish. Zoologists then largely abandoned recapitulation, though [[Ernst Haeckel]] revived it in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connell |first1=Lindsey |title=The Meckel-Serres Conception of Recapitulation |url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/meckel-serres-conception-recapitulation |website=The Embryo Project Encyclopedia |accessdate=10 October 2016 |date=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Desmond |first=Adrian J. |authorlink=Adrian Desmond |title=The politics of evolution: morphology, medicine, and reform in radical London |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1989 |isbn=0-226-14374-0 |pages=53–53, 86–88, 337–340, 490–491}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|loc=p. 252–253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |title=Evolution: the history of an idea |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2003  |isbn=0-520-23693-9 |pages=120–128, 190–191, 208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Secord|2003|loc=p. 424, 512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary morphology===
[[File:Comparison of Three Invertebrate Chordates.svg|thumb|A. [[Lancelet]] (a chordate), B. Larval [[tunicate]], C. Adult tunicate. [[Alexander Kovalevsky|Kowalevsky]] saw that the [[notochord]] (1) and gill slit (5) are shared by tunicates and vertebrates.]]
{{further|Morphology (biology)|Body plan}}

From the early 19th century through most of the 20th century, [[embryology]] faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing [[body plan]], often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how  [[embryogenesis|embryonic development]] was controlled at the [[molecular biology|molecular level]], and therefore equally little about how [[developmental biology|developmental processes]] had evolved.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Sean B. |title=The Origins of Form |url=http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/features/061488/the-origins-of-form |website=Natural History |accessdate=9 October 2016 |quote=Biologists could say, with confidence, that forms change, and that natural selection is an important force for change. Yet they could say nothing about how that change is accomplished. How bodies or body parts change, or how new structures arise, remained complete mysteries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Darwin]] argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. As an example of this, Darwin cited in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' the [[shrimp]]-like [[larva]] of the [[barnacle]], whose [[Sessility (motility)|sessile]] adults looked nothing like other [[arthropods]]; [[Linnaeus]] and [[Cuvier]] had classified them as [[mollusc]]s.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilbert |first1=Scott F. |title=The morphogenesis of evolutionary developmental biology |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |date=2003 |volume=47 |pages=467–477 |url=http://www.chd.ucsd.edu/_files/fall2008/Gilbert.2003.IJDB.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin | title=On the Origin of Species| isbn=0-8014-1319-2 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1859| url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=457 |pages=439–440 |quote=Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin also noted [[Alexander Kovalevsky|Alexander Kowalevsky]]'s finding that the [[tunicate]], too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a [[notochord]] and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in [[vertebrate]]s, and should therefore be grouped with them as [[chordates]].&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Richmond | first=Marsha | title=Darwin's Study of the Cirripedia | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Richmond_cirripedia.html | publisher=Darwin Online | date=January 2007 | accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19th century zoology thus converted [[embryology]] into an evolutionary science, connecting [[phylogeny]] with [[homology (biology)|homologies]] between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including [[Fritz Müller]] proposed the use of embryology to discover [[phylogeny|phylogenetic relationships]] between taxa. Müller demonstrated that [[crustaceans]] shared the [[Crustacean larvae#Nauplius|Nauplius]] larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognised as crustaceans. Müller also recognised that [[natural selection]] must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt; Two of Haeckel's other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing ([[heterochrony]]) and changes in the positioning within the body ([[heterotopy]]) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B.

But for the next century, without molecular evidence, progress stalled.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;

===The modern synthesis of the early 20th century===
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}

In the so-called [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the early 20th century, [[Ronald Fisher]] brought together Darwin's theory of [[evolution]], with its insistence on natural selection, [[heredity]], and [[genotype|variation]], and [[Gregor Mendel]]'s [[Mendelian inheritance|laws of genetics]] into a coherent structure for [[evolutionary biology]]. Biologists assumed that an organism was a straightforward reflection of its component genes: the genes coded for proteins, which built the organism's body. Biochemical pathways (and, they supposed, new species) evolved through [[mutation]]s in these genes. It was a simple, clear and nearly comprehensive picture: but it did not explain embryology.&lt;ref name=Gilbert2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bock |first=Walter J. |date=July 1981 |title=Reviewed Work: ''The Evolutionary Synthesis. Perspectives on the Unification of Biology'' |journal=[[The Auk]] |location=McLean, VA |publisher=[[American Ornithologists' Union]] |volume=98 |issue=3 |pages=644–646 |issn=0004-8038 |jstor=4086148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolutionary embryologist [[Gavin de Beer]] anticipated evolutionary developmental biology in his 1930 book ''[[Embryos and Ancestors]]'',&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |author1link=Lewis I. Held |title=[[How the Snake Lost its Legs]]. Curious Tales from the Frontier of Evo-Devo |date=2014 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-1-107-62139-8 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; by showing that evolution could occur by [[heterochrony]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1977|pp=221–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as in [[paedomorphosis|the retention of juvenile features in the adult]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This, de Beer argued, could cause apparently sudden changes in the [[fossil record]], since embryos fossilise poorly. As the gaps in the fossil record had been used as an argument against Darwin's gradualist evolution, de Beer's explanation supported the Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Ingo Brigandt |year=2006 |title=Homology and heterochrony: the evolutionary embryologist Gavin Rylands de Beer (1899-1972) |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Zoology]] |volume=306B |issue=4 |pages=317–328 |doi=10.1002/jez.b.21100 |url=https://www.ualberta.ca/~brigandt/de_Beer.pdf |pmid=16506229}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite de Beer, the modern synthesis largely ignored embryonic development to explain the form of organisms, since population genetics appeared to be an adequate explanation of how forms evolved.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1991&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gilbert, S.

{{main|Lac operon}}

In 1961, [[Jacques Monod]], [[Jean-Pierre Changeux]] and [[François Jacob]] discovered the [[lac operon]] in the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. It was a cluster of [[gene]]s, arranged in a feedback [[control loop]] so that its products would only be made when "switched on" by an environmental stimulus. One of these products was [[β-galactosidase|an enzyme that splits a sugar]], lactose; and [[lactose]] itself was the stimulus that switched the genes on. This was a revelation, as it showed for the first time that genes, even in an organism as small as a bacterium, were subject to fine-grained control. The implication was that many other genes were also elaborately regulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Monod | first1=Jacques | author1link=Jacques Monod | last2=Changeux | first2=J.P. | last3=Jacob | first3=François | author3link=François Jacob | year=1963 | title=Allosteric proteins and cellular control systems |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology | volume=6 | issue=4 | pages=306–329 | doi=10.1016/S0022-2836(63)80091-1 | pmid=13936070 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birth of evo-devo and a second synthesis===
In 1977, a revolution in thinking about evolution and developmental biology began, with the arrival of [[recombinant DNA]] technology in [[genetics]], and the papers ''Ontogeny and Phylogeny'' by [[Stephen J.

==The control of body structure==
===Deep homology===
{{further|Deep homology}}

Roughly spherical eggs of different animals give rise to extremely different bodies, from jellyfish to lobsters, butterflies to elephants. Many of these organisms share the same structural genes for body{{hyp}}building&lt;!--nothing to do with steroids and gyms--&gt; proteins like collagen and enzymes, but biologists had expected that each group of animals would have its own rules of development. The surprise of evo-devo is that the shaping of bodies is controlled by a rather small percentage of genes, and that these regulatory genes are ancient, shared by all animals. The [[giraffe]] does not have a gene for a long neck, any more than the [[elephant]] has a gene for a big body. Their bodies are patterned by a system of switching which causes development of different features to begin earlier or later, to occur in this or that part of the embryo, and to continue for more or less time.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt;

The puzzle of how embryonic development was controlled began to be solved using the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' as a [[model organism]]. The step-by-step control of [[Drosophila embryogenesis|its embryogenesis]] was visualized by attaching [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; A dye such as [[green fluorescent protein]], originally from [[Aequorea victoria|a jellyfish]], was typically attached to an [[antibody]] specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fluorescent Probes |url=https://www.thermofisher.com/uk/en/home/life-science/protein-biology/protein-biology-learning-center/protein-biology-resource-library/pierce-protein-methods/fluorescent-probes.html# |publisher=ThermoFisher Scientific |accessdate=12 October 2016 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using such a technique, in 1994 [[Walter Gehring]] found that the ''[[pax-6]]'' gene, vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies, exactly matches an eye-forming gene in mice and humans. The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals, such as [[squid]], a [[cephalopod]] [[mollusc]]. Biologists including [[Ernst Mayr]] had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times, as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; For example, the fruit fly's [[compound eye]] is made of hundreds of small lensed structures ([[ommatidia]]); the [[human eye]] has a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] where the [[optic nerve]] enters the eye, and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the [[retina]], so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina, so the structure is effectively "upside-down"; in contrast, the cephalopod eye has the retina, then a layer of nerve fibres, then the wall of the eye "the right way around".&lt;ref name=Land1992&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.

===Gene toolkit ===
[[File:Hoxgenesoffruitfly.svg|Expression of [[Hox gene|homeobox (Hox) genes]] in the fruit fly|thumb|300px]]
{{main|Evo-devo gene toolkit}}

A small fraction of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among [[Phylum|phyla]], meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of [[signalling pathway]]s: they encode [[transcription factor]]s, [[cell adhesion]] proteins, cell surface [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] proteins and signalling [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligands]] that bind to them, and secreted [[morphogens]] that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the [[body plan]] of the organism. Among the most important toolkit genes are the [[Hox gene|''Hox'' genes]]. These transcription factors contain the [[homeobox]] protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit genes, and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;
Hox genes determine where repeating parts, such as the many [[vertebra]]e of [[snake]]s, will grow in a developing embryo or larva.&lt;ref name=CarrollNatHist/&gt; ''Pax-6'', already mentioned, is a classic toolkit gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xu, P.X. |author2=Woo, I. |author3=Her, H. |author4=Beier, D.R. |author5=Maas, R.L. |year=1997 |title=Mouse Eya homologues of the Drosophila eyes absent gene require Pax6 for expression in lens and nasal placode |journal=Development |volume=124 |issue=1 |pmid=9006082 |pages=219–231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homeobox]] genes are also found in plants, implying they are common to all [[eukaryote]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid19734295"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mukherjee, K. |author2=Brocchieri, L. |author3=Bürglin, T.R. | title=A comprehensive classification and evolutionary analysis of plant homeobox genes | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=26 | issue=12 | pages=2775–94 | date=December 2009 | pmid=19734295 | pmc=2775110 | doi=10.1093/molbev/msp201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9336443"&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Bürglin, T.R. | title=Analysis of TALE superclass homeobox genes (MEIS, PBC, KNOX, Iroquois, TGIF) reveals a novel domain conserved between plants and animals | journal=Nucleic Acids Research | volume=25 | issue=21 | pages=4173–80 | date=November 1997 | pmid=9336443 | pmc=147054 | doi= 10.1093/nar/25.21.4173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17501745"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Derelle, R. |author2=Lopez, P. |author3=Le Guyader, H. |author4=Manuel, M. | title=Homeodomain proteins belong to the ancestral molecular toolkit of eukaryotes | journal=Evolution &amp; Development | volume=9 | issue=3 | pages=212–9 | year=2007 | pmid=17501745 | doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2007.00153.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The embryo's regulatory networks===
[[File:Gene Regulatory Network.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[gene regulatory network]]]]
{{further|Regulation of gene expression|Transcriptional regulation}}

The protein products of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of [[pleiotropy]], being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular [[cis-regulatory element]]s. For example, while a non-pleiotropic [[rhodopsin]] gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element just a few hundred [[base pair]]s long, the pleiotropic [[eyeless]] cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; The [[gene regulatory network|regulatory networks]] involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls "scores to hundreds" of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt; All this complexity enables genes involved in the development of the embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, so what is switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;

[[File:Drosophila early embryo protein gradients.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Gene product distributions along the long axis of the early embryo of a [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]]]]

Such a cascading regulatory network has been studied in detail in the [[Drosophila embryogenesis|development of the fruit fly embryo]]. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a [[rugby ball]]. A small number of genes produce [[messenger RNA]]s that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the ''[[bicoid]]'' and ''hunchback'' genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the ''caudal'' and ''[[nanos (gene)|nanos]]'' genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of ''caudal'''s messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.&lt;ref name=Russel&gt;{{cite book | last=Russel | first=Peter | title=iGenetics: a molecular approach | year=2010 | publisher=Pearson Education | isbn=978-0-321-56976-9 | pages=564–571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Rivera-Pomar, Rolando |author2=Jackle, Herbert |year=1996 |title=From gradients to stripes in Drosophila embryogenesis: Filling in the gaps | journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=12 | issue=11 | pages=478–483 | doi=10.1016/0168-9525(96)10044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gap gene expression.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Gap gene]]s in the fruit fly are switched on by genes such as ''[[bicoid]]'', setting up stripes across the embryo which start to pattern the body's segments.]]

The Bicoid, Hunchback and Caudal proteins in turn regulate the transcription of [[gap gene]]s such as ''giant'', ''knirps'', ''Krüppel'', and ''tailless'' in a striped pattern, creating the first level of structures that will become segments.&lt;ref name="Nusslein"/&gt; The proteins from these in turn control the [[pair-rule gene]]s, which in the next stage set up 7 bands across the embryo's long axis. Finally, the segment polarity genes such as ''[[engrailed (gene)|engrailed]]'' split each of the 7 bands into two, creating 14 future segments.&lt;ref name=Russel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rivera/&gt;

This process explains the accurate conservation of toolkit gene sequences, which has resulted in deep homology and functional equivalence of toolkit proteins in dissimilar animals (seen, for example, when a mouse protein controls fruit fly development). The interactions of transcription factors and cis-regulatory elements, or of signalling proteins and receptors, become locked in through multiple usages, making almost any mutation deleterious and hence eliminated by natural selection.&lt;ref name=Carroll_2008/&gt;

==The origins of novelty ==
{{see also|History of evolutionary thought#21st century}}

Among the more surprising and, perhaps, counterintuitive (from a [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|neo-Darwinian]] viewpoint) results of recent research in evolutionary developmental biology is that the diversity of [[body plan]]s and [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] in organisms across many [[phylum|phyla]] are not necessarily reflected in diversity at the level of the sequences of genes, including those of the developmental genetic toolkit and other genes involved in development. Indeed, as John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner have noted, there is an apparent paradox: "where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gerhart |first=John |last2=Kirschner |first2=Marc | year=1997 | title=Cells, Embryos and Evolution| publisher=Blackwell Science |isbn=978-0-86542-574-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, if the observed morphological novelty between different [[clade]]s does not come from changes in gene sequences (such as by [[mutation (biology)|mutation]]), where does it come from?

Variations in the toolkit may have produced a large part of the morphological evolution of animals. The toolkit can drive evolution in two ways.

===Consolidation of epigenetic changes===
{{main|Genetic assimilation|Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance}}
{{further|Extended evolutionary synthesis}}

Evolutionary innovation may sometimes begin [[Lamarckism|in Lamarckian style]] with [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]] alterations of gene regulation or [[morphogenesis|phenotype generation]], subsequently [[genetic assimilation|consolidated by changes at the gene level]]. Epigenetic changes include modification of DNA by reversible methylation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epigenetic Inheritance and Evolution: The Lamarckian Dimension |last=Jablonka |first=Eva |last2=Lamb |first2=Marion |year=1995 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, New York |isbn=978-0-19-854063-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as nonprogrammed remoulding of the organism by physical and other environmental effects due to the inherent [[phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] of developmental mechanisms.&lt;ref name="West-Eberhard 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=West-Eberhard |first=M-J. |year=2003 |title=Developmental plasticity and evolution |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-512235-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The biologists [[Stuart Newman|Stuart A. Newman]] and [[Gerd Müller (theoretical biologist)|Gerd B. Müller]] have suggested that organisms early in the history of multicellular life were more susceptible to this second category of epigenetic determination than are modern organisms, providing a basis for early [[macroevolution]]ary changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Müller, Gerd B. |editor2=Newman, Stuart A. | year=2003 | title=[[Origination of Organismal Form |Origination of Organismal Form: Beyond the Gene in Developmental and Evolutionary Biology]] | publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental bias===
[[File:Chilipoda- Geophilomorpha (3309242471).jpg|thumb|Among the [[centipede]]s, all members of the [[Geophilomorpha]] are constrained by a developmental bias to have an odd number of segments, whether as few as 27 or as many as 191.]]

Development in specific lineages can be biased either positively, towards a given trajectory or phenotype,{{efn|Positive bias is sometimes called developmental drive.&lt;ref name=Arthur2001/&gt;}} or negatively, away from producing certain types of change; either may be absolute (the change is always or never produced) or relative. Evidence for any such direction in evolution is however hard to acquire. For example, in the [[gastropod]]s, the snail-type shell is always built as a tube that grows both in length and in diameter; selection has created a wide variety of shell shapes such as flat spirals, [[cowrie]]s and tall turret spirals within these constraints. Among the [[centipede]]s, the [[Lithobiomorpha]] always have 15 trunk segments as adults, probably the result of a developmental bias towards an odd number of trunk segments. Another centipede order, the [[Geophilomorpha]], the number of segments varies in different species between 27 and 191, but the number is always odd, making this an absolute constraint; almost all the odd numbers in that range are occupied by one or another species.&lt;ref name=Arthur2001&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arthur |first=W. |date=July 2001 |title=Developmental drive: an important determinant of the direction of phenotypic evolution |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=271–278 |pmid=11478524 |doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2001.003004271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arthur2002Centipedes&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Arthur |first=W. |date=October 2002 |title=The interaction between developmental bias and natural selection: from centipede segments to a general hypothesis |journal=Heredity |volume=89 |issue=4 |pages=239–246 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800139 |pmid=12242638}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ChipmanArthurAkam2004&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Chipman |first=Ariel D. |last2=Arthur |first2=Wallace |last3=Akam |first3=Michael |date=July 2004 |title=A Double Segment Periodicity Underlies Segment Generation in Centipede Development |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982204005184 |journal=Current Biology |volume=14 |issue=14 |pages=1250–1255 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.07.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''evolutionary history of life''' on Earth traces the processes by which both living [[organism]]s and [[fossil]] organisms evolved since life emerged on the planet, until the present.

=== Independent emergence on Earth ===
{{main|Abiogenesis}}
Life on Earth is based on [[carbon]] and water. Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment, especially from [[carbon dioxide]].&lt;ref name="PiP" /&gt; There is no other chemical element whose properties are similar enough to carbon's to be called an analogue; [[silicon]], the element directly below carbon on the [[periodic table]], does not form very many complex stable molecules, and because most of its compounds are water-insoluble, it would be more difficult for organisms to extract. The elements [[boron]] and [[phosphorus]] have more complex chemistries, but suffer from other limitations relative to carbon. Water is an excellent [[solvent]] and has two other useful properties: the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter; and its molecules have [[electric charge|electrically negative]] and positive ends, which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can. Other good solvents, such as [[ammonia]], are liquid only at such low temperatures that chemical reactions may be too slow to sustain life, and lack water's other advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bennett|2008|pp=[https://books.google.com/?id=lEQKnip7St4C&amp;pg=PA84 82–85]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms based on [[Hypothetical types of biochemistry|alternative biochemistry]] may, however, be possible on other planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schulze-Makuch |first1=Dirk |authorlink1=Dirk Schulze-Makuch |last2=Irwin |first2=Louis N. |date=April 2006 |title=The prospect of alien life in exotic forms on other worlds |journal=[[Naturwissenschaften]] |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=155–72 |bibcode=2006NW.....93..155S |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0078-6 |pmid=16525788 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on how life might have emerged from non-living chemicals focuses on three possible starting points: [[self-replication]], an organism's ability to produce offspring that are very similar to itself; metabolism, its ability to feed and repair itself; and external [[cell membrane]]s, which allow food to enter and waste products to leave, but exclude unwanted substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peretó |first=Juli |year=2005 |title=Controversies on the origin of life |url=http://www.im.microbios.org/0801/0801023.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[International Microbiology]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=23–31 |pmid=15906258 |accessdate=2007-10-07 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on abiogenesis still has a long way to go, since theoretical and [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] approaches are only beginning to make contact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Szathmáry |first=Eörs |authorlink=Eörs Szathmáry |date=February 3, 2005 |title=Life: In search of the simplest cell |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v433/n7025/full/433469a.html |journal=Nature |volume=433 |issue=7025 |pages=469–470 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..469S |doi=10.1038/433469a |accessdate=2008-09-01 |pmid=15690023 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Luisi |first1=Pier Luigi |authorlink1=Pier Luigi Luisi |last2=Ferri |first2=Francesca |last3=Stano |first3=Pasquale |date=January 2006 |title=Approaches to semi-synthetic minimal cells: a review |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=93 |issue=1 |pages=1–13 |bibcode=2006NW.....93....1L |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0056-z |pmid=16292523 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Metabolism first: Iron–sulfur world ====
{{main|Iron–sulfur world theory}}
A series of experiments starting in 1997 showed that early stages in the formation of proteins from inorganic materials including [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] could be achieved by using [[iron(II) sulfide|iron sulfide]] and [[nickel sulfide]] as [[catalyst]]s. Most of the steps required temperatures of about {{convert|100|°C|°F}} and moderate pressures, although one stage required {{convert|250|°C|°F}} and a pressure equivalent to that found under {{convert|7|km|mi}} of rock. Hence it was suggested that self-sustaining synthesis of proteins could have occurred near hydrothermal vents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wächtershäuser |first=Günter |authorlink=Günter Wächtershäuser |date=August 25, 2000 |title=Life as We Don't Know It |journal=Science |volume=289 |issue=5483 |pages=1307–1308 |doi=10.1126/science.289.5483.1307 |pmid=10979855 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The clay hypothesis ====
{{main|Graham Cairns-Smith#Clay hypothesis|RNA world hypothesis}}
RNA is complex and there are doubts about whether it can be produced non-biologically in the wild.&lt;ref name="RNANaturalSynthesisProblems" /&gt; Some [[clay]]s, notably [[montmorillonite]], have properties that make them plausible accelerators for the emergence of an RNA world: they grow by self-replication of their [[crystal]]line pattern; they are subject to an analog of natural selection, as the clay "species" that grows fastest in a particular environment rapidly becomes dominant; and they can catalyze the formation of RNA molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cairns-Smith|1968|pp=57–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this idea has not become the scientific consensus, it still has active supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ferris |first=James P. |date=June 1999 |title=Prebiotic Synthesis on Minerals: Bridging the Prebiotic and RNA Worlds |journal=[[The Biological Bulletin]] |volume=196 |issue=3 |pages=311–314 |doi=10.2307/1542957 |jstor=1542957 |pmid=10390828 |ref=harv}} "This paper was originally presented at a workshop titled ''Evolution: A Molecular Point of View''."&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in 2003 reported that montmorillonite could also accelerate the conversion of [[fatty acid]]s into "bubbles," and that the "bubbles" could encapsulate RNA attached to the clay. These "bubbles" can then grow by absorbing additional lipids and then divide. The formation of the earliest cells may have been aided by similar processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanczyc |first1=Martin M. |last2=Fujikawa |first2=Shelly M. |last3=Szostak |first3=Jack W. |authorlink3=Jack W.

===Chromatin, nucleus, endomembrane system, and mitochondria===
Eukaryotes may have been present long before the oxygenation of the atmosphere,&lt;ref name="GlansdorffXuLabedan2008LUCA" /&gt; but most modern eukaryotes require oxygen, which their [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] use to fuel the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], the internal energy supply of all known cells.&lt;ref name="HedgesBlairEtAl2004molecularTimescaleOfEukaryoteEvolution" /&gt; In the 1970s it was proposed and, after much debate, widely accepted that eukaryotes emerged as a result of a sequence of endosymbiosis between "[[prokaryote]]s." For example: a [[predator]]y microorganism invaded a large prokaryote, probably an [[archaea]]n, but the attack was neutralized, and the attacker took up residence and evolved into the first of the mitochondria; one of these [[Chimera (genetics)|chimera]]s later tried to swallow a photosynthesizing cyanobacterium, but the victim survived inside the attacker and the new combination became the ancestor of [[plant]]s; and so on. After each endosymbiosis began, the partners would have eliminated unproductive duplication of genetic functions by re-arranging their genomes, a process which sometimes involved transfer of genes between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Margulis|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vellai |first1=Tibor |last2=Vida |first2=Gábor |date=August 7, 1999 |title=The origin of eukaryotes: the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=266 |issue=1428 |pages=1571–1577 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1999.0817 |pmc=1690172 |pmid=10467746 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Selosse |first1=Marc-André |last2=Abert |first2=Béatrice |last3=Godelle |first3=Bernard |date=March 1, 2001 |title=Reducing the genome size of organelles favours gene transfer to the nucleus |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016953470002084X |journal=[[Trends (journals)|Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=135–141 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)02084-X |accessdate=2015-01-29 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis proposes that mitochondria were originally [[sulfur]]- or [[hydrogen]]-metabolising endosymbionts, and became oxygen-consumers later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pisani |first1=Davide |last2=Cotton |first2=James A. |last3=McInerney |first3=James O. |date=August 2007 |title=Supertrees Disentangle the Chimerical Origin of Eukaryotic Genomes |journal=[[Molecular Biology and Evolution]] |volume=24 |issue=8 |pages=1752–1760 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm095 |pmid=17504772 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, mitochondria might have been part of eukaryotes' original equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gray |first1=Michael W. |last2=Burger |first2=Gertraud |last3=Lang |first3=B.

[[Plastid]]s, the superclass of [[organelle]]s of which [[chloroplast]]s are the best-known exemplar, are thought to have originated from [[Endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] cyanobacteria.

=== Evolution of sexual reproduction ===
{{Main|Evolution of sexual reproduction|Sexual reproduction}}
The defining characteristics of [[sexual reproduction]] in eukaryotes are [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]]. There is much [[genetic recombination]] in this kind of reproduction, in which offspring receive 50% of their genes from each parent,&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; in contrast with [[asexual reproduction]], in which there is no recombination. Bacteria also exchange DNA by [[bacterial conjugation]], the benefits of which include resistance to [[antibiotic resistance|antibiotic]]s and other [[toxin]]s, and the ability to utilize new [[metabolite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holmes|Jobling|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conjugation is not a means of reproduction, and is not limited to members of the same species&amp;nbsp;– there are cases where bacteria transfer DNA to plants and animals.&lt;ref name="Christie, P. J. 2001 294–305"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Christie |first=Peter J. |date=April 2001 |title=Type IV secretion: intercellular transfer of macromolecules by systems ancestrally related to conjugation machines |journal=[[Molecular Microbiology (journal)|Molecular Microbiology]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=294–305 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.2001.02302.x |pmid=11309113 |pmc=3922410 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, bacterial transformation is clearly an adaptation for transfer of DNA between bacteria of the same species. Bacterial transformation is a complex process involving the products of numerous bacterial genes and can be regarded as a bacterial form of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michod |first1=Richard E. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Harris |last3=Nedelcu |first3=Aurora M. |date=May 2008 |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |url=http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[Infection, Genetics and Evolution]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=267–285 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 |pmid=18295550 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=Harris |last2=Bernstein |first2=Carol |date=July 2010|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis |journal=[[BioScience]] |volume=60 |issue=7 |pages=498–505 |doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5 |ref=harv|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 67 prokaryotic species (in seven different phyla).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnsborg |first1=Ola |last2=Eldholm |first2=Vegard |last3=Håvarstein |first3=Leiv Sigve |date=December 2007 |title=Natural genetic transformation: prevalence, mechanisms and function |journal=Research in Microbiology |volume=158 |issue=10 |pages=767–778 |doi=10.1016/j.resmic.2007.09.004 |pmid=17997281 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation.&lt;ref name="novapublishers.com"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|Bernstein|Michod|2012|pp=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also see [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Origin of sexual reproduction]].)

The disadvantages of sexual reproduction are well-known: the genetic reshuffle of recombination may break up favorable combinations of genes; and since males do not directly increase the number of offspring in the next generation, an asexual population can out-breed and displace in as little as 50 generations a sexual population that is equal in every other respect.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Neiman |first1=Maurine |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |last2=Jokela |first2=Jukka |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Life Sciences]] |year=2010 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=Hoboken, NJ |isbn=978-0-470-01617-6 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001716.pub2|chapter=Sex: Advantage }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the great majority of animals, plants, fungi and [[protist]]s reproduce sexually.

The [[Red Queen hypothesis]] suggests that sexual reproduction provides protection against [[parasite]]s, because it is easier for parasites to evolve means of overcoming the defenses of genetically identical [[cloning|clone]]s than those of sexual species that present moving targets, and there is some experimental evidence for this. However, there is still doubt about whether it would explain the survival of sexual species if multiple similar clone species were present, as one of the clones may survive the attacks of parasites for long enough to out-breed the sexual species.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; Furthermore, contrary to the expectations of the Red Queen hypothesis, Kathryn A. Hanley et al. found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites was significantly higher in sexual geckos than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hanley |first1=Kathryn A. |last2=Fisher |first2=Robert N. |last3=Case |first3=Ted J. |date=June 1995 |title=Lower Mite Infestations in an Asexual Gecko Compared With Its Sexual Ancestors |journal=[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]] |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=418–426 |doi=10.2307/2410266 |ref=harv|jstor=2410266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, biologist Matthew Parker, after reviewing numerous genetic studies on plant disease resistance, failed to find a single example consistent with the concept that pathogens are the primary selective agent responsible for sexual reproduction in the host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=Matthew A. |date=September 1994 |title=Pathogens and sex in plants |journal=Evolutionary Ecology |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=560–584 |doi=10.1007/bf01238258 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexey Kondrashov]]'s ''deterministic mutation hypothesis'' (DMH) assumes that each organism has more than one harmful mutation and the combined effects of these mutations are more harmful than the sum of the harm done by each individual mutation. If so, sexual recombination of genes will reduce the harm that bad mutations do to offspring and at the same time eliminate some bad mutations from the [[gene pool]] by isolating them in individuals that perish quickly because they have an above-average number of bad mutations. However, the evidence suggests that the DMH's assumptions are shaky because many species have on average less than one harmful mutation per individual and no species that has been investigated shows evidence of [[synergy]] between harmful mutations.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt; (Further criticisms of this hypothesis are discussed in the article [[Evolution of sexual reproduction#Removal of deleterious genes]])

The random nature of recombination causes the relative abundance of alternative traits to vary from one generation to another. This [[genetic drift]] is insufficient on its own to make sexual reproduction advantageous, but a combination of genetic drift and natural selection may be sufficient. When chance produces combinations of good traits, natural selection gives a large advantage to lineages in which these traits become genetically linked. On the other hand, the benefits of good traits are neutralized if they appear along with bad traits. Sexual recombination gives good traits the opportunities to become linked with other good traits, and mathematical models suggest this may be more than enough to offset the disadvantages of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="OttoGerstein2006WhySex" /&gt; Other combinations of hypotheses that are inadequate on their own are also being examined.&lt;ref name="Jokela2001SexAdvantage" /&gt;

The initial advantages of multicellularity may have included: more efficient sharing of nutrients that are digested outside the cell,&lt;ref name="Koschwanezetal2011PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koschwanez |first1=John H. |last2=Foster |first2=Kevin R. |last3=Murray |first3=Andrew W. |date=August 9, 2011 |title=Sucrose Utilization in Budding Yeast as a Model for the Origin of Undifferentiated Multicellularity |journal=PLOS Biology |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=e1001122 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001122 |pmid=21857801 |pmc=3153487 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; increased resistance to predators, many of which attacked by engulfing; the ability to resist currents by attaching to a firm surface; the ability to reach upwards to filter-feed or to obtain sunlight for photosynthesis;&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt; the ability to create an internal environment that gives protection against the external one;&lt;ref name="Bonner1999OriginsOfMulticellularity" /&gt; and even the opportunity for a group of cells to behave "intelligently" by sharing information.&lt;ref name="NakagakiYamadaTóth2000Intelligence"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nakagaki |first1=Toshiyuki |last2=Yamada |first2=Hiroyasu |last3=Tóth |first3=Ágota |date=September 28, 2000 |title=Intelligence: Maze-solving by an amoeboid organism |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v407/n6803/abs/407470a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=407 |issue=6803 |pages=470 |doi=10.1038/35035159 |pmid=11028990 |accessdate=2008-09-03 |ref=harv|bibcode=2000Natur.407..470N }}&lt;/ref&gt; These features would also have provided opportunities for other organisms to diversify, by creating more varied environments than flat microbial mats could.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

Multicellularity with differentiated cells is beneficial to the organism as a whole but disadvantageous from the point of view of individual cells, most of which lose the opportunity to reproduce themselves. In an asexual multicellular organism, rogue cells which retain the ability to reproduce may take over and reduce the organism to a mass of undifferentiated cells. Sexual reproduction eliminates such rogue cells from the next generation and therefore appears to be a prerequisite for complex multicellularity.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

The available evidence indicates that eukaryotes evolved much earlier but remained inconspicuous until a rapid diversification around 1 Ga. The only respect in which eukaryotes clearly surpass bacteria and archaea is their capacity for variety of forms, and sexual reproduction enabled eukaryotes to exploit that advantage by producing organisms with multiple cells that differed in form and function.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2000Bangiomorpha" /&gt;

By comparing the composition of transcription factor families and regulatory network motifs between unicellular organisms and multicellular organisms, scientists found there are many novel transcription factor families and three novel types of regulatory network motifs in multicellular organisms, and novel family transcription factors are preferentially wired into these novel network motifs which are essential for multicullular development. These results propose a plausible mechanism for the contribution of novel-family transcription factors and novel network motifs to the origin of multicellular organisms at transcriptional regulatory level.&lt;ref name="MBE_1767"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin JP, et al. | title= An Arabidopsis transcriptional regulatory map reveals distinct functional and evolutionary features of novel transcription factors|journal= Molecular Biology and Evolution | date=July 2015 |volume=32 |issue=7|doi=10.1093/molbev/msv058 |url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/7/1767.full |pmid=25750178 |pmc=4476157 |pages=1767–1773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[small shelly fauna]] are a very mixed collection of fossils found between the Late Ediacaran and [[Cambrian Series 3|Middle Cambrian]] periods.

=== Evolution of terrestrial antioxidants ===
Oxygen is a potent [[Oxidizing agent|oxidant]] whose accumulation in terrestrial atmosphere resulted from the development of [[photosynthesis]] over 3 Ga, in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), which were the most primitive oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Brown algae accumulate inorganic mineral [[antioxidant]]s such as [[rubidium]], [[vanadium]], [[zinc]], iron, [[copper]], [[molybdenum]], [[selenium]] and [[iodine]] which is concentrated more than 30,000 times the concentration of this element in seawater. Protective endogenous antioxidant enzymes and exogenous dietary antioxidants helped to prevent oxidative damage. Most marine mineral antioxidants act in the cells as essential [[trace element]]s in [[redox]] and antioxidant [[Metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]].

When plants and animals began to enter rivers and land about 500 Ma, environmental deficiency of these marine mineral antioxidants was a challenge to the evolution of terrestrial life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Venturi |first=Sebastiano |date=September 2011 |title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine |journal=Current Chemical Biology |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=155–162 |doi=10.2174/187231311796765012 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crockford |first=Susan J. |date=August 2009 |title=Evolutionary roots of iodine and thyroid hormones in cell-cell signaling |journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=155–166 |doi=10.1093/icb/icp053 |pmid=21669854 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terrestrial plants slowly optimized the production of “new” endogenous antioxidants such as [[ascorbic acid]], [[polyphenol]]s, [[flavonoid]]s, [[tocopherol]]s, etc. A few of these appeared more recently, in last 200–50 Ma, in [[fruit]]s and [[flower]]s of [[angiosperm]] plants.

In fact, angiosperms (the dominant type of plant today) and most of their antioxidant pigments evolved during the [[Late Jurassic]] period. Plants employ antioxidants to defend their structures against [[reactive oxygen species]] produced during photosynthesis. Animals are exposed to the same oxidants, and they have evolved endogenous enzymatic antioxidant systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venturi |first1=Sebastiano |last2=Donati |first2=Francesco M. |last3=Venturi |first3=Alessandro |last4=Venturi |first4=Mattia |date=August 2000 |title=Environmental Iodine Deficiency: A Challenge to the Evolution of Terrestrial Life? |journal=[[Thyroid (journal)|Thyroid]] |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=727–729 |doi=10.1089/10507250050137851 |pmid=11014322 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iodine]] is the most primitive and abundant electron-rich essential element in the diet of marine and terrestrial organisms, and as iodide acts as an [[electron donor]] and has this ancestral antioxidant function in all iodide-concentrating cells from primitive marine algae to more recent terrestrial vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Küpper |first1=Frithjof C. |last2=Carpenter |first2=Lucy J. |last3=McFiggans |first3=Gordon B. |last4=Palmer |first4=Carl J. |last5=Waite |first5=Tim J. |last6=Boneberg |first6=Eva-Maria |last7=Woitsch |first7=Sonja |last8=Weiller |first8=Markus |last9=Abela |first9=Rafael |date=May 13, 2008 |title=Iodide accumulation provides kelp with an inorganic antioxidant impacting atmospheric chemistry |journal=Proc.

In aquatic algae, almost all cells are capable of photosynthesis and are nearly independent.

By the Late Devonian {{ma|370|Ma|Devonian}}, trees such as ''[[Archaeopteris]]'' were so abundant that they changed river systems from mostly [[braided river|braided]] to mostly [[meander]]ing, because their roots bound the soil firmly.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Briggs and Crowther 2001|Scheckler 2001]], "Afforestation—the First Forests," pp. 67–70&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, they caused the "Late Devonian wood crisis"&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "Late Devonian wood crisis" is used at {{cite web |url=http://palaeos.com/vertebrates/tetrapoda/acanthostega.html |title=Tetrapoda: ''Acanthostega'' |website=[[Palaeos]] |accessdate=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; because:
* They removed more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, reducing the [[greenhouse effect]] and thus causing an [[ice age]] in the [[Carboniferous]] period.&lt;ref name="AlgeoScheckler1998errestrialMarineTeleconnectionsInDevonian"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Algeo |first1=Thomas J. |last2=Scheckler |first2=Stephen E. |date=January 29, 1998 |title=Terrestrial-marine teleconnections in the Devonian: links between the evolution of land plants, weathering processes, and marine anoxic events |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=353 |issue=1365 |pages=113–130 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1998.0195 |pmc=1692181 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later ecosystems the carbon dioxide "locked up" in wood is returned to the atmosphere by decomposition of dead wood.

* The increasing depth of plants' roots led to more washing of nutrients into rivers and seas by rain. This caused [[algal bloom]]s whose high consumption of oxygen caused [[anoxic event]]s in deeper waters, increasing the extinction rate among deep-water animals.&lt;ref name="AlgeoScheckler1998errestrialMarineTeleconnectionsInDevonian" /&gt;

=== Land invertebrates ===
Animals had to change their feeding and [[Excretion|excretory]] systems, and most land animals developed [[internal fertilization]] of their eggs.&lt;ref name="Garwood" /&gt; The difference in [[refractive index]] between water and air required changes in their eyes. On the other hand, in some ways movement and breathing became easier, and the better transmission of high-frequency sounds in air encouraged the development of [[hearing]].&lt;ref name="Selden2001TerrestrializationOfAnimals" /&gt;

The [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]] of other major invertebrate groups on land is poor: none at all for non-[[Parasitism|parasitic]] [[flatworm]]s, [[nematode]]s or [[nemertea]]ns; some parasitic nematodes have been fossilized in [[amber]]; annelid worm fossils are known from the Carboniferous, but they may still have been aquatic animals; the earliest fossils of [[Gastropoda|gastropod]]s on land date from the Late Carboniferous, and this group may have had to wait until [[Plant litter|leaf litter]] became abundant enough to provide the moist conditions they need.&lt;ref name="Selden2001TerrestrializationOfAnimals"&gt;[[#Briggs and Crowther 2001|Selden 2001]], "Terrestrialization of Animals," pp. 71–74&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest confirmed fossils of flying [[insect]]s date from the Late Carboniferous, but it is thought that insects developed the ability to fly in the Early Carboniferous or even Late Devonian. This gave them a wider range of [[ecological niche]]s for feeding and breeding, and a means of escape from predators and from unfavorable changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|Engel|2005|pp=155–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 99% of modern insect species fly or are descendants of flying species.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grimaldi|Engel|2005|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;Family tree of [[tetrapod]]s&lt;ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
[[Tetrapod]]s, vertebrates with four limbs, evolved from other [[rhipidistia]]n fish over a relatively short timespan during the Late Devonian ({{ma|370|360|Ma|Devonian}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gordon |first1=Malcolm S. |last2=Graham |first2=Jeffrey B. |last3=Wang |first3=Tobias |date=September–October 2004 |title=Introduction to the Special Collection: Revisiting the Vertebrate Invasion of the Land |journal=[[Physiological and Biochemical Zoology]] |volume=77 |issue=5 |pages=697–699 |doi=10.1086/425182 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early groups are grouped together as [[Labyrinthodontia]]. They retained aquatic, fry-like [[tadpole]]s, a system still seen in [[Lissamphibia|modern amphibians]]. 

Iodine and T4/T3  stimulate the amphibian metamorphosis and the [[evolution of nervous systems]] transforming the aquatic, vegetarian tadpole into  a “more evoluted” terrestrial, carnivorous frog with better neurological, visuospatial, olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Venturi, Sebastiano|title=Evolutionary Significance of Iodine|journal=Current Chemical Biology-|volume=5 |pages=155–162|year=2011|doi=10.2174/187231311796765012|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new hormonal action of T3 was made possible by the formation of T3-receptors in the cells of vertebrates. Firstly, about 600-500 million years ago, in primitive Chordata appeared the alpha T3-receptors with a metamorphosing action and then, about 250-150 million years ago, in the Birds and Mammalia appeared the beta T3-receptors with metabolic and thermogenetic actions.&lt;ref name=Venturi&gt;{{cite book | last = Venturi | first = S |author2=Bégin ME | year = 2010 | chapter = Thyroid Hormone, Iodine and Human Brain Evolution | title= Environmental Influences on Human Brain Evolution | editors = Cunnane S; Stewart K | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=gfkRnv20GtsC&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 105–124] | isbn = 978-0-470-45268-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s to the early 1980s it was thought that tetrapods evolved from fish that had already acquired the ability to crawl on land, possibly in order to go from a pool that was drying out to one that was deeper. However, in 1987, nearly complete fossils of ''[[Acanthostega]]'' from about {{ma|363|Ma|Devonian}} showed that this Late Devonian [[Transitional fossil|transitional]] animal had [[leg]]s and both [[lung]]s and [[gill]]s, but could never have survived on land: its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight; its fish-like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground. The current hypothesis is that ''Acanthostega'', which was about {{convert|1|m|ft}} long, was a wholly aquatic predator that hunted in shallow water&lt;!-- , using its limbs to hold on to vegetation while it lay in ambush --&gt;. Its skeleton differed from that of most fish, in ways that enabled it to raise its head to breathe air while its body remained submerged, including: its jaws show modifications that would have enabled it to gulp air; the bones at the back of its skull are locked together, providing strong attachment points for muscles that raised its head; the head is not joined to the [[shoulder girdle]] and it has a distinct neck.&lt;ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clack |first=Jennifer A. |authorlink=Jenny Clack |date=December 2005 |title=Getting a Leg Up on Land |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/getting-a-leg-up-on-land/ |journal=Scientific American |volume=293 |issue=6 |pages=100–107 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1205-100 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |ref=harv |pmid=16323697|bibcode=2005SciAm.293f.100C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Devonian proliferation of land plants may help to explain why air breathing would have been an advantage: leaves falling into streams and rivers would have encouraged the growth of aquatic vegetation; this would have attracted grazing invertebrates and small fish that preyed on them; they would have been attractive prey but the environment was unsuitable for the big marine predatory fish; air-breathing would have been necessary because these waters would have been short of oxygen, since warm water holds less [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]] than cooler marine water and since the decomposition of vegetation would have used some of the oxygen.&lt;ref name="Clack2005GettingLegUp" /&gt;

Later discoveries revealed earlier transitional forms between ''Acanthostega'' and completely fish-like animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Daeschler |first1=Edward B. |authorlink1=Ted Daeschler |last2=Shubin |first2=Neil H. |authorlink2=Neil Shubin |last3=Jenkins |first3=Farish A., Jr. |authorlink3=Farish Jenkins |date=April 6, 2006 |title=A Devonian tetrapod-like fish and the evolution of the tetrapod body plan |url=http://courses.washington.edu/bio354/Paper%203.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=757–763 |issue=7085 |bibcode=2006Natur.440..757D |doi=10.1038/nature04639 |pmid=16598249 |accessdate=2015-02-12 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, there is then a gap ([[Romer's gap]]) of about 30 Ma between the fossils of ancestral tetrapods and Middle Carboniferous fossils of vertebrates that look well-adapted for life on land. Some of these look like early relatives of modern amphibians, most of which need to keep their skins moist and to lay their eggs in water, while others are accepted as early relatives of the [[amniote]]s, whose waterproof skin and egg membranes enable them to live and breed far from water.&lt;ref name="AhlbergMilner1994OriginOfTetrapods"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ahlberg |first1=Per E. |authorlink1=Per E.

== Social insects ==

{{main|Eusociality}}
The social insects are remarkable because the great majority of individuals in each colony are sterile. This appears contrary to basic concepts of evolution such as natural selection and the [[Gene-centered view of evolution|selfish gene]]. In fact, there are very few [[Eusociality|eusocial]] insect species: only 15 out of approximately 2,600 living [[family (biology)|families]] of insects contain eusocial species, and it seems that eusociality has evolved independently only 12 times among arthropods, although some eusocial lineages have diversified into several families. Nevertheless, social insects have been spectacularly successful; for example although [[ant]]s and [[termite]]s account for only about 2% of known insect species, they form over 50% of the total mass of insects. Their ability to control a territory appears to be the foundation of their success.&lt;ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Edward O. |authorlink1=E. O.

The sacrifice of breeding opportunities by most individuals has long been explained as a consequence of these species' unusual [[Haplodiploidy|haplodiploid]] method of [[sex-determination system|sex determination]], which has the paradoxical consequence that two sterile worker daughters of the same queen share more genes with each other than they would with their offspring if they could breed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=William O.

O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]] argue that this explanation is faulty: for example, it is based on [[kin selection]], but there is no evidence of [[nepotism]] in colonies that have multiple queens. Instead, they write, eusociality evolves only in species that are under strong pressure from predators and competitors, but in environments where it is possible to build "fortresses"; after colonies have established this security, they gain other advantages through co-operative [[foraging]]. In support of this explanation they cite the appearance of eusociality in [[Blesmol|bathyergid]] mole rats,&lt;ref name="WilsonHölldobler2005EusocialityOriginConsequences" /&gt; which are not haplodiploid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lovegrove |first=Barry G. |date=January 1991 |title=The evolution of eusociality in molerats (Bathyergidae): a question of risks, numbers, and costs |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |doi=10.1007/BF00172137 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest fossils of insects have been found in Early Devonian rocks from about {{ma|400|Ma|Devonian}}, which preserve only a few varieties of flightless insect. The [[Mazon Creek fossil beds|Mazon Creek lagerstätten]] from the Late Carboniferous, about {{ma|300|Ma|Carboniferous}}, include about 200 species, some gigantic by modern standards, and indicate that insects had occupied their main modern ecological niches as [[herbivore]]s, [[detritivore]]s and insectivores. Social termites and ants first appear in the Early Cretaceous, and advanced social bees have been found in Late Cretaceous rocks but did not become abundant until the Middle [[Cenozoic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Labandeira|Eble|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that, along with other life forms, modern-day humans evolved from an ancient, common ancestor was proposed by [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]] in 1844 and taken up by [[Charles Darwin]] in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c8 |title=Darwin &amp; the Descent of Man |last=Montgomery |first=Stephen |year=2009 |website=Charles Darwin &amp; Evolution |publisher=[[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's College]] |location=Cambridge |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225222347/http://darwin200.christs.cam.ac.uk/pages/index.php?page_id=c8 |archivedate=2015-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans evolved from a lineage of upright-walking [[ape]]s that has been traced back over {{ma|6|Ma}} to ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brunet |first1=Michel |authorlink1=Michel Brunet (paleontologist) |last2=Guy |first2=Franck |last3=Pilbeam |first3=David |authorlink3=David Pilbeam |last4=Mackaye |first4=Hassane Taisso |last5=Likius |first5=Andossa |last6=Ahounta |first6=Djimdoumalbaye |last7=Beauvilain |first7=Alain |last8=Blondel |first8=Cécile |date=July 11, 2002 |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/abs/nature00879.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |doi=10.1038/nature00879 |pmid=12110880 |accessdate=2008-09-09 |display-authors=3 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known [[stone tool]]s were made about {{ma|2.5|Ma}}, apparently by ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'', and were found near animal bones that bear scratches made by these tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=de Heinzelin |first1=Jean |authorlink1=Jean de Heinzelin de Braucourt |last2=Clark |first2=J.

== Mass extinctions ==
{{main|Extinction event}}
{{annotated image/Extinction|caption=Apparent extinction intensity, i.e. the fraction of [[Genus|genera]] going extinct at any given time, as reconstructed from the [[Fossil#Fossil record|fossil record]]. (Graph not meant to include the recent, ongoing [[Holocene extinction]] event).}}
Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since {{ma|542|Ma}}. Although they were disasters at the time, mass extinctions have sometimes accelerated the evolution of life on Earth. When dominance of particular ecological niches passes from one group of organisms to another, it is rarely because the new dominant group is "superior" to the old and usually because an extinction event eliminates the old dominant group and makes way for the new one.&lt;ref name="Van Valkenburgh 1999 463–493" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benton|2005a|loc=Chapter 6: "Tetrapods of the Triassic"}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Phanerozoic biodiversity | float=right}}
The fossil record appears to show that the gaps between mass extinctions are becoming longer and the average and background rates of extinction are decreasing. Both of these phenomena could be explained in one or more ways:&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firstscience.com/SITE/ARTICLES/macleod.asp |title=Extinction! |last=MacLeod |first=Norman |date=January 6, 2001 |website=FirstScience.com |accessdate=2015-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The oceans may have become more hospitable to life over the last 500&amp;nbsp;Ma and less vulnerable to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of [[eutrophication]] and anoxic events; and marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains were less likely to be disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1995 |title=Cyclic and secular variation in microfossil biomineralization: clues to the biogeochemical evolution of Phanerozoic oceans |journal=[[Global and Planetary Change]] |volume=11 |issue=1–2 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1016/0921-8181(94)00011-2 |bibcode=1995GPC....11....1M |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Ronald E. |date=June 1996 |title=Secular Increase in Nutrient Levels through the Phanerozoic: Implications for Productivity, Biomass, and Diversity of the Marine Biosphere |journal=PALAIOS |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=209–219 |doi=10.2307/3515230 |jstor=3515230 |ref=harv|bibcode=1996Palai..11..209M }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reasonably complete fossils are very rare, most extinct organisms are represented only by partial fossils, and complete fossils are rarest in the oldest rocks. So paleontologists have mistakenly assigned parts of the same organism to different genera, which were often defined solely to accommodate these finds—the story of ''[[Anomalocaris]]'' is an example of this. The risk of this mistake is higher for older fossils because these are often both unlike parts of any living organism and poorly conserved. Many of the "superfluous" genera are represented by fragments which are not found again and the "superfluous" genera appear to become extinct very quickly.&lt;ref name="MacLeod2001Extinction" /&gt;

[[Biodiversity]] in the fossil record, which is "...the number of distinct genera alive at any given time; that is, those whose first occurrence predates and whose last occurrence postdates that time"&lt;ref name="RohdeMuller2005" /&gt; shows a different trend: a fairly swift rise from {{ma|542|400|Ma}}; a slight decline from {{ma|400|200|Ma}}, in which the devastating Permian–Triassic extinction event is an important factor; and a swift rise from {{ma|200|Ma}} to the present.&lt;ref name="RohdeMuller2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rohde |first1=Robert A. |authorlink1=Robert Rohde |last2=Muller |first2=Richard A. |authorlink2=Richard A.

'''fraLine''' is a non-profit (research) project of [[Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-university.de/de/fachbereiche/fb2/forschung_institute_projekte/fraline.html Project on the Website of the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; Project and research activities focus on IT services management for schools and the use of digital media in educational settings. fraLine is also a joint project between the University of Applied Sciences and the city of [[Frankfurt]] am Main (represented by the "Stadtschulamt" = municipal school-maintaining body).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=4096&amp;_ffmpar_id_inhalt=20557 City of Frankfurt website]&lt;/ref&gt; fraLine and the city of Frankfurt cooperate in the fields of IT support and IT service management in educational contexts as well as technical implementation of digital media in class. fraLine also cooperates with the Hessian state education authority ("[[:de:Staatliches Schulamt|Staatliches Schulamt]]") in the field of media education and digital media training for teachers. 
fraLine was launched in 2001 and employs mainly technical students of the University of Applied Sciences and [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], but also IT professionals, engineers and media educators.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [http://www.thomas-knaus.de Dr. Thomas Knaus] and [http://fraline.de/personen/team fraLine team page]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and development projects==

===Projects===
fraLine conducts research in the fields of [[IT service management]] according to [[ITIL]] recommendations&lt;ref&gt;cf. e.g. [http://fraline.de/images/Downloads/Qualifikationsarbeiten/diplomarbeit_itil_schmelz_09Aug.pdf "Analysis of ITSM elements in the technical support for schools of a major school-maintaining body as to their consistency with ITIL recommendations" by Anthony Schmelz]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the field of IT support and digital media use in educational contexts including [[educational software]], [[media literacy]] etc. 
Research results and concepts are provided to the city of Frankfurt ("Stadtschulamt") for the improvement of information technology in schools and the establishment of a centrally managed school IT infrastructure in the municipal area. Therefore, fraLine also offers advisory services to the city of Frankfurt, to all municipal schools as well as other educational institutions on topics such as acquisition of computers or computer parts, hardware, IT security, remote service etc.

Research in technical areas is complemented by studies in media education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomas-knaus.de/index.php/en/research Research projects by Dr. Thomas Knaus]&lt;/ref&gt; Results in the field of media education and current media projects are presented on the annual expert conference "fraMediale"&lt;ref&gt;The list of speakers in 2009 included the mayor of Frankfurt Mrs. [[Jutta Ebeling]] and the President of the University of Applied Sciences Frankfurt Dr.-Ing. [[Detlev Buchholz]] as well as several representatives of "Project Lehr@mt" at Frankfurt Goethe University [http://www.zlf.uni-frankfurt.de/wir-ueber-uns/neue-medien/index.html "Project Lehr@mt"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.framediale.de Conference webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; which is hosted and organized by fraLine.&lt;ref&gt;A conference volume is published by "kopaed" (German publishing house) under the title [http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=697 "fraMediale - digitale Medien in Bildungseinrichtungen"]&lt;/ref&gt;

fraLine developed the "fraDesk", a multi-user capable [[trouble ticket system]] for coordinating and documenting customer requests, incident reports or general processes based on division of labor. fraLine uses this software in its own everyday routine. The "fraDesk" is free software and was presented at the [[CeBIT]] 2008 in [[Hanover]], Germany.

Other research projects conducted by fraLine employees&lt;ref&gt;cp. [http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications/academic-papers-and-reports List of publications on the project webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; include the development of standard resource administration and user management for schools, improvement of school support via remote maintenance and support, but also media educational topics such as content filtering, evaluation of [[educational software]] and media communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kopaed.de/kopaedshop/index.php?PRODUCT_ID=637 "Kommunigrafie - eine empirische Studie zur Bedeutung von Text und Bild in der digitalen Kommunikation" ("An empirical study concerning the meaning of text and image in digital communication") by Dr. Thomas Knaus ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge base for teachers===
fraLine publishes relevant information for schools as well as research results in the form of test reports and academic papers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/en/publications Test reports and academic papers]&lt;/ref&gt; a glossary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraline.de/index.php/de/glossar Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; and a large set of FAQ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fraline.de/faq/ fraLine "FAQ" knowledge database"]&lt;/ref&gt; The FAQ database is a practical [[knowledge base]] [[Knowledge base]] and used as a point of reference for local teachers and others. It includes technical tutorials and information on the Frankfurt local school network, operating systems, software, hardware, peripheral equipment, the Internet, licenses and rights of utilization. 
Additionally, fraLine offers tutorials and introductory courses imparting theoretical and practical knowledge to school teachers and school IT representatives in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt für die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support services for schools==
The fraLine student team offers practical IT support to all 152 schools in Frankfurt by operating a telephone hotline, the Internet-based helpdesk "fraDesk" and through on-site service. Financed by public funds through the city of Frankfurt the service is free of charge for schools. It covers everyday troubleshooting relating to [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]], as well as software installation, actualisation and handling. In order to coordinate its support services, fraLine cooperates with so-called "IT representatives" in every school. They are appointed by their school principals and responsible for collecting IT-incidents and requests in their schools and communicating them to fraLine. Here, fraLine functions as first point of contact ("single-point-of-contact"). If problems cannot be solved by telephone, fraLine employees visit schools on-site or help them to refer their request to the competent authorities (e.g. school maintaining body ("Stadtschulamt"), or the Department of Information and Communicational Technology).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Deutschherrenschule (secondary school in Frankfurt) includes fraLine in its [http://www.schuleundzukunft.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Medienschulen/Medienkonzept_Deutschherrenschule.pdf  "media concept" (page 3f.)]&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes criticized that IT-support carried out by students does not match the schools´ need for a "professional" support. On the other hand, only senior students who are identified as possessing the necessary qualifications are accepted at the project. 
In addition to the technical support, fraLine also offers training courses for teachers and school administration staff in the fields of IT-infrastructure and media use in educational contexts.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Online platform for providers of seminars and workshops in Frankfurt hosted by the state education authority ("Staatliches Schulamt für die Stadt Frankfurt am Main") [http://www.medienbildung-frankfurt.de/ "Regionale Medienbildung"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
As another way to support schools, fraLine launched the project "educational-technical assistance". As part of this project, fraLine employees accompany teachers during class offering them technical assistance with the digital media devices they plan to use in their lesson. The project aims at reducing technical insecurities of teachers and wants to promote a broader use of digital media in education.

==Partnerships, cooperations and awards==
fraLine contributes to various multi-organisational and interdisciplinary initiatives in Frankfurt am Main, in the federal state of Hesse and in Germany responding to the growing demand for a sensible use of media in education. Thus, fraLine maintains close partnerships with its sister projects in Bremen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schul-support-service.de/ School support service in the city of Bremen "S3"]&lt;/ref&gt; and Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://3s.hh.schule.de/ School support service in the city of Hamburg "3S"]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2007, fraLine was awarded with the "Germany – Land of Ideas" award. "Land of Ideas" is an initiative under the patronage of former German Federal President [[Horst Köhler]]. Public or private institutions that have developed innovations and ideas are nominated as so-called "landmarks in the land of ideas" for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.land-of-ideas.org/CDA/landmark_of_the_day,6482,1,,en.html?action=detail&amp;id=3303 ''Land of Ideas'' (June 10, 2008), "A Win-Win Situation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''frond''' is a large, divided [[leaf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Raven| first= Evert Eichhorn| year=2004| title= The Biology of Plants| edition= 7th | publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company| location= New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both common usage and botanical nomenclature, the leaves of [[fern]]s are referred to as fronds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Gifford |first1=Ernest M. |first2= Adriance S. |last2=Foster| year= 1989| title= Morphology and Evolution of Vascular Plants|edition= 3rd |publisher= W.H. Freeman and Company| location= New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some botanists restrict the term to this group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1= Walter S. | last1= Judd| first2= Christopher S. | last2= Campbell| first3= Michael J. | last3= Donoghue| first4= Elizabeth A. | last4= Kellogg| first5=  Peter F. | last5= Stevens |year= 2007| title= Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach|edition= 3rd |publisher= Sinauer| location= Sunderland, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other botanists allow the term frond to also apply to the large leaves of [[cycad]]s and palms ([[Arecaceae]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= David L. | last= Jones| year= 1993| title= Cycads of the World| publisher= Smithsonian Institution Press, USA| isbn= 0730103382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Michael| last= Allaby| year= 1992| title= The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Botany| publisher= Oxford University Press| location= Oxford, UK| isbn= 9780192860941}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Frond" is commonly used to identify a large, compound leaf, but if the term is used botanically to refer to the leaves of ferns, it may be applied to smaller and undivided leaves.

Fronds have particular terms describing their components.  Like all leaves, fronds usually have a stalk connecting them to the main stem.  In [[botany]], this leaf stalk is generally called a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], but in regard to fronds specifically it is called a [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]], and it supports a flattened blade (which may be called a lamina), and the continuation of the stipe into this portion is called the rachis. The blades may be simple (undivided), pinnatifid (deeply incised, but not truly compound), [[pinnate]] (compound with the leaflets arranged along a rachis to resemble a feather), or further [[Leaf#Divisions_of_the_blade|compound]] (subdivided).  If compound, a frond may be compound once, twice, or more.

==Pinnate fronds==
If a frond is pinnate, each leafy segment of the blade is called a pinna (plural pinnae), the stalk bearing the pinna a petiolule, and the main vein or mid-rib of the pinna a costa (plural costae).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Walters| first= Keil| year= 1996| title= Vascular Plant Taxonomy| edition= 4th |publisher= Kendall Hunt Publishing Co. |location= Dubuque, Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a frond is divided into pinnae, the frond is called once pinnate. In some fronds the pinna are further divided into segments, creating a bipinnate frond. The segments into which each pinna are divided are called pinnules. Rarely, a frond may even be tripinnate, in which case the pinnule divisions are known as ultimate segments. Pinnae may be arranged along the rachis either directly opposite one another or alternating up the stem. The arrangement may change from the base of a blade to the tip, as in the example of ''[[Blechnum]]'' shown below (from base to tip: pinnae opposite to alternate, and pinnatisect to pinnatifid). 

Some fronds are not pinnately compound (or simple), but may be [[leaf shape|palmate]] or [[wikt:bifurcation|bifurcate]]. Some ferns, like members of the group [[Ophioglossales]] have a unique arrangement.

[[image:fern frond pinnate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Adaxial (left) and abaxial (right) surfaces of a pinnate fern frond (''[[Blechnum appendiculatum]]''). Sori are evident on the abaxial surface.]] 

==Sporangia==
Fern fronds often bear [[sporangia]], where the plant's spores are formed, usually on the underside (abaxial surface) of the pinnae, but sometimes marginally or scattered over the frond.  The sporangia are typically clustered into a [[sorus]] (pl., sori). Associated with each sorus in many species is a membranous protective structure called an indusium, which is an outgrowth of the blade surface that may partly cover the sporangia. Some fern species feature [[frond dimorphism]], in which fertile and sterile fronds differ in appearance and structure.

==Fern fronds==
Fern fronds, as with all leaves, arise from the stem, either directly, or on an outgrowth from the stem termed a [[phyllopodium]]. The stem of a typical (leptosporangiate) fern is subterranean or horizontal on the surface of the ground. These stems are called [[rhizomes]]. Many fern fronds are initially coiled into a fiddle-head or crozier (see [[vernation|circinate vernation]]), although cycad and palm fronds do not have this pattern of new leaf growth.

Fronds may bear hairs, scales, glands, and, in some species, bulblets for vegetative reproduction.

==Features==

===Hypergraphia===
[[Hypergraphia]] is the tendency for extensive and compulsive writing or drawing, and has been observed in persons with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] who have experienced multiple seizures.&lt;ref name=Hypergraphia_repeated_seizures&gt;{{ cite journal |last1 = Tremont |first1 = Geoffrey |last2 = Smith |first2 = Megan M |last3 = Bauer |first3 = Lyndsey |last4 = Alosco |first4 = Michael L |last5 = Davis |first5 = Jennifer D |last6 = Blum |first6 = Andrew S |last7 = LaFrance |first7 = W Curt |title = Comparison of personality characteristics on the Bear-Fedio Inventory between patients with epilepsy and those with non-epileptic seizures. |journal = The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences |doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11020039 |pages=47–52 |issue = 1 |volume = 24 |year = 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with hypergraphia display extreme attention to detail in their writing. Some such patients keep diaries recording meticulous details about their everyday lives. In certain cases, these writings demonstrate extreme interest in religious topics. Also, these individuals tend to have poor penmanship. The novelist [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] showed symptoms of Geschwind syndrome, including hypergraphia.&lt;ref name=DostoevskyEpilepsy&gt;{{ cite journal |last = Hughes |first = John R |title = The idiosyncratic aspects of the epilepsy of Fyodor Dostoevsky. |journal = [[Epilepsy &amp; Behavior]]|pages=531–8 |issue = 3 |volume = 7 |year = 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2005.07.021 |pmid=16194626}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases hypergraphia can manifest with compulsive drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=JK|last2=Robertson|first2=MM|last3=Trimble|first3=MR|title=The lateralising significance of hypergraphia in temporal lobe epilepsy|journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]]|date=February 1982|volume=45|issue=2|pages=131–8|doi=10.1136/jnnp.45.2.131|pmid=7069424|pmc=1083040}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings by patients with hypergraphia exhibit repetition and a high level of detail, sometimes morphing writing with drawing &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neurology and General Medicine|last=Michael|first=Michael Jeffrey Aminoff|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This "typical personality" of temporal lobe epileptic patient has been described in roughly similar terms over many years (Blumer &amp; Benson, 1975; Geschwind, 1975, 1977; Blumer, 1999; Devinsky &amp; Schachter, 2009).

'''Holism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὅλος}} ''holos'' "all, whole, entire") is the idea that [[system]]s (physical, biological, chemical, social, economic, mental, linguistic) and their properties should be viewed as wholes, not just as a collection of parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Barry | last = Oshry | title = Seeing Systems: Unlocking the Mysteries of Organizational Life | publisher = Berrett-Koehler | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sunny Y | last = Auyang | title = Foundations of Complex-system Theories: in Economics, Evolutionary Biology, and Statistical Physics | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term holism was coined by [[Jan_Smuts|Jan Smuts]].&lt;ref name="HaE"&gt;{{ cite book | first = Jan Christiaan | last = Smuts | title = Holism and Evolution 2nd Edition |publisher = Macmillan and Co | year = 1927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The first publication of ''Holism and Evolution'' was by Macmillan and Co. in 1926. Smuts published a 2nd edition in 1927 and there have been at least three subsequent reprints; Compass/Viking Press 1961, Greenwood Press 1973, and Sierra Sunrise Books 1999 (a version edited by Sanford Holst). The full text of the 1927 2nd edition is available on the Internet Archive site, and this is the source used in updating the Holism page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Adler]] considered holism as a concept that represents all of the wholes in the universe, and these wholes are the real factors in the universe. Further, that Holism also denoted a theory of the universe in the same vein as Materialism and Spiritualism.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|120–121}}

== Synopsis of ''Holism and Evolution'' ==
After identifying the need for reform in the fundamental concepts of matter, life and mind (chapter 1) Smuts examines the reformed concepts (as of 1926) of space and time (chapter 2), matter (chapter 3) and biology (chapter 4) and concludes that the close approach to each other of the concepts of matter, life and mind, and the partial overflow of each other's domain, imply that there is a fundamental principle (Holism) of which they are the progressive outcome.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|86}}  Chapters 5 and 6 provide the general concept, functions and categories of Holism; chapters 7 and 8 address Holism with respect to Mechanism and Darwinism, chapters 9-11 make a start towards demonstrating the concepts and functions of Holism for the metaphysical categories (mind, personality, ideals) and the book concludes with a chapter that argues for the universal ubiquity of Holism and its place as a monistic ontology.

The following is an overview of Smuts' opinions regarding the general concept, functions, and categories of Holism; like the definition of Holism, other than the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, the editor is unaware of any authoritative secondary sources corroborating Smuts' opinions.

=== Structure ===
Wholes are composites which have an internal structure, function or character which clearly differentiate them from mechanical additions, aggregates, and constructions, such as science assumes on the mechanical hypothesis.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|106}} The concept of structure is not confined to the physical domain (e.g. chemical, biological and artifacts);  it also applies to the metaphysical domain (e.g. mental structures, properties, attributes, values, ideals, etc.)&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|161}}

=== Field ===
The field of a whole is not something different and additional to it, it is the continuation of the whole beyond its sensible contours of experience.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|113}}  The field characterizes a whole as a unified and synthesised event in the system of Relativity, that includes not only its present but also its past—and also its future potentialities.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|89}}  As such, the concept of field entails both activity and structure.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|115}}

=== Variation ===

Darwin's theory of organic descent placed primary emphasis on the role of natural selection, but there would be nothing to select if not for variation.  Variations that are the result of mutations in the biological sense and variations that are the result of individually acquired modifications in the personal sense are attributed by Smuts to Holism; further it was his opinion that because variations appear in complexes and not singly, evolution is more than the outcome of individual selections; it is holistic.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|190–192}}

=== Regulation ===

The whole exhibits a discernible regulatory function as it relates to cooperation and coordination of the structure and activity of parts, and to the selection and deselection of variations. The result is a balanced correlation of organs and functions. The activities of the parts are directed to central ends; co-operation and unified action instead of the separate mechanical activities of the parts.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|125}}

=== Creativity ===
It is the intermingling of fields which is creative or causal in nature.  This is seen in matter, where if not for its dynamic structural creative character matter could not have been the mother of the universe.  This function, or factor of creativity is even more marked in biology where the protoplasm of the cell is vitally active in an ongoing process of creative change where parts are continually being destroyed and replaced by new protoplasm. With minds the regulatory function of Holism acquires consciousness and freedom, demonstrating a creative power of the most far-reaching character. Holism is not only creative but self-creative, and its final structures are far more holistic than its initial structures.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|18, 37, 67–68, 88–89 }}

=== Causality ===
As it relates to causality Smuts makes reference to [[A. N. Whitehead]], and indirectly [[Baruch Spinoza]]; the Whitehead premise is that organic mechanism is a fundamental process which realizes and actualizes individual syntheses or unities.  Holism (the factor) exemplifies this same idea while emphasizing the holistic character of the process.  The whole completely transforms the concept of Causality; results are not directly a function of causes. The whole absorbs and integrates the cause into its own activity; results appear as the consequence of the activity of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|121–124,126}}  Note that this material relating to Whitehead's influence as it relates to causality was added in the second edition, and of course will not be found in reprints of the first edition; nor is it included in the most recent Holst edition.  It is the second edition of ''Holism and Evolution'' (1927) that provides the most recent and definitive treatment by Smuts.

=== The whole is greater than the sum of its parts ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fundamental holistic characters as a unity of parts which is so close and intense as to be more than the sum of its parts; which not only gives a particular conformation or structure to the parts, but so relates and determines them in their synthesis that their functions are altered;  the synthesis affects and determines the parts, so that they function towards the whole; and the whole and the parts, therefore reciprocally influence and determine each other, and appear more or less to merge their individual characters: the whole is in the parts and the parts are in the whole, and this synthesis of whole and parts is reflected in the holistic character of the functions of the parts as well as of the whole.&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|88}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Progressive grading of wholes ===
A "rough and provisional" summary of the progressive grading of wholes that comprise holism is as follows:&lt;ref name="HaE" /&gt;{{rp|109}}

# Material structure e.g. a chemical compound
# Functional structure in living bodies 
# Animals, which exhibit a degree of central control that is primarily implicit and unconscious
# Personality, characterized as conscious central control
# States and similar group organizations characterized by central control that involve many people 
# Holistic Ideals, or absolute Values, distinct from human personality that are creative factors in the creation of a spiritual world, for example Truth, Beauty and Goodness.

==Holism in philosophy==
{{main|Confirmation holism|Semantic holism}}
In philosophy, any doctrine that emphasizes the priority of a whole over its parts is holism. Some suggest that such a definition owes its origins to a non-holistic view of language and places it in the reductivist camp. Alternately, a 'holistic' definition of holism denies the necessity of a division between the function of separate parts and the workings of the 'whole'. Effectively this means that the concept of a part has no absolute foundation in observation, but is rather a result of a materialist structuring of reality based on the necessity of logical and distinct units as a means to deriving information through comparative analysis. It suggests that the key recognizable characteristic of a concept of 'true' holism is a sense of the fundamental truth of any particular experience. This exists in contradistinction to what is perceived as the reductivist reliance on inductive method as the key to verification of its concept of how the parts function within the whole. Equally the potential for recognising the clarity of holistic experience within the logical terms of maths is limited by the abstract nature of numbers. In terms of real life measurements numbers have no scale or dimensional properties, so they have to rely on experimentally verified units (e.g. inches, volts, calories etc.), to describe reality. It is this reliance on the holistic integrity of experience which leads to the recognition that intuitive perception rather than mathematical calculation is the source of the truth of effective theories.  (See references Holism, 2016.)

=== Philosophy of language ===
In the [[philosophy of language]] this becomes the claim, called [[semantic holism]], that the meaning of an individual word or sentence can only be understood in terms of its relations to a larger body of language, even a whole theory or a whole language. In the [[philosophy of mind]], a mental state may be identified only in terms of its relations with others. This is often referred to as "content holism" or "holism of the mental". This notion involves the philosophies of such figures as [[Frege]], [[Wittgenstein]], and [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_holism.html ''Holism'', The Basics of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epistemological and confirmation holism ===
[[epistemological holism|Epistemological]] and [[confirmation holism]] are mainstream ideas in contemporary philosophy.

=== Ontological holism ===
Ontological holism was espoused by [[David Bohm]] in his theory&lt;ref&gt;Bohm, D. (1980). ''Wholeness and the Implicate Order''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-7100-0971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[implicate and explicate order]].

=== Spinoza ===
The concept of holism played a pivotal role in [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Huenemann, ''Interpreting Spinoza: Critical Essays'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eccy De Jonge, ''Spinoza and Deep Ecology: Challenging Traditional Approaches to Environmentalism'', UK: Ashgate Publishing, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;65&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hegel ===
Hegel rejected "the fundamentally atomistic conception of the object," (Stern, 38) arguing that "individual objects exist as manifestations of indivisible substance-universals, which cannot be reduced to a set of properties or attributes; he therefore holds that the object should be treated as an ontologically primary whole." (Stern, 40) In direct opposition to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], therefore, "Hegel insists that the unity we find in our experience of the world is not constructed by us out of a plurality of intuitions." (Stern, 40) In "his ontological scheme a concrete individual is not reducible to a plurality of sensible properties, but rather exemplifies a substance universal." (Stern, 41) His point is that it is "a mistake to treat an organic substance like blood as nothing more than a compound of unchanging chemical elements, that can be separated and united without being fundamentally altered." (Stern, 103) In Hegel's view, a substance like blood is thus "more of an organic unity and cannot be understood as just an external composition of the sort of distinct substances that were discussed at the level of chemistry." (Stern, 103) Thus in Hegel's view, blood is blood and cannot be successfully reduced to what we consider are its component parts; we must view it as a whole substance entire unto itself. This is most certainly a fundamentally holistic view.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge Chapman Hall, 1990 (full text download)] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160520122904/http://www.mediafire.com/?rxmn2t1votf |date=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- [Editors note: work in progress, moving references to Hegel to a common section] [[Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Stern, ''Hegel, Kant and the Structure of the Object'', London: Routledge, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;6 &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Merold Westphal, ''Hegel, Freedom, and Modernity'', New York: SUNY, 1992, pp.79-81, &amp; p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edmund Husserl]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Esfield, ''Holism in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Physics'', Springer, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johanna Maria Tito, ''Logic in the Husserlian Context'', Northwestern University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;245&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

==Holism in physical sciences==
{{main |Holism in science}}

=== Agriculture ===
There are several newer methods in [[agricultural science]] such as [[permaculture]] and holistic planned grazing ([[holistic management]]) that integrate [[ecology]] and [[social sciences]] with food production. [[Organic farming]] is sometimes considered a holistic approach.

=== Chaos and complexity ===
In the latter half of the 20th century, holism led to [[systems thinking]] and its derivatives. Systems in biology, psychology, or sociology are frequently so complex that their behavior is, or appears, "new" or "[[emergence|emergent]]": it cannot be deduced from the properties of the elements alone.{{Sfn | von Bertalanffy | 1971 | p = 54}}

Holism has thus been used as a catchword. This contributed to the resistance encountered by the scientific interpretation of holism, which insists that there are [[ontology|ontological]] reasons that prevent reductive models in principle from providing efficient algorithms for prediction of system behavior in certain classes of systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Scientific holism holds that the behavior of a system cannot be perfectly predicted, no matter how much data is available. Natural systems can produce surprisingly unexpected behavior, and it is suspected that behavior of such systems might be [[computational irreducibility|computationally irreducible]], which means it would not be possible to even approximate the system state without a full simulation of all the events occurring in the system. Key properties of the higher level behavior of certain classes of systems may be mediated by rare "surprises" in the behavior of their elements due to the principle of interconnectivity, thus evading predictions except by brute force simulation.

[[Complex systems|Complexity theory]] (also called "science of complexity") is a contemporary heir of systems thinking. It comprises both computational and holistic, relational approaches towards understanding [[complex adaptive systems]], and especially in the latter, some argue that it can be seen as the polar opposite to reductive methods. General theories of complexity have been proposed, and numerous complexity institutes and departments have sprung up around the world. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] is arguably the most famous of them.

=== Ecology ===
[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|240px|thumb|right|The Earth seen from [[Apollo 17]]]]
{{See also|Holistic community}}
Holistic thinking is often applied to ecology, combining biological, chemical, physical, economic, ethical, and political insights. The complexity grows with the area, so that it is necessary to reduce the characteristic of the view in other ways, for example to a specific time of duration.

[[John Muir]], Scots-born early American conservationist,&lt;ref&gt;Reconnecting with John Muir By Terry Gifford, University of Georgia, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; wrote "When we try to pick out anything by itself we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe".

More information is to be found in the field of [[systems ecology]], a cross-disciplinary field influenced by [[general systems theory]].

=== Medicine ===
In [[primary care]] the term "holistic," has been used to describe approaches that take into account social considerations and other intuitive judgements.&lt;ref name="TudorHart2010"&gt;[[Julian Tudor Hart]] (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=h5_6-NeAqcsC&amp;pg=PA258 ''The Political Economy of Health Care''] pp.106, 258&lt;/ref&gt; The term holism, and so-called approaches, appear in [[psychosomatic illness|psychosomatic]] medicine in the 1970s, when they were considered one possible way to conceptualize psychosomatic phenomena. Instead of charting one-way causal links from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] to [[Soma (biology)|soma]], or vice versa, it aimed at a systemic model, where multiple biological, psychological and social factors were seen as interlinked.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"/&gt;

Other, alternative approaches in the 1970s were psychosomatic and somatopsychic approaches, which concentrated on causal links only from psyche to soma, or from soma to psyche, respectively.&lt;ref name="Lipowski1977"&gt;Lipowski, 1977.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}{{Request quotation|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At present it is commonplace in psychosomatic medicine to state that psyche and soma cannot really be separated for practical or theoretical purposes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} A disturbance on any level—somatic, psychic, or social—will radiate to all the other levels, too. In this sense, psychosomatic thinking is similar to the [[biopsychosocial model]] of medicine.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Many [[alternative medicine]] practitioners claim a [[Holistic health|holistic approach to healing]].

=== Neurology ===
A lively debate has run since the end of the 19th century regarding the functional organization of the [[brain]]. The holistic tradition (e.g., [[Pierre Marie]]) maintained that the brain was a homogeneous organ with no specific subparts whereas the localizationists (e.g., [[Paul Broca]]) argued that the brain was organized in functionally distinct [[cortical area]]s which were each specialized to process a given type of information or implement specific mental operations. The controversy was [[epitome|epitomized]] with the existence of a [[language]] area in the brain, nowadays known as [[Broca's area]].&lt;ref&gt;'Does Broca's area exist?': Christofredo Jakob's 1906 response to Pierre Marie's holistic stance. Kyrana Tsapkini, Ana B. Vivas, Lazaros C. Triarhou. ''Brain and Language'', Volume 105, Issue 3, June 2008, Pages 211-219 {{DOI|10.1016/j.bandl.2007.07.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holism in social sciences==

=== Architecture ===
Architecture is often argued by design academics and those practicing in design to be a holistic enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Ivar (2006). ''Ideas and Beliefs in Architecture: How attitudes, orientations, and underlying assumptions shape the built environment''. Oslo School of Architecture and Design. {{ISBN|82-547-0174-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, holism tends to imply an all-inclusive design perspective. This trait is considered exclusive to architecture, distinct from other professions involved in design projects.

=== Branding ===
A holistic brand (also holistic branding) is considering the entire brand or image of the company. For example, a universal brand image across all countries, including everything from advertising styles to the stationery the company has made, to the company colours.

=== Economics ===
With roots in [[Schumpeter]], the evolutionary approach might be considered the holistic theory in economics. It shares certain language from the biological evolutionary approach. It takes into account how the [[innovation system]] evolves over time. Knowledge and know-how, know-who, know-what and know-why are part of the whole business economics. Knowledge can also be tacit, as described by [[Michael Polanyi]]. These models are open, and consider that it is hard to predict exactly the impact of a policy measure. They are also less mathematical.

=== Education reform ===
The [[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]] identifies many levels of cognitive functioning, which can be used to create a more [[holistic education]]. In [[authentic assessment]], rather than using computers to score multiple choice tests, a [[standards based assessment]] uses trained scorers to score open-response items using holistic scoring methods.&lt;ref&gt;Rubrics (Authentic Assessment Toolbox) "So, when might you use a holistic rubric? Holistic rubrics tend to be used when a quick or gross judgment needs to be made." [http://jonathan.mueller.faculty.noctrl.edu/toolbox/rubrics.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; In projects such as the North Carolina Writing Project, scorers are instructed not to count errors, or count numbers of points or supporting statements. The scorer is instead instructed to judge holistically whether "as a whole" is it more a "2" or a "3". Critics question whether such a process can be as objective as computer scoring, and the degree to which such scoring methods can result in different scores from different scorers.

===Psychology===

==== Psychology of perception ====
A major holistic movement in the early twentieth century was [[gestalt psychology]]. The claim was that perception is not an aggregation of atomic [[sense data]] but a field, in which there is a figure and a ground. Background has holistic effects on the perceived figure. Gestalt psychologists included [[Wolfgang Koehler]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Kurt Koffka]]. Koehler claimed the perceptual fields corresponded to electrical fields in the brain. [[Karl Lashley]] did experiments with gold foil pieces inserted in monkey brains purporting to show that such fields did not exist. However, many of the perceptual illusions and visual phenomena exhibited by the gestaltists were taken over (often without credit) by later perceptual psychologists. Gestalt psychology had influence on [[Fritz Perls]]' [[gestalt therapy]], although some old-line gestaltists opposed the association with counter-cultural and [[New Age]] trends later associated with gestalt therapy. Gestalt theory was also influential on phenomenology. [[Aron Gurwitsch]] wrote on the role of the field of consciousness in gestalt theory in relation to phenomenology. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] made much use of holistic psychologists such as work of [[Kurt Goldstein]] in his ''Phenomenology of Perception''.

==== Teleological psychology ====
[[Alfred Adler]] believed that the individual (an integrated whole expressed through a self-consistent unity of thinking, feeling, and action, moving toward an unconscious, [[Classical Adlerian psychology#Fictional final goal|fictional final goal]]), must be understood within the larger wholes of society, from the groups to which he belongs (starting with his face-to-face relationships), to the larger whole of mankind. The recognition of our social embeddedness and the need for developing an interest in the welfare of others, as well as a respect for nature, is at the heart of Adler's philosophy of living and principles of psychotherapy.

[[Edgar Morin]], the French philosopher and sociologist, can be considered a holist based on the [[Transdisciplinarity|transdisciplinary]] nature of his work.

Mel Levine, M.D., author of ''A Mind at a Time'',&lt;ref&gt;(Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder (with Charles R. Schwab) of the not-for-profit organization All Kinds of Minds, can be considered a holist based on his view of the 'whole child' as a product of many systems and his work supporting the educational needs of children through the management of a child's educational profile as a whole rather than isolated weaknesses in that profile.

=== Anthropology ===
There is an ongoing dispute as to whether anthropology is intrinsically holistic. Supporters of this concept consider anthropology holistic in two senses. First, it is concerned with all human beings across times and places, and with all dimensions of humanity (evolutionary, biophysical, sociopolitical, economic, cultural, psychological, etc.)  Further, many academic programs following this approach take a "four-field" approach to anthropology that encompasses [[physical anthropology]], [[archeology]], [[linguistics]], and [[cultural anthropology]] or [[social anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Shore | first = Bradd | year = 1999 | title = Strange Fate of Holism | journal = Anthropology News | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 4–5 | doi = 10.1111/an.1999.40.9.5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some leading anthropologists disagree, and consider anthropological holism to be an artifact from 19th century [[sociocultural evolution|social evolutionary]] thought that inappropriately imposes scientific [[positivism]] upon cultural anthropology.&lt;ref name=Sacred_bundle&gt;{{Citation | editor1-last =Segal | editor1-first = Daniel A | first2 = Ian | editor2-last = Yanagisako | first1 = James | last1 = Clifford | last2 = Hodder | first3 = Rena | last3 = Lederman | first4 = Michael | last4 = Silverstein |title=Unwrapping the Sacred Bundle: Reflections on the Disciplining of Anthropology |publisher=Duke University Press |year= 2005 |url=http://www.dukeupress.edu/cgibin/forwardsql/search.cgi?template0=nomatch.htm&amp;template2=books/book_detail_page.htm&amp;user_id=11016434335&amp;Bmain.Btitle_option=1&amp;Bmain.Btitle=Unwrapping+the+Sacred+Bundle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "holism" is additionally used within social and cultural anthropology to refer to an analysis of a society as a whole which refuses to break society into component parts. One definition says: "as a methodological ideal, holism implies ... that one does not permit oneself to believe that our own established institutional boundaries (e.g. between politics, sexuality, religion, economics) necessarily may be found also in foreign societies."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/def/holism.htm anthrobase definition of holism]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Émile Durkheim ====
{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}} {{see also|Ubuntu (philosophy)}}
[[Émile Durkheim]] developed a concept of holism which he set as opposite to the notion that a [[society]] was nothing more than a simple collection of individuals. In more recent times, [[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Louis Dumont (anthropologist)|Louis Dumont]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; has contrasted "holism" to "[[individualism]]" as two different forms of societies. According to him, modern humans live in an individualist society, whereas ancient Greek society, for example, could be qualified as "holistic", because the individual found identity in the whole society. Thus, the individual was ready to sacrifice himself or herself for his or her [[community]], as his or her life without the ''[[polis]]'' had no sense whatsoever.

==== Cosmomorphism ====
The French Protestant missionary [[Maurice Leenhardt]] coined the term "cosmomorphism" to indicate the state of perfect [[symbiosis]] with the surrounding environment which characterized the culture of the [[Melanesians]] of [[New Caledonia]]. For these people, an isolated individual is totally indeterminate, indistinct, and featureless until he can find his position within the natural and social world in which he is inserted. The confines between the self and the world are annulled to the point that the material body itself is no guarantee of the sort of recognition of identity which is typical of our own culture.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Bihan, [http://www.lehman.cuny.edu/ile.en.ile/paroles/bihan_writer.html "The Writer, a Man Without Qualities"], ''Literature and Identity in New Caledonia''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rasmussen, [http://ijds.lemoyne.edu/journal/3_1/pdf/IJDS.3.1.03.Rasmussen.pdf "Personahood, Self, Difference, and Dialogue (Commentary on Chaudhary)"], ''International Journal for Dialogical Science'', Fall 2008, Vol.&amp;nbsp;3, No.&amp;nbsp;1, 31-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===
Holistic concepts are strongly represented within the thoughts expressed within [[Logos]] (per [[Heraclitus]]), [[Panentheism]] and [[Pantheism]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In [[theological anthropology]], which belongs to theology and not to anthropology, holism is the belief that [[Human body|body]], [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] and [[spirit]] are not separate components of a person, but rather facets of a united whole.&lt;ref&gt;"The traditional anthropology encounters major problems in the Bible and its predominantly holistic view of human beings. Genesis 2:7 is a key verse: 'Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being' (NRSV). The 'living being' (traditionally, 'living soul') is an attempt to translate the Hebrew ''nephesh hayah'', which indicates a 'living person' in the context. More than one interpreter has pointed out that this text does not say that the human being ''has'' a soul but rather ''is'' a soul. H. Wheeler Robinson summarized the matter in his statement that 'The Hebrew conceived man as animated body and not as an incarnate soul.'" (Martin E. Tate, "The Comprehensive Nature of Salvation in Biblical Perspective," ''Evangelical review of theology'', Vol. 23.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hipogeu Cala en Blanes 10 oct.jpg|thumb|Entrance of the hypogeum of Torre del Ram. ]]
The '''Hypogeum of Torre del Ram''' is an archaeological site of de '''Torre del Ram''', in Cala en Blanes ([[Ciutadella de Menorca]]), is a [[Bronze Age]] funerary [[hypogeum]], which was used as a collective tomb by a family or a small community. Even though it was emptied in later centuries to be reused as a cattle shelter, which caused the loss of all the information about the interred population, grave goods and chronology, its resemblance with other prehistoric tombs of Menorca dates it to between 1700 and 1400 BC.

A stepped corridor leads to the tomb's rectangular chamber, which has a stone bench that surrounds its internal perimeter. Part of the stone gallery, which used to cover the corridor and the entrance, is still preserved, which was built with the cyclopean{{explain|date=December 2017}} technique. 

The corridor is 2.60 m long, while the dimensions of the chamber are: 8.80 m long, 2.50 m wide and 1.95 m high. 
[[File:TORRE DEL RAM interior.jpg|thumb|right|View of the chamber of Torre del Ram hypogeum, ]]

The walls of the internal chamber present several engravings representing three sailing ships and other undetermined figures. Some authors claim the importance of these elements, since they could date back to the [[Bronze Age]].  However, the date of these engraving has not been determined and could have been made in any other subsequent period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IdPub=8574#ancla4&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[biology]], an '''identification key''' is a printed or computer-aided device that aids the [[identification (biology)|identification]] of biological entities, such as [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fossil]]s, [[microorganism]]s, and [[pollen]] grains.  Identification keys are also used in many other scientific and technical fields to identify various kinds of entities, such as [[disease]]s, [[soil type]]s, [[mineral]]s, or [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] artifacts.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Traditionally identification keys have most commonly taken the form of '''[[single-access key]]s'''. These work by offering a fixed sequence of ''identification steps'', each with multiple alternatives, the choice of which determines the next step.  If each step has only two alternatives, the key is said to be '''dichotomous''', else it is '''polytomous'''.  Modern '''[[multi-access key|multi-access]]''' or '''interactive''' keys allow the user to freely choose the identification steps and their order.

At each step, the user must answer a question about one or more features (''characters'') of the entity to be identified. For example, a step in a [[botany|botanical]] key may ask about the color of flowers, or the disposition of the leaves along the stems.  A key for [[insect]] identification may ask about the number of [[Chaetotaxy|bristle]]s on the rear leg.

==Principles of good key design==

Identification errors may have serious consequences in both pure and applied disciplines, including [[ecology]], medical diagnosis, [[pest (animal)|pest]] control, [[forensic]]s, etc.&lt;ref name="marshall"&gt;
  [http://www.biology.ualberta.ca/bsc/news_19_2/error_rates.htm Steve Marshall]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, identification keys must be constructed with great care in order to minimize the incidence of such errors.

Whenever possible, the character used at each identification step should be ''diagnostic''; that is, each alternative should be common to all members of a group of entities, and unique to that group.  It should also be ''differential'', meaning that the alternatives should separate the corresponding subgroups from each other.  However, characters which are neither differential nor diagnostic may be included to increase comprehension (especially characters that are common to the group, but not unique).

Whenever possible, redundant characters should be used at each step.  For example, if a group is to be split into two subgroups, one characterized by six black spots and the other by four brown stripes, the user should be queried about all three characters (number, shape, and color of the markings) — even though any single one of them would be sufficient in theory.  This redundancy improves the reliability of identification, provides a consistency check against user errors, and allows the user to proceed even if some of the characters could not be observed. In this case, the characters should be ordered according to their reliability and convenience. Further error tolerance can be achieved by using [[reticulation (single-access key)|reticulation]].

The [[terminology]] used in the identification steps should be consistent in meaning and should be uniformly used. The use of alternative terms for the same concept to achieve more "lively prose" should be avoided.  Positive statements should be used in preference to negative statements.{{clarify|date=August 2009}}  The wording of the alternatives should be completely parallel sentences; alternatives like "flowers red, size 10-40 cm" versus "flowers yellow" should be avoided.

Geographic distribution characters should be used with caution. Species that have not been observed in a region may still occasionally occur there. Also, the [[organism]] may have been transported, particularly to locations near ports and airports, or it may have changed its range (e. g., due to [[global warming]]). For [[Europe]] and, probably, [[North Africa]] a [[Palaearctic]] key is advisable.

Rarity is not a viable character. An identification may be correct even though a species is very rare.

===Common problems in key usage===

Key users must overcome many practical problems, such as:

* ''Variant forms'': The key may identify only some forms of the species, such as adult males (or, more rarely, females). Keys for larvae identification may consider only the final [[instar]]. (This is not the case, however, of keys used in [[forensic entomology|forensic identification of fly larvae]].)
* ''Incomplete coverage'': Species and groups that are difficult to identify or that have been poorly characterized may have been left out of the key, or may be mentioned only in introductory text.
* ''Lighting and magnification'': Very few keys give details of how the specimen was viewed (the magnification, lighting system, angle of view etc.).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This can cause problems. The author may, for instance refer to tiny bristles, hairs or [[chaeta]]e—but how tiny?
* ''Language'': Very few keys are multilingual.&lt;ref name="timb"&gt;
  [http://delta-intkey.com/wood/index.htm Commercial Timbers], an example of a key in five languages. 
&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of a key may be incorrect or misleading. Many keys contain vague words that do not translate.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

* ''Obsolescence'': Older keys may not include more recently described species. They may also use outdated  [[scientific classification|species names]], which must then be mapped to the current ones.

==Verifying identifications==
The identification obtained from a key should be viewed as only a suggestion of the species's real identity. Full identification requires comparison of the specimen with some authoritative source, such as a full and accurate description of the species, preferably in a [[monograph]].  Many keys contain brief descriptions to allow more certain identification, but these should not be assumed sufficient for verification.

Comparison with a monographic description is often difficult in practice, as many monographs are expensive, out of print, written in foreign languages, or hard to obtain. Monographs are often several decades old, so that often the species names used in the key do not match those used in the monograph.

Another alternative is comparison with authoritatively identified specimens in natural history museums or other relevant repositories.  Authoritatively identified images are becoming more common on the internet.  To qualify, the image must be labeled with a ''voucher specimen'' number, the name of the scientist who identified the photographed specimen, and the name of the public institution where the specimen is housed (so that interested parties can re-examine the specimen themselves).

A '''Jacobi ellipsoid''' is a [[triaxial ellipsoid|triaxial (i.e. scalene) ellipsoid]] under equilibrium which arises when a self-gravitating fluid body of uniform density rotates with a constant angular velocity. It is named after the [[Germans|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi, C. G. (1834). Ueber die figur des gleichgewichts. Annalen der Physik, 109(8–16), 229–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1969). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium (Vol. 10, p. 253). New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandrasekhar, S. (1967). Ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium—an historical account. Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 20(2), 251–265.&lt;/ref&gt;==
Before Jacobi, the [[Maclaurin spheroid]] which was formulated in 1742, was considered to be the only type of [[ellipsoid]] which can be in equilibrium. [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] in 1811&lt;ref&gt;Lagrange, J. L. (1811). Mécanique Analytique sect. IV 2 vol.&lt;/ref&gt; considered the possibility of a tri-axial ellipsoid being in equilibrium, but concluded that the two equatorial axes of the [[ellipsoid]] must be equal, leading back to the solution of [[Maclaurin spheroid]]. But [[Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi|Jacobi]] realized that [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]]'s demonstration is a sufficiency condition, but not necessary. He remarked, "One would make a grave mistake if one supposed that the spheroids of revolution are the only admissible figures of equilibrium even under the restrictive assumption of second degree surfaces" and further adds that "In fact a simple consideration shows that ellipsoids with three unequal axes can very well be figures of equilibrium; and that one can assume an ellipse of arbitrary shape for the equatorial section and determine the third axis (which is also the least of the three axes) and the angular velocity of rotation such that the ellipsoid is a figure of equilibrium."&lt;ref&gt;Dirichlet, G. L. (1856). Gedächtnisrede auf Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik, 52, 193–217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacobi formula==
[[File:Jacobi-ellipsoid-dimensions-2.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|right|The equatorial (''a'', ''b'') and polar (''c'') semi-principal axes of a Jacobi ellipsoid and Maclaurin spheroid, as a function of normalized angular momentum, subject to ''abc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 (i.e. for constant volume of 4π/3).&lt;br/&gt;The broken lines are for the Maclaurin spheroid in the range where it has dynamic but not secular stability - it will relax into the Jacobi ellipsoid provided it can dissipate energy by virtue of a viscous constituent fluid.]]

For an ellipsoid with semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a, \ b, \ c&lt;/math&gt;, the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; about &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; axis is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho} = 2 abc \int_0^\infty \frac{udu}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\Delta}\ , \quad \Delta^2 = (a^2+u)(b^2+u)(c^2+u)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]], subject to the condition

:&lt;math&gt;a^2 b^2 \int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(a^2+u)(b^2+u)\Delta} = c^2\int_0^\infty \frac{du}{(c^2+u)\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;

For fixed values of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, the above condition has solution for &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{c^2}&gt;\frac{1}{a^2} + \frac{1}{b^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The integrals can be expressed in terms of [[Elliptic integral|incomplete elliptic integral]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, G. H. (1886). On Jacobi's figure of equilibrium for a rotating mass of fluid. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 41(246–250), 319–336.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the [[Carlson symmetric form]] elliptic integral &lt;math&gt;R_{J}&lt;/math&gt;, the formula for the angular velocity becomes

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Omega^{2}}{\pi G \rho} = \frac{4 a b c}{3 (a^{2} - b^{2})} (a^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - b^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2}))&lt;/math&gt;

and the condition on the relative size of the semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a, \ b, \ c&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{3} \frac{a^{2} b^{2}}{b^{2} - a^{2}} (R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},a^{2}) - R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},b^{2})) = \frac{2}{3} c^{2} R_{J}(a^{2},b^{2},c^{2},c^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

The angular momentum &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; of the Jacobi ellipsoid is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{\sqrt{GM^3\bar{a}}} = \frac{\sqrt 3}{10}\frac{a^2+b^2}{\bar{a}^2}\sqrt{\frac{\Omega^2}{\pi G\rho}} \ , \quad \bar{a}=(abc)^{1/3}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the ellipsoid and &lt;math&gt;\bar{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''mean radius'', the radius of a sphere of the same volume as the ellipsoid.

==Relationship with Dedekind ellipsoid==

The Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids are both equilibrium figures for a body of rotating homogeneous self-gravitating fluid. However, while the Jacobi ellipsoid spins bodily, with no internal flow of the fluid in the rotating frame, the Dedekind ellipsoid maintains a fixed orientation, with the constituent fluid circulating within it. This is a direct consequence of [[Dirichlet's ellipsoidal problem#Dedekind's theorem|Dedekind's theorem]].

For any given Jacobi ellipsoid, there exists a Dedekind ellipsoid with the same semi-principal axes &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and same mass and with a [[flow velocity|flow velocity field]] of&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar1965"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = \zeta \frac{- a^{2} y \mathbf{\hat{x}} + b^{2} x \mathbf{\hat{y}}}{a^{2} + b^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vorticity]], which is uniform throughout the spheroid (&lt;math&gt;\nabla\times \mathbf{u} = \zeta \mathbf{\hat{z}}&lt;/math&gt;). The angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; of the Jacobi ellipsoid and vorticity of the corresponding Dedekind ellipsoid are related by&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar1965"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta = \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right) \Omega&lt;/math&gt;

That is, each particle of the fluid of the Dedekind ellipsoid describes a [[similarity (geometry)|similar]] elliptical circuit in the same period in which the Jacobi spheroid performs one rotation.

In the special case of &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids (and the Maclaurin spheroid) become one and the same; bodily rotation and circular flow amount to the same thing. In this case &lt;math&gt;\zeta = 2 \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, as is always true for a rigidly rotating body.

In the general case, the Jacobi and Dedekind ellipsoids have the same energy&lt;ref name="Bardeen"/&gt;, but the angular momentum of the Jacobi spheroid is the greater by a factor of&lt;ref name="Bardeen"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{L_{\mathrm{Jac}}}{L_{\mathrm{Ded}}} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{a}{b} + \frac{b}{a}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The '''''Journal of Law and Religion''''' is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal published through [[Cambridge University Press]] and edited by the [[Center for the Study of Law and Religion]] at [[Emory University School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-religion|title=Journal of Law and Religion|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge Core|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary interests include topics related to the relationship between religion and law, including subjects related to theological [[jurisprudence]] and [[political theology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The journal was founded at [[Hamline University School of Law]] by the Harvard Law professor [[Harold J. Berman]] in 1982 along with Stephen B.Young, then Dean of the law school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hamline.edu/HUNewsDetail.aspx?id=2110|title=Journal of Law &amp; Religion Salutes 25 Years of "Building Community and Deepening Understanding"|last=|first=|date=|website=Hamline University Law School|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council on Religion and Law and Harvard Divinity School Professor [[James Luther Adams]] were also instrumental in starting the Journal. The goal of the Journal was to provide multiple frameworks of analysis for the study and discussion of structures of positive law. The Journal moved to the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at [[Emory University School of Law|Emory]] in 2013, two years prior to Hamline's merger with [[William Mitchell College of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationaljurist.com/national-jurist-magazine/journal-law-and-religion-moves-hamline-emory|title=Journal of Law and Religion moves from Hamline to Emory|last=|first=|date=8 August 2013|website=The National Jurist|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Journal's co-editors include Silas Allard, [[Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im]], [[Michael Broyde]], M. Christian Green, [[Michael J.

The center was founded in 1967 at [[Paris West University Nanterre La Défense|Paris X University]] by Eric de Dampierre, and associated with the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|National Scientific Research Council]] ([[CNRS]]) from 1968. In 1989 it became a Mixed Research Unit (UMR). Today it is the UMR 7186.

== Activities ==
The spectrum of research activities covered by the LESC is quite vast, reaching from traditional fieldwork based ethnography to visual anthropology. 
These activities are conducted mainly within the three scientific research departments:
* [[Technology]]
* [[Americas|Americanism]]
* [[Ethnomusicology]]

== Learned societies ==
They are two [[Learned society|learned societies]] housed in the LESC.
* The '''Société d'ethnologie''', created in 1986 by Eric de Dampierre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/socethno/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130234331/http://www.mae.u-paris10.fr/socethno/index.htm |archivedate=2011-01-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">A '''law''' is a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] principle that describes the fundamental nature of something, the universal properties and the relationships between things, or a description that purports to explain these principles and relationships.

== "Laws of nature " ==

{{See|Physical law}}

For example, "physical laws" such as the "[[gravity|law of gravity]]" or "[[science|scientific laws]]" attempt to describe the fundamental nature of the universe itself. Laws of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] describe the nature of rational thought and inference ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[transcendental idealism]], and differently [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s work ''[[Laws of Form]]'', was precisely a determination of the ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' laws governing human thought before any interaction whatsoever with experience).

Within most fields of study, and in science in particular, the elevation of some principle of that field to the status of "law" usually takes place after a very long time during which the principle is used and tested and verified; though in some fields of study such laws are simply postulated as a foundation and assumed. Mathematical laws are somewhere in between: they are often arbitrary and unproven in themselves, but they are sometimes judged by how useful they are in making predictions about the real world. However, they ultimately rely on arbitrary [[axioms]].  

== "Laws of fundamentals in mathematics" ==

Some fundamental law of mathematics was introduced by '''Harsha
'''.                                                                 

'''First law of fundamentals:''' If we consider '''k''' as a constant and '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers of which the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' but the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt;is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.    

'''Complemantry of first law of fundamentals:'''As per first law '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' is any constant the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''',then the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second law of fundamentals:'''If we consider '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' be any constant the division of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' and the division of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt; but equal    
to '''c'''.

== "Laws" in social sciences ==

Laws of [[economics]] are an attempt in [[modelization]] of economic behavior. [[Marxism]] criticized the [[belief]] in eternal "laws of economics", which it considered a product of the [[ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|dominant ideology]]. It claimed that in fact, those so-called "laws of economics" were only the historical laws of [[capitalism]], that is of a particular historical social formation. With the advent, in the 20th century, of the application of mathematical, statistical, and experimental techniques to economics, economic theory matured into a corpus of knowledge rooted in the scientific method rather than in philosophical argument.

==Miscellaneous==

Finally, the term is sometimes applied to less rigorous ideas that may be interesting observations or relationships, practical or ethical guidelines (also called [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]]), and even humorous parodies of such laws.

Examples of scientific laws include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[conservation law]]s, [[Ohm's law]], and others. Laws of other fields of study include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of [[philosophy]] and [[Say's law]] in [[economics]]. Examples of observed phenomena often described as laws include the [[Titius-Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Thomas Malthus]]'s Principle of Population or [[Malthusian Growth Model]], [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[Unintended consequences|law of unintended consequences]].

Some humorous parodies of such laws include [[adage]]s such as [[Murphy's law]] and its many variants, and [[Godwin's Law]] of [[Internet]] conversations.

* [[Legal doctrine|Principle of law]], [[Philosophy of law]]
* [[Legal positivism]], which states that there is no necessary relation between [[morality]] and [[law]]. Law is thus conceived as the mere product of social conventions. Legal positivism is opposed to [[natural law]] theory and to [[Interpretivism (legal)|legal interpretivism]].

[[Image:Island nations.svg|thumb|350px|Sovereign states and states with limited recognition fully on islands (Australia is regarded a continent), those with land borders shaded green, and those without shaded dark blue]]

This is a '''list of island countries'''. An [[island]] is a land mass (smaller than a [[continent]]) that is surrounded by water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/island| title=Definition of island| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[island country|island countries]] are spread over an [[archipelago]], as is the case with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Indonesia]] (both of which consist of thousands of islands). Others consist of a single island, such as [[Nauru]], or part of an island, such as [[Haiti]]. Although [[Australia]] is designated as [[Australia (continent)|a continent]], it is often referred to as an island, as it  has no land [[border]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Löffler |first=Ernst |authorlink= |author2=A.J. Rose, Anneliese Löffler &amp; Denis Warner |title=Australia:Portrait of a Continent |year=1983 |publisher=Hutchinson Group |location=[[Richmond, Victoria]] |page=17 |isbn=0-09-130460-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some declared island countries are not universally recognized as politically independent, such as [[Northern Cyprus]]. Some states, such as [[Taiwan]], officially claim to hold continental territories but are ''de facto'' limited to control over islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4963">'''Magnet-assisted transfection''' is a [[transfection]] method which uses magnetic interactions to deliver [[DNA]] into target cells. Nucleic acids are associated with magnetic [[nanoparticle]]s, and magnetic fields drive the nucleic acid-particle complexes into target cells, where the nucleic acids are released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Plank C|author2=Zelphati O|author3=Mykhaylyk O|displayauthors=1|title=Magnetically enhanced nucleic acid delivery. Ten years of magnetofection-progress and prospects|journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date=November 2011|volume=63|issue=14–15|pages=1300–1331|doi=10.1016/j.addr.2011.08.002|pmid=21893135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnetofection|url=http://www.ozbiosciences.com/magnetofection.html|work=OZ Biosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic Nanoparticles ==

Nanoparticles used as carriers for nucleic acids are mostly [[iron oxide|iron oxides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Plank, C., Schillinger, U., Scherer, F., Bergemann, C., Remy, J. S., Krötz, F., Anton, M., Lausier, J. and Rosenecker, J.|title=The magnetofection method: using magnetic force to enhance gene delivery|year=2003|journal=The Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=384|issue=5|pages=737–747|doi=10.1515/BC.2003.082|pmid=12817470}}&lt;/ref&gt; These iron oxides can be generated by precipitation from acidic iron-salt solutions upon addition of appropriate bases. The magnetic nanoparticles have an approximate size of 100&amp;nbsp;nm and are additionally coated with biological [[polymers]] to allow loading of nucleic acids. Particles and nucleic acids form complexes by [[ionic interaction]] of the negatively charged nucleic acid and the positively charged surface of the magnetic nanoparticle.

== DNA delivery to the target cells ==

The binding of the negatively charged nucleic acids to the positively charged iron particles occurs relatively fast. After complex formation, the loaded particles are incubated together with the target cells on a magnetic plate. The magnetic field causes the iron particles to be rapidly drawn towards the surface of the cell membrane. Cellular uptake occurs by either [[endocytosis]] or [[pinocytosis]]. Once delivered to the target cells, the DNA is released into the cytoplasm. The magnetic particles are accumulated in [[endosomes]] and/or [[vacuoles]]. Over time, the nanoparticles are degraded and the iron enters the normal iron [[metabolism]]. Influence of cellular functions by iron particles has not been reported yet. In most cases the increased iron concentration in culture media does not lead to cytotoxic effects.

== Advantages and prospects ==

Magnet-assisted transfection is a relatively new and time-saving method to introduce nucleic acids into a target cell with increased efficiency. In particular, adherent mammalian cell lines and primary cell cultures show very high transfection rates. Suspension cells and cells from other organisms can also be successfully transfected. A major advantage of the method is the mild treatment of the cells in comparison to liposome-based transfection reagents ([[lipofection]]) and [[electroporation]], which may result in the death of 20-50% of cells.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In addition, the transfection efficiency is increased in numerous cases by the directed transport in a magnetic field, especially for low amounts of nucleic acids. In contrast, methods like lipofection offer only statistical hits between cargo and cells, because of the three-dimensional motion of cells and transfection aggregates in a liquid suspension. Magnet-assisted transfection can also be performed in the presence of [[Blood serum|serum]], which is a further benefit. Currently, there are over 150 cells known to be successfully transfected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iba-go.com/naps/naps_fr02_04.html|title=Successfully Transfected Cells|work=IBA Solutions for Life Sciences|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223012449/http://www.iba-go.com/naps/naps_fr02_04.html|archivedate=February 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, synergistic effects in transfection efficiency can arise from the possible combination of lipofection and magnet-assisted transfection.
In future, this technology might be also an alternative strategy to the currently used viral and non-viral vectors in gene-therapy and gene transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davis, M. E.|year=2002|title=Non-viral gene delivery systems|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=13|issue=2|pages=128–131|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11415567_Davis_ME._Non-viral_gene_delivery_systems._Curr_Opin_Biotechnol_13_128-131|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(02)00294-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mandat International''', also known as the '''International Cooperation Foundation''', is an international [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] with consultative status to the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]], the [[UNDPI]], and the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]].

==Aims==
Mandat Internatioal aims to promote international dialogue and cooperation, including in the research domain. It promotes international law, data protection and sustainable development. It is strictly independent from any political or religious affiliation.

==Activities==
Mandat International is a foundation with public utility status, relying on a network of members covering the various fields of activity of international cooperation. It collaborates closely with most of the international organizations and is independent of any political or religious affiliation. Its first aim is is to promote international cooperation, including in the research domain. Its activities encompass various domains, from ICT research, to international law and privacy, multistakeholder dialogue and international research projects. Over time, the foundation has developed many projects, including several international research projects, international conferences and events, support to over 10’000 delegates for attending international conferences, educational programes, creating the Eduki foundation, legal search engines, conferences, etc. The foundation usually supports projects for a limited period of time but with the objective to have a sustainable impact. When its objectives are achieved it usually pioneers and addresses new emerging challenges.

The current focus of the foundation is on promoting international cooperation with the research community, developing international research projects, supporting technology transfer from the ressearch community to standardization and international organizations, and promoting international law. The foundation is also actively engaged in the Internet of Things domain to promote international cooperation and dissemination, in line with the International Declaration on Internet of Things for Sustainable Development adopted by the IoT Forum and the ITU.

[[Mindfulness meditation]] has been shown to have a positive impact on several psychiatric problems such as depression and therefore has formed the basis of [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] programs&lt;ref name = Holzel2011&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Holzel B. K. |author2=Lazar S. W. |author3=Gard T. |author4=Schuman-Olivier Z. |author5=Vago D. R. |author6=Ott U. | year = 2011 | title = How Does Mindfulness Meditation Work?

The applications of mindfulness meditation are well established, however the mechanisms that underlie this practice are yet to be fully understood.

[[File:Image of Mindfulness and Wisdom (8392104320).jpg|thumb|right|Mindfulness Meditation]]

Four components of [[mindfulness meditation]] have been proposed to describe much of the mechanism of action by which mindfulness meditation may work: [[attention]] regulation, body awareness, emotion regulation, and change in perspective on the self.&lt;ref name=Holzel2011/&gt; All of the components described above are connected to each other. For example, when a person is triggered by an external stimulus, the executive [[attention]] system attempts to maintain a mindful state. There is also a heightened body awareness such as a rapid heartbeat which triggers an emotional response. The response is then regulated so that it does not become habitual, but constantly changes from moment to moment experience. This eventually leads to a change in the perspective of the self.

== Attention regulation ==
[[File:MRI anterior cingulate.png|thumb|right|Anterior cingulate cortex]]

Attention regulation is the task of focusing attention on an object, acknowledging any distractions, and then returning your focus back to the object. Some evidence for mechanisms responsible for attention regulation during mindfulness meditation are shown below.
 
* Mindfulness meditators showed greater activation of rostral [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) and dorsal [[medial prefrontal cortex]] (MPFC).&lt;ref name =Holzel2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hölzel B.K. |author2=Ott U. |author3=Hempel H. |author4=Hackl A. |author5=Wolf K. |author6=Stark R. |author7=Vaitl D. | year = 2007 | title = Differential engagement of anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent medial frontal cortex in adept meditators and nonmeditators | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 421 | issue = | pages = 16–21 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2007.04.074 | pmid=17548160}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that meditators have a stronger processing of conflict/distraction and are more engaged in emotional regulation. However, as the meditators become more efficient at focused attention, regulation becomes unnecessary and consequentially decreases activation of ACC in the long term.&lt;ref name =Lewis2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brefczynski-Lewis J.A. |author2=Lutz A. |author3=Schaefer H.S. |author4=Levinson D.B. |author5=Davidson R.J. | year = 2007 | title = Neural correlates of attentional expertise in long-term meditation practitioners | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = | pages = 11483–11488 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0606552104 | pmid=17596341 | pmc=1903340}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The cortical thickness in the dorsal ACC was also found to be greater in the [[gray matter]] of experienced meditators.&lt;ref name =Grant2010&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grant J.A. |author2=Courtemanche J. |author3=Duerden E.G. |author4=Duncan G.H. |author5=Rainville P. | year = 2010 | title = Cortical thickness and pain sensitivity in Zen meditators | url = | journal = Emotion | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 43–53 | doi=10.1037/a0018334}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is an increased frontal [[midline theta rhythm]], which is related to attention demanding tasks and is believed to be indicative of ACC activation.&lt;ref name=Asada1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Asada H. |author2=Fukuda Y. |author3=Tsunoda S. |author4=Yamaguchi M. |author5=Tonoike M. | year = 1999 | title = Frontal midline theta rhythms reflect alternative activation of prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in humans | url = | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 274 | issue = | pages = 29–32 | doi=10.1016/s0304-3940(99)00679-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; High midline theta rhythm has been associated with lowest anxiety score in the Manifest Anxiety Scale (MAS), the highest score in the extrovertive scale of the Maudsley Personality Inventory (MPI) and the lowest score in the neurotic scale of MPI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmid=9895201 | doi=10.1046/j.1440-1819.1998.00452.x | volume=52 | title=Frontal midline theta rhythm and mental activity | year=1998 | author=Inanaga K | journal=Psychiatry Clin Neurosci | pages=555–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACC detects conflicting information coming from distractions. When a person is presented with a conflicting stimulus, the brain initially processes the stimulus incorrectly. This is known as [[error-related negativity]] (ERN). Before the ERN reaches a [[Sensory threshold|threshold]], the correct conflict  is detected by the [[frontocentral N2]]. After the correction, the rostral ACC is activated and allows for executive attention to the correct stimulus.&lt;ref name=Veen2002&gt;{{cite journal |author1=van Veen V. |author2=Carter C.S. | year = 2002 | title = The anterior cingulate as a conflict monitor: FMRI and ERP studies | url = | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 77 | issue = | pages = 477–482 | doi=10.1016/s0031-9384(02)00930-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, [[mindfulness meditation]] could potentially be a method for treating [[attention]] related disorders such as [[ADHD]] and [[bipolar disorder]].

== Body awareness ==
[[File:Gray717-emphasizing-insula.png|thumb|right|Gray matter &amp; insula]]

Body awareness refers to focusing on an object/task within the body such as breathing. From a qualitative interview with ten mindfulness meditators, some of the following responses were observed: "When I'm walking, I deliberately notice the sensations of my body moving" and "I notice how foods and drinks affect my thoughts, bodily sensations, and emotions”.&lt;ref name=Holzel2006&gt;Hölzel, B.K., Ott, U., Hempel, H., &amp; Stark, R. (2006, May). Wie wirkt Achtsamkeit? Eine Interviewstudie mit erfahrenen Meditierenden(How does mindfulness work? An interview study with experienced meditators). Paper presented at the 24th Symposium of the Section for Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy of the German Society for Psychology, Würzburg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; The two possible mechanisms by which a mindfulness meditator can experience body awareness are discussed below.

* Meditators showed a greater cortical thickness &lt;ref name=Lazar2005&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lazar S.W. |author2=Kerr C.E. |author3=Wasserman R.H. |author4=Gray J.R. |author5=Greve D.N. |author6=Treadway M.T. |author7=Fischl B. | year = 2005 | title = Meditation experience is associated with increased cortical thickness | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 1893–1897 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000186598.66243.19 | pmid=16272874 | pmc=1361002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and greater [[gray matter]] concentration in the right anterior [[insular cortex|insula]].&lt;ref name=Holzel2008&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hölzel B.K. |author2=Ott U. |author3=Gard T. |author4=Hempel H. |author5=Weygandt M. |author6=Morgen K. |author7=Vaitl D. | year = 2008 | title = Investigation of mindfulness meditation practitioners with voxel-based morphometry | journal = Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 55–61 | doi=10.1093/scan/nsm038 | pmid=19015095 | pmc=2569815}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* On the contrary, subjects who had undergone 8 weeks of mindfulness training showed no significant change in gray matter concentration of the insula, but rather an increase [[gray matter]] concentration of the [[temporo-parietal junction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hölzel B.K. |author2=Carmody J. |author3=Vangel M. |author4=Congleton C. |author5=Yerramsetti S.M. |author6=Gard T. |author7=Lazar S.W. | year = 2011 | title = Mindfulness practice leads to increases in regional brain gray matter density | url = | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 36–43 | doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2010.08.006 | pmid=21071182 | pmc=3004979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[insular cortex|insula]] is responsible for awareness to stimuli and the thickness of its [[gray matter]] correlates to the accuracy and detection of the stimuli by the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Craig A.D. | year = 2003 | title = Interoception: The sense of the physiological condition of the body | doi = 10.1016/s0959-4388(03)00090-4 | journal = Current Opinion in Neurobiology | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 500–505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Critchley H.D. |author2=Wiens S. |author3=Rotshtein P. |author4=Ohman A. |author5=Dolan R.J. | year = 2004 | title = Neural systems supporting interoceptive awareness | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 189–195 | doi=10.1038/nn1176 | pmid=14730305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative evidence suggests that mindfulness meditation impacts body awareness, however this component is not well characterized.&lt;ref name=Holzel2011/&gt;

== Emotion regulation ==
[[File:Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) Abnormal Brain Structures.png|thumb|right|Prefrontal cortex &amp; amygdala]]

Emotions can be regulated cognitively or behaviorally. Cognitive regulation (in terms of mindfulness meditation) means having control over giving attention to a particular stimuli or by changing the response to that stimuli. The cognitive change is achieved through [[reappraisal]] (interpreting the stimulus in a more positive manner) and [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] (reversing the response to the stimulus). Behavioral regulation refers to inhibiting the expression of certain behaviors in response to a stimulus. Research suggests two main mechanisms for how [[mindfulness meditation]] influences the emotional response to a stimulus.
  
* [[Mindfulness meditation]] regulates emotions via increased activation of the dorso-medial PFC and rostral ACC.&lt;ref name =Holzel2007/&gt;
* Increased activation of the ventrolateral PFC can regulate emotion by decreasing the activity of the [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harenski C.L. |author2=Hamann S. | year = 2006 | title = Neural correlates of regulating negative emotions related to moral violations | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 313–324 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2005.09.034 | pmid=16249098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beauregard M. |author2=Levesque J. |author3=Bourgouin P. | year = 2001 | title = Neural correlates of conscious self-regulation of emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 21 | issue = | page = RC165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schaefer S.M. |author2=Jackson D.C. |author3=Davidson R.J. |author4=Aguirre G.K. |author5=Kimberg D.Y. |author6=Thompson-Schill S.L. | year = 2002 | title = Modulation of amygdalar activity by the conscious regulation of negative emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 913–921 | doi=10.1162/089892902760191135 | pmid=12191458}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also predicted by a study that observed the effect of a person's mood/attitude during mindfulness on brain activation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Creswell J.D. |author2=Way B.M. |author3=Eisenberger N.I. |author4=Lieberman M.D. | year = 2007 | title = Neural correlates of dispositional mindfulness during affect labeling | url = | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 69 | issue = | pages = 560–565 | doi=10.1097/psy.0b013e3180f6171f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lateral prefrontal cortex]] (lPFC) is important for selective attention while ventral [[prefrontal cortex]] (vPFC) is involved in inhibiting a response. As noted before, the [[anterior cingulate cortex]] (ACC) has been noted for maintaining attention to a stimulus. The [[amygdala]] is responsible for generating emotions. [[Mindfulness meditation]] is believed to be able to regulate negative thoughts and decrease emotional reactivity through these regions of the brain. Emotion regulation deficits have been noted in disorders such as [[borderline personality disorder]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Silbersweig D. |author2=Clarkin J.F. |author3=Goldstein M. |author4=Kernberg O.F. |author5=Tuescher O. |author6=Levy K.N. |author7=Rauch S.L. | year = 2007 | title = Failure of frontolimbic inhibitory function in the context of negative emotion in borderline personality disorder | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = | pages = 1832–1841 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.06010126 | pmid=18056238}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Abercrombie H.C. |author2=Schaefer S.M. |author3=Larson C.L. |author4=Oakes T.R. |author5=Lindgren K.A. |author6=Holden J.E. |author7=Davidson R.J. | year = 1998 | title = Metabolic rate in the right amygdala predicts negative affect in depressed patients | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 3301–3307 | doi=10.1097/00001756-199810050-00028}}&lt;/ref&gt; These deficits have been associated with reduced prefrontal activation and increased [[amygdala]] activity, which mindfulness meditation might be able to attenuate.

== Pain ==
*{{see also|Meditation and pain}}
Pain is known to activate the following regions of the brain: the [[anterior cingulate cortex]], anterior/posterior [[insular cortex|insula]], primary/secondary [[somatosensory]] cortices, and the [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name=Zeidan2012&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zeidan F. |author2=Grant J. A. |author3=Brown C. A. |author4=McHaffie J. G. |author5=Coghill R. C. | year = 2012 | title = Mindfulness meditation-related pain relief: Evidence for unique brain mechanisms in the regulation of pain | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 520 | issue = 2| pages = 165–173 | doi = 10.1016/j.neulet.2012.03.082 | pmid=22487846 | pmc=3580050}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mindfulness meditation may provide several methods by which a person can consciously regulate pain.&lt;ref name=Zeidan2012/&gt;
 
* Brown and Jones found that mindfulness meditation decreased pain anticipation in the right parietal cortex and mid-cingulate cortex. Mindfulness meditation also increased the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and ventromedial-prefrontal cortex (vm-PFC). Since the vm-PFC is involved in inhibiting emotional responses to stimuli, anticipation to pain was concluded to be reduced by cognitive and emotional control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brown C.A. |author2=Jones A.K. | year = 2010 | title = Meditation experience predicts less negative appraisal of pain: electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of anticipatory neural responses | url = | journal = Pain | volume = 150 | issue = 3| pages = 428–438 | doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.04.017 | pmid=20494517}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another study by Grant revealed that meditators showed greater activation of insula, thalamus, and mid-cingulate cortex while a lower activation of the regions responsible for emotion control (medial-PFC, OFC, and amygdala). Meditators were believed to be in a mental state that allowed them to pay close attention to the sensory input from the stimuli and simultaneously inhibit any appraisal or emotional reactivity.&lt;ref name=Grant2010/&gt;

Brown and Jones found that meditators showed no difference in pain sensitivity but rather the anticipation in pain. However, Grant's research showed that meditators experienced lower sensitivity to pain. These conflicting studies illustrate that the exact mechanism may vary with the expertise level or meditation technique.&lt;ref name=Zeidan2012/&gt;

'''Medical translation''' is the practice of translating various documents—training materials, medical bulletins, drug data sheets, etc.—for health care, medical devices, marketing, or for clinical, regulatory, and technical documentation. Most countries require that companies and organizations translate literature and labeling for medical devices or pharmaceuticals into their national language. Documents for clinical trials often require translation for local clinicians and patients and regulatory representatives. Regulatory approval submissions typically must be translated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergogroup.com/articles/how-europe-regulates-devices|title=Resource Library for Medical Device Professionals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ce-mark.com/neweu.pdf|title=EU Medical and IVD Device Labeling: Translation Requirements and Trends |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to linguistic skills, medical translation requires specific training and subject matter knowledge because of the highly technical, sensitive, and regulated nature of medical texts.

==Process==
Medical translation steps can include:
* Extracting text from source format
* [[Translation|Translating]] text to the target language
* Editing by a separate person to assure adherence to approved terminology and proper style and voice
* Publishing the translation in the original format (e.g., Word document, Web page, e-learning program)
* [[Proofreading]] to ensure the formatted translation has proper punctuation and line and page breaks, and displays correctly 
* Reviewing in-country by a native-speaking expert to ensure the translation meets all requirements

Translation agencies may oversee both project management and linguistic aspects. [citation needed] 

==Quality and Standards==
The life and death nature of medical texts mandates a strong emphasis on translation quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.fxtrans.com/2009/11/quality-is-dead-long-live-measurable.html|title=Long live translation quality|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international medical industry is highly regulated, and companies who must translate documentation typically choose translation agencies certified or compliant with one or more of the following standards:

* [[EN 15038]] — European standard for translation vendor quality ([[Translation-quality standards]])
* [[ISO 9001]] — Quality system standard
* [[ISO 13485]] — Overarching standard for medical device manufacture

Judd, The MBR book (2006) Principles and applications of membrane bioreactors in water and wastewater treatment, Elsevier, Oxford {{ISBN|1856174816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[Image:MBR Schematic.jpg|thumb|400 px|Simple schematic describing the MBR process]]
When used with [[sewage|domestic wastewater]], MBR processes can produce effluent of high quality enough to be discharged to coastal, surface or brackish waterways or to be reclaimed for urban irrigation. Other advantages of MBRs over conventional processes include small footprint, easy retrofit and upgrade of old wastewater treatment plants.

It is possible to operate MBR processes at higher [[mixed liquor suspended solids]] (MLSS) concentrations compared to conventional settlement separation systems, thus reducing the reactor volume to achieve the same loading rate.

Two MBR configurations exist: internal/submerged, where the membranes are immersed in and integral to the biological reactor; and external/sidestream, where membranes are a separate unit process requiring an intermediate pumping step.

Recent technical innovation and significant membrane cost reduction have enabled MBRs to become an established process option to treat wastewaters.&lt;ref name=judd/&gt; As a result, the MBR process has now become an attractive option for the treatment and reuse of industrial and municipal wastewaters, as evidenced by their constantly rising numbers and capacity. The current MBR market has been estimated to value around US$216 million in 2006 and to rise to US$363 million by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=S. Atkinson|doi=10.1016/S0958-2118(06)70635-8|title=Research studies predict strong growth for MBR markets|year=2006|journal=Membrane Technology|volume=2006|issue=2|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:SubmergedMBR Schematic.jpg|thumb|400px|Schematic of a submerged MBR]]

Membrane bioreactors can be used to reduce the footprint of an activated sludge sewage treatment system by removing some of the liquid component of the mixed liquor. This leaves a concentrated waste product that is then treated using the [[activated sludge]] process.

==History and basic operating parameters==
The MBR process was introduced by the late 1960s, as soon as commercial scale [[ultrafiltration]] (UF) and [[microfiltration]] (MF) membranes were available. The original process was introduced by Dorr-Oliver Inc. and combined the use of an [[activated sludge]] bioreactor with a crossflow membrane filtration loop. The flat sheet membranes used in this process were polymeric and featured pore sizes ranging from 0.003 to 0.01 μm. Although the idea of replacing the [[settling tank]] of the conventional activated sludge process was attractive, it was difficult to justify the use of such a process because of the high cost of membranes, low economic value of the product (tertiary effluent) and the potential rapid loss of performance due to membrane fouling. As a result, the focus was on the attainment of high fluxes, and it was therefore necessary to pump the MLSS at high crossflow velocity at significant energy penalty (of the order 10 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; product) to reduce fouling. Because of the poor economics of the first generation MBRs, they only found applications in niche areas with special needs, such as isolated trailer parks or ski resorts.

The breakthrough for the MBR came in 1989 with Yamamoto and co-workers idea of submerging the membranes in the bioreactor. Until then, MBRs were designed with the separation device located external to the reactor (sidestream MBR) and relied on high transmembrane pressure (TMP) to maintain filtration. With the membrane directly immersed in the bioreactor, submerged MBR systems are usually preferred to sidestream configuration, especially for domestic wastewater treatment. The submerged configuration relies on [[Coarse bubble diffusers|coarse bubble aeration]] to produce mixing and limit fouling. The energy demand of the submerged system can be up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of the sidestream systems and submerged systems operate at a lower flux, demanding more membrane area. In submerged configurations, aeration is considered as one of the major parameters in process performance both hydraulic and biological. Aeration maintains solids in suspension, scours the membrane surface and provides oxygen to the biomass, leading to a better biodegradability and cell synthesis.

The other key steps in the recent MBR development were the acceptance of modest fluxes (25 percent or less of those in the first generation), and the idea to use two-phase bubbly flow to control fouling. The lower operating cost obtained with the submerged configuration along with the steady decrease in the membrane cost encouraged an exponential increase in MBR plant installations from the mid 90s. Since then, further improvements in the MBR design and operation have been introduced and incorporated into larger plants. While early MBRs were operated at solid retention times (SRT) as high as 100 days with MLSS up to 30 g/L, the recent trend is to apply lower solid retention times (around 10–20 days), resulting in more manageable MLSS levels (10 to 15 g/L). Thanks to these new operating conditions, the oxygen transfer and the pumping cost in the MBR have tended to decrease and overall maintenance has been simplified. There is now a range of MBR systems commercially available, most of which use submerged membranes although some external modules are available; these external systems also use two-phase flow for fouling control. Typical hydraulic retention times (HRT) range between 3 and 10 hours. In terms of membrane configurations, mainly [[Hollow fiber membrane|hollow fiber]] and flat sheet membranes are applied for MBR applications.&lt;ref name=le-clech1&gt;{{cite journal|author1=P. Le-Clech |author2=V. Chen |author3=A.G. Fane |doi=10.1016/j.memsci.2006.08.019|title=Fouling in membrane bioreactors used in wastewater treatment|year=2006|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=284|pages=17–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wastewater UF membrane system, Aquabio.jpg|thumb|UF membrane side stream configuration]]
Despite the more favourable energy usage of submerged membranes, there continued to be a market for the side stream configuration, particularly in smaller flow industrial applications. For ease of maintenance the side stream configuration can be installed on a lower level in a plant building. Membrane replacement can be undertaken without specialised lifting equipment. As a result, research continued with the side stream configuration, during which time it was found that full scale plants could be operated with higher fluxes. This has culminated in recent years with the development of low energy systems which incorporate more sophisticated control of the operating parameters coupled with periodic back washes, which enable sustainable operation at energy usage as low as 0.3 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of product.

==Configurations==

===Internal/submerged===
The filtration element is installed in either the main bioreactor vessel or in a separate tank. The membranes can be flat sheet or tubular or combination of both, and can incorporate an online backwash system which reduces membrane surface fouling by pumping membrane permeate back through the membrane. In systems where the membranes are in a separate tank to the bioreactor, individual trains of membranes can be isolated to undertake cleaning regimes incorporating membrane soaks, however the biomass must be continuously pumped back to the main reactor to limit MLSS concentration increase. Additional aeration is also required to provide air scour to reduce fouling. Where the membranes are installed in the main reactor, membrane modules are removed from the vessel and transferred to an offline cleaning tank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Z. | last2 = Wu | first2 = Z. | last3 = Yin | first3 = X. | last4 = Tian | first4 = L. | year = 2008 | title = Membrane fouling in a submerged membrane bioreactor (MBR) under sub-critical flux operation: Membrane foulant and gel layer characterization | url = | journal = Journal of Membrane Science | volume = 325 | issue = 1| pages = 238–244 | doi = 10.1016/j.memsci.2008.07.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External/sidestream===
The filtration elements are installed externally to the reactor, often in a plant room. The biomass is either pumped directly through a number of membrane modules in series and back to the bioreactor, or the biomass is pumped to a bank of modules, from which a second pump circulates the biomass through the modules in series. Cleaning and soaking of the membranes can be undertaken in place with use of an installed cleaning tank, pump and pipework.

==Major considerations==

===Fouling and fouling control===
The MBR filtration performance inevitably decreases with filtration time. This is due to the deposition of soluble and particulate materials onto and into the membrane, attributed to the interactions between activated sludge components and the membrane. This major drawback and process limitation has been under investigation since the early MBRs, and remains one of the most challenging issues facing further MBR development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.membrane.unsw.edu.au/research/mbr.htm Membrane Bioreactors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308092504/http://www.membrane.unsw.edu.au/research/mbr.htm |date=2008-03-08 }}. membrane.unsw.edu.au&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cui&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Z.F. Cui |author2=S. Chang |author3=A.G. Fane |doi=10.1016/S0376-7388(03)00246-1|title=The use of gas bubbling to enhance membrane processes|year=2003|journal=Journal of Membrane Science|volume=221|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent reviews covering membrane applications to bioreactors, it has been shown that, as with other membrane separation processes, membrane fouling is the most serious problem affecting system performance. Fouling leads to a significant increase in hydraulic resistance, manifested as permeate flux decline or transmembrane pressure (TMP) increase when the process is operated under constant-TMP or constant-flux conditions respectively.&lt;ref name=meng&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meng|first1=Fangang|last2=Yang|first2=Fenglin|last3=Shi|first3=Baoqiang|last4=Zhang|first4=Hanmin|title=A comprehensive study on membrane fouling in submerged membrane bioreactors operated under different aeration intensities|journal=Separation and Purification Technology|date=February 2008|volume=59|issue=1|pages=91–100|doi=10.1016/j.seppur.2007.05.040|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1383586607002675|accessdate=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In systems where flux is maintained by increasing TMP, the energy required to achieve filtration increases. Alternatively frequent membrane cleaning is therefore required, increasing significantly the operating costs as a result of cleaning agents and production downtime. More frequent membrane replacement is also expected.

Membrane fouling results from interaction between the membrane material and the components of the activated sludge liquor, which include biological flocs formed by a large range of living or dead microorganisms along with soluble and colloidal compounds. The suspended biomass has no fixed composition and varies both with feed water composition and MBR operating conditions employed. Thus though many investigations of membrane fouling have been published, the diverse range of operating conditions and feedwater matrices employed, the different analytical methods used and the limited information reported in most studies on the suspended biomass composition, has made it difficult to establish any generic behaviour pertaining to membrane fouling in MBRs specifically.

[[Image:MBR FiltrationFactors.jpg|thumb|700 px|Factors influencing fouling (interactions in red)]]
The air-induced cross flow obtained in submerged MBR can efficiently remove or at least reduce the fouling layer on the membrane surface. A recent review reports the latest findings on applications of aeration in submerged membrane configuration and describes the enhancement of performances offered by gas bubbling.&lt;ref name=cui/&gt; As an optimal air flow-rate has been identified behind which further increases in aeration have no effect on fouling removal, the choice of aeration rate is a key parameter in MBR design.

Many other anti-fouling strategies can be applied to MBR applications. They comprise, for example:
*Intermittent permeation or relaxation, where the filtration is stopped at regular time interval before being resumed. Particles deposited on the membrane surface tend to diffuse back to the reactor; this phenomenon being increased by the continuous aeration applied during this resting period.
*Membrane backwashing, where permeate water is pumped back to the membrane, and flow through the pores to the feed channel, dislodging internal and external foulants.
*Air backwashing, where pressurized air in the permeate side of the membrane build up and release a significant pressure within a very short period of time. Membrane modules therefore need to be in a pressurised vessel coupled to a vent system. Air usually does not go through the membrane. If it did, the air would dry the membrane and a rewet step would be necessary, by pressurizing the feed side of the membrane.
*Proprietary anti-fouling products, such as Nalco's Membrane Performance Enhancer Technology.&lt;ref&gt;Nalco. http://www.nalco.com/ASP/applications/membrane_tech/products/mpe.asp . {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607074607/http://www.nalco.com/ASP/applications/membrane_tech/products/mpe.asp |date=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, different types/intensities of chemical cleaning may also be recommended:
*Chemically enhanced backwash (daily);
*Maintenance cleaning with higher chemical concentration (weekly);
*Intensive chemical cleaning (once or twice a year).

Intensive cleaning is also carried out when further filtration cannot be sustained because of an elevated transmembrane pressure (TMP). Each of the four main MBR suppliers (Kubota, Evoqua, Mitsubishi and GE Water) have their own chemical cleaning recipes, which differ mainly in terms of concentration and methods (see Table 1). Under normal conditions, the prevalent cleaning agents remain NaOCl ([[sodium hypochlorite]]) and [[citric acid]]. It is common for MBR suppliers to adapt specific protocols for chemical cleanings (i.e. chemical concentrations and cleaning frequencies) for individual facilities.&lt;ref name=le-clech1/&gt;

[[Image:MBR Cleaning.jpg|thumb|550 px|Intensive chemical cleaning protocols for four MBR suppliers (the exact protocol for chemical cleaning can vary from a plant to another)]]

===Biological performances/kinetics===

====COD removal and sludge yield====
Simply due to the high number of microorganism in MBRs, the pollutants uptake rate can be increased. This leads to better degradation in a given time span or to smaller required reactor volumes. In comparison to the conventional activated sludge process (ASP) which typically achieves 95 percent, COD removal can be increased to 96 to 99 percent in MBRs (see table,&lt;ref name=kraume&gt;{{cite journal|author1=M. Kraume |author2=U. Bracklow |author3=M. Vocks |author4=A. Drews |pmid=16004001|year=2005|title=Nutrients removal in MBRs for municipal wastewater treatment|volume=51|issue=6–7|pages=391–402|journal=Water Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;). COD and BOD5 removal are found to increase with MLSS concentration. Above 15 g/L COD removal becomes almost independent of biomass concentration at &gt;96 percent.&lt;ref name=drews&gt;{{cite journal|author1=A. Drews |author2=H. Evenblij |author3=S. Rosenberger |doi=10.1002/ep.10113|title=Potential and drawbacks of microbiology-membrane interaction in membrane bioreactors|year=2005|journal=Environmental Progress|volume=24|issue=4|pages=426–433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbitrary high MLSS concentrations are not employed, however, as oxygen transfer is impeded due to higher and [[non-Newtonian fluid]] viscosity. Kinetics may also differ due to easier substrate access. In ASP, flocs may reach several 100 μm in size. This means that the substrate can reach the active sites only by diffusion which causes an additional resistance and limits the overall reaction rate (diffusion controlled). Hydrodynamic stress in MBRs reduces floc size (to 3.5 μm in sidestream MBRs) and thereby increases the apparent reaction rate. Like in the conventional ASP, sludge yield is decreased at higher SRT or biomass concentration. Little or no sludge is produced at sludge loading rates of 0.01 kgCOD/(kgMLSS d).&lt;ref&gt;T. Stephenson, S. Judd, B. Jefferson, K. Brindle, Membrane bioreactors for wastewater treatment, IWA Publishing (2000) {{ISBN|1900222078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the imposed biomass concentration limit, such low loading rates would result in enormous tank sizes or long HRTs in conventional ASP.

====Nutrient removal====
Nutrient removal is one of the main concerns in modern [[wastewater treatment]] especially in areas that are sensitive to [[eutrophication]]. Like in the conventional ASP, currently, the most widely applied technology for N-removal from municipal wastewater is [[nitrification]] combined with [[denitrification]]. Besides phosphorus precipitation, [[enhanced biological phosphorus removal]] (EBPR) can be implemented which requires an additional anaerobic process step. Some characteristics of MBR technology render EBPR in combination with post-denitrification an attractive alternative that achieves very low nutrient effluent concentrations.&lt;ref name=drews/&gt;

[[Image:MBR NutrientRemoval.jpg|thumb|600 px|Nutrients removal in MBRs for municipal wastewater treatment&lt;ref name=kraume/&gt;]]

====Anaerobic MBRs====
[[Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor|Anaerobic MBRs]] (sometimes abbreviated AnMBR) were introduced in the 1980s in South Africa and currently see a renaissance in research. However, anaerobic processes are normally used when a low cost treatment is required that enables [[energy recovery]] but does not achieve advanced treatment (low carbon removal, no nutrients removal). In contrast, membrane-based technologies enable advanced treatment (disinfection), but at high energy cost. Therefore, the combination of both can only be economically viable if a compact process for energy recovery is desired, or when disinfection is required after anaerobic treatment (cases of water reuse with nutrients). If maximal energy recovery is desired, a single anaerobic process will be always superior to a combination with a membrane process.

Recently, anaerobic MBRs have seen successful full-scale application to the treatment of some types of industrial wastewaters—typically high-strength wastes. Example applications include the treatment of alcohol stillage wastewater in Japan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grant|first=Shannon|author2=Page, Ian |author3=Moro, Masashi |author4= Yamamoto, Tetsuya |title=Full-Scale Applications of the Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor Process for Treatment of Stillage from Alcohol Production in Japan|journal=Proceedings of the Water Environment Federation|year=2008|series=WEFTEC 2008: Session 101 through Session 115|pages=7556–7570|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wef/wefproc/2008/00002008/00000007/art00007|accessdate=3 Jan 2013 |doi=10.2175/193864708790894179 |volume=2008|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the treatment of salad dressing/barbecue sauce wastewater in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Christian|first=Scott |author2=Shannon Grant |author3=Peter McCarthy |author4=Dwain Wilson |author5=Dale Mills|title=The First Two Years of Full-Scale Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (AnMBR) Operation Treating High-Strength Industrial Wastewater|journal=Water Practice &amp; Technology|year=2011|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.2166/wpt.2011.032|url=http://www.iwaponline.com/wpt/006/wpt0060032.htm|doi-broken-date=2018-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixing and hydrodynamics===
Like in any other reactors, the [[hydrodynamics]] (or mixing) within an MBR plays an important role in determining the pollutant removal and fouling control within an MBR.  It has a substantial effect on the energy usage and size requirements of an MBR, therefore the whole life cost of an MBR is high.

The removal of pollutants is greatly influenced by the length of time fluid elements spend in the MBR (i.e. the [[residence time distribution]] or RTD).  The [[residence time distribution]] is a description of the [[hydrodynamics]]/mixing in the system and is determined by the design of the MBR (e.g. MBR size, inlet/recycle flowrates, wall/baffle/mixer/aerator positioning, mixing energy input).  An example of the effect of mixing is that a [[continuous stirred-tank reactor]] will not have as high pollutant conversion per unit volume of reactor as a [[plug flow]] reactor.

The control of fouling, as previously mentioned, is primarily undertaken using coarse bubble aeration.  The distribution of bubbles around the membranes, the shear at the membrane surface for cake removal and the size of the bubble are greatly influenced by the mixing/[[hydrodynamics]] of the system.  The mixing within the system can also influence the production of possible foulants.  For example, vessels not completely mixed (i.e. plug flow reactors) are more susceptible to the effects of shock loads which may cause cell lysis and release of soluble microbial products.

[[Image:MBR-Mixing RTD-and-CFD.jpg|thumb|600 px|Example of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modelling results (streamlines) for a full-scale MBR (Adapted from the Project AMEDEUS – Australian Node Newsletter August 2007&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbr-network.eu/mbr-forum/forum_entry.php?id=194 MBR-Network] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425045125/http://www.mbr-network.eu/mbr-forum/forum_entry.php?id=194 |date=2008-04-25 }}. mbr-network.eu&lt;/ref&gt;).]]

Many factors affect the hydrodynamics of wastewater processes and hence MBRs.  These range from physical properties (e.g. mixture [[rheology]] and gas/liquid/solid density etc.) to the fluid [[boundary conditions]] (e.g. inlet/outlet/recycle flowrates, baffle/mixer position etc.).  However, many factors are peculiar to MBRs, these cover the filtration tank design (e.g. membrane type, multiple outlets attributed to membranes, membrane packing density, membrane orientation etc.) and its operation (e.g. membrane relaxation, membrane back flush etc.).

The mixing modelling and design techniques applied to MBRs are very similar to those used for conventional activated sludge systems.  They include the relatively quick and easy [[compartmental modelling]] technique which will only derive the RTD of a process (e.g. the MBR) or the process unit (e.g. membrane filtration vessel) and relies on broad assumptions of the mixing properties of each sub-unit.  [[Computational fluid dynamics]] modelling (CFD) on the other hand does not rely on broad assumptions of the mixing characteristics and attempts to predict the hydrodynamics from a fundamental level.  It is applicable to all scales of fluid flow and can reveal much information about the mixing in a process, ranging from the RTD to the shear profile on a membrane surface.  Visualisation of MBR CFD modelling results is shown in the image.

Investigations of MBR hydrodynamics have occurred at many different scales, ranging from examination of shear stress at the membrane surface to RTD analysis of the whole MBR.  Cui et al. (2003)&lt;ref name=cui/&gt; investigated the movement of Taylor bubbles through tubular membranes. Khosravi, M. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Khosravi, M. and Kraume, M. (2007) Prediction of the circulation velocity in a membrane bioreactor, IWA Harrogate, UK&lt;/ref&gt; examined the entire membrane filtration vessel using CFD and velocity measurements, while Brannock et al. (2007)&lt;ref&gt;Brannock, M.W.D., Kuechle, B., Wang, Y. and Leslie, G. (2007) Evaluation of membrane bioreactor performance via residence time distribution analysis: effects of membrane configuration in full-scale MBRs, IWA Berlin, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; examined the entire MBR using tracer study experiments and RTD analysis.

In [[linguistics]], the '''minimalist program''' ('''MP''') is a major line of inquiry that has been developing inside [[generative grammar]] since the early 1990s, starting with a 1993 paper by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1993. ''A minimalist program for linguistic theory''. MIT occasional papers in linguistics no. 1. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Distributed by MIT Working Papers in Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky presents MP as a [[research program|program]], not as a theory, following [[Imre Lakatos]]'s distinction.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of this distinction in the context of linguistics, see Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism: Origins, Concepts, Methods, and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The MP seeks to be a mode of inquiry characterized by the flexibility of the multiple directions that its minimalism enables. Ultimately, the MP provides a conceptual framework used to guide the development of linguistic theory. In minimalism, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] attempts to approach [[universal grammar]] from below—that is, proposing the question "what would be the optimal answer to what the theory of [[i-Language]] should be?"

For Chomsky, there are [[Minimalist grammar|minimalist]] questions, but the answers can be framed in any theory. Of all these questions, the two that play the most crucial role are:&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims'', pp. 84 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*What is language?
*Why does it have the properties it has?

== Theoretical goals ==

=== Perfection ===

The MP appeals to the idea that the language ability in humans shows signs of being incorporated under an optimal design with exquisite organization, which seems to suggest that the inner workings conform to a very simple computational law or a particular mental organ. In other words, the MP works on the assumption that [[universal grammar]] constitutes a perfect design in the sense that it contains only what is necessary to meet humans' conceptual and physical (phonological) needs.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical standpoint, and in the context of [[generative grammar]], the MP draws on the minimalist approach of the [[principles and parameters]] program, considered to be the ultimate standard theoretical model that generative linguistics has developed since the 1980s. What this approach suggests is the existence of a fixed set of principles valid for all languages, which, when combined with settings for a finite set of binary switches (parameters), may describe the specific properties that characterize the language system a child eventually comes to attain.&lt;ref&gt;There are many introductions to Principle and Parameters. Two that align PP in such a way that make the transition to MP smooth are Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell, and Cook, Vivian J. and Newson, Mark. 2007. ''Chomsky's Universal Grammar: An Introduction''. Third Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP aims to get to know how much of the [[principles and parameters]] model can be taken as a result of this hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty. In turn, more developed versions of the [[Principles and Parameters]] approach provide technical principles from which the MP can be seen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed introductory discussion between the transition of the technicalities from PP to MP see, among others, Gert Webelhuth. 1995. ''Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program: Principles and Parameters in Syntactic Theory''. Wiley-Blackwell; Uriagereka, Juan. 1998. ''Rhyme and Reason. An Introduction to Minimalist Syntax''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]; Hornstein, Norbert, Jairo Nunes and Kleanthes K. Grohmann. 2005. ''Understanding Minimalism''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; and Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===

The MP aims at the further development of ideas involving ''economy of derivation'' and ''economy of representation'', which had started to become significant in the early 1990s, but were still peripheral aspects of [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full description of the checking mechanism see Adger, David. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economy of derivation is a principle stating that movements (i.e., transformations) only occur in order to match ''interpretable features'' with ''uninterpretable features''. An example of an interpretable feature is the plural [[inflection]] on regular English nouns, e.g., ''dog'''s'''''. The word ''dogs'' can only be used to refer to several dogs, not a single dog, and so this inflection contributes to meaning, making it ''interpretable''. English verbs are inflected according to the [[grammatical number|number]] of their subject (e.g., "Dogs bite" vs. "A dog bite'''''s'''''"), but this information is only interpretable once a relationship is formed between the subject and the verb, so movement of the subject is required.
* Economy of representation is the principle that grammatical structures must exist for a purpose, i.e., the structure of a sentence should be no larger or more complex than required to satisfy constraints on grammaticality, which are equivalent to constraints on the mapping between the conceptual/intentional and sensori-motor interfaces in the optimal system that minimalism seeks to explore.

== Technical innovations ==

The exploration of minimalist questions has led to several radical changes in the technical apparatus of transformational generative grammatical theory. Some of the most important are:&lt;ref&gt;For some conceptual and empirical advantages of the MP over the traditional view see: Bošković, Željko. 1994. D-Structure, Θ-Criterion, and Movement into Θ-Positions. Linguistic Analysis 24: 247–286, and for more detailed discussions Bošković, Željko and Howard Lasnik (eds). 2006.

=== Bare phrase structure ===

A major development of MP inquiry is bare phrase structure (BPS), a theory of [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] (sentence building prior to movement) developed by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chomsky, Noam. 1995. Bare Phrase Structure. In ''Evolution and Revolution in Linguistic Theory. Essays in honor of Carlos Otero''., eds. Hector Campos and Paula Kempchinsky, 51–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of BPS has moved the Chomskyan tradition toward the [[dependency grammar]] tradition, which operates with significantly less structure than most [[phrase structure grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Timothy, Michael Putnam, and Thomas Gross 2011. Bare phrase structure, label-less structures, and specifier-less syntax: Is Minimalism becoming a dependency grammar? The Linguistic Review 28: 315–364&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory contrasts with [[X-bar theory]], which preceded it, in four important ways:

# BPS is explicitly derivational. That is, it is built from the bottom up, bit by bit. In contrast, X-bar theory is representational—a structure for a given construction is built in one fell swoop, and [[lexical items]] are inserted into the structure.
# BPS does not have a preconceived phrasal structure, while in X-bar theory every phrase has a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], a [[head (linguistics)|head]], and a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]].
# BPS permits only binary branching, while X-bar theory permits both binary and unary branching.
# BPS does not distinguish between a "head" and a "terminal", while some versions of X-bar theory require such a distinction.

BPS incorporates two basic operations: "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]" and "[[Move α|move]]". Although there is active debate on exactly how "move" should be formulated, the differences between the current proposals are relatively minute. The following description follows Chomsky's original proposal.&lt;!--so where is the discussion of move, then? The rest of this section only describes merge. Is move unimportant, or has it been forgotten?--&gt;

Merge is a function that takes two objects (say α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label (either α or β, in this case α). The label identifies the properties of the phrase.

Merge (α, β) → {α, {α, β} }

For example, "merge" can operate on the lexical items "drink" and "water" to give "drink water". Note that the phrase "drink water" behaves more like the [[verb]] ''drink'' than like the [[noun]] ''water''. That is, wherever the verb ''drink'' can be put, so too can the phrase "drink water":

I like to _____________ (drink)/(drink water).&lt;br&gt;
(Drinking/Drinking water) __________ is fun.

Furthermore, the phrase "drink water" can not typically be put in the same places as the noun ''water'':

It can be said, "There's some ''water'' on the table", but not "There's some ''drink water'' on the table".

So, the phrase is identified with a label. In the case of "drink water", the label is ''drink'' since the phrase acts as a verb. For simplicity, this phrase is called a verb phrase (VP). If "cold" and "water" were merged to get "cold water", this would be a noun phrase (NP) with the label "water"; it follows that the phrase "cold water" can appear in the same environments as the noun ''water'' in the three test sentences above. So, for ''drink water'', there is the following:

Merge (drink, water) → {drink, {drink, water} }

This can be represented in a typical [[concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] as follows:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree Drink Water.png|150px]]

or, with more technical terms, as:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree VP.png|150px]]

Merge can also operate on structures already built. If it could not, then such a system would predict only two-word utterances to be grammatical. If a new head is merged with a previously formed object (a phrase), the function has the form

Merge &lt;code&gt;(γ, {α, {α, β}}) → {γ, {γ, {α, {α, β}}}}&lt;/code&gt;

Here, γ is the label, so that γ "projects" from the label of the head. This corresponds to the following tree structure:

[[Image:Minimalist Syntax Tree 1.png|150px]]

Merge operates blindly, projecting labels in all possible combinations. The [[subcategorization]] features of the head then license certain label projections and eliminate all derivations with alternate projections.

=== Phases ===
A "'''phase'''" is a syntactic domain first hypothesized by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1998). "Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework" MIT Occasional Papers in Linguistics 15. Republished in 2000 in R. Martin, D. Michaels, &amp; J. Uriagereka (eds.). ''Step By Step: Essays In Syntax in Honor of [[Howard Lasnik]]''. 89–155. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple sentence is often decomposed into two phases, CP and ''v''P (see [[X-bar theory]]). Movement of a constituent out of a phase is (in the general case) only permitted if the constituent has first moved to the left edge of the phase. This condition is described in the ''phase impenetrability condition'', which has been variously formulated within the literature. In its original conception, only the ''v''P in transitive and [[unergative verb]]s constitute phases. The ''v''P in passives and [[unaccusative verb]]s (if even present) are not phases. This topic is, however, currently under debate in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;See, among others, Legate, Julie Anne. 2003. Some Interface Properties of the phrase. Linguistic Inquiry 34: 506–516 and Chomsky, Noam. 2008. On Phases. In ''Foundational Issues in Linguistic Theory. Essays in Honor of Jean-Roger Vergnaud''. eds. Robert Freidin, Carlos Peregrín Otero and Maria Luisa Zubizarreta, 133–166. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
In the late 1990s, [[David E. Johnson]] and Shalom Lappin published the first detailed critiques of Chomsky's minimalist program.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1997), "A Critique of the Minimalist Program" in ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 20, 273–333, and Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1999). ''Local Constraints vs Economy.'' Stanford: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; This technical work was followed by a lively debate with proponents of minimalism on the scientific status of the program.&lt;ref&gt;*Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000a). "The Structure of Unscientific Revolutions." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 665–771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000b). "The Revolution Confused: A Reply to our Critics." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 873–890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2001). "The Revolution Maximally Confused." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 19, 901–919&lt;/ref&gt; The original article provoked several replies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Am I Unscientific? A Reply to Lappin, Levine, and Johnson| year=2000 | last=Holmberg| first=Anders | journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=837–842 | doi=10.1023/A:1006425604798}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Revolution, Discovery, and an Elementary Principle of Logic| year=2000 | last=Reuland| first=Eric | journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=843–848 | doi=10.1023/A:1006404305706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Caricaturing Dissent| year=2000 | last=Roberts| first=Ian| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=849–857 | doi=10.1023/A:1006408422545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Metric of Open-Mindedness| year=2000 | last=Piattelli-Palmarini| first=Massimo| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=859–862 | doi=10.1023/A:1006460406615}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=On the Emptiness of 'Design' Polemics| year=2000 | last=Uriagereka| first=Juan| journal=[[Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory]] | volume=18 | pages=863–871 | doi=10.1023/A:1006412507524}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two further rounds of replies and counter-replies in subsequent issues of the same journal.

Lappin et al. argue that the minimalist program is a radical departure from earlier Chomskyan linguistic practice that is not motivated by any new empirical discoveries, but rather by a general appeal to ''perfection'', which is both empirically unmotivated and so vague as to be unfalsifiable. They compare the adoption of this paradigm by linguistic researchers to other historical paradigm shifts in natural sciences and conclude that of the minimalist program has been an "unscientific revolution", driven primarily by Chomsky's authority in linguistics. The several replies to the article in ''Natural Language and Linguistic Theory'' Volume 18 number 4 (2000) make a number of different defenses of the minimalist program. Some claim that it is not in fact revolutionary or not in fact widely adopted, while others agree with Lappin and Johnson on these points, but defend the vagueness of its formulation as not problematic in light of its status as a research program rather than a theory (see above).

'''Nucleocosmogenesis''' is a scientific term first coined and published by [[George Gamow]], renowned biophysicist, in the 1920s.  According to his definition, nucleocosmogenesis is the process by which chemical elements are created out of more fundamental components in the cosmos. The modern term for such processes is [[nucleosynthesis]].

''' Peter W. Heller''' (born 5 September 1957) ) is a former Deputy Mayor of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]/Germany, environmental scientist, and venture philanthropist.

== Early life ==
Peter W. Heller was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], the son of Wolfgang Heller, entrepreneur in the printing industry, and Ingeborg Heller. He studied economics and philosophy at the [[university of St. Gallen]], [[university of Lausanne]] (Switzerland) and [[university of Freiburg]] (Germany) where he obtained his PhD (Dr. rer.pol.) in 1988 with a thesis on "The Problem of Environmental Degradation in Economic Theory".  In 1988, he married Micaela Heller. They have two children, Julia (born 1989) and Jakob (born 1991).

== Professional career ==
1984 Heller was elected to the City Council of Freiburg and served on the Council’s committees for the municipal budget, environment, and culture. He left the Council in 1990 after his election as Deputy Mayor.

1990 the Council of the City of [[Freiburg im Breisgau]] elected him as Deputy Mayor to head the local administration's environmental protection department,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/1995/34/Alles_Oeko_oder_was_ DIE ZEIT, 34 (1995)]&lt;/ref&gt; the first of its kind in Southern Germany (until 1996). It comprised the offices of municipal environmental law  and regulations, waste management, urban park and forestry services, local energy  management and climate policy.

1993 the Executive Committee of [[ICLEI]] – Local Governments for Sustainability elected him as Chairman (until 1997). ICLEI is a major global network and agency of local governments committed to environmental protection and local sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Berliner Zeitung: [http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/archiv/staedte-wollen-regierungen-unter-druck-setzen-linz-baut-eine--solar-city--fuer-25-000-menschen,10810590,8930110.html], abgerufen am 12. März 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

1997 Heller founded the investment company forseo GmbH which holds equity stakes in companies of the solar PV, windpower, and energy efficiency industry. He serves as Chairman of the Supervisory Boards of Streb AG (since 2012) and of Fahrenheit GmbH (since 2018). He co-founded solar PV and windpower development companies in Chile, Brazil and France, and provided seed capital for technology developers in the US and Germany.

Heller is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the [[Canopus Foundation]], a private non-profit organisation which became one of the pioneers of Venture Philanthropy in Germany. Since 2000 the foundation has been providing grants and business development assistance to social enterprises active in the field of rural energy access for low income communities in developing countries. In 2008 the Canopus Foundation and Ashoka International, Arlington Va. (US) jointly founded the Solar for All initiative,.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, A.: „Der Frühphasenstifter“. In: wir - Das Magazin für Unternehmerfamilien, 2 (2012), S. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mersch, T. &amp; Merx, S.: „Die Business-Wohltäter“. In: enorm - Wirtschaft für den Menschen, 3 (2010), S. 20-27&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014 the foundation has been promoting initiatives of new economic thinking towards more plurality in economic science, and encourages deliberation on the preconditions of a sustainable economy and society.

2001 he co-founded the „Basel Agency for Sustainable Energy (BASE)“, a „Collaborating Center“ of [[UNEP]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenkranz, E.: Netzwerk für erneuerbare Energien, in: Basler Zeitung (2002), Nr. 163, Teil II&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2011 Heller serves on the Board of Trustees of the European Environment Foundation, Basel, which holds an annual international convention of Environmental Laureates. In 2018 the Supervisory Board of HUMBOLDT-VIADRINA Governance Platform (HVGP) gGmbH elected him as Chairman.

== Structure ==
{{plain image with caption|Phloem cells.svg|Cross section of some phloem cells|440px}}
Phloem tissue consists of conducting cells, generally called sieve elements, [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells, including both specialized companion cells or albuminous cells and unspecialized cells and supportive cells, such as [[fibres]] and [[sclereid]]s.

===Conducting cells (Sieve elements)===
{{main|Sieve tube element}}
[[File:Phloem and Xylem in stem.svg|thumb|simplified phloem and companion cells: {{ordered list |[[Xylem]] |Phloem |[[Cambium]] |Pith |Companion Cells}}]]
Sieve elements are the type of cell that are responsible for transporting sugars throughout the plant.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;   At maturity they lack a [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and have very few organelles, so they rely on companion cells or albuminous cells for most of their metabolic needs. Sieve tube cells do contain [[vacuole]]s and other organelles, such as [[ribosome]]s, before they mature, but these generally migrate to the cell wall and dissolve at maturity; this ensures there is little to impede the movement of fluids. One of the few organelles they do contain at maturity is the smooth [[endoplasmic reticulum]], which can be found at the plasma membrane, often nearby the [[plasmodesmata]] that connect them to their companion or albuminous cells. All sieve cells have groups of pores at their ends that grow from modified and enlarged [[plasmodesmata]], called '''sieve areas'''. The pores are reinforced by platelets of a [[polysaccharide]] called [[callose]].&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;

===Parenchyma cells===
They are of  two types, aerenchyma and chlorenchyma.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Other [[parenchyma]] cells within the phloem are generally undifferentiated and used for food storage.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;

====Companion cells====
The metabolic functioning of sieve-tube members depends on a close association with the ''companion cells'', a specialized form of [[parenchyma]] cell. All of the cellular functions of a sieve-tube element are carried out by the (much smaller) companion cell, a typical nucleate [[plant cell]] except the companion cell usually has a larger number of [[ribosomes]] and [[mitochondria]]. The dense cytoplasm of a companion cell is connected to the sieve-tube element by plasmodesmata.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Raven |first=Peter H. |author2=Evert, R.F. |author3=Eichhorn, S.E. |title=Biology of Plants |year=1992 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=New York, NY, U.S.A. |page=791 |isbn=1-4292-3995-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common sidewall shared by a sieve tube element and a companion cell has large numbers of plasmodesmata.

There are two types of companion cells.
#'''Ordinary companion cells''', which have smooth walls and few or no plasmodesmatal connections to cells other than the sieve tube.
#'''[[Transfer cells]]''', which have much-folded walls that are adjacent to non-sieve cells, allowing for larger areas of transfer. They are specialized in scavenging solutes from those in the cell walls that are actively pumped requiring energy.

====Albuminous cells====
Albuminous cells have a similar role to companion cells, but are associated with  sieve cells only and are hence found only in seedless vascular plants and gymnosperms.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992"/&gt;

===Supportive cells===
Although its primary function is transport of sugars, phloem may also contain cells that have a mechanical support function.  These generally fall into two categories: [[fibres]] and [[sclereid]]s.  Both cell types have a [[secondary cell wall]] and are therefore dead at maturity.  The secondary cell wall increases their rigidity and tensile strength.

====Fibres====
[[Bast fibre]]s are the long, narrow supportive cells that provide [[Tension (physics)|tension]] strength without limiting flexibility.  They are also found in xylem, and are the main component of many textiles such as paper, linen, and cotton.&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;

====Sclereids====
[[Sclereid]]s are irregularly shaped cells that add compression strength&lt;ref name="Raven et al. 1992" /&gt;  but may reduce flexibility to some extent.  They also serve as anti-herbivory structures, as their irregular shape and hardness will increase wear on teeth as the herbivores chews. For example, they are responsible for the gritty texture in pears,and in winter bears

==Function==
Unlike [[xylem]] (which is composed primarily of dead cells), the phloem is composed of still-living cells that transport [[Sap (plant)|sap]].  The sap is a water-based solution, but rich in [[sugar]]s made by photosynthesis. These sugars are transported to non-photosynthetic parts of the plant, such as the roots, or into storage structures, such as [[tuber]]s or bulbs.

During the plant's growth period, usually during the spring, storage organs such as the [[root]]s are sugar sources, and the plant's many growing areas are sugar sinks. The movement in phloem is multidirectional, whereas, in xylem cells, it is unidirectional (upward).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

After the growth period, when the [[meristem]]s are dormant, the [[leaf|leaves]] are sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing [[seed]]-bearing organs (such as [[fruit]]) are always sinks. Because of this multi-directional flow, coupled with the fact that sap cannot move with ease between adjacent sieve-tubes, it is not unusual for sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canny|first1=MJ|title=Phloem Translocation|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While movement of water and minerals through the xylem is driven by negative pressures (tension) most of the time, movement through the phloem is driven by positive [[hydrostatic pressure]]s. This process is termed ''translocation'', and is accomplished by a process called [[phloem loading]] and ''unloading''.

Phloem sap is also thought to play a role in sending informational signals throughout vascular plants. "Loading and unloading patterns are largely determined by the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] and number of [[plasmodesmata]] and the position-dependent function of [[Solution|solute]]-specific, [[plasma membrane]] [[transport proteins]]. Recent evidence indicates that mobile proteins and [[RNA]] are part of the plant's long-distance communication signaling system. Evidence also exists for the directed transport and sorting of [[macromolecules]] as they pass through plasmodesmata."&lt;ref name="turgeon2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turgeon|first=Robert |author2=Wolf, Shmuel |title=Phloem Transport: Cellular Pathways and Molecular Trafficking |journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology |year=2009 |doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092045 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092045?journalCode=arplant |volume=60 |pages=207–21 |pmid=19025382 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organic [[molecule]]s such as sugars, [[amino acid]]s, certain [[hormone]]s, and even [[messenger RNA]]s are transported in the phloem through [[sieve tube element]]s.&lt;ref name="turgeon2009" /&gt;

=== Girdling ===
{{main|Girdling}}
Because phloem tubes are located outside the [[xylem]] in most plants, a tree or other plant can be killed by stripping away the bark in a ring on the trunk or stem.  With the phloem destroyed, nutrients cannot reach the roots, and the tree/plant will die.  Trees located in areas with animals such as beavers are vulnerable since beavers chew off the bark at a fairly precise height.  This process is known as girdling, and can be used for agricultural purposes.  For example, enormous fruits and vegetables seen at fairs and carnivals are produced via girdling.  A farmer would place a girdle at the base of a large branch, and remove all but one fruit/vegetable from that branch.  Thus, all the sugars manufactured by leaves on that branch have no [[Carbon dioxide sink|sinks]] to go to but the one fruit/vegetable, which thus expands to many times normal size.

===Origin===
When the plant is an embryo, vascular tissue emerges from procambium tissue, which is at the center of the embryo. Protophloem itself appears in the mid-vein extending into the cotyledonary node, which constitutes the first appearance of a leaf in angiosperms, where it forms continuous strands. The hormone [[auxin]], transported by the protein PIN1 is responsible for the growth of those protophloem strands, signaling the final identity of those tissues. [[SHORTROOT]](SHR), and [[microRNA165]]/[[mir-166 microRNA precursor|166]] also participate in that process, while Callose Synthase 3([[CALS3]]), inhibits the locations where SHORTROOT(SHR), and microRNA165 can go.

In the embryo, root phloem develops independently in the upper hypocotyl, which lies between the embryonic root, and the cotyledon.&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, William, et al. The Plant Vascular System: Evolution, Development and Functions. Journal of Integrative Plant Biology. 55, 294-388 (2013) {{PMID|23462277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an adult, the phloem originates, and grows outwards from, [[meristem]]atic cells in the [[vascular cambium]]. Phloem is produced in phases. ''Primary'' phloem is laid down by the [[apical meristem]] and develops from the [[procambium]]. ''Secondary'' phloem is laid down by the vascular cambium to the inside of the established layer(s) of phloem.

In some eudicot families ([[Apocynaceae]], [[Convolvulaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Solanaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Asteraceae]], [[Thymelaeaceae]]), phloem also develops on the inner side of the vascular cambium; in this case, a distinction between '''external phloem''' and '''internal phloem''' or '''intraxylary phloem''' is made. Internal phloem is mostly primary, and begins differentiation later than the external phloem and protoxylem, though it is not without exceptions. In some other families ([[Amaranthaceae]], [[Nyctaginaceae]], [[Salvadoraceae]]), the cambium also periodically forms inward strands or layers of phloem, embedded in the xylem: Such phloem strands are called '''included phloem''' or '''interxylary phloem'''.&lt;ref&gt;Evert, Ray F. ''Esau's Plant Anatomy''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc, 2006, pp. 357–358, {{ISBN|0-470-04737-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nutritional use==
[[File:Detaching inner bark of pine.jpg|thumb|Stripping the inner bark from a pine branch.]]
Phloem of [[pine]] trees has been used in [[Finland]] as a substitute food in times of [[famine]] and even in good years in the northeast. Supplies of phloem from previous years helped stave off starvation in the [[Finnish famine of 1866-1868|great famine of the 1860s]]. Phloem is dried and milled to flour (''pettu'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and mixed with [[rye]] to form a hard dark bread, [[bark bread]]. The least appreciated was ''silkko'', a bread made only from [[buttermilk]] and ''pettu'' without any real rye or cereal flour. Recently, ''pettu'' has again become available as a curiosity, and some have made claims of health benefits. However, its food energy content is low relative to rye or other cereals.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Phloem from [[silver birch]] has been also used to make flour in the past.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

'''Photo-Induced Cross-Linking of Unmodified Proteins (PICUP)''' is a protein cross-linking method by visible light irradiation of a photocatalyst in the presence of an electron acceptor and the protein of interest.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahimi|first=Farid|last2=Maiti|first2=Panchanan|last3=Bitan|first3=Gal|date=2009-01-12|title=Photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins (PICUP) applied to amyloidogenic peptides|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments: JoVE|issue=23|doi=10.3791/1071|issn=1940-087X|pmc=2763294|pmid=19229175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irradiation results in a highly reactive protein radical that forms a covalent bond between the amino acid side chains of the proteins to be linked. [[Cross-link|Cross-linking methods]] developed prior to PICUP, including the use of physical, oxidative, and chemical cross-linkers, often require more time and result in protein byproducts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition, the cross-linked protein yield is very low due to the multifunctionality of the cross-linking reagents.

The process was first applied in 1999 to utilize protein cross-linking techniques to analyze the interactions between polypeptides as well as structural differences proteins undergo in a [[Catalysis|catalytic pathway]]. The techniques in the 20th century were not sufficient to be applied to cross-link fast and transient changes of these proteins in high yield. PICUP allowed for rapid (&lt;1 second) and high production of covalently-linked proteins in close proximity with each other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fancy|first=David A.|last2=Kodadek|first2=Thomas|date=1999-05-25|title=Chemistry for the analysis of protein–protein interactions: Rapid and efficient cross-linking triggered by long wavelength light|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=96|issue=11|pages=6020–6024|issn=0027-8424|pmc=26828|pmid=10339534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Fancy and Kodadek ===

Fancy and Kodadek's application of PICUP in 1999 was the first time proteins cross-linking was able to be performed in such a short period of time (1 second) and without modifying the structure of the proteins in question.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, PICUP was able to be performed at physiological pH of 7.4, which opened doors for further application of protein cross-linking such as studying the biochemical mechanisms that proteins participate in the human body. In addition, irradiation by [[Light|visible light]] in PICUP is useful because many biomolecules that participate in metabolic pathways to be analyzed do no absorb light with wavelengths below the range for [[Ultraviolet|UV light]], allowing for cross-links without denaturation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Bitan, Lomakin, and Teplow ===

In 2001, Gal Bitan, Aleksey Lomakin, and David B. Teplow applied PICUP to study [[Amyloid beta|amyloid β-protein (Aβ)]] oligomerization, which is observed in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitan|first=Gal|last2=Lomakin|first2=Aleksey|last3=Teplow|first3=David B.|date=2001-09-14|title=Amyloid β-Protein Oligomerization PRENUCLEATION INTERACTIONS REVEALED BY PHOTO-INDUCED CROSS-LINKING OF UNMODIFIED PROTEINS|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/276/37/35176|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|language=en|volume=276|issue=37|pages=35176–35184|doi=10.1074/jbc.M102223200|issn=0021-9258|pmid=11441003}}&lt;/ref&gt; PICUP allowed for identifying and quantifying the Aβ oligomers that are metastable because of its ability to rapidly cross-link.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coupling PICUP with [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)]], the distribution of oligomers in rapid equilibrium was quantified.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This application allowed for the study of amyloidogenic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases and opened doors for possible future therapeutic mechanisms. [[Neurodegeneration|Neurodegenerative diseases]] are currently suggested to be the result of neurotoxic proteins, so the ability to study their oligomer distribution is effective in understanding how and under what conditions these oligomers are formed.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:RuBpy and APS Reaction.png|thumb|500x500px|APS and Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reaction to produce excited Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]
The mechanism of PICUP require the [[Tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride|tris(bipyridyl)Ru(II) complex]], an electron acceptor, [[Ammonium persulfate|ammonium persulfate (APS)]], and reactive amino acid side chains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tris(2,2′‐bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate, a tris(bipyridyl)Ru(II) complex, initially contains a Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bitan|first=Gal|date=2006|title=Structural study of metastable amyloidogenic protein oligomers by photo-induced cross-linking of unmodified proteins|journal=Methods in Enzymology|volume=413|pages=217–236|doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(06)13012-8|issn=0076-6879|pmc=2782599|pmid=17046399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon visible light irradiation and in the presence of ammonium persulfate (APS), Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; enters its excited state and is oxidized to Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; is now an extremely reactive oxidizer that only wants to accept one electron instead of the standard two.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reaction can proceed in the absence of an electron acceptor, but it will have a much lower efficiency, producing byproducts resulting from the excited Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacting with oxygen.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fancy|first=D.

[[File:Forming dimers.png|left|thumb|500x500px|Formation of covalent bond between amino acid side chains (Tyrosine)]]The unpaired single electron on the side chain reacts with another amino acid side chain of a polypeptide in the vicinity, resulting in a dimer with a covalent bond.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; With the regeneration of Ru&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; when Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; picks up an electron from the amino acids allows for continuous formation of radicals with Ru&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; being oxidized by APS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the PCR tube that the reaction takes place in, numerous unstable protein radicals come in contact with each other through simple diffusion and react both intra- and intermolecularly to achieve a more stable state. The monomeric protein radicals are able to achieve a lower energy state through forming a covalent bond to produce a dimer and releasing a hydrogen atom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This newly formed dimer is also able to react with numerous other monomers or dimers through the same mechanism, creating higher numbers of cross-linked oligomers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allows for a distribution of variety of oligomers to be present in the mixture.

== Method ==
[[File:PICUP Apparatus .jpg|thumb|Camera apparatus used to irradiate the protein mixture]]In every experiment, it is important to determine the relative concentration of the protein in question, ammonium persulfate, and Tris(2,2′‐bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate that will be used in the protein cross-linking experiment. Previous experiments have shown that for [[Amyloid beta|amyloid β-protein (Aβ)]], the peptide assumed to cause toxicity in [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's Disease]], the ratio of protein: Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;: APS is 1:2:40.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The ratio of Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and APS is suggested to be kept at this ratio, but the appropriate concentration of a given protein can vary. For many proteins that PICUP has not yet been used for, finding the appropriate concentrations can be done through trial and error. Generally, protein concentrations would fall in between 10 and 50µM, dissolved in the corresponding buffer, most likely [[Sodium phosphates|sodium phosphate]] if testing for conditions at physiological pH. However, some studies of pure protein suggest that the protein to Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ratio should be kept at 1:2 as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This level arises from the fact that the lower amount of Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can lead to the protein sample appearing to have more than the actual number of higher order oligomers, and a greater amount of Ru(Bpy)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can allow for artificial cross-linking byproducts.

The general method for PICUP is as follows:
# The appropriate amount of the protein is pipetted into the polymerase chain reaction tube (PCR).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/1-59259-874-9:011|title=Determination of Peptide Oligomerization State Using Rapid Photochemical Crosslinking|last=Vollers|first=Sabrina S.|last2=Teplow|first2=David B.|last3=Bitan|first3=Gal|pages=011–018|language=en|doi=10.1385/1-59259-874-9:011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Ammonium persulfate (APS) and Tris(2,2′‐bipyridyl)dichlororuthenium(II) hexahydrate are added to the sample and mixed briefly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
# The PCR tube is placed in a glass vial to hold it still inside the bellows of the camera that would irradiate the mixture. Upon closing the lid that covers the camera, pressing down the camera shutter illuminates the tube for however long you program the camera to irradiate for. Using the same camera for every replicate of the experiment ensures that the irradiation time and the distance from the light sourced is controlled for every PICUP experiment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
# After the sample in the PCR tube is irradiated, a calculated amount of 1M [[Dithiothreitol|Dithiothreitol (DTT)]] is immediately added to the mixture to quench the reaction. If the reaction is not quenched, the oligomers will continually aggregate and lower order oligomers will not be present in the mixture. In addition, if [[Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis|SDS-PAGE]] is to be used to analyze the oligomer distribution of the proteins after PICUP, DTT would also act as a denaturing agent to the proteins before gel electrophoresis.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications  ==
Using PICUP on protein complexes is useful in providing catalytic and kinetic information about these proteins, as catalytic mechanisms are rapid and PICUP allows for fast and highly efficient cross-linking of proteins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some [[epitope]] and [[affinity tags]] were shown to be unaffected by the PICUP reaction, enabling visualization of the cross-linked proteins.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Furthermore, PICUP allows for visualization of quantitative bands of protein oligomer distribution when it is coupled with protein fractionation techniques. This combination is especially useful when examining the oligomers of neurodegenerative diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s disease]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s disease]], and [[Huntington’s disease]], that result from protein aggregation.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; PICUP is extremely important when possible prevention and treatment procedures for these diseases are explored, as it is necessary to investigate the aggregation propensity of the respective [[Amyloid|amyloidogenic proteins]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12209">The '''Regional Studies Association''' ('''RSA''') is an international learned society that is concerned with the analysis of regions and regional issues. The Regional Studies Association works with its international and interdisciplinary membership to facilitate the highest standards of theoretical development, empirical analysis and policy debate of issues at this sub-national scale, incorporating both the urban and rural and different conceptions of space such as city regions and interstitial spaces. We are, for example, interested in issues of economic development and growth, conceptions of territory and its governance and in thorny problems of equity and injustice.

[[File:RSA logo.jpg|thumb|Regional Studies Association logo]]

It runs a programme of international conferences and events based on excellence that has been growing steadily over the years and plays a major role in the Association’s aim in supporting its members disseminate their research. These events also create debates and offer opportunities for those who wish to be part of a community where high quality events are also the place to network within a friendly atmosphere, present their work to international audiences and strengthen their careers. In 2017, the RSA organised events in Ireland, Brazil, China, Romania, Belgium, Australia, UK &amp; Russia. The RSA was a key partner in the European Week of Regions and Cities and we were coordinating the #EURegionsWeek 2017 University sessions and EU Cohesion Policy Master Class. 

The association publishes 5 journals with the publisher [[Taylor and Francis]]: [[Regional Studies (journal) |''Regional Studies'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=cres20|title=Regional Studies :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsea20|title=Spatial Economic Analysis :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Territory, Politics, Governance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rtep20|title=Territory, Politics, Governance :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[open access journal]] ''Regional Studies, Regional Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsrs20|title=Regional Studies, Regional Science :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Area Development and Policy'', that engages with the transformation of the modern world as a result of development of the global South/Greater [[BRICS]]. The ''Regions and Cities'' Book Series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfbuiltenvironment.com/books/series/Regions_and_Cities|title=Built Environment - Routledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Routledge]] in association with the RSA. The Book Series Editor-in-Chief is Joan Fitzgerald (Northeastern University, USA). ''Regions'' magazine is the membership magazine and the voice of the RSA membership.

It has allocated financial resources to support its members and offer a range of funding opportunities to suit different career stages. These opportunities provide members with the chance to apply for financial help to support their research, run networking events, receive awards for excellence and help towards the costs of travel to attend non-RSA events and present their work to international audiences. The RSA offers the following funding opportunities: '''Travel Grant''' up to £500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-travel-grant|title=RSA Travel Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Policy Expo'''  up to £15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/policy-expo-grant-scheme|title=RSA Policy Expo Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Membership Research Grant (MeRSA)''' up to £5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-MeRSA-Grant|title=RSA Membership Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Fellowship Research Grant (FeRSA)''' up to £7,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-fellowship-research-grant-scheme|title=RSA Fellowship Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Early Career Research Grant''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/early-career-grant-scheme|title=RSA Early Career Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Research Network Grant Scheme''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/research-network-grants|title=RSA Research network grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The RSA's Research Networks are formed by RSA members to organise a series of events to examine an issue of collective interest. 

There is an extensive '''international network''' of around 70 Ambassadors, five Divisions (China, Latin America, Northern Europe, India and Russia), five country Sections (Hungary, Poland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales) and six UK regional Branches which support members in their own locales. We also have a non-profit Foundation in Belgium (RSA Europe). These international networks work together with the Association to expend the opportunities and benefits offered to its members but also to those who do not yet know the Association. These networks are set up to organise a range of activities that are open to all to attend and they have the role of informing and disseminating information on regional studies at a regional and/or national level. They also act as an invaluable link to the Association for those who work in a language other than English but also for those who cannot attend all the major events directly organised by the Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/networks|title=RSA International Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA's Chair is Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones, Director of Newcastle City Futures and Chair of Town Planning, Newcastle University, UK. The RSA’s previous Chair (2012-2017) was Professor Andrew Beer, Dean, Research &amp; Innovation at UniSA Business School, Australia. He succeeded Professor [[David Bailey (academic economist and commentator)|David Bailey]] who served as Chair over 2006–12. Sally Hardy is Chief Executive for the past 30 years. The RSA President is Ron Martin, University of Cambridge, UK. The previous RSA President was [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] until 2014.

[[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] was awarded the RSA's Prize for Outstanding Contribution to the field of Regional Studies at the RSA's Presidential Lunch held at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in September 2008. In subsequent years the association has awarded an annual Sir Peter Hall Prize for outstanding contribution to the field of Regional Studies, with recipients including Ann Markusen, John Bachtler, John Goddard, [[Michael Storper]], [[Allen J. Scott]], Ray Hudson, Brian Robson, Susan Christopherson and [[Saskia Sassen]]  in 2017. The RSA also awards excellence in the field with its Best Book Award, Nathaniel Lichfield Award, RSA and Routledge Early Career Award, as well as its Best Paper and Best Referee Awards for all its academic journals (''Regional Studies; Spatial Economic Analysis; Territory, Politics, Governance; Regional Studies, Regional Science; Area Development and Policy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding|title=RSA Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA is a member society of the Academy of Social Sciences, previously known as the [[Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acss.org.uk/about6.htm |title=Academy of Social Sciences |publisher=Acss.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is also a recognised United Nations NGO with Consultative Status (ECOSOC).

The '''Science and Engineering Challenge''' [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|(SEC)]] is a non-profit, [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] outreach program run throughout the schools year in [[Australia]]. The goal of the program is to challenge student’s perception of science and engineering and experience aspects of those fields that they normally would not encounter in a school environment.&lt;ref name="Challenge Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-engineering-and-built-environment/science-and-engineering-challenge|title=About Us|date=19 November 2014|website=Newcastle.edu.au|accessdate=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] focuses on inspiring students in year 10 to consider a future career in science and engineering by choosing to study science and mathematics in years 11 and 12. The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|SEC]] also includes other events such as Discovery Days and the [https://www.newcastle.edu.au/about-uon/governance-and-leadership/faculties-and-schools/faculty-of-science-and-information-technology/community-outreach/smart S.M.A.R.T] outreach program.

==History==
The SEC began at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] as an initiative of the Faculties of Engineering and Built Environment, and Science and Information Technology. Initially, information nights were conducted aimed at giving students and parents from rural areas the opportunity to find out about careers in science and engineering.  Based on the success of these information nights, the first SEC event was held on the [[Central Coast (New South Wales)|Central Coast]] in the year 2000, as an activity for [[National Science Week]]. Throughout 2001, events were held around the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] area and other parts of [[NSW]].

2002 saw the first Challenge Days held outside of [[NSW]], this took place in [[Canberra]]. Over the next three years, Challenge Days were conducted in [[Queensland]], [[Tasmania]], [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In 2005 the winners from each state competed at the first National Final.

In 2017 there were 110 SMART events, 49 Discovery Days for primary-aged students, and 99 Challenge Days for year 9-10 students. Overall more than 50,000 people were involved in one or more SEC programs. Almost 2,100 teachers and 3,600 other volunteers were also involved.
Since 1998 over half a million people have taken part in a SEC event.

== Discovery Days ==

In 2005 the Challenge expanded yet again to include events for primary school students, called Discovery Days. These are largely the same as regular challenge events; however, the actives are simplified and typical run for a shorter period of time.

== Programs ==

#The Little Scientists program: Train preschool teachers to incorporate STEM into their lessons
#SMART program of science shows and workshops: Infants and Primary-aged students
#Discovery Days: Mini-Challenge Days for students in years 5-6
#Build a Future Days: A fascinating on-campus experience for year 7-8 students
#Challenge Days (our premier event): National STEM competition for year 9-10 students
#Casual work and Internships with the SEC Team
#Teacher Professional Development: For School Teachers

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

More general equations are the [[convection–diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

;Pre-Maxwell laws

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations. Coulomb's Law can be found from Gauss' Law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart Law can be deduced from Ampere's Law (magnetostatic form). Lenz' Law and Faraday's Law can be incorporated into the Maxwell-Faraday equation. Nonetheless they are still very effective for simple calculations.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''stall''' is a reduction in the [[lift (force)|lift]] coefficient generated by a [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] as [[angle of attack]] increases.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', p. 486. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when the [[critical angle of attack]] of the foil is exceeded.  The critical angle of attack is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and [[Reynolds number]].

Stalls in fixed-wing flight are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which may be due to slowing down below [[#Speed|stall speed]] in level flight). A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving—the effect is the same even in an unpowered [[glider aircraft]]. [[Thrust vectoring|Vectored thrust]] in manned and unmanned aircraft is used to surpass the stall limit, thereby giving rise to [[post-stall]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Gal-Or, ''Vectored Propulsion, Supermaneuverability, and Robot Aircraft'', Springer Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|0-387-97161-0}}, {{ISBN|3-540-97161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USAF &amp; NATO Report RTO-TR-015 AC/323/(HFM-015)/TP-1 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because stalls are most commonly discussed in connection with [[aviation]], this article discusses stalls as they relate mainly to aircraft, in particular [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. The principles of stall discussed here translate to foils in other fluids as well.

==Formal definition==
[[File:StallFormation.svg|right|350px]]
A stall is a condition in [[aerodynamics]] and aviation wherein the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point such that lift begins to decrease. The angle at which this occurs is called the ''critical angle of attack''. This critical angle is dependent upon the airfoil section or profile of the wing, its [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], its [[aspect ratio (aeronautics)|aspect ratio]], and other factors, but is typically in the range of 8 to 20 degrees relative to the incoming wind ("relative wind") for most subsonic airfoils. The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack on the [[lift coefficient]] versus angle-of-attack curve at which the maximum lift coefficient occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flow separation]] begins to occur at small angles of attack while attached flow over the wing is still dominant. As angle of attack increases, the separated regions on the top of the wing increase in size and hinder the wing's ability to create lift. At the critical angle of attack, separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle of attack produce ''less'' lift and more [[drag (physics)|drag]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A fixed-wing aircraft during a stall may experience [[buffeting]] or a change in [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]. Most aircraft are designed to have a gradual stall with characteristics that will warn the pilot and give them time to react. For example, an aircraft that does not buffet before the stall may have an audible alarm or a [[stick shaker]] installed to simulate the feel of a buffet by vibrating the stick fore and aft. The critical angle of attack in steady straight and level flight can be attained only at low airspeed. Attempts to increase the angle of attack at higher airspeeds can cause a high-speed stall or may merely cause the aircraft to climb.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Any [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] of the aircraft as it enters the stall regime can result in [[autorotation (fixed-wing aircraft)|autorotation]], which is also sometimes referred to as a "[[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]". As air no longer flows smoothly over the wings during a stall, [[aileron]] control of roll becomes less effective, whilst simultaneously the tendency for the ailerons to generate [[adverse yaw]] increases. This characteristic increases the lift from the advancing wing and increases the likelihood of the aircraft entering into a spin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Graph==

[[File:Lift curve.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|An example of the relationship between angle of attack and lift on a cambered airfoil. The exact relationship is usually measured in a [[wind tunnel]] and depends on the airfoil section. The relationship for an aircraft wing depends on the planform and its aspect ratio.]]

The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the "burble point"). This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case, but it varies from airfoil to airfoil. In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (thickness to [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratios of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]]. Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight). The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.

The information in a graph of this kind is gathered using a model of the airfoil in a [[wind tunnel]]. Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same [[Reynolds number]] regime (or scale speed) as in free flight. The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft. High-pressure wind tunnels are one solution to this problem. In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again. This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.28 and 16.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D., ''A History of Aerodynamics'', pp. 296–311&lt;/ref&gt;

This graph shows the stall angle, yet in practice most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling in terms of [[airspeed]]. This is because all aircraft are equipped with an [[airspeed indicator]], but fewer aircraft have an angle of attack indicator. An aircraft's stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) for a range of weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.

As speed reduces, angle of attack has to increase to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached. The airspeed at which this angle is reached is the (1g, unaccelerated) stalling speed of the aircraft in that particular configuration. Deploying [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]]/slats decreases the stall speed to allow the aircraft to take off and land at a lower speed.

==Aerodynamic description==

===Fixed-wing aircraft===
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] can be made to stall in any [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|pitch]] attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude. Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different fixed-wing aircraft and is represented by colour codes on the [[airspeed indicator]]. As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above). The pilot will notice the [[aircraft flight control system|flight controls]] have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.

In most [[light aircraft]], as the stall is reached, the aircraft will start to descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, until smooth air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver is normally quite safe, and, if correctly handled, leads to only a small loss in altitude (20–30&amp;nbsp;m/50–100&amp;nbsp;ft). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 61&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations Part25 section 201&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of an unfamiliar aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.

A special form of asymmetric stall in which the aircraft also rotates about its yaw axis is called a [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]. A spin can occur if an aircraft is stalled and there is an asymmetric yawing moment applied to it.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt; This yawing moment can be aerodynamic (sideslip angle, rudder, adverse yaw from the ailerons), thrust related (p-factor, one engine inoperative on a multi-engine non-centreline thrust aircraft), or from less likely sources such as severe turbulence. The net effect is that one wing is stalled before the other and the aircraft descends rapidly while rotating, and some aircraft cannot recover from this condition without correct pilot control inputs (which must stop yaw) and loading.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 23&lt;/ref&gt; A new solution to the problem of difficult (or impossible) stall-spin recovery is provided by the [[ballistic parachute]] recovery system.

The most common stall-spin scenarios occur on takeoff ([[departure resistance|departure]] stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers. Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly respond to the out-of-trim situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are [[Atmospheric icing|contaminated with ice]] or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.

Stalls occur not only at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their critical angle of attack. Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb. However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive. In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction. Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the stalling angle to be exceeded, even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These "high-speed stalls" produce the same buffeting characteristics as 1g stalls and can also initiate a spin if there is also any yawing.

===Symptoms of onset===
One symptom of an approaching stall is slow and sloppy controls. As the speed of the aircraft decreases approaching the stall, there is less air moving over the wing, and, therefore, less air will be deflected by the control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, and rudder) at this lower speed. Some buffeting may also be felt from the turbulent flow above the wings as the stall is reached. The stall warning will sound, if fitted, in most aircraft 5 to 10 knots above the stall speed.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations part 25 section 207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Different aircraft types have different stalling characteristics. A benign stall is one where the nose drops gently and the wings remain level throughout. Slightly more demanding is a stall in which one wing stalls slightly before the other, causing that wing to drop sharply, with the possibility of entering a spin. A dangerous stall is one in which the nose rises, pushing the wing deeper into the stalled state and potentially leading to an unrecoverable ''[[#Deep stall|deep stall]]''. This can occur in some T-tailed aircraft wherein the turbulent airflow from the stalled wing can blanket the control surfaces at the tail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Stalls depend only on angle of attack, not [[airspeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stick and Rudder|author=Langewiesche, Wolfgang|publisher=McGraw Hill|date=1972|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more slowly an airplane goes, the greater the angle of attack it needs to produce lift equal to the aircraft's weight.&lt;ref name="phakcp4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-3of7.pdf|title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge – Chapter 4|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904015736/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-3of7.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the speed decreases further, at some point this angle will be equal to the [[Critical angle of attack|critical (stall) angle of attack]]. This speed is called the "stall speed". An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.

The actual stall speed will vary depending on the airplane's weight, altitude, configuration, and vertical and lateral acceleration. Guidelines for the case of zero acceleration are provided by the following [[V speeds]]:
* V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;: The computed stalling speed with [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]] retracted at design speed. Often has the same value as V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt;: The stall speed in landing configuration (full flaps, [[landing gear]] down, [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] retracted).
* V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;: The stall speed in a "clean" configuration (flaps, landing gear and spoilers all retracted as far as possible).
* V&lt;sub&gt;SR&lt;/sub&gt;: Reference stall speed.&lt;ref name="faacfr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=f553dbb9c06409a040f3d6865e435c70&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2&amp;idno=14;cc=ecfr|title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations – Chapter 14.1|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an airspeed indicator, the bottom of the white arc indicates V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; at maximum weight, while the bottom of the green arc indicates V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; at maximum weight. While an aircraft's V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; speed is computed by design, its V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; speeds must be demonstrated empirically by flight testing.&lt;ref&gt;Flight testing of fixed wing aircraft.

==In accelerated and turning flight==
[[File:Accelerated stall.gif|thumb|350px|Illustration of a turning flight stall, occurring during a co-ordinated turn with progressively increasing angle of bank.]]
The normal stall speed, specified by the V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs under such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Considering, for example, a [[banked turn#Aviation|banked turn]], the [[lift (force)|lift]] required is equal to the [[weight]] of the aircraft plus extra lift to provide the [[centripetal force]] necessary to perform the turn; that is:&lt;ref name=Clancy5.22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W. (1979), ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics and Flight Mechanics'', p. 464, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York {{ISBN|0-471-03032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = nW&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = lift
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = load factor (greater than 1 in a turn)
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = weight of the aircraft

To achieve the extra lift, the [[lift coefficient]], and so the angle of attack, will have to be higher than it would be in straight and level flight at the same speed. Therefore, given that the stall always occurs at the same critical angle of attack,&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.8 and 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; by increasing the load factor (e.g., by tightening the turn) such critical angle – and the stall – will be reached with the airspeed remaining well above the normal stall speed,&lt;ref name="Clancy5.22"&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; that is:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Equation 14.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W.

The table that follows gives some examples of the relation between the [[angle of bank]] and the square root of the load factor. It derives from the trigonometric relation ([[Cosecant|secant]]) between &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in a turn with bank angle of 45°, V&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; is 19% higher than V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

It should be noted that, according to [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called '''turning flight stall''', while the term ''accelerated'' is used to indicate an ''accelerated turning stall'' only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A notable example of air accident involving a low-altitude turning flight stall is the [[1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash]].

==Types==

===Dynamic stall===
Dynamic stall is a non-linear unsteady aerodynamic effect that occurs when airfoils rapidly change the angle of attack. The rapid change can cause a strong [[vortex]] to be shed from the leading edge of the aerofoil, and travel backwards above the wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchner |first1=A. J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |title=Measurements of the flow due to a rapidly pitching plate using time resolved high resolution PIV |journal=Aerospace Science and Technology |volume=44 |pages=4 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963814000789 |publisher=Aerospace Science and Technology |accessdate=18 October 2015 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.ast.2014.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vortex, containing high-velocity airflows, briefly increases the lift produced by the wing. As soon as it passes behind the trailing edge, however, the lift reduces dramatically, and the wing is in normal stall.&lt;ref name="Filippone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |title=Dynamic Stall, Unsteady Aerodynamics |accessdate=March 25, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229110350/http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |archivedate=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic stall is an effect most associated with helicopters and flapping wings, though also occurs in wind turbines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/jfm.2018.112 |title=Dynamic stall in vertical axis wind turbines: Scaling and topological considerations |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=841 |pages=746-66 |year=2018 |last1=Buchner |first1=A-J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |last3=Honnery |first3=D. |last4=Smits |first4=A.J. |bibcode=2018JFM...841..746B }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and due to gusting airflow. During forward flight, some regions of a helicopter blade may incur flow that reverses (compared to the direction of blade movement), and thus includes rapidly changing angles of attack. Oscillating (flapping) wings, such as those of insects—including the most famous one, the [[bumblebee]]—may rely almost entirely on dynamic stall for lift production, provided the oscillations are fast compared to the speed of flight, and the angle of the wing changes rapidly compared to airflow direction.&lt;ref name="Filippone" /&gt;

Stall delay can occur on [[airfoils]] subject to a high angle of attack and a three-dimensional flow. When the angle of attack on an airfoil is increasing rapidly, the flow will remain substantially attached to the airfoil to a significantly higher angle of attack than can be achieved in steady-state conditions. As a result, the stall is delayed momentarily and a lift coefficient significantly higher than the steady-state maximum is achieved. The effect was first noticed on [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A ''deep stall'' (or ''super-stall'') is a dangerous type of stall that affects certain [[aircraft]] designs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.aviationshop.com.au/avfacts/editorial/tipstall/ | work =Aviationshop | title =What is the super-stall? | accessdate =2009-09-02 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20091013203208/http://www.aviationshop.com.au/avfacts/editorial/tipstall/ | archivedate =2009-10-13 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; notably jet aircraft with a [[T-tail]] configuration and rear-mounted engines.

Trubshaw&lt;ref&gt;"Low Speed Handling with Special Reference to the Super Stall" Trubshaw, Appendix III in "Trubshaw Test Pilot" Trubshaw and Edmondson, Sutton Publishing 1998, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; gives a broad definition of deep stall as penetrating to such angles of attack &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that pitch control effectiveness is reduced by the wing and nacelle wakes. He also gives a definition that relates deep stall to a locked-in condition where recovery is impossible. This is a single value of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for a given aircraft configuration, where there is no pitching moment, i.e. a trim point.

Typical values both for the range of deep stall, as defined above, and the locked-in trim point are given for the [[Douglas DC-9]] Series 10 by Schaufele.&lt;ref&gt;"Applied Aerodynamics at the Douglas Aircraft Company-A Historical Perspective" Roger D. Schaufele, 37th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 11–14, 1999/Reno, NVFig.26 Deep Stall Pitching Moments&lt;/ref&gt; These values are from wind tunnel tests for an early design. The final design had no locked in trim point so recovery from the deep stall region was possible, as required to meet certification rules. Normal stall beginning at the 'g' break (sudden decrease of the vertical [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]]&lt;ref name=boeing/&gt;) was at 18 degrees &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, deep stall started at about 30 degrees and the locked-in unrecoverable trim point was at 47 degrees.

The very high &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for a deep stall locked-in condition occurs well beyond the normal stall but can be attained very rapidly as the aircraft is unstable beyond the normal stall and requires immediate action to arrest it. The loss of lift causes high sink rates which, together with the low forward speed at the normal stall, give a high &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with little or no rotation of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=trubshaw&gt;"Accident Report No. EW/C/039, Appendix IV in "Trubshaw Test Pilot" Trubshaw and Edmondson, Sutton Publishing 1998, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG, during stall flight tests before the type was modified to prevent a locked-in deep stall condition, descended at over {{convert|10000|ft/min|m/s|-1}} and struck the ground in a flat attitude moving only {{convert|70|ft|m|-1}} forward after initial impact.&lt;ref name=trubshaw/&gt; Sketches which show how the wing wake blankets the tail may be misleading if they imply that deep stall requires a high body angle.

Effects similar to deep stall had been known to occur on some aircraft designs before the term was coined. A prototype [[Gloster Javelin]] ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''WD808'') was lost in a crash on 11 June 1953, to a "locked in" stall&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=20519 ASN Wikibase Occurrence # 20519] Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Waterton&lt;ref name=waterton&gt;"The Quick and the Dead" W.A.Waterton, Frederick Mueller, London 1956, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; states that the trimming tailplane was found to be the wrong way for recovery. Low speed handling tests were being done to assess a new wing.&lt;ref name=waterton/&gt; [[Handley Page Victor]] ''XL159'' was lost to a "stable stall" on 23 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevictorassociation.org.uk/?p=491 A Tale of Two Victors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161536/http://www.thevictorassociation.org.uk/?p=491 |date=2012-03-22 }} Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been clearing the fixed droop leading edge with the test being stall approach, landing configuration, C of G aft.

The name "deep stall" first came into widespread use after [[1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash|the crash]] of the prototype [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew.&lt;ref&gt;""Report on the Accident to B.A.C. One-Eleven G-ASHG at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, Wiltshire on 22nd October 1963'', Ministry of Aviation C.A.P. 219, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; This led to changes to the aircraft, including the installation of a [[stick shaker]] (see below) to clearly warn the pilot of an impending stall. Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] (G-ARPY), was [[1966 Felthorpe Trident crash|lost to deep stall]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660603-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Hawker Siddeley HS-121 Trident 1C G-ARPY Felthorpe |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1966-06-03 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; deep stall is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the [[British European Airways Flight 548]] ''G-ARPI'') crash – known as the "Staines Disaster" – on 18 June 1972 when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall recovery system.&lt;ref&gt;AIB Report 4/73, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 1980, a prototype of the [[Canadair Challenger]] [[business jet]] crashed after initially entering a deep stall from 17,000&amp;nbsp;ft and having both engines flame-out.

===Tip stall===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Aircraft with a [[swept wing]] suffer from a particular form of stalling behaviour at low speed. At high speed the airflow over the wing tends to progress directly along the chord, but as the speed is reduced a sideways component due to the angle of the [[leading edge]] has time to build up. Airflow at the root is affected only by the angle of the wing, but at a point further along the span, the airflow is affected both by the angle as well as any sideways component of the airflow from the air closer to the root. This results in a pattern of airflow that is progressively "sideways" as one moves toward the wingtip.

As it is only the airflow along the chord that contributes to lift, this means that the wing begins to develop less lift at the tip than the root. In extreme cases, this can lead to the wingtip entering stall long before the wing as a whole. In this case the average lift of the wing as a whole moves forward; the inboard sections are continuing to generate lift and are generally in front of the [[center of gravity]] (C of G), while the tips are no longer contributing and are behind the C of G. This produces a strong nose-up pitch in the aircraft, which can lead to more of the wing stalling, the lift moving further forward, and so forth. This chain reaction is considered very dangerous and was known as the [[pitch-up]].

Tip stall can be prevented in a number of ways, at least one of which is found on almost all modern aircraft. An early solution was the addition of [[wing fence]]s to re-direct sideways moving air back towards the rear of the wing. A similar solution is the dog-tooth notch seen on some aircraft, like the [[Avro Arrow]]. A more common modern solution is to use some degree of [[Washout (aviation)|washout]].

==Warning and safety devices==
Fixed-wing aircraft can be equipped with devices to prevent or postpone a stall or to make it less (or in some cases more) severe, or to make recovery easier.
* An '''aerodynamic twist''' can be introduced to the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called '''washout''' and causes the [[wing root]] to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at the wing tips, where the [[aileron]]s are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.
* A '''[[stall strip]]''' is a small sharp-edged device that, when attached to the leading edge of a wing, encourages the stall to start there in preference to any other location on the wing. If attached close to the wing root, it makes the stall gentle and progressive; if attached near the wing tip, it encourages the aircraft to drop a wing when stalling.
* A '''[[Wing fence|stall fence]]''' is a flat plate in the direction of the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] to stop separated flow progressing out along the wing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |title=Stall fences and vortex generators |access-date=2009-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508032211/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |archive-date=2009-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vortex generator]]s''', tiny strips of metal or plastic placed on top of the wing near the leading edge that protrude past the [[boundary layer]] into the free stream. As the name implies, they energize the boundary layer by mixing free stream airflow with boundary layer flow thereby creating vortices, this increases the [[momentum]] in the boundary layer. By increasing the momentum of the boundary layer, airflow separation and the resulting stall may be delayed.
* An '''anti-stall strake''' is a [[leading edge extension]] that generates a [[vortex]] on the wing upper surface to postpone the stall.
* A '''[[stick pusher]]''' is a mechanical device that prevents the pilot from stalling an aircraft. It pushes the elevator control forward as the stall is approached, causing a reduction in the angle of attack. In generic terms, a stick pusher is known as a ''stall identification device'' or ''stall identification system''.&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Advisory Circular 25-7A ''Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes'', paragraph 228&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[stick shaker]]''' is a mechanical device that shakes the pilot's controls to warn of the onset of stall.
* A '''stall warning''' is an electronic or mechanical device that sounds an [[buzzer|audible warning]] as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain some form of this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a ''stall warning horn'', which consists of either a [[pressure]] [[sensor]] or a movable metal tab that actuates a [[switch]], and produces an audible warning in response.
* An '''angle-of-attack indicator''' for light aircraft, the "AlphaSystemsAOA" and a nearly identical "'''Lift Reserve Indicator'''", are both pressure differential instruments that display margin above stall and/or angle of attack on an instantaneous, continuous readout. The General Technics CYA-100 displays true angle of attack via a magnetically coupled vane. An AOA indicator provides a visual display of the amount of available lift throughout its slow speed envelope regardless of the many variables that act upon an aircraft. This indicator is immediately responsive to changes in speed, angle of attack, and wind conditions, and automatically compensates for aircraft weight, altitude, and temperature.
* An '''angle of attack limiter''' or an "alpha" limiter is a flight computer that automatically prevents pilot input from causing the plane to rise over the stall angle. Some alpha limiters can be disabled by the pilot.

Stall warning systems often involve inputs from a broad range of sensors and systems to include a dedicated angle of attack sensor.

Blockage, damage, or inoperation of stall and angle of attack (AOA) probes can lead to unreliability of the stall warning, and cause the stick pusher, overspeed warning, autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |title=Harco Probes Still Causing Eclipse Airspeed Problems |access-date=2008-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926190738/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |archive-date=2008-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a forward [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] is used for pitch control, rather than an aft tail, the canard is designed to meet the airflow at a slightly greater angle of attack than the wing. Therefore, when the aircraft pitch increases abnormally, the canard will usually stall first, causing the nose to drop and so preventing the wing from reaching its critical AOA. Thus, the risk of main wing stalling is greatly reduced. However, if the main wing stalls, recovery becomes difficult, as the canard is more deeply stalled and angle of attack increases rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Airplane stability and control By Malcolm J. Abzug, E. Eugene Larrabee Chapter 17 {{ISBN|0-521-80992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an aft tail is used, the wing is designed to stall before the tail. In this case, the wing can be flown at higher lift coefficient (closer to stall) to produce more overall lift.

Most military combat aircraft have an angle of attack indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).

==Flight beyond the stall==
As a wing stalls, [[aileron]] effectiveness is reduced, making the plane hard to control and increasing the risk of a spin starting. [[Post stall]], steady flight beyond the stalling angle (where the coefficient of lift is largest) requires engine thrust to replace lift as well as alternative controls to replace the loss of effectiveness of the ailerons. For high-powered aircraft, the loss of lift (and increase in drag) beyond the stall angle is less of a problem than maintaining control. Some aircraft may be subject to [[post-stall gyration]] (e.g. the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]) or susceptible to entering a [[Spin (aerodynamics)#Unrecoverable spins|flat-spin]] (e.g. [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]). Control beyond-stall can be provided by reaction control systems (e.g. [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104A]]), vectored thrust, as well as a rolling [[stabilator]] (or taileron). The enhanced manoeuvering capability by flights at very high angles of attack can provide a tactical advantage for military fighters such as the [[F-22 Raptor]]. Short term stalls at 90–120° (e.g. [[Pugachev's Cobra]]) are sometimes performed at airshows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationfans.com/node/12 Pugachev's Cobra Maneuver]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest angle of attack in sustained flight so far demonstrated was 70 degrees in the [[X-31]] at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/X-31/HTML/EC94-42478-3.html X-31 EC94-42478-3: X-31 at High Angle of Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustained post-stall flight is a type of [[supermaneuverability]].

==Spoilers==
{{Main|Spoiler (aeronautics)}}
Except for flight training, airplane testing, and [[aerobatics]], a stall is usually an undesirable event. [[spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoilers]] (sometimes called lift dumpers), however, are devices that are intentionally deployed to create a carefully controlled [[flow separation]] over part of an aircraft's wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoilers|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/spoil.html|publisher=[[NASA]], [[Glenn Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers can also be used on aborted take-offs and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft's weight on its wheels for better braking action.

Unlike powered airplanes, which can control descent by increasing or decreasing thrust, gliders have to increase drag to increase the rate of descent. In high-performance gliders, spoiler deployment is extensively used to control the approach to landing.

Spoilers can also be thought of as  "lift reducers" because they reduce the lift of the wing in which the spoiler resides. For example, an uncommanded roll to the left could be reversed by raising the right wing spoiler (or only a few of the spoilers present in large airliner wings). This has the advantage of avoiding the need to increase lift in the wing that is dropping (which may bring that wing closer to stalling).

==History==
[[Otto Lilienthal]] died while flying in 1896 as the result of a stall. Wilbur Wright encountered stalls for the first time in 1901, while flying his second glider. Awareness of Lilienthal's accident and Wilbur's experience, motivated the [[Wright Brothers]] to design their plane in "[[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]" configuration. This made recoveries from stalls easier and more gentle. The design saved the brothers' lives more than once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm Designing the 1900 Wright Glider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002349/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] worked on his "[[Autogiro]]" project to develop a rotary wing aircraft which, he hoped, would be unable to stall and which therefore would be safer than aeroplanes. In developing the resulting "[[autogyro]]" aircraft, he solved many engineering problems which made the [[helicopter]] possible.

The '''Terrorism Research &amp; Analysis Consortium''' ('''TRAC''') is a digital intelligence repository of research and analysis covering [[Definitions of terrorism|terrorism]] and political violence. It provides editorially reviewed contributions from its [[consortium]] members, research associates, and embedded sources to assist decision-makers and researchers from a variety of disciplines. TRAC cross-references incoming, real-time contributions against its entire database of regional and group profiles, spanning every ideology, target, and tactic. The website also offers a clipping service called Chatter Control to bring primary resource material from social media and news from beyond the scope of Western media outlets to its clients' attention.&lt;ref name="Libraryjournal.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=LaGuardia|first1=Cheryl|title=Beacham Group Releases TRAC: Terrorism Research &amp; Analysis Consortium|url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/2012/02/blogs/eviews/beacham-group-releases-trac-terrorism-research-analysis-consortium/|accessdate=14 October 2014|publisher=Library Journal|date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a May 2013 [[NPR]] interview, TRAC's founder Veryan Khan partnered with the Beacham Group LLC as "editorial director of tracterrorism.org and an associate publisher," preparing research for nearly a decade before launching the site.&lt;ref name="WUNC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wen|first1=Shawn|title=Researcher Creates A Database Of Global Terrorist Groups|url=http://wunc.org/post/researcher-creates-database-global-terrorist-groups|accessdate=9 May 2013|publisher=WUNC - NPR|date=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Shortly after going live in 2012, TRAC had over 6,000 pages and a "master index and profiles of 3,800 identified terrorist groups and groups known to aid and abet terrorist [[organization]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s."&lt;ref name="Libraryjournal.com" /&gt;

==History==
TRAC was officially launched in Fall 2011 by the Beacham Group LLC, an academic and reference publisher founded in 1985. Originally Beacham Publishing Corp., the Beacham Group specializes in comprehensive reference works in subject areas such as endangered species, environmental issues, young adult literature, popular fiction, and European and American biography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Washington|first1=Coll|title=Beacham Scholarship Supports Terrorism Studies|url=http://www.washcoll.edu/live/news/2296-beacham-scholarship-supports-terrorism-studies|accessdate=14 October 2014|publisher=Washington College Magazine|date=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial research for the TRAC database began in the late 1990s, as global awareness of terrorism was rising due to activities of groups like [[FARC]], the [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]], and Pakistani groups associated with the Taliban. The [[PLO]] profile was the first profile developed and impetus for the articles on terrorism in nationalist and separatist movements. TRAC's coverage of Islamist terrorism expanded as the demand for research on terrorism responded to the [[9/11 attack]]s in [[New York City]].

Initially, [[consortium]] members were largely academics drawn from universities around the world. One of the first research partners, Arabinda Acharya, joined in 2009. The scope of professions represented by the consortium's 2,800 initial members widely varied from that point up to the online launch in 2012.

==Components==

===Group profiles===
TRAC currently maintains profiles on 4,500+ groups that have been known to participate in [http://www.michael-findley.com/uploads/2/0/4/5/20455799/sageman.pdf political violence] or aid and abet terrorist organizations, including [[anarchist]], [[nationalist]], and [[separatist]] movements; racist/hate groups, such as the [[Ku Klux Klan]]); lone wolves (such as [[Timothy McVeigh]]); and [[extremist]] religious [[sects]] such as [[al Qaeda| al Qaeda franchises]], [[ISIS]], [[Boko Haram]], [[Westboro Baptist Church]], and [[Bodu Bala Sena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trackingterrorism.org/group/westboro-baptist-church-wbc |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Westboro Baptist Church (WBC) | Terrorist Groups | TRAC&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each profile includes (when available) the group's tactics, targets, ideology, associated groups, leaders, theater of operation, and events associated with the group.&lt;ref name="Libraryjournal.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Vice" /&gt;

TRAC's profile on the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] received by far the most international attention to-date since the summer of 2014. Unique page-views per month range from 10,000-20,000. Other profiles of particular interest in 2015 include [[Boko Haram]] in [[Nigeria]]. In September 2014, TRAC was the first terrorism research body to cover the [[Khorasan Group|Khorasan Group / The Wolf Unit (WU)]].

===Analysis===
TRAC provides original and commissioned analyses (or "articles") on terrorism topics ranging from gender and terrorism, Quranic understandings of violent [[Jihad]], vulnerable cities, and [[urban terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Malia|title=Mysterious woman from Canada’s rapid rise in ISIS puzzles intel analysts|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/09/mysterious-woman-from-canadas-rapid-rise-in-isis-puzzles-intel-analysts/|accessdate=9 February 2014|publisher=Fox|date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each is categorized and searchable by ideology, targets, tactics, and region. Rather than a continuous page of text, every article is broken into chapters with an outline provided adjacent to the text. Associated news stories and primary resource material archived by TRAC is also available below the outline and updated on an hourly, or as-available basis.

TRAC's articles also include analytical tools such as data models, matrices, and infographs. In 2014, TRAC provided [[CNN]] with visuals from its work to identifying every member of the Islamic State administration and an analysis of the IS video "Although the Disbelievers Dislike It."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/09/18/world/meast/isis-syria-iraq-hierarchy/index.html|title=The anatomy of ISIS: How the 'Islamic State' is run, from oil to beheadings - CNN.com |last1=Thompson |first1=Nick |last2=Schubert |first2=Atika |date=9 September 2014 |work=[[CNN]] |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chatter control===
TRAC continuously monitors global developments through foreign language news outlets, social media, and embedded sources, posting analysis and feeds to the source as events unfold. Sources include well-known international news organizations, regional newspapers, blogs, think tank releases, terrorist group [[communiqués]] and under the radar commentary. TRAC has archived over 15,000 sources that are searchable.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===Publishing center===
TRAC’s editorial board provides an opportunity for scholars and journalists to publish their research, which is cross-linked to relevant articles and profiles within TRAC’s database. TRAC also lists 2,200+ resource centers (universities, think tanks, government agencies) with links to their websites.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
