{{Thomism}}
In [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosophy]], '''''actus purus''''' ( literally "pure act") is the absolute perfection of [[God]].

Created beings have potentiality that is not actuality, imperfections as well as perfection.  Only God is simultaneously all that He can be, infinitely real and infinitely perfect: 'I am who I am' ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleref2-nb|Gen|3:14}}). His attributes or His operations are really identical with His [[essence]], and His essence necessitates His [[existence]]. (Contrast this understanding with the [[Essence–Energies distinction]] in [[Essence–Energies distinction (Eastern Orthodox theology)|Eastern Christian]], particularly [[Gregory Palamas|Palamite]], theology).

In created beings, the state of potentiality precedes that of actuality; before being realized, a perfection must be capable of realization. But, absolutely speaking, actuality precedes potentiality. For in order to change, a thing must be acted upon, or actualized; change and potentiality presuppose, therefore, a being which is ''[[Actus primus|in actu]]''. This actuality, if mixed with [[Potentiality and actuality|potentiality]], presupposes another [[Actus et potentia|actuality]], and so on, until we reach the ''actus purus''.

According to [[Thomas Aquinas]] a thing which requires completion by another is said to be in potency to that other: realization of potency is called actuality. The universe is conceived of as a series of things arranged in an ascending order, or potency and act at once crowned and created by God, who alone is pure act. God is changeless because change means passage from potency to act, and so he is without beginning and end, since these demand change. Matter and form are necessary to the understanding of change, for change requires the union of that which becomes and that which it becomes. Matter is the first, and form the second. All physical things are composed of matter and form. The difference between a thing as form or character and the actual existence of it is denoted by the terms essence and being (or existence). It is only in God that there is no distinction between the two. Both pairs - matter &amp; form and essence &amp; being - are special cases of potency and act. They are also modes: modes do not add anything to the idea of being, but are ways of making explicit what is implicit in it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32961">{{Gnosticism}}
In many [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] systems,  various [[emanationism|emanations]] of "[[God]]" are known by such names as One,  [[Monad (Gnosticism)|Monad]], ''Aion teleos'' (αἰών τέλεος "The Broadest Aeon"), [[Bythos]] ("depth or profundity", {{lang|grc|βυθός}}), ''Proarkhe'' ("before the beginning", {{lang|grc|προαρχή}}),  ''Arkhe'' ("the beginning", {{lang|grc|ἀρχή}}), and '''Aeons'''. In  different systems these emanations are differently named, classified, and described, but  emanation theory is common to all forms of Gnosticism. In [[Basilidian]] Gnosis they are called sonships (υἱότητες ''huiotetes''; sing.: υἱότης ''huiotes''); according to [[Marcosians|Marcus]], they are numbers and sounds; in [[Valentinianism]] they form male/female pairs called '''syzygies''' (Greek {{lang|grc|συζυγίαι}}, from σύζυγοι ''syzygoi'', lit. "yokings together").

This source of all being is an Aeon, in which an inner being dwells, known as ''Ennoea'' ("thought, intent", Greek {{lang|grc|ἔννοια}}), ''Charis'' ("grace", Greek {{lang|grc|χάρις}}), or ''Sige'' ("silence", Greek {{lang|grc|σιγή}}). The split perfect being conceives the second Aeon, ''Nous'' ("mind", Greek Νους), within itself. Complex hierarchies of Aeons are thus produced, sometimes to the number of thirty. These Aeons belong to a purely ideal, [[Noumenon|noumenal]], intelligible, or supersensible world; they are immaterial, they are hypostatic ideas. Together with the source from which they emanate, they form ''[[Pleroma]]'' ("region of light", Greek {{lang|grc|πλήρωμα}}). The lowest regions of  Pleroma are closest to darkness—that is, the physical world.

The transition from immaterial to material, from noumenal to sensible, is created by a flaw, passion, or sin in an Aeon. According to [[Basilides]], it is a flaw in the last sonship; according to others the sin of the Great [[Archon (Gnosticism)|Archon]], or Aeon-Creator, of the Universe; according to others it is the passion of the female Aeon Sophia, who emanates without her partner Aeon, resulting in the ''[[Demiurge]]'' (Greek {{lang|grc|Δημιουργός}}),&lt;ref&gt;Lit. "half-creator," occasionally referred to as ''Yaldabaoth,'' "Son of Chaos".&lt;/ref&gt; a creature that should never have been. This creature does not belong to Pleroma, and the One emanates two savior Aeons, ''[[Christ]]'' and ''the [[Holy Spirit]]'', to save humanity from the Demiurge. Christ then took a human form (''Jesus''),  to teach humanity how to achieve [[Gnosis]]. The ultimate end of all Gnosis is μετάνοια ''metanoia'', or repentance—undoing the sin of material existence and returning to Pleroma.

Aeons bear a number of similarities to Judaeo-Christian angels, including roles as servants and emanations of God, and  existing as beings of light.  In fact, certain Gnostic Angels, such as Armozel, are also Aeons. The Gnostic [[Gospel of Judas]], recently found, purchased, held, and translated by the [[National Geographic Society]], also mentions Aeons and speaks of Jesus' teachings about them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/ The Lost Gospel] - online feature from National Geographic, including [http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/document.html Coptic text, English translation, and photos] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408000000/http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/document.html |date=April 8, 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valentinus==
[[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] assumed, as the beginning of all things, the Primal Being or Bythos, who after ages of silence and contemplation, gave rise to other beings by a process of emanation. The first series of beings, the Aeons, were thirty in number, representing fifteen syzygies or pairs sexually complementary. One common form is outlined below:&lt;ref&gt;Mead, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Aeons.png|600px|center|Scheme of the Aeons]]

The [[Valentinians|Valentinian system]] was, until recently, only known through the criticisms of its opponents; however, the discovery of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] has given access to Valentinian texts, including sources that have been tentatively identified as written by Valentinus.

[[Tertullian]]'s ''Against the Valentinians'' gives a slightly different sequence. The first eight of these Aeons, corresponding to generations one through four below, are referred to as the ''[[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]].''&lt;ref&gt;''Against the Valentinians'' ({{lang-la|Adversus Valentinianos}}) [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Against the Valentinians/VII|Books 7]]-[[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume III/Anti-Marcion/Against the Valentinians/VIII|8]].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Irenaeus]],&lt;ref&gt;''Against Heresies'' (Latin: ''Adversus Haereses'') also known as ''[[The Detection and Overthrow of Falsely So-Called Gnosis]]'' [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XII.|I. xii]].&lt;/ref&gt; the followers of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]] [[Ptolemy (gnostic)|Ptolemy]] and [[Colarbasus|Colorbasus]] had Aeons that differ from those of Valentinus. Logos is created when [[Adam Kadmon#Gnosticism|Anthropos]] learns to speak.

The order of Anthropos and Ecclesia versus Logos and Zoe is somewhat debated; different sources give different accounts. Logos and Zoe are unique to this system as compared to the previous, and may be an evolved version of the first, totalling 32 Aeons, but it is not clear if the first two were actually regarded Aeons.
&lt;!--This has been unsourced for years and years, delete? 
==Modern interpretations==
According to Myther, "The total number of Aeons, being 32, reflects the similarity of the mechanism to the [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]], which, as suggested in the [[Zohar]], incorporates 10 [[Sephirot]]h and 22 paths interconnecting these 10 Sephiroth; while 10 Aeons are created during the first five generations from which come the other 22 Aeons later during the sixth generation."{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Sige==
[[File:Valentinianpleroma-Matter.png|thumb|right|300px|''Plérome de Valentin'', from ''Histoire critique du Gnosticisme;'' Jacques Matter, 1826, Vol. II, Plate II]]

In the system of Valentinus, as expounded by Irenaeus (i. 1), the origin of things was traced to two eternal co-existent principles, a male and a female. The male was called Bythos or Proarche, or Propator, etc.; the female had the names Ennoea, Charis and Sige. The whole Aeonology of Valentinus was based on a theory of syzygies, or pairs of Aeons, each Aeon being provided with a consort; and the supposed need of the co-operation of a male and female principle for the generation of new ones, was common to Valentinus and some earlier Gnostic systems. But it was a disputed point in these systems whether the First Principle of all was thus twofold. There were those, both in earlier systems, and even among the Valentinians who held, that the origin of things was to be traced to a single Principle, which some described as [[hermaphrodite]]; others said was above all sex. And among the Valentinians who counted thirty Aeons, there were those who counted Bythos and Sige as the first pair; others who asserted the Single Principle excluded Bythos from the number, and made out the number of thirty without reckoning him. Thus Irenaeus says of the Valentinians (I. ii. 4. p.&amp;nbsp;10), "For they maintain that sometimes the Father acts in conjunction with Sige, but that at other times he shows himself independent both of male and female." And ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XI.|I. xi. 5]]) "For some declare him to be without a consort, and neither male nor female, and, in fact, nothing at all; while others affirm him to be masculo-feminine, assigning to him the nature of a hermaphrodite; others, again, allot Sige to him as a spouse, that thus may be formed the first conjunction."

Hippolytus supposes Valentinus to have derived his system from that of [[Simon Magus|Simon]]; and in that as expounded in the ''[[Simonians|Apophasis Megale]]'', from which he gives extracts, the origin of things is derived from six roots, divided into three pairs; but all these roots spring from a single independent Principle, which is without consort. The name Sige occurs in the description which Hippolytus (vi. 18) quotes from the ''Apophasis'', how from the supreme Principle there arise the male and female offshoots ''nous'' and ''epinoia''. The name Sige is there given not to either of the offshoots but to the supreme Principle itself: however, in the description, these offshoots appear less as distinct entities than as different aspects of the same Being.

[[Cyril of Jerusalem]] (''Catech''. vi. 17) makes Sige the daughter of Bythos and by him the mother of Logos, a fable which he classes with the incests which heathen mythology attributed to Jupiter. Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book II/Chapter XII.|II. xii.]]) ridicules the absurdity of the later form of Valentinian theory, in which Sige and Logos are represented as coexistent Aeons in the same Pleroma. "Where there is Silence" he says, "there will not be Word; and where there is Word, there cannot be Silence". He goes on ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book II/Chapter XIV.|ii. 14]]) to trace the invention of Sige to the heathen poets, quoting Antiphanes, who in his Theogony makes [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]] the offspring of Night and Silence.

{{quote|In place of Night and Silence they substitute Bythus and Sige; instead of Chaos, they put Nous; and for Love (by whom, says the comic poet, all other things were set in order) they have brought forward the Word; while for the primary and greatest gods they have formed the Æons; and in place of the secondary gods, they tell us of that creation by [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|their mother]] which is outside of the Pleroma, calling it the second Ogdoad. ... these men call those things which are within the Pleroma real existences, just as those philosophers did the atoms; while they maintain that those which are without the Pleroma have no true existence, even as those did respecting the vacuum. They have thus banished themselves in this world (since they are here outside of the Pleroma) into a place which has no existence. Again, when they maintain that these things [below] are images of those which have a true existence [above], they again most manifestly rehearse the doctrine of [[Democritus]] and [[Plato]]. For Democritus was the first who maintained that numerous and diverse figures were stamped, as it were, with the forms [of things above], and descended from universal space into this world. But [[Theory of Forms|Plato, for his part, speaks of matter, and exemplar, and God]]. These men, following those distinctions, have styled what he calls [[Platonic idealism|ideas]], and exemplar, the ''images'' of those things which are above ...}}

==Ennoea==
In the attempts made by the framers of different Gnostic systems to explain the origin of the existing world, the first stage in the process was usually made by personifying the conception in the divine mind of that which was to emanate from Him. We learn from [[Justin Martyr]] (''Ap''. I. 26), and from Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIII.|I. 23]]), that the word Ennoea was used in a technical sense in the system of [[Simon Magus|Simon]]. The Latin translation of Irenaeas either retains the word, or renders "mentis conceptio." Tertullian has "injectio" (''De Anima'', 34). In the ''[[Simonians|Apophasis Megale]]'' cited by Hippolytus (''Ref''. vi. 18, 19, p.&amp;nbsp;174), the word used is not ''Ennoia'' but ''Epinoia''. Irenaeus states ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIII.|I. 23]]) that the word Ennoea passed from the system of Simon into that of Menander. In the Barbeliot system which Irenaeus also counts as derived from that of Simon ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIX.|I. 29]]), Ennoea appears as one of the first in the series of emanations from the unnameable Father.

In the system of Valentinus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter I.|Iren. I. i.]]) Ennoea is one of several alternative names for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos. For the somewhat different form in which Ptolemaeus presented this part of the system see Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XII.|I. xii.]]). Irenaeus criticises this part of the system ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book II/Chapter XIII.|II. xiii.]]). The name Ennoea is similarly used in the [[Ophites|Ophite]] system described by Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|I. xxx.]]).

==Charis==
Charis, in the system of Valentinus, was an alternative name, with Ennoea and Sige, for the consort of the primary Aeon Bythos ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter IV.|Iren. i. 4]]). The name expresses that aspect of the absolute Greatness in which it is regarded not as a solitary monad, but as imparting from its perfection to beings of which it is the ultimate source; and this is the explanation given in the Valentinian fragment preserved by Epiphanius (''Haer''. xxxi. 6), ''dia to epikechoregekenai auten thesaurismata tou Megethous tois ek tou Megethous''. The use of the word Charis enabled Ptolemaeus (quoted by [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter VIII.|Irenaeus, i. 8]]) to find in {{bibleverse||John|1:14}} the first tetrad of Aeons, viz., Pater, Monogenes, Charis, Aletheia. The suspicion arises that it was with a view to such an identification that names to be found in the prologue of St. John's Gospel were added as alternative appellations to the original names of the Aeons. But this is a point on which we have no data to pronounce. Charis has an important place in the system of [[Marcus (Marcosian)|Marcus]] ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XIII.|Irenaeus, i. 13]]). The name Charis appears also in the system of the [[Barbelo|Barbelitae]] ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXIX.|Irenaeus, i. 29]]), but as denoting a later emanation than in the Valentinian system. The word has possibly also a technical meaning in the Ophite prayers preserved by Origen ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IV/Origen/Origen Against Celsus/Book VI/Chapter XXXI|''Contra Celsum'', vi. 31]]), all of which end with the invocation ''he charis synesto moi, nai pater, synesto.

==Nous==
{{main|Nous#Gnosticism|l1=Nous (Gnosticism)}}

==Ecclesia==
This higher Ecclesia was held to be the archetype of the lower Ecclesia constituted by the spiritual seed on earth ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter V.|Iren. I. v.]] 6, p. 28). In a Gnostic system described by Irenaeus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter XXX.|I. xxx.]] p. 109) we have also a heavenly church, not, however, as a separate Aeon, but as constituted by the harmony of the first existing beings. According to Hippolytus (v. 6, p. 95), the [[Naassenes]] counted three Ecclesiae.

It is especially in the case of the church that we find in Christian speculation prior to Valentinus traces of the conception, which lies at the root of the whole doctrine of Aeons, that earthly things have their archetypes in preexistent heavenly things. [[The Shepherd of Hermas|Hermas]] (''Vis''. ii. 4) speaks of the church as created before all things and of the world as formed for her sake; and in the newly discovered portion of the so-called [[Second Epistle of Clement]] to the Corinthians (c. 14) the writer speaks of the spiritual church as created before the sun and moon, as pre-existent like Christ Himself, and like him manifested in the last days for men's salvation; and he even uses language which, if it were not sufficiently accounted for by what is said in the Epistle to the Ephesians as to the union between Christ and His church, might be supposed to have affinity with the Valentinian doctrine of the relation between Anthropos and Ecclesia.&lt;ref&gt;In the notes to the passages just cited, in [[Joseph Lightfoot|Lightfoot]]'s and in Gebhardt and [[Adolf Von Harnack|Harnack]]'s editions will be found references to other early writers who have used similar language concerning the church.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] quotes the direction to Moses to make the tabernacle after the pattern shewn him on the Mount (a passage cited in {{bibleverse||Acts|7:44}}), and his argument dwells on the inference that the various parts of the Jewish service were but copies of better heavenly archetypes. This same heavenly tabernacle appears as part of the imagery of the book of the Revelation ({{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|11:19}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|15:5}}). In the same book the church appears as the Lamb's wife, the [[new Jerusalem]] descending from heaven; and St. Paul's teaching ({{bibleverse||Ephesians|1:3}}) might be thrown into the form that the church existed in God's election before the foundation of the world.

==Anthropos==
{{Main|Adam Kadmon}}
As the world is an image of the living Aeon (''tou zontos aionos''), so is man an image of the pre-existent man of the ''anthrops proon''. Valentinus, according to Clemens Alexandrinus ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book IV.|''Valentini homil. ap. Clem. Strom.'' iv. 13, 92]]), spoke of the Sophia as an artist (''zographos'') making this visible lower world a picture of the glorious Archetype, but the hearer or reader would as readily understand the heavenly wisdom of the Book of Proverbs to be meant by this Sophia, as the 12th and fallen Aeon. Under her (according to Valentinus) stand the world-creative angels, whose head is the Demiurge. Her formation (''plasma'') is Adam created in the name of the ''Anthropos proon''. In him thus made a higher power puts the seed of the heavenly pneumatic essence (''sperma tes anothen ousias''). Thus furnished with higher insight, Adam excites the fears of the angels; for even as ''kosmikoi anthropoi'' are seized with fear of the images made by their own hands to bear the name of God, ''i.e.'' the idols, so these angels cause the images they have made to disappear ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume II/CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA/The Stromata, or Miscellanies/Book II/Chapter VIII.|''Ep. ad amicos ap. Clem. Alex. Strom.'' ii. 8, 36]]).
{{quote|... they say that Achamoth sketched these pictures in honor of the aeons. Yet they transfer this work to Soter as its originator who operated through Achamoth so as to present her as the very image of the invisible and unknown Father, she being invisible, of course, and unknown to the Demiurge, and in the same way he created this same Demiurge to correspond to Nus, the son. The Archangels, creations of the Demiurge, are models of the rest of the aeons. ... don't you agree that I should laugh at these pictures painted by such a lunatic painter? Achamoth, a female and yet the image of the Father; the Demiurge, ignorant of his mother—not to mention of his Father—yet representing Nus who is not ignorant of his Father; the angels, the reproductions of their masters. This is the same as counterfeiting a fake ...|Tertullian, ''[http://www.gnosis.org/library/ter_val.htm Against the Valentinians]'', XIX}}

==Horos==
According to the doctrine of Valentinus, as described by [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter II.|Irenaeus i. 2]], the youngest Aeon Sophia, in her passion to comprehend the Father of all, runs the danger of being absorbed into his essence, from which she is saved by coming in contact with the limiting power ''Horos'', whose function it is to strengthen all things outside the ineffable Greatness, by confining each to its appointed place. According to this version Horos was a previously existing power; but according to another, and apparently a later account, Horos is an Aeon only generated on this occasion at the request of all the Aeons, who implored the Father to avert a danger that threatened to affect them all. Then (as Hippolytus tells the story, vi. 31) he directs the production of a new pair of Aeons, Christ and the Holy Spirit, who restore order by separating from the Pleroma the unformed offspring of Sophia. After this Horos is produced in order to secure the permanence of the order thus produced. Irenaeus (''u. s.'') reverses this order, and Horos is produced first, afterwards the other pair.

The Valentinian fragment in Epiphanius (''Haer''. 31, p.&amp;nbsp;171), which seems to give a more ancient form of this heresy, knows nothing of Horos, but it relates as the last spiritual birth the generation of five beings without consorts, whose names are used in the Irenaean version as titles for the supernumerary Aeon Horos. But besides, this Aeon has a sixth name, which in the version of Hippolytus is made his primary title ''[[Stauros]];'' and it is explained ([[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume I/IRENAEUS/Against Heresies: Book I/Chapter III.|Irenaeus, i. 3]]) that besides his function as a separator, in respect of which he is called Horos, this Aeon does the work of stablishing and settling, in respect of which he is called Stauros. A derivation from ''sterizo'' is hinted at.

The literal earthly crucifixion of the Saviour (that seen by the [[Pneumatic (Gnosticism)|psychic]] church, which only believes in the ''historical'' Jesus) was meant to represent an ''archetypal'' scene in the world of Aeons, when the younger Sophia, Achamoth, is healed through the Savior's instrumentation. 
{{quote|The animal and carnal Christ, however, does suffer after the fashion of the superior Christ, who, for the purpose of producing Achamoth, had been stretched upon the cross, that is, Horos, in a substantial though not a cognizable form. In this manner do they reduce all things to mere images--Christians themselves being indeed nothing but imaginary beings!|Tertullian, ''[http://www.gnosis.org/library/ter_val.htm Against the Valentinians]'', XXVII}}
The distinction just explained as to the different use of the names Horos and Stauros was not carefully observed by Valentinians. Thus the last word is sometimes used when the function of separation and division is spoken of (''Excerpt. ex Script. Theodot.'' 22 and 42, Clem. Alex. ii. pp.&amp;nbsp;974, 979), it being remarked in the latter passage that the cross separates the faithful from the unbelievers; and Clem. Alex., who occasionally uses Valentinian language in an orthodox sense, speaks in the same way (''Paed''. iii. 12, p.&amp;nbsp;303, and ''Strom''. ii. 20, p.&amp;nbsp;486).

In the Valentinian theory there is a double Horos, or at least a double function discharged by Horos. 
{{quote|text=&lt;poem&gt;Plato, then, in expounding mysteries concerning the universe, writes to Dionysius expressing himself after some such manner as this: “. . . All things are about the King of all, and on his account are all things, and he is cause of all the glorious (objects of creation). The second is about the second, and the third about the third. But pertaining to the King there is none of those things of which I have spoken. But after this the soul earnestly desires to learn what sort these are, looking upon those things that are akin to itself, and not one of these is (in itself) sufficient. . . .”

Valentinus, falling in with these (remarks), has made a fundamental principle in his system “the King of all,” whom Plato mentioned, and whom this heretic styles Pater, and Bythos, and Proarche over the rest of the Æons. And when Plato uses the words, “what is second about things that are second,” Valentinus supposes to be second all the Æons that are within the ''limit'' [Horos] (of the Pleroma, as well as) the limit (itself). And when Plato uses the words, “what is third about what is third,” he has (constituted as third) the entire of the arrangement (existing) outside the limit and the Pleroma.&lt;/poem&gt;|author=Hippolytus, [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume V/Hippolytus/The Refutation of All Heresies/Book VI/Part 33|''Philosophumena'', VI, 32]]}}
On the one hand, he discharges as already described, a function within the Pleroma, separating the other Aeons from the ineffable Bythos, and saving them from absorption into his essence. On the other hand, Horos is the outside boundary of the Pleroma itself, giving it permanence and stability by guarding it against the intrusion of any foreign element. 
&lt;!--When we consider the discordance of the different accounts of Horos (the same work being ascribed to him which is elsewhere ascribed to Christ and the Holy Spirit), and the name Saviour being given to him, and the fact that by no way of counting can he be included in the number of thirty Aeons, there is reason to infer that this personification of the limiting power was not made till a late stage of the development of Valentinian doctrine.--&gt;

Several writers, including Jewish [[Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]], and [[animal rights]] groups have drawn a comparison between the '''treatment of animals and [[the Holocaust]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, Charles. ''Eternal Treblinka'', Lantern Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison is regarded as controversial, and has been criticized by organizations that campaign against [[antisemitism]], including the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref name=tolerance&gt;Willoughby, Brian. [http://www.tolerance.org/news/article_hate.jsp?id=724 "PETA Turns Holocaust into Pig Pen"], ''Tolerance.org'', a webproject  of the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]], March 7, 2003, Retrieved August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A character in one of Singer's stories described the treatment of animals by humans as "an eternal [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]]".&lt;ref name=Patterson/&gt; Similarly, the eponymous character in [[J. M. Coetzee]]'s ''[[Elizabeth Costello]]'' compared the Nazis' treatment of Jews to methods used by the [[meat industry]] to herd and slaughter cattle.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;Coetzee, J.M. [http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/factory-farming-must-be-called-to--slaughterhouse/2007/02/21/1171733846249.html Exposing the beast: factory farming must be called to the slaughterhouse], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'',
February 22, 2007.  Retrieved February 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison began immediately after the end of [[World War II]], when Jewish writers recounted the lack of resistance by European Jewish victims of the Holocaust, who were led to their death as "sheep to slaughter".&lt;ref&gt;Sicher, Efraim, "Breaking crystal: writing and memory after Auschwitz", pp. 41, 98, 99, 121, etc., University of Illinois Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The ADL argues, however, that the subsequent use of Holocaust imagery by animal rights activists is a "disturbing development".&lt;ref name=ADL1&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/holocaust_imagery.asp "Holocaust Imagery and Animal Rights"], [[Anti-Defamation League]], August 2, 2005, Retrieved August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roberta Kalechofsky]] of Jews for Animal Rights argues in her essay "Animal Suffering and the Holocaust: The Problem with Comparisons" that, although there is "connective tissue" between animal suffering and the Holocaust, they "fall into different historical frameworks, and comparison between them aborts the ... force of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref name=RK&gt;Kalechofsky, Roberta. [http://www.micahbooks.com/animalsufferingandtheholocaust40.html ''Animal Suffering and the Holocaust: The Problem with Comparisons''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904163302/http://www.micahbooks.com/animalsufferingandtheholocaust40.html |date=September 4, 2009 }}, Micah Publications, 2003, last accessed November 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also written that she "agree[s] with I.B. Singer's statement, that 'every day is Treblinka for the animals{{'"}}, but concludes that "some agonies are too total to be compared with other agonies."&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;

==Comparisons==
Jewish author Isaac Bashevis Singer, who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1978, made the comparison in several of his stories, including ''Enemies, A Love Story,'' ''The Penitent,'' and ''The Letter Writer.'' In the latter the protagonist says, "In relation to [animals], all people are Nazis; for the animals, it is an eternal Treblinka."&lt;ref name=Patterson&gt;Patterson, Charles (2002). ''Eternal Treblinka'', Lantern Books, pp. 181–188.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''The Penitent'' the protagonist says "when it comes to animals, every man is a Nazi."&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Isaac Bashevis (1983).  ''The Penitent'', Farrar, Straus, Giroux, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Kupfer-Koberwitz]], a [[pacifist]], [[conscientious objector]] and Holocaust victim who was sent to [[Dachau]] for "being a strong autonomously thinking personality",&lt;ref&gt;Charles Patterson. [i]Eternal Treblinka: Our Treatment of Animals and the Holocaust[/i].  New York, NY: Lantern Books, 2002  218.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in his "Dachau Diaries" (kept at the University of Chicago Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.KOBERWITZ |title=Guide to the Edgar Kupfer-Koberwitz Dachau Diaries 1942-1945 |publisher=Lib.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that "I have suffered so much myself that I can feel other creatures' suffering by virtue of my own".&lt;ref name=EKK&gt;Edgar Kupfer-Koberwitz, ''Animal Brothers: Reflection on an Ethical Way of Life'', 4th ed.Mannaheim, Germany: Warland-Verlagsgenossenschaft eG Mannaheim, n. date.  Translated by Ruth Mossner for Vegetarian Press, Denver, CO.&lt;/ref&gt;  He further wrote, "I believe as long as man tortures and kills animals, he will torture and kill humans as well—and wars will be waged—for killing must be practiced and learned on a small scale".&lt;ref name=EKK/&gt;

Belgian writer [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] also made the comparison. She wrote that if we had not accepted the inhumane transportation of animals to the slaughterhouses we would not have accepted the transportation of humans to the concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Yourcenar,  [http://bibliodroitsanimaux.voila.net/yourcenardigereragonies.html UNE POLITIQUE POUR DEMAIN]&lt;/ref&gt; In another article, making the same connection, she wrote that every act of cruelty suffered by thousands of living creatures is a crime against humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Marguerite Yourcenar, [http://bibliodroitsanimaux.voila.net/yourcenarcloisonetanche.html Une civilisation à cloisons étanches]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. M. Coetzee]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2003, invoked the image of the [[slaughterhouse]] in describing the Nazi's treatment of Jews: "... in the 20th century, a group of powerful and bloody-minded men in Germany hit on the idea of adapting the methods of the industrial stockyard, as pioneered and perfected in Chicago, to the slaughter – or what they preferred to call the processing – of human beings."&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;

The ADL lists a number of animal rights groups that have made the comparison. The magazine ''No Compromise'' introduced the [[Animal Liberation Front]] with the words: "If we are trespassing, so were the soldiers who broke down the gates of Hitler's death camps; If we are thieves, so were the members of the Underground Railroad who freed the slaves of the South; And if we are vandals, so were those who destroyed Forever the gas chambers of Buchenwald and Auschwitz."&lt;ref name="ADL1"/&gt;

In 2001, Meat.org included an "Animal Holocaust" section containing photographs of animals with captions such as "Holocaust Victim", arguing that it's "easy to see the resemblance of the systematic destruction and slaughter of over six million Jews by the Nazis before and during World War II and the over 20 million animals that are executed every day in America alone. Many of the Jews of the Holocaust were transported to concentration camps in cattle cars to their death. The concentration camps very much resemble the common slaughterhouses of today."&lt;ref name=ADL1/&gt;

The Consistency in Compassion Campaign (CCC), a project of the Northwest Animal Rights Network of [[Seattle]], Washington, argues that "the Holocaust stands for much more than the one event. It represents a place and time when supremacist thinking was so embedded in a culture that they were blind or apathetic to the evil that existed in their everyday world. This kind of thinking is not exclusive to just that time and place. The great blind spot of our country and Western Civilization for that matter is the mistreatment and disregard for non-human animals in nearly every capacity."&lt;ref name=ADL1/&gt;

==PETA and the use of Holocaust imagery==
[[Ingrid Newkirk]], the president of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA), has herself made the comparison unambiguously, saying: "Six million Jews died in [[concentration camp]]s, but six billion broiler chickens will die this year in slaughterhouses."&lt;ref name=Shafran&gt;Shafran, Avi. [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/25916/format/html/displaystory.html "This time PETA's guilty of missing the point"], ''[[j.]]'', May 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

PETA has twice used Holocaust imagery in its campaigns. In July 2003, a PETA television public service announcement called "They came for us at night" aired on U.S. cable networks, narrated by a man describing what it felt like to be transported without food or water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petatv.com/tvpopup/video.asp?video=holocaust_ad&amp;Player=wm&amp;speed=_med "They came for us at night"], PETAtv.com, Retrieved August 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, PETA's "Holocaust on your Plate" exhibition consisted of eight {{convert|60|sqft|m2|adj=on}} panels, each juxtaposing images of the Holocaust with images of [[factory farming|factory-farmed animals]]. Photographs of concentration camp inmates were displayed next to photographs of battery chickens, and piled bodies of Holocaust victims next to a pile of pig carcasses. Captions alleged that "like the Jews murdered in [[concentration camp]]s, animals are terrorized when they are housed in huge filthy warehouses and rounded up for shipment to slaughter. The leather sofa and handbag are the moral equivalent of the [[Lampshades made from human skin|lampshades made from the skins of people]] killed in the [[Extermination camps in the Holocaust|death camps]]."&lt;ref name=SmithHolocaust&gt;Smith, Wesley J. [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/21/INGH63PBJ81.DTL "PETA to cannibals: Don't let them eat steak"], ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', December 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was funded by an anonymous Jewish philanthropist,&lt;ref name=Teather&gt;Teather, David. [https://www.theguardian.com/animalrights/story/0,11917,906289,00.html "'Holocaust on a plate' angers US Jews"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 3, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and created by Matt Prescott, who lost several relatives in the Holocaust. Prescott said: "The very same mindset that made the Holocaust possible – that we can do anything we want to those we decide are 'different or inferior' – is what allows us to commit atrocities against animals every single day. ... The fact is, all animals feel pain, fear and loneliness. We're asking people to recognize that what Jews and others went through in the Holocaust is what animals go through every day in [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]]."&lt;ref name=Teather/&gt;

[[Abraham Foxman]], chairman of the ADL, said the exhibition was "outrageous, offensive and takes [[chutzpah]] to new heights ... The effort by PETA to compare the deliberate systematic murder of millions of Jews to the issue of animal rights is abhorrent."&lt;ref name=Teather/&gt; Stuart Bender, legal counsel for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, wrote to PETA asking them to "cease and desist this reprehensible misuse of Holocaust materials."&lt;ref name=tolerance/&gt; There were also differing opinions within the animal rights movement. Roberta Kalechofsky wrote: "While I sympathize with PETA's aim—and am a member of PETA—I objected to this use of the Holocaust... The agony of animals arises from different causes from those of the Holocaust. Human beings do not hate animals. They do not eat them because they hate them. They do not experiment on them because they hate them, they do not hunt them because they hate them. These were the motives for the Holocaust. Human beings have no ideological or theological conflict with animals."&lt;ref name=RK/&gt;

In 2005, Newkirk apologized for the pain the campaign had caused some people, while defending the goals of the campaign, writing:

{{quote|Hard as it may be to understand for those who were deeply upset by this campaign, I was bowled over by the negative reception by many in the Jewish community. It was both unintended and unexpected. The PETA staff who proposed that we do it were Jewish, and the patronage for the entire endeavor was Jewish. We were careful to use Jewish authors and scholars and quotes from Holocaust victims and survivors ... We believe that we humans can and should use our distinctive capacities to reduce suffering in the world ... Our mission is a profoundly human one at its heart, yet we know that we have caused pain. This was never our intention, and we are deeply sorry.  We hope that you can understand that although we embarked on the "Holocaust on Your Plate" project with misconceptions about what its impact would be, we always try to act with integrity, with the goal of improving the lives of those who suffer. We hope those we upset will find it in their hearts to work toward the goal of a kinder world for all, regardless of species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ingrid Newkirk|Newkirk, Ingrid]].

''The Guardian'' subsequently reported, however, that "the appeal has done little to calm the fury of Jewish groups."&lt;ref name=Teather/&gt; The campaign was also banned in Germany for making the Holocaust seem "insignificant and banal", to which  [[Peter Singer]], the noted [[animal rights]] advocate and writer, and a descendant of Holocaust survivors, replied by noting that "... if Peta is not allowed to state its case against our abuse of animals in the way that they judge best, because doing so might offend some people, then criticism of religion could also be prohibited on the same grounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20min.ch/news/kreuz_und_quer/story/Tierschuetzern-wird-Holocaust-Vergleich-verboten-22626755 |title=20 Minuten Online - Nachrichten - Panorama |publisher=20min.ch |date= |accessdate=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=To defame religion is a human right|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/apr/15/religion-islam-atheism-defamation|accessdate=October 1, 2011|newspaper=The Guardian|date=April 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2009, the German Federal Constitutional Court dismissed a legal move challenging an appeal court's ruling that PETA's campaign was not protected by free speech laws. While not entering formal proceedings to decide in the matter, the court expressed severe doubts as to whether the campaign constituted an offense against human rights in its opinion to dismiss the appeal, as had been found by the orderly courts, but acceded to the other grounds of the former rulings that the campaign constituted a trivialization of the Holocaust and hence a severe violation of living Jews' personality rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bundesverfassungsgericht.de/pressemitteilungen/bvg09-029.html|title=Erfolglose Verfassungsbeschwerden eines Tierschutzvereins gegen das Verbot einer auf einem Holocaustvergleich aufbauenden Werbekampagne|author=[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]|date=March 26, 2009|accessdate=April 13, 2012|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtleties of the ruling are sometimes not reflected adequately in press reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/news/germany-rules-animal-rights-group-s-holocaust-ad-offensive-1.272963|title=Germany rules animal rights group's Holocaust ad offensive|agency=Associated Press|publisher=Ha'aretz|date=July 8, 2010|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology of art]], the relationship between '''art and emotion''' has newly been the subject of extensive study thanks to the intervention of esteemed art historian [[Alexander Nemerov]]. [[Emotion]]al or aesthetic responses to [[art]] have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Emotional Responses to Art: From Collation and Arousal to Cognition and Emotion.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2005|volume=9|issue=4|pages=342–357|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.9.4.342}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.&lt;ref name=Fellous-review&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fellous|first=Jean-Marc|title=A mechanistic view of the expression and experience of emotion in the arts. Deeper that reason: Emotion and its role in literature, music and art by Jenefer Robinson|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|year=2006|volume=119|issue=4|pages=668–674|doi=10.2307/20445371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cupchik|first=Gerald C.|author2=Vartanian, Oshin|author3= Crawley, Adrian|author4= Mikulis, David J.|title=Viewing artworks: Contributions of cognitive control and perceptual facilitation to aesthetic experience|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=1 June 2009|volume=70|issue=1|pages=84–91|doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2009.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, [[brain]] regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.&lt;ref name=Cupchick-neuro /&gt;

== Basis for Emotional Responses to Art ==
Evolutionary ancestry has hard-wired humans to have affective responses for certain patterns and traits. These predispositions lend themselves to responses when looking at certain visual arts as well. Identification of subject matter is the first step in understanding the visual image. Being presented with visual stimuli creates initial confusion. Being able to comprehend a figure and background creates closure and triggers the pleasure centers of the brain by remedying the confusion. Once an image is identified, meaning can be created by accessing memory relative to the visual stimuli and associating personal memories with what is being viewed.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barry | first1 = A | year = 2006 | title = Perceptual Aesthetics: Transcendent Emotion, Neurological Image | url = | journal = Visual Communication Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 134–151 | doi = 10.1207/s15551407vcq1303_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of stimulating initial interest that can lead to emotion involves pattern recognition. [[Symmetry]] is often found in works of art, and the human brain unconsciously searches for symmetry for a number of reasons. Potential predators were [[Symmetry in biology|bilaterally symmetrical]], as were potential prey. Bilateral symmetry also exists in humans, and a healthy human is typically symmetrical. This attraction to symmetry was therefore advantageous, as it helped humans recognize danger, food, and mates. Art containing symmetry therefore is typically approached and positively valenced to humans.&lt;ref name="barry" /&gt;

Another example is to observe paintings or photographs of bright, open landscapes that often evoke a feeling of beauty, [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]], or happiness. This connection to pleasant emotions exists because it was advantageous to humans before today's society to be able to see far into the distance in a brightly lit vista. Similarly, visual images that are dark and/or obscure typically elicit emotions of [[anxiety]] and fear. This is because an impeded visual field is disadvantageous for a human to be able to defend itself.&lt;ref name="carroll"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carroll | first1 = N | year = 2003 | title = ART AND MOOD: PRELIMINARY NOTES AND CONJECTURES | url = | journal = Monist | volume = 86 | issue = 4| pages = 521–555 | doi=10.5840/monist200386426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meta-Emotions ===
The optimal visual artwork creates what Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav call "meta-emotions." These are multiple emotions that are triggered at the same time. They posit that what people see when immediately looking at a piece of artwork are the formal, technical qualities of the work and its complexity. Works that are well-made but lacking in appropriate complexity, or works that are intricate but missing in technical skill will not produce "meta-emotions."&lt;ref name="noy"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noy | first1 = P. | last2 = Noy-Sharav | first2 = D. | year = 2013 | title = Art and Emotions | url = | journal = International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 100–107 | doi = 10.1002/aps.1352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, seeing a perfectly painted chair (technical quality but no complexity) or a sloppily drawn image of [[Christ]] on the cross (complex but no skill) would be unlikely to stimulate deep emotional responses. However, beautifully painted works of Christ's [[crucifixion]] are likely make people who can relate or who understand the story behind it weep.

Noy &amp; Noy-Sharav also claim that art is the most potent form of emotional communication. They cite examples of people being able to listen to and [[dance]] to [[music]] for hours without getting tired and literature being able to take people to far away, imagined lands inside their heads. Art forms give humans a higher satisfaction in emotional release than simply managing emotions on their own. Art allows people to have a cathartic release of pent-up emotions either by creating work or by witnessing and pseudo-experiencing what they see in front of them. Instead of being passive recipients of actions and images, art is intended for people to challenge themselves and work through the emotions they see presented in the artistic message ./..&lt;ref name="noy" /&gt;

==Types of elicited emotions==

tions works of art can elicit; whether these are defined emotions such as anger, confusion or happiness, or a general feeling of aesthetic appreciation.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Looking past pleasure: Anger, confusion, disgust, pride, surprise, and other unusual aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=48–51|doi=10.1037/a0014632}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic experience seems to be determined by liking or disliking a work of art, placed along a continuum of pleasure–displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; However, other diverse emotions can still be felt in response to art, which can be sorted into three categories: Knowledge Emotions, Hostile Emotions, and Self-Conscious Emotions.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Liking and comprehensibility ===
Pleasure elicited by works of art can also have multiple sources. A number of theories suggest that enjoyment of a work of art is dependent on its comprehensibility or ability to be understood easily.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: The influence of titles on aesthetic experiences.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, when more information about a work of art is provided, such as a title, description, or artist's statement, researchers predict that viewers will understand the piece better, and demonstrate greater liking for it.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Experimental evidence shows that the presence of a title for a work increases perceived understanding, regardless of whether that title is elaborative or descriptive.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;  Elaborative titles did affect aesthetic responses to the work, suggesting viewers were not creating alternative explanations for the works if an explaining title is given.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt; Descriptive or random titles do not show any of these effects.&lt;ref name=Millis-titles /&gt;

Furthering the thought that pleasure in art derives from its comprehensibility and processing fluency, some authors have described this experience as an emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Thomas|author2=Detweiler-Bedell, Brian|title=Beauty as an emotion: The exhilarating prospect of mastering a challenging world.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2008|volume=12|issue=4|pages=305–329|doi=10.1037/a0012558}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional feeling of beauty, or an aesthetic experience, does not have a valence emotional undercurrent, rather is general cognitive arousal due to the fluent processing of a novel stimuli.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt; Some authors believe that aesthetic emotions is enough of a unique and verifiable experience that it should be included in general theories of emotion.&lt;ref name=Armstrong-Beauty /&gt;

===Knowledge emotions===
Knowledge emotions deal with reactions to thinking and feeling, such as interest, confusion, and surprise.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; They often stem from self-analysis of what the viewer knows, expects, and perceives.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This set of emotions also spur actions that motivate further learning and thinking.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Interest====
Interest in a work of art arises from perceiving the work as new, complex, and unfamiliar, as well as understandable.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; This dimension is studied most often by aesthetics researchers, and can be equated with aesthetic pleasure or an aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; This stage of art experience usually occurs as the viewer understands the artwork they are viewing, and the art fits into their knowledge and expectations while providing a new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt;

====Confusion====
Confusion can be viewed as an opposite to interest, and serves as a signal to the self to inform the viewer that they cannot comprehend what they are looking at, and confusion often necessitates a shift in action to remedy the lack of understanding.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Confusion and interest: The role of knowledge emotions in aesthetic experience.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=75–80|doi=10.1037/a0017081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion is thought to stem from uncertainty, and a lack of one's expectations and knowledge being met by a work of art.&lt;ref name=Silvia-confusion /&gt; 
Confusion is most often experienced by art novices, and therefore must often be dealt with by those in arts education.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Surprise====
Surprise functions as a disruption of current action to alert a viewer to a significant event.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; The emotion is centered around the experience of something new and unexpected, and can be ellicied by sensory incongruity.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; Art can ellicit surprise when expectations about the work are not met, but the work changes those expectations in an understandable way.

===Hostile emotions===
Hostile emotions toward art are often very visible in the form of anger or frustration, and can result in censorship, but are less easily described by a continuum of aesthetic pleasure-displeasure.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These reactions center around the hostility triad: anger, disgust, and contempt.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;  These emotions often motivate aggression, self-assertion, and violence, and arise from perception of the artist's deliberate trespass onto the expectations of the viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

===Self-conscious emotions===
Self-conscious emotions are responses that reflect upon the self and one's actions, such as pride, guilt, shame, regret and embarrassment.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; These are much more complex emotions, and involve assessing events as agreeing with one's self-perception or not, and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt; There are numerous instances of artists expressing self-conscious emotions in response to their art, and self-conscious emotions can also be felt collectively.&lt;ref name=Silvia-lookingpastpleasure /&gt;

====Sublime feelings====
Researchers have investigated the experience of the sublime, viewed as similar to aesthetic appreciation, which causes general psychological arousal.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eskine|first=Kendall J.|author2=Kacinik, Natalie A.|author3= Prinz, Jesse J.|title=Stirring images: Fear, not happiness or arousal, makes art more sublime.|journal=Emotion|date=1 January 2012|volume=12|issue=5|pages=1071–1074|doi=10.1037/a0027200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sublime feeling has been connected to a feeling of happiness in response to art, but may be more related to an experience of fear.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt; Researchers have shown that feelings of fear induced before looking at artwork results in more sublime feelings in response to those works.&lt;ref name=Eskine-sublime /&gt;

====Aesthetic chills====
{{Main|Aesthetic chills}}
Another common emotional response is that of chills when viewing a work of art. The feeling is predicted to be related to similar aesthetic experiences such as awe, feeling touched, or absorption.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|author2=Nusbaum, Emily C.|title=On personality and piloerection: Individual differences in aesthetic chills and other unusual aesthetic experiences.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2011|volume=5|issue=3|pages=208–214|doi=10.1037/a0021914}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personality traits along the Big 5 Inventory have been shown to be predictors of a person's experience of aesthetic chills, especially a high rating on Openness to Experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; This counters the effect of fluid intelligence, where those with higher amounts of fluid intelligence are less likely to experience chills.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt; Experience with the arts also predicts someone's experience of aesthetic chills, but this may be due to them experiencing art more frequently.&lt;ref name=Silvia-chills /&gt;

===Effects of expertise===
The fact that art is analyzed and experienced differently by those with artistic training and expertise than those who are artistically naive has been shown numerous times. Researchers have tried to understand how experts interact with art so differently from the art naive, as experts tend to like more abstract compositions, and show a greater liking for both modern and classical types of art.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Gerger, Gernot|author3= Dressler, Stefan G.|author4= Schabmann, Alfred|title=How art is appreciated.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts also exhibit more arousal when looking at modern and abstract works, while non-experts show more arousal to classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder-appreciated /&gt;

Other researchers predicted that experts find more complex art interesting because they have changed their appraisals of art to create more interest, or are possibly making completely different types of appraisals than novices.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=Paul J.|title=Artistic training and interest in visual art: Applying the appraisal model of aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2006|volume=24|issue=2|pages=139–161|doi=10.2190/dx8k-6wea-6wpa-fm84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts described works rated high in complexity as easier to understand and more interesting than did novices, possibly as experts tend to use more idiosyncratic criteria when judging artworks.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt; However, experts seem to use the same appraisals of emotions that novices do, but these appraisals are at a higher level, because a wider range of art is comprehensible to experts.&lt;ref name=Silvia-expertise /&gt;

====Expertise and museum visits====
Due to most art being in museums and galleries, most people have to make deliberate choices to interact with art. Researchers are interested in what types of experiences and emotions people are looking for when going to experience art in a museum.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano|author2=Bartoli, G.|author3=Bove, G.|title=Learning through ancient art and experincing emotions with contemporary art: Comparing visits in two different museums|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2007|volume=25|issue=2|pages=173–191|doi=10.2190/r784-4504-37m3-2370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most people respond that they visit museums to experience 'the pleasure of art' or 'the desire for cultural learning', but when broken down, visitors of museums of classical art are more motivated to see famous works and learn more about them.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Visitors in contemporary art museums were more motivated by a more emotional connection to the art, and went more for the pleasure than a learning experience.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt; Predictors of who would prefer to go to which type of museum lay in education level, art fluency, an socio-economic status.&lt;ref name=Mastandera-muesum /&gt;

==Theories and models of elicited emotions==
Researchers have offered a number of theories to describe emotional responses to art, often aligning with the various theories of the basis of emotions. Authors have argued that the emotional experience is created explicitly by the artist and mimicked in the viewer, or that the emotional experience of art is a by-product of the analysis of that work.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;&lt;ref name=Fellous-review /&gt;

===Appraisal theory===
The [[appraisal theory]] of emotions centers on the assumption that it is the evaluation of events, and not the events themselves, that cause emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Emotions are then created by different groups of appraisal structures that events are analyzed through.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; When applied to art, appraisal theories argue that various artistic structures, such as complexity, prototypically, and understanding are used as appraisal structures, and works that show more typical art principles will create a stronger aesthetic experience .&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Appraisal theories suggest that art is experienced as interesting after being analyzed through a novelty check and coping-potential check, which analyze the art's newness of experience for the viewer, and the viewer's ability to understand the new experience.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; Experimental evidence suggests that art is preferred when the viewer finds it easier to understand, and that interest in a work is predictable with knowledge of the viewer's ability to process complex visual works, which supports the appraisal theory.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt; People with higher levels of artistic expertise and knowledge often prefer more complex works of art. Under appraisal theory, experts have a different emotional experience to art due to a preference for more complex works that they can understand better than a naive viewer.&lt;ref name=Silvia-emotionalresponsestoart /&gt;

====Appraisal and negative emotions====
A newer take on this theory focuses on the consequences of the emotions elicited from art, both positive and negative. The original theory argues that positive emotions are the result of a biobehavioral reward system, where a person feels a positive emotion when they have completed a personal goal.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Jessica M.|author2=Paul J. Silvia|title=Opposing art: Rejection as an action tendency of hostile aesthetic emotions|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|year=2009|volume=27|issue=1|pages=109–126|doi=10.2190/em.27.1.f}}&lt;/ref&gt; These emotional rewards create actions by motivating approach or withdrawal from a stimuli, depending if the object is positive or negative to the person.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; However, these theories have not often focused on negative emotions, especially negative emotional experiences from art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; These emotions are central to experimental aesthetics research in order to understand why people have negative, rejecting, condemning, or censoring reactions to works of art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; By showing research participants controversial photographs, rating their feelings of anger, and measuring their subsequent actions, researchers found that the participants that felt hostile toward the photographs displayed more rejection of the works.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt; This suggests that negative emotions towards a work of art can create a negative action toward it, and suggests the need for further research on negative reactions towards art.&lt;ref name=cooper-opposingart /&gt;

===Minimal model===
Other psychologists believe that emotions are of minimal functionality, and are used to move a person towards incentives and away from threats.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xenakis|first=Ioannis|author2=Arnellos, Argyris|author3= Darzentas, John|title=The functional role of emotions in aesthetic judgment|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2012|volume=30|issue=2|pages=212–226|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2011.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, positive emotions are felt upon the attainment of a goal, and negative emotions when a goal has failed to be achieved.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt;   The basic states of pleasure or pain can be adapted to aesthetic experiences by a disinterested buffer, where the experience is not explicitly related to the goal-reaching of the person, but a similar experience can be analyzed from a disinterested distance.&lt;ref name=Xenakis-functionalrole /&gt; These emotions are disinterested because the work of art or artist's goals are not affecting the person's well being, but the viewer can feel whether or not those goals were achieved from a third-party distance.

===Five-step aesthetic experience===
Other theorists have focused their models on the disrupting and unique experience that comes from the interacting with a powerful work of art. An early model focused on a two-part experience: facile recognition and meta-cognitive perception, or the experience of the work of art and the mind's analysis of that experience.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelowski|first=Matthew|author2=Akiba, Fuminori|title=A model of art perception, evaluation and emotion in transformative aesthetic experience|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|date=1 August 2011|volume=29|issue=2|pages=80–97|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2010.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further cognitive model strengthens this idea into a five-part emotional experience of a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; As this five-part model is new, it remains only a theory, as not much empirical evidence for the model had been researched yet.

====Part one: Pre-expectations and self-image====
The first stage of this model focuses on the viewer's expectations of the work before seeing it, based on their previous experiences, their observational strategies, and the relation of the work to themselves.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; Viewers who tend to appreciate art, or know more about it will have different expectations at this stage than those who are not engaged by art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part two: Cognitive mastery and introduction of discrepancy ====
After viewing the work of art, people will make an initial judgment and classification of the work,  often based on their preconceptions of the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; After initial classification, viewers attempt to understand the motive and meaning of the work, which can then inform their perception of the work, creating a cycle of changing perception and the attempt to understand it.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; It is at this point any discrepancies between expectations and the work, or the work and understanding arise.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part three: Secondary control and escape====
When an individual finds a discrepancy in their understanding that cannot be resolved or ignored, they move to the third stage of their interaction with a work of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; At this point, interaction with the work has switched from lower-order and unconscious processes to higher-order cognitive involvement, and tension and frustration starts to be felt.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt; In order to maintain their self-assumptions and to resolve the work, an individual will try to change their environment in order for the issue to be resolved or ignored.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This can be done by re-classifying the work and its motives, blaming the discrepancy on an external source, or attempting to escape the situation or mentally withdraw from the work.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part four: Meta-cognitive reassessment====
If viewers cannot escape or reassess the work, they are forced to reassess the self and their interactions with works of art.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;  This experience of self-awareness through a work of art is often externally caused, rather than internally motivated, and starts a transformative process to understand the meaning of the discrepant work, and edit their own self-image.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

====Part five: Aesthetic outcome and new mastery====
After the self-transformation and change in expectations, the viewer resets their interaction with the work, and begins the process anew with deeper self-understanding and cognitive mastery of the artwork.&lt;ref name=Pelowski-5part /&gt;

==Pupillary response tests==
In order to research emotional responses to art, researchers often rely on behavioral data.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuchinke|first=Lars|author2=Trapp, Sabrina|author3= Jacobs, Arthur M.|author4= Leder, Helmut|title=Pupillary responses in art appreciation: Effects of aesthetic emotions.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2009|volume=3|issue=3|pages=156–163|doi=10.1037/a0014464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But new psychophysilogical methods of measuring emotional response are beginning to be used, such as the measurement of pupillary response.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses have been predicted to indicate image pleasantness and emotional arousal, but can be confounded by luminance, and confusion between an emotion's positive or negative valence, requiring an accompanying verbal explanation of emotional state.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powell|first=W. Ryan|author2=Schirillo, James A.|title=Hemispheric laterality measured in Rembrandt's portraits using pupil diameter and aesthetic verbal judgements|journal=Cognition &amp; Emotion|date=1 August 2011|volume=25|issue=5|pages=868–885|doi=10.1080/02699931.2010.515709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pupil dilatations have been found to predict emotional responses and the amount of information the brain is processing, measures important in testing emotional response ellicted by artwork.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Further, the existence of pupillary responses to artwork can be used as an argument that art does ellicit emotional responses with physiological reactions.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; 
[[File:Juan Gris 004.jpg|thumb|An example Cubist work by Juan Gris]]

===Pupil responses to art===
After viewing Cubist paintings of varying complexity, abstraction, and familiarity, participants' pupil responses were greatest when viewing aesthetically pleasing artwork, and highly accessible art, or art low in abstraction.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; Pupil responses also correlated with personal preferences of the cubist art.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt; High pupil responses were also correlated with faster cognitive processing, supporting theories that aesthetic emotions and preferences are related to the brain's ease of processing the stimuli.&lt;ref name=Leder-pupil /&gt;

====Left-cheek biases====
[[File:Rembrandt - Minerva - WGA19246.jpg|thumb|''Minerva'' Rembrandt. Female portrait showing left-cheek orientation]]
These effects are also seen when investigating the Western preference for left-facing portraits. This skew towards left-cheek is found in the majority of Western portraits, and is rated as more pleasing than other portrait orientations.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackburn|first=Kelsey|author2=Schirillo, James|title=Emotive hemispheric differences measured in real-life portraits using pupil diameter and subjective aesthetic preferences|journal=Experimental Brain Research|date=19 April 2012|volume=219|issue=4|pages=447–455|doi=10.1007/s00221-012-3091-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories for this preference suggest that the left side of the face as more emotionally descriptive and expressive, which lets viewers connect to this emotional content better.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Pupil response tests were used to test emotional response to different types of portraits, left or right cheek, and pupil dilation was linearly related to the pleasantness of the portrait, with increased dilations for pleasant images, and constrictions for unpleasant images.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt; Left-facing portraits were rated as more pleasant, even when mirrored to appear right-facing, suggesting that people are more attracted to more emotional facial depictions.&lt;ref name=Blackburn-pupil /&gt;

This research was continued, using portraits by [[Rembrandt]] featuring females with a left-cheek focus and males with a right-cheek focus.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;  Researchers predicted Rembrandt chose to portray his subjects this way to elicit different emotional responses in his viewers related to which portrait cheek was favored.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; In comparison to previous studies, increased pupil size was only found for male portraits with a right-cheek preference. This may be because the portraits were viewed as domineering, and the subsequent pupil response was due to unpleasantness.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt; As pupil dilation is more indicative of strength of emotional response than the valence, a verbal description of emotional responses should accompany further pupillary response tests.&lt;ref name=Rembrandt /&gt;

==Art as emotional regulation==
Art is also used as an emotional regulator, most often in [[Art Therapy]] sessions. Studies have shown that creating art can serve as a method of short-term [[mood (psychology)|mood]] regulation.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drake|first=Jennifer E.|author2=Winner, Ellen|title=Confronting sadness through art-making: Distraction is more beneficial than venting.|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=1 January 2012|volume=6|issue=3|pages=255–261|doi=10.1037/a0026909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalebroux|first=Anne|author2=Goldstein, Thalia R.|author3= Winner, Ellen|title=Short-term mood repair through art-making: Positive emotion is more effective than venting|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=32|issue=4|pages=288–295|doi=10.1007/s11031-008-9105-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of regulation falls into two categories: venting and distraction.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Artists in all fields of the arts have reported emotional venting and distraction through the creation of their art.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Venting===
Venting through art is the process of using art to attend to and discharge negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; However, research has shown venting to be a less effective method of emotional regulation. Research participants asked to draw either an image related to a sad movie they just watched, or a neutral house, demonstrated less negative mood after the neutral drawing.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Venting drawings did improve negative mood more than no drawing activity.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Other research suggests that this is because analyzing negative emotions can have a helpful effect, but immersing in negative emotions can have a deleterious effect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

===Distraction===
Distraction is the process of creating art to oppose, or in spite of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; This can also take the form of fantasizing, or creating an opposing positive to counteract a negative affect.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt; Research has demonstrated that distractive art making activities improve mood greater than venting activities.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; Distractive drawings were shown to decrease negative emotions more than venting drawings or no drawing task even after participants were asked to recall their saddest personal memories.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; These participants also experienced an increase in positive affect after a distractive drawing task.&lt;ref name=Drake-venting /&gt; The change in mood valence after a distractive drawing task is even greater when participants are asked to create happy drawings to counter their negative mood.&lt;ref name=Dalebroux-venting /&gt;

'''Henri-Benjamin Constant de Rebecque''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃stɑ̃|lang}}; 25 October 1767 – 8 December 1830), or simply '''Benjamin Constant''', was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-French political activist and writer on politics and religion. He was the author of a partly biographical [[psychological novel]], ''[[Adolphe]]''.  He was a fervent [[Liberalism|liberal]]&lt;ref&gt;Craiutu, A. (2012) A Virtue for Courageous Minds: Moderation in French Political Thought, 1748–1830, pp. 199,  202–03&lt;/ref&gt; of the early 19th century, who influenced the [[Trienio Liberal]] movement in Spain, the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]] in Portugal, the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[November Uprising]] in Poland, the [[Belgian Revolution]], and [[liberalism in Brazil]] and Mexico.

==Biography==
Henri-Benjamin Constant was born in [[Lausanne]] to descendants of [[Huguenot]] Protestants who had fled from [[Artois]] to Switzerland during the [[Huguenot Wars]] in the 16th century. His father, Jules Constant de Rebecque, served as a high-ranking officer in the [[Dutch States Army]], like his grandfather, his uncle and his cousin [[Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque]]. When Constant's mother died soon after his birth, both his grandmothers took care of him. Private tutors educated him in Brussels (1779) and in the Netherlands (1780). At the Protestant [[University of Erlangen]] (1783), he gained appointment to the court of [[Duchess Sophie Caroline Marie of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]]. He had to leave after an affair with a girl, and moved to the [[University of Edinburgh]]. There he lived at the home of [[Andrew Duncan, the elder]] and became friends with [[James Mackintosh]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BFVdUXEXhDYC&amp;pg=PR23 Benjamin Constant: philosophe, historien, romancier, homme d'état, p. 38]&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Malcolm Laing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805218/56461/excerpt/9780521856461_excerpt.htm |title=The Cambridge Companion to Constant |publisher=Assets.cambridge.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he left the city, he promised to pay back his gambling debts.

In 1787, he returned, traveling on horseback through England and Scotland. In those years the European nobility, with their [[prerogatives]], had come under heavy attack by those who were influenced by Rousseau's [[Discourse on Inequality]]; Constant's family criticized him when he left out part of his last name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Constant_-_Le_Cahier_rouge,_%C3%A9d._Constant_de_Rebecque.djvu&amp;page=138 |title=Cahier Rouge, p. 122 |publisher=Commons.wikimedia.org |date=2013-08-11 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Paris, at the home of [[Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Suard]] he became acquainted with [[Isabelle de Charriere]], a 46-year old Dutch woman and writer, who later helped publish Rousseau's [[Confessions (Rousseau)|Confessions]], and who knew his uncle [[David-Louis Constant de Rebecque]] extremely well by correspondence for 15 years. When he stayed at her home in [[Colombier, Neuchâtel|Colombier]] Switzerland,  they wrote an [[epistolary novel]] together. She acted as a mother to him until Constant's appointment to the court of [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] that required him to move north. He left the court when the [[War of the First Coalition]] began in 1792.

In Brunswick, he had married Wilhelmina von Cramm, but he divorced her in 1793. In September 1794, he met and became interested in the famous and rich (but married) [[Anne Louise Germaine de Staël]], brought up on the principles of Rousseau. They both admired [[Jean Lambert Tallien]] and [[Talleyrand]]. Their intellectual collaboration between 1795 and 1811 made them one of the most celebrated intellectual couples of their time.&lt;ref&gt;
Their affair resulted in one daughter [[Albertine, baroness Staël von Holstein|Albertine]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Reign of Terror]] in France (1793–1794), Constant became a defender of [[bicameralism]] and of the [[Parliament of Great Britain]]. In revolutionary France this strand of political thought resulted in the [[Constitution of the Year III]], the [[Council of Five Hundred]] and the [[Council of Ancients]]. In 1799, after [[18 Brumaire]], Constant was appointed by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] to the [[Tribunat]], but in 1802, the first consul forced him to withdraw because of his speeches and his connections with Mme de Staël.

Constant became acquainted with [[Julie Talma]], the wife of [[François-Joseph Talma]], who wrote him many letters of compelling human interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFVdUXEXhDYC&amp;lpg=PA222&amp;ots=0pQj1Zpdv4&amp;dq=Julie%20Talma%20letters%20to%20Constant&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA222#v=onepage&amp;q=Julie%20Talma%20letters%20to%20Constant&amp;f=false |title=Benjamin Constant, p. 222 |publisher=Books.google.nl |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800, the [[Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise]], an [[act of terror]], failed. In 1803, at a time when Britain and France were at peace, [[Jean Gabriel Peltier]], while living in England, argued that Napoleon should be killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etudes-revolutionnaires.org/prestashop/product.php?id_product=50 |title=Un journaliste contre-révolutionnaire, Jean-Gabriel Peltier (1760–1825) – Etudes Révolutionnaires |publisher=Etudes-revolutionnaires.org |date=2011-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000534/http://etudes-revolutionnaires.org/prestashop/product.php?id_product=50 |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer [[James Mackintosh]] defended the French refugee against a [[libel]] suit instigated by Napoleon – then [[First Consul]] of France. Mackintosh's speech was widely published in English and also across Europe in a French translation by Madame de Staël. She was forced to leave Paris.

De Staël, disappointed in French [[Rationalism]], became interested in [[German Romanticism]]. Constant moved with her and their two children to [[Weimar]]. [[Duchess Anna Amalia of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel]] welcomed them the day after their arrival. In Weimar they met [[Friedrich von Schiller]]; [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] at first hesitated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FWUBAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Goethe%20meeting%20Madame%20de%20Stael%20in%20Weimar&amp;hl=nl&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q=Goethe%20meeting%20Madame%20de%20Stael%20in%20Weimar&amp;f=false Madame De Stael and the Grand-Duchess Louise Door Madame de Stael, p. 24]&lt;/ref&gt; In Berlin, they met with [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]], and his brother, [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]]. Constant parted from de Stael and in 1806 lived in [[Rouen]] and [[Meulan]], where he started to work on his novel ''[[Adolphe]]''. In 1809, he secretly married Caroline von Hardenberg, a woman who had been divorced twice,  (she was related to [[Novalis]] and to [[Karl August von Hardenberg]]). He &lt;!--spent time gambling in [[Baden-Baden]] or in [[Göttingen]], and--&gt; moved back to Paris in 1814, where [[Louis XVIII of France]] had become king. As a member of the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]]; Constant defended the [[constitutional monarchy]]. He became friends with [[Madame Récamier]] and argued with Germaine de Staël, who had asked him to pay his debts when their daughter Albertine married [[Victor de Broglie (1785–1870)|Victor de Broglie]]. During the [[Hundred Days]] of Napoleon, who had become more liberal, Constant fled to the [[Vendée]], but returned when he was invited several times at the [[Tuileries]] in order to set up changes for the [[Charter of 1815]].

After the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (18 June 1815), Constant moved to London – not in the company of Madame Récamier, who went south, but with his wife. In 1817, back in Paris, he sat in the [[Chamber of Deputies of France|Chamber of Deputies]], the lower legislative house of the Restoration-era government. One of its most eloquent [[orator]]s, he became a leader of the parliamentary bloc first known as the ''Independants'' and later as "[[Liberalism|liberals]]". He became an opponent of [[Charles X of France]] during the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;
G. Lanson, P. Tuffrau, Manuel d'histoire de la Littérature Française, Hachette, Paris 1953&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--and was active in [[French politics]] as a publicist and politician during the latter half of the [[French Revolution]] and--&gt;
between 1815 and 1830.

In 1822, in light of Constant's political career, Goethe praised him in the following terms:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I spent many instructive evenings with Benjamin Constant. Whoever recollects what this excellent man accomplished in [later] years, and with what zeal he advanced without wavering along the path which, once chosen, was forever followed, realizes what noble aspirations, as yet undeveloped, were fermenting within him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Dennis |title=Benjamin Constant: A Biography |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1830, King [[Louis Philippe I]] gave Constant a large sum of money to pay off his debts, and appointed him to the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Conseil d'Etat]].&lt;!--Constant died in Paris on 8 December 1830.--&gt;

==Political philosophy==
{{Liberalism sidebar}}
[[image:Isabelle de Charrière - Jens Juel.gif|thumb|[[Isabelle de Charrière]], a Dutch-Swiss intellectual with whom Constant conducted an extensive correspondence]]

One of the first thinkers to go by the name of "liberal", Constant looked to Britain rather than to [[ancient Rome]] for a practical model of freedom in a large, commercial society. He drew a distinction between the "Liberty of the Ancients" and the "Liberty of the Moderns".&lt;ref name="AncientModern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uark.edu/depts/comminfo/cambridge/ancients.html |title=Constant, Benjamin, 1988, 'The Liberty of the Ancients Compared with that of the Moderns' (1819), in The Political Writings of Benjamin Constant, ed. Biancamaria Fontana, Cambridge, pp. 309–28 |publisher=Uark.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805184450/http://www.uark.edu/depts/comminfo/cambridge/ancients.html |archivedate=5 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty of the Ancients was a participatory [[republicanism|republican]] liberty, which gave the citizens the right to directly influence politics through debates and votes in the public assembly.&lt;ref name="AncientModern"/&gt;  In order to support this degree of participation, citizenship was a burdensome moral obligation requiring a considerable investment of time and energy. Generally, this required a sub-society of slaves to do much of the productive work, leaving the citizens free to deliberate on public affairs. Ancient Liberty was also limited to relatively small and homogenous societies, in which the people could be conveniently gathered together in one place to transact public affairs.&lt;ref name="AncientModern"/&gt;

The Liberty of the Moderns, in contrast, was based on the possession of [[civil liberties]], the rule of law, and freedom from excessive state interference. Direct participation would be limited: a necessary consequence of the size of modern states, and also the inevitable result of having created a commercial society in which there are no slaves but almost everybody must earn a living through work. Instead, the voters would elect [[Legislator|representatives]], who would deliberate in Parliament on behalf of the people and would save citizens from the necessity of daily political involvement.&lt;ref name="AncientModern"/&gt;

He chastised several aspects of the French Revolution, and the failures within the social and political upheaval. He stated how the French attempted to apply ancient republic liberties to the modern state. Constant realized that freedom meant drawing a line between the area of a person's private life and that of public authority.&lt;ref name="Rosenblatt 2004"&gt;Rosenblatt 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He admired the noble spirit of regeneration of the state; however, he stated that it was naïve that writers believed that two thousand years had not wrought some changes in the disposition and needs of the people. The dynamics of the state had changed: the ancient states' population paled in comparison to that of modern countries. He even argued that with a large population, man had no role in government regardless of its form or type. Constant emphasized how the citizens of the ancient state found more satisfaction in their public existence and less in their private. However, the satisfaction of modern peoples occurs in their private existence.

Constant's repeated denunciation of [[despotism]] pervaded his critique of French political philosophers [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Abbé de Mably]]. These writers, influential to the French Revolution, according to Constant mistook authority for liberty and approved any means of extending the action of authority. Reformers used the model of ancient states of public force, and organized the most absolute despotism under the name of the Republic. He continued to condemn despotism, citing the paradox of liberty derived from recourse to despotism, and the lack of substance in this ideology.

Furthermore, he pointed out the detrimental nature of the [[Reign of Terror]]; the inexplicable delirium. In [[François Furet]]'s words, Constant's "entire political thought"&lt;ref&gt;Furet 1981, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; revolved around this question, namely the problem of explaining the Terror. Constant understood the revolutionaries' disastrous over-investment in the political.&lt;ref name="Rosenblatt 2004" /&gt; The French revolutionaries such as the [[Sans-culottes]] were the primary forces in the streets. They promoted constant vigilance and a public emphasis. Constant pointed out how the most obscure life, the quietest existence, the most unknown name, offered no protection during the Reign of Terror. He also stated that each individual added to the number, and took fright in the number that he had helped increase. This [[mob mentality]] deterred many and helped to usher in new despots such as Napoleon.

Moreover, Constant believed that, in the modern world, commerce was superior to war. He attacked [[Napoleon]]'s martial appetite, on the grounds that it was illiberal and no longer suited to modern commercial social organization. Ancient Liberty tended to be warlike, whereas a state organized on the principles of Modern Liberty would be at peace with all peaceful nations.

Constant believed that if liberty were to be salvaged from the aftermath of the Revolution, then chimerical Ancient Liberty had to be reconciled with the practical and achievable Modern Liberty. England, since the [[Glorious Revolution of 1688]], and then the United Kingdom after 1707, had demonstrated the practicality of Modern Liberty and Britain was a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Constant concluded that constitutional monarchy was better suited than republicanism to maintaining Modern Liberty. He was instrumental in drafting the "Acte Additional" of 1815, which transformed Napoleon's restored rule into a modern constitutional monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/legislation/c_additional.html English Text of the Charter]&lt;/ref&gt;  This was only to last for "One Hundred Days" before Napoleon was defeated, but Constant's work nevertheless provided a means of reconciling monarchy with liberty. Indeed, the French Constitution (or Charter) of 1830 could be seen as a practical implementation of many of Constant's ideas: a hereditary monarchy existing alongside an elected Chamber of Deputies and a senatorial Chamber of Peers, with the executive power vested in responsible ministers. Thus, although often ignored in France because of his Anglo-Saxon sympathies, Constant made a profound (albeit indirect) contribution to French constitutional traditions.

Secondly, Constant developed a new theory of constitutional monarchy, in which royal power was intended to be a neutral power, protecting, balancing and restraining the excesses of the other, active powers (the executive, legislature, and [[judiciary]]). This was an advance on the prevailing theory in the English-speaking world, which, following the conventional wisdom of [[William Blackstone]], the 18th-century English [[jurist]], had reckoned the King to be head of the executive branch. In Constant's scheme, the executive power was entrusted to a Council of Ministers (or Cabinet) who, although appointed by the King, were ultimately responsible to Parliament. In making this clear theoretical distinction between the powers of the King (as [[head of state]]) and the ministers (as Executive) Constant was responding to the political reality which had been apparent in Britain for more than a century: that the ministers, and not the King, are responsible, and therefore that the King "reigns but does not rule". This was important for the development of parliamentary government in France and elsewhere. It should be noted, however, that the King was not to be a powerless cipher in Constant's scheme: he would have many powers, including the power to make judicial appointments, to dissolve the Chamber and call new elections, to appoint the [[peerage|peers]], and to dismiss ministers – but he would not be able to govern, make policy, or direct the administration, since that would be the task of the responsible ministers. This theory was literally applied in Portugal (1822) and Brazil (1824), where the King/Emperor was explicitly given "Moderating Powers" rather than executive power. Elsewhere (for example, the 1848 "Statuto albertino" of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], which later became the basis of the [[History of Italy|Italian]] constitution from 1861) the executive power was notionally vested in the King, but was exercisable only by the responsible ministers.

He defended the [[separation of powers]] as basis of a liberal State, but unlike [[Montesquieu]] and most of the liberal thinkers, he defended five powers instead of three. They were the Regal or Moderator, the [[Executive (government)|Executive]], the Representative Power of Opinion, the Representative Power of Tradition and the [[Judicial power|Judicial]], the Moderator Power was a monarch, a type judge that was not part of the government, but served as a neutral power to the government, the Executive Power was the ministers that the monarch appointed and they were, collectively, the [[head of government]], the Representative Powers were a separation of the Monstesquieu´s [[Legislative power|Legislative Power]], with the Representative Power of Opinion being an elected body to represent the opinion of the citizens and the Representative Power of Tradition was an hereditary House of Peers and the judicial was similar to the Montesquieu's Judicial Power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culver|first=John W.|last2=de Oliveira Torres|first2=Joao Camillo|date=May 1968|title=A democracia coroada. Teoria politica de Imperio do Brasil.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2510809|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=48|issue=2|pages=338|doi=10.2307/2510809|issn=0018-2168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant's other concerns included a "new type of [[federalism]]": a serious attempt to decentralize French government through the devolution of powers to elected municipal councils. This proposal reached fruition in 1831, when elected municipal councils (albeit on a narrow [[suffrage|franchise]]) were created.

The importance of Constant's writings on the liberty of the ancients has dominated understanding of his work. His wider literary and cultural writings (most importantly the novella ''Adolphe'' and his extensive histories of religion) emphasized the importance of [[self-sacrifice]] and warmth of the human emotions as a basis for social living. Thus, while he pleaded for [[individual liberty]] as vital for individual moral development and appropriate for modernity, he felt that egoism and self-interest were insufficient as part of a true definition of individual liberty. Emotional authenticity and fellow-feeling were critical. In this, his moral and religious thought was strongly influenced by the moral writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and German thinkers such as [[Immanuel Kant]], whom he read in preparing his religious history.

==Novels==
Constant published only one novel during his lifetime, ''[[Adolphe]]'' (1816), the story of a young, indecisive man's disastrous love affair with an older mistress. A first-person novel in the sentimentalist tradition, ''Adolphe'' examines the thoughts of the young man as he falls in and out of love with Ellenore, a woman of uncertain virtue. Constant began the novel as an autobiographical tale of two loves, but decided that the reading public would object to serial passions. The love affair depicted in the finished version of the novel is thought to be based on Constant's affair with Anna Lindsay, who describes the affair in her correspondence (published in the ''Revue des Deux Mondes'', December 1930 – January 1931). The book has been compared to [[Chateaubriand]]'s ''René'' or [[Mme de Stael]]'s ''Corinne''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

'''Comparative biology''' uses natural variation and disparity to understand the patterns of life at all levels—from genes to communities—and the critical role of organisms in ecosystems.  Comparative biology is a cross-lineage approach to understanding the phylogenetic history of individuals or higher [[taxa]] and the mechanisms and patterns that drives it. Comparative biology encompasses [[Evolutionary Biology]], [[Systematics]], [[Neontology]], [[Paleontology]], [[Ethology]], [[Anthropology]], and [[Biogeography]] as well as historical approaches to [[Developmental biology]], [[Genomics]], [[Physiology]], [[Ecology]] and many other areas of the biological sciences.The comparative approach also has numerous applications in human health, [[genetics]], [[biomedicine]], and [[conservation biology]]. The biological relationships (phylogenies, pedigree) are important for comparative analyses and usually represented by a [[phylogenetic tree]] or [[cladogram]] to differentiate those features with single origins ([[Homology (biology)|Homology]]) from those with multiple origins ([[Homoplasy]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12833">A '''Darwinian puzzle''' is a [[Trait (biological)|trait]] that appears to reduce the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of individuals that possess it. Such traits attract the attention of [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologists]]. Several human traits pose challenges to evolutionary thinking, as they are relatively prevalent but are associated with lower reproductive success through reduced fertility and/or longevity. Some of the classic examples include: left handedness, menopause, and mental disorders. These traits are also found in animals, a peacock shows an example of a trait that may reduce its fitness. The bigger the tail, the easier it is seen by predators and it also may hinder the movement of the peacock. Darwin, in fact, solved this "puzzle" by explaining the peacock's tail as evidence of [[sexual selection]]; a bigger tail confers evolutionary fitness on the male by allowing it to attract more females than other males with shorter tails. The phrase "Darwinian puzzle" itself is rare and of unclear origin; it's typically talked about in the context of Animal Behavior.

==Applications in nature==
Darwinian puzzles are evident in nature, even though it appears to reduce the fitness of the individual that possesses it. Different individuals use the odd phenomenon in particular ways such as toxins, fitness demonstration, and mimicry.

== Factors that affect Darwinian puzzles ==
There are a few contributing factors in biology which may affect Darwinian puzzles.
* Coefficient of relatedness (r): the percentage of genes shared by two animals.
This may be based on common descent. Animals may share 1/4, 1/2, or even in some cases all of their genes with others. Identical twins have a coefficient of relatedness of r=1. Full siblings have a coefficient of relatedness of r=.50, and half siblings and first cousins have a coefficient of relatedness of r=.25. Depending on how related two animals are, they may be more likely to act altruistically to one another. Even if it is of no benefit to themselves, it helps to promote survival of at least some of their genes as they are shared with others closely related to them. The formula to calculate coefficient of relatedness is (R&lt;sub&gt;XY&lt;/sub&gt;) = Σ (1/2)&lt;sup&gt;n.&lt;/sup&gt;
* Hamilton's rule: an explanation for when a Darwinian puzzle may evolve in a population.
Hamilton's rule is often used to explain altruism in populations based upon relatedness. It can be represented by the formula (rB &gt; C) where r represents relatedness, B represents benefit to the recipient, and C represents cost to the altruist. Animals may use Hamilton's rule in many instances where it will not promote their own fitness, but will have an evolutionary effect on the overall fitness of the species in general.

==Examples==
The following phenomena are sometimes called Darwinian puzzles:
*[[Altruism in animals]]
**&lt;u&gt;Biological altruism&lt;/u&gt;: Tends to be centered around fitness exchanges. It can also be called evolutionary or reproductive altruism. It is defined as "increasing other organisms fitness while decreasing the fitness of the actor themselves". In order for this to be true, both the loss of the "actor" and the benefit of the "recipient must be present. It is not just how the behavior affects fitness but all the other characteristics that make up fitness as well.
**&lt;u&gt;Psychological altruism&lt;/u&gt;: This is based on the intentions of the one doing the behavior. It is defined by stating that "A behavior is psychologically altruistic if and only if it is motivated by an ultimate desire for the well-being of some other organism, and as a first pass, we can say that a desire is ultimate if its object is desired for its own sake, rather than because the agent thinks that satisfying the desire will lead to the satisfaction of some other desire". An example is giving money to a charity with the intent to help others, even if the money never actually reaches that specific charity. However, if a person gives money to charity in order for others to think that they are selfless is not performing a psychologically altruistic behavior.
**&lt;u&gt;Helping altruism&lt;/u&gt;: Combines biological with psychological but is the least common of the three. It represents the reason for the behavior as well as the possible fitness outcomes because of the behavior. To best quote to explain this behavior is "we may ask whether human altruism is intrinsically or extrinsically motivated; that is, do human beings help one another because the helpful act itself is inherently rewarding or only because the helpful act is instrumental in bringing about separate outcomes such as material rewards or the avoidance of punishment?" It does not have to consist of obtaining food or helping to raise young, it can be much milder than that (helping someone else reach a personal goal).
*[[Homosexual behavior in animals|Homosexuality in animals]]
**Uganda kobs: Of the species of Ugandan kobs, the females seem to be the only gender that participates in homosexual behavior. Female kobs are often seen soliciting other females by whistling at them and/or foreleg kicking in order to delicately touch other female genitals. Foreleg kicking can also be seen in male mountain rams, who also use it in order to engage in homosexual activities with other male rams. Female kobs also participate in mounting of other females, even though they cannot reproduce from the action alone. Females that participate in the courting of other females, may even compete for certain female choices by pushing competitors with their head. This action was originally thought to be a method for females not interested in homosexual courting to say no to pursuers, but was proven to be a way to gain dominance over other kobs. Even with these homosexual behaviors female kobs still mate with male kobs, which lead scientists to believe that these actions to practice sex or excite members of the same sex are to improve their chances for future reproductive sex. (2)
**Greylag geese: Within this species of geese there are both heterosexual and homosexual couples. Male greylag geese often pair up and stay together for years, similar to male bottlenose dolphins. These males work together to find a mate and both father some of the goslings. As a result, in these relationships, goslings have three parents, a male couple and a mother. This not only benefits the growing geese, who have an extra parent to protect them, it also benefits the mother who gains a higher social status, more time to take care of the chicks and more time to find food for herself. During the time the mother is off feeding, the more dominant male fights off predators and the other stays to watch over the goslings. Once the relationship has run its course the female goose branches off while the two male geese continue through their lives together. (1)
*[[Senescence|Cellular senescence]]
*Monarch butterfly: The [[monarch butterfly]] is a species that has an orange and black wing pattern that is very easy to spot. This coloration of the monarch is non-beneficial to its fitness. It is not beneficial because the bright colors will attract their predators. However, they are able to counteract this non-beneficial trait because they have the ability to feed on poisonous milk weed which deposits potent plant poison in their tissues. Therefore, when a predator ingests them it will induce them to vomit, because of the poison within the butterflies system.  Though a monarch butterfly will be sacrificing itself through this process, it is able to help its own kind by educating their predators as to the harmfulness of eating them.  The genetically similar monarchs will then be able to survive and pass on the shared genes to the next monarch generation.
*Poisonous dart frog: The [[poison dart frog]] species (members of the Dendrobatidae genus) are another prominent example of an animal that applies to the concept of the Darwinian puzzle. The bright, conspicuous coloration of their skin is a tactic used to warn predators that they are highly toxic. The two-inch-long (five centimeters) golden poison dart frog has enough venom to kill ten grown men. Indigenous Emberá people brush the tips of their arrows across the frogs' skin to make the arrows toxic. This method is a highly effective hunting tool and has earned the frog species its name "poisonous dart frog". Scientists predict that the frogs assimilate their toxins from the prey that they eat consisting of ants and termites. The frogs demonstrate the Darwinian puzzle because of the bright coloration that would be thought to attract predators. Instead, they present themselves as a warning.
*Gazelle [[stotting]]: The Darwinian puzzle also manifests in the behavior of gazelles when they stott. They do this to advertise to predators that they are physically fit and the predator will not catch them if they choose to pursue. This is a form of predator deterrence, but at the same time it makes the gazelle more visible to the predator. There is also more caloric expenditure when the gazelle stotts which would be counter-intuitive to survival. Another Darwinian puzzle that scientists are trying to interpret is the stotting behavior of Thomson gazelles. The gazelle sacrifices its speed whilst escaping from one predator, but searches for other predators up ahead. Another potential reasoning for this stotting behavior is that it will alert their herd that a predator is nearby. Predators, such as cheetahs, realize that when a gazelle is stotting they are less likely to capture their prey so they abandon hunts. 
*Conspicuous spider web: There are orb-weaving spiders that spin webs with zigzag patterns that are clear, and visible to their prey. The visibility of the [[web decoration]] is thought to deter prey from the web, but in actuality it acts as a lure to draw the prey into it. The prey is more inclined to avoid the visible patterns and become caught in the webbing between the zigzag patterns. The spiders also use it as a form of camouflage to obscure their bodies. Studies have shown that orb-weaving spiders with ornamented webs have greater success catching prey than the unornamented web spiders.
*Mimicry: Many species have the trait known as [[mimicry]] which allows normally harmless creatures to appear dangerous. Harmless hoverflies are an example of a species that exhibits mimicry. Hoverflies mimic the look and sound of wasps. Though most of them resemble the wasps very closely, others barely pass as looking like the wasps.  In order to solve this Darwinian puzzle of why certain hoverflies do not resemble the wasps closely, Canadian researchers conducted a study.  In this study the researchers determined that larger hoverflies will closely resemble the wasps where the smaller species barely mimic them.  This was determined to be due to the larger species having a greater threat of being attacked by birds.  The smaller species do not have to worry about closely impersonating the wasps as much because the birds will not even bother to try to attack them due to their size.  Since the larger hoverflies impersonate the wasps, they will have a greater chance of surviving and will therefore increase their fitness.

'''Deicide''' is the killing (or the killer) of a [[deity|god]]. The concept may be used for any act of killing a god, including a [[life-death-rebirth deity]] who is killed and then [[Resurrection|resurrected]].

==Etymology==
The term deicide was coined in the 17th century from [[medieval Latin]] ''*deicidium'', from ''de-us'' "god" and ''-cidium'' "cutting, killing."

==New Testament accounts==
{{See also|Jewish deicide|Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|Pilate's court}}
According to the New Testament accounts, the Judean (or Jewish) authorities in Jerusalem, the [[Pharisees]], charged Jesus with [[blasphemy]], a [[List of capital crimes in the Torah|capital crime under biblical law]], and sought his execution. According to {{bibleverse||John|18:31}}, the Judean (Jewish) authorities claimed to lack the authority to have Jesus put to death, though it is doubtful what legal basis such a claim would have had; the [[Jesus Seminar]] historicity project notes for {{bibleverse||John|18:31}}: "''it's illegal for us:'' The accuracy of this claim is doubtful." in their ''Scholars Version''. Additionally, {{bibleverse||John|7:53-8:11}} records them asking [[Jesus]] about stoning the [[adulteress]] and {{bibleverse||Acts|6:12}} records them ordering the [[stoning]] of [[Saint Stephen]].

They brought Jesus to [[Pontius Pilate]], the Roman [[Prefect]] of [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]], who was hesitant and let the people decide if Jesus were to be executed. According to the Bible, Pontius Pilate only ordered Jesus to be flogged. Washing his hands, Pilate said he would not take the blame for Jesus' death, to which the crowd replied, "[[Blood curse|His blood is upon us and our children]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|27:24-25|NAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilate is portrayed in the Gospel accounts as a reluctant accomplice to Jesus' death. Modern scholars say it is most likely that a Roman Governor such as Pilate would have no problem in executing any leader whose followers posed a potential threat to Roman rule.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} It has also been suggested that the Gospel accounts may have downplayed the role of the Romans in Jesus' death during a time when Christianity was struggling to gain acceptance in the Roman world.&lt;ref&gt;''Anchor Bible Dictionary'' vol. 5. (1992) pg. 399-400. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian analysis==
{{See also|Substitutionary atonement}}
The [[Catholic Church]] and other [[Christian denominations]] suggest that Jesus' death was necessary to take away the collective sin of the human race. The crucifixion is seen as an example of Christ's eternal love for mankind and as a self-sacrifice on the part of God for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Book of Concord, [http://bookofconcord.org/creeds.php "The Three Ecumenical or Universal Creeds,"] The Book of Concord Website, n.d.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gnostic]] [[Gospel of Judas]] contends that Jesus commanded [[Judas Iscariot]] to set in motion the chain of events that would lead to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,190826,00.html "Ancient Manuscript Suggests Jesus Asked Judas to Betray Him,"] Fox News Website, Thursday, April 06, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a verse from a hymn written in 1892 for use in the [[Church of England]] to call upon God to convert the Jews to Christianity:
:Though the Blood betrayed and spilt,
:: On the race entailed a doom,
: Let its virtue cleanse the guilt,
:: Melt the hardness, chase the gloom;
: Lift the veil from off their heart,
:: Make them Israelites indeed,
: Meet once more for lot and part
:: With Thy household's genuine seed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/t/t/ttcforon.htm "Thou, the Christ Forever One"], words by [[Bill Bright|William Bright]], from ''Supplemental Hymns to [[Hymns Ancient and Modern]]'', 1889)&lt;/ref&gt;

Against certain Christian movements, some of which rejected the use of [[Hebrew Scripture]], Augustine countered that God had chosen the [[Jews]] as a special people,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diarmaid MacCulloch]]. ''[[The Reformation: A History]]'' (Penguin Group, 2005) p 8.&lt;/ref&gt; and he considered the scattering of Jewish people by the Roman Empire to be a fulfillment of prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', book 18, chapter 46.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected homicidal attitudes, quoting part of the same prophecy, namely "Slay them not, lest they should at last forget Thy law" (Psalm 59:11). Augustine, who believed Jewish people would be converted to Christianity at "the end of time", argued that God had allowed them to survive their dispersion as a warning to Christians; as such, he argued, they should be permitted to dwell in Christian lands.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. (1999) ''The Spanish Inquisition'', Stroud, pp. 33–35, {{ISBN|0752417703}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment sometimes attributed to Augustine that Christians should let the Jews "survive but not thrive" (it is repeated by author [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]] in his book ''Constantine's Sword'', for example)&lt;ref&gt;James Carroll, ''Constantine's Sword'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1864878,00.html Paula Fredriksen, interviewed by David Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"] in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], December 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is apocryphal and is not found in any of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen interviewed by Van Biema, "Was Saint Augustine Good for the Jews?"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epistemological realism''' is a philosophical position, a subcategory of [[objectivism (philosophy)|objectivism]], holding that what you know about an object exists independently of your mind. It opposes [[epistemological idealism]].

Epistemological realism is related directly to the [[correspondence theory of truth]], which claims that the world exists independently and innately to our perceptions of it. Our sensory data then reflect or correspond to the innate world.

The term '''''face''''' [[idiom]]atically refers to one's own sense of [[self-image]], [[dignity]] or [[:wikt:prestige|prestige]] in social contexts. In the [[English-speaking world]] and the [[Western civilization|West]], the expression "to save face" describes the lengths that an individual may go to in order to preserve their established position in society, taking action to ensure that one is not thought badly of by his or her peers. It is a fundamental concept in the fields of [[sociology]], [[sociolinguistics]], [[semantics]], [[politeness theory]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[communication]], and [[face negotiation theory]], and translates at least somewhat equivalently into many [[world languages]], both [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and otherwise.

== Definitions ==
Although Chinese writer [[Lin Yutang]] claimed "Face cannot be translated or defined",&lt;ref name=Yutang&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yutang|first1=Lin|title=My Country and My People|date=1935|publisher=Reynal &amp; Hitchcock|location=New York|pages=199–200|ref=A John Day Book|format=Hardcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; compare these definitions:

* The term ''face'' may be defined as the positive social value a person effectively claims for himself or herself by the line others assume he or she has taken during a particular contact. Face is an image of self, delineated in terms of approved social attributes.&lt;ref name="Goffman 1955"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00332747.1955.11023008 |title=On Face-Work |journal=Psychiatry |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=213–231 |year=1955 |last1=Goffman |first1=Erving }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Face is the respectability and/or deference which a person can claim for himself or herself from others, by virtue of the relative position he or she occupies in his or her social network and the degree to which he or she is judged to have functioned adequately in that position as well as acceptably in his or her general conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Ho 1975:883{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Face is something that is emotionally invested, and that can be lost, maintained, or enhanced, and must be constantly attended to in interaction. In general, people cooperate (and assume each other's cooperation) in maintaining face in interaction, such cooperation being based on the mutual vulnerability of face.&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Levinson 1978:66{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Face is a sense of worth that comes from knowing one's status and reflecting concern with the congruency between one's performance or appearance and one's real worth.&lt;ref&gt;Huang 1987:71{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Face" means "sociodynamic valuation", a lexical hyponym of words meaning "prestige; dignity; honor; respect; status". (Carr 1993:90)
* "Face" has more meaning based on Chinese culture context.

==By country==
"The concept of face is, of course, Chinese in origin",&lt;ref&gt;Ho 1975:867{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet many languages have "face" terms that metaphorically mean "prestige; [[honor]]; [[reputation]]". The French sociologist [[Marcel Mauss]], who sociologically studied the [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] (formerly known as [[Kwakiutl]]) and [[Haida people|Haida]] nations in [[British Columbia]], Canada interpreted the [[Kwak'wala]] word ''q'elsem'' ("rotten face") meaning "stingy [[potlatch]]-giver; one who gives no feast".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Kwakiutl and Haida noblemen have the same notion of "face" as the Chinese mandarin or officer. It is said of one of the great mythical chiefs who gave no feast that he had a "rotten face". The expression is more apt than it is even in China; for to lose one's face is to lose one's spirit, which is truly the "face", the dancing mask, the right to incarnate a spirit and wear an emblem or totem. It is the veritable ''persona'' which is at stake, and it can be lost in the potlatch just as it can be lost in the game of gift-giving, in war, or through some error in ritual. (1954:38) &lt;/blockquote&gt; Michael Carr (1992, 1993) lexicographically investigated "face; prestige" [[lemma (morphology)|dictionary form]]s in Chinese, Japanese, and English. Within this sample, [[Chinese dictionary|Chinese dictionaries]] include 98 forms, e.g., ''sipo lian'' 撕破臉 ("rip up face") "have no consideration for someone's feelings"; [[Japanese dictionary|Japanese dictionaries]] list 89, e.g., ''kao o uru'' 顔を売る ("sell face") "become popular; gain influence"; and English dictionaries include 5 forms, e.g., ''lose face'' (borrowed from Chinese ''diulian'' 丟臉 "lose face"). Carr found that the Chinese and Japanese lexicons have roughly equal numbers of words for "losing face" and "saving face", while English has more for "saving face".

=== Chinese 臉面 and 面子===
Two influential Chinese authors explained "face". The Chinese writer [[Lu Xun]] referred to the American missionary [[Arthur Henderson Smith]]'s (1894:16–18) interpretation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The term "face" keeps cropping up in our conversation, and it seems such a simple expression that I doubt whether many people give it much thought. Recently, however, we have heard this word on the lips of foreigners too, who seem to be studying it. They find it extremely hard to understand, but believe that "face" is the key to the Chinese spirit and that grasping it will be like grabbing a queue twenty-four years ago [when wearing a [[queue (hairstyle)|queue]] was compulsory]&amp;nbsp;– everything else will follow. (1934, 1959:129) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lin Yutang considered the psychology of "face".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Interesting as the Chinese physiological face is, the psychological face makes a still more fascinating study. It is not a face that can be washed or shaved, but a face that can be "granted" and "lost" and "fought for" and "presented as a gift". Here we arrive at the most curious point of Chinese social psychology. Abstract and intangible, it is yet the most delicate standard by which Chinese social intercourse is regulated.&lt;ref name=Yutang /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lin refers to ''liú miànzi'' 留面子 "grant face; give (someone) a chance to regain lost honor", ''shī miànzi'' 失面子 "lose face", ''zhēng miànzi'' 爭面子 "fight for face; [[keeping up with the Joneses]]", and ''gěi miànzi'' 給面子 "give face; show respect (for someone's feelings)".

The [[Chinese language]] has three common words meaning "face":

* ''mian'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:面|面]]|p=''miàn''|w=''mien''}})
* ''lian'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:臉|臉]]|p=''liǎn''|w=''lien''}})
* ''yan'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:顏|顏]]|p=''yán''|w=''yen''}}).

'''Miàn''' 面 "face; personal esteem; countenance; surface; side" occurs in words like:

* ''miànzi'' [[wikt:面子|面子]] "face; side; reputation; self-respect; prestige, honor; social standing"
* ''miànmù'' [[wikt:面目|面目]] ("face and eyes") "face; appearance; respect; social standing; prestige; honor(only used in ancient chinese prose.Now it only means appearance)"
* ''miànpí'' 面皮 ("face skin") "facial skin; complexion; feelings; sensitivity; sense of shame"
* ''tǐmiàn'' [[wikt:體面|體面]] ("body face") "face; good looking; honor; dignity; prestige"
* ''qíngmian'' 情面 ("feelings face") "face; prestige; favor; kindness; partiality"

''Miànmù'', which occurs in the ''[[Classic of Poetry|Shijing]]'', ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'', and other [[Chinese classics]], is the oldest Chinese word for figurative "face" (Carr 1992:43). David Yau-fai Ho (1974:241) describes ''tǐmiàn'' as "an expression without an exact equivalent in English", meaning "the social front, the ostensible display of one's social standing to the public. It is both a prerogative and an implicit obligation for the socially prominent to be particular about." ''Miànzi'' is a measurable and quantifiable concept of "face". Face, Hsien-chin Hu says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;can be borrowed, struggled for, added to, padded, — all terms indicating a gradual increase in volume. It is built up through initial high position, wealth, power, ability, through cleverly establishing social ties to a number of prominent people, as well as through avoidance of acts that would cause unfavorable comment. (1944:61) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Liǎn''' 臉 "face; countenance; respect; reputation; prestige" is seen in several "face" words:

* ''liǎnshàng'' 臉上 ("face on/above") "one's face; honor; respect"
* ''liǎnmiàn'' 臉面 ("face face") "face; self-respect; prestige; influence"
* ''liǎnpí'' 臉皮 ("face skin") "face; sensitivity; compassion"

While the use of the word "''miàn''" is more common outside [[Mainland China]], in [[China PRC]], it is the word "''liǎn''" 臉 that is more commonly used.

Hu (1944:51-52) contrasts ''méiyǒu liǎn'' 沒有臉 ("without face") "audacious; wanton; shameless" as "the most severe condemnation that can be made of a person" and ''bùyào liǎn'' 不要臉 ("don't want face") "shameless; selfishly inconsiderate" as "a serious accusation meaning that ego does not care what society thinks of his character, that he is ready to obtain benefits for himself in defiance of moral standards".

Note that [[Cantonese]] uses 面 instead of 臉. However, Chinese people generally use the term 臉子 more commonly when speaking in [[Mandarin Chinese]] ([[Putonghua]]).

'''Yán''' 顏 "face; prestige; reputation; honor" occurs in the common expression ''diū yán'' 丟顏 and the words:

* ''yánhòu'' 顏厚 ("face thick") or ''hòuyán'' 厚顏 "thick-skinned; brazen; shameless; impudent"
* ''yánmiàn'' 顏面 ("face face") "face; honor; prestige"

Chinese uses ''yán'' less often in expressing "face; prestige" than either ''miàn'' or ''liǎn''.

Carr (1992:58–60) summarizes four common Chinese lexical patterns for "face" words. First, the lexicon antithetically modifies all three "face" words with ''hòu'' 厚 "thick; deep; great" and ''báo'' or ''bó'' 薄 "thin; slight; weak" to describe "(in)sensitivity to prestige", for example, ''miànpí hòu'' 面皮厚 "thick-skinned; shameless" and ''miànpí báo'' 面皮薄 "thin-skinned; diffident". Second, owing to the importance of the visible face, ''kàn'' 看 "see; look" meaning "have consideration for" and ''bùhǎokàn'' 不好看 "not good looking" describe "face". Third, several expressions reciprocally describe ''yǒu'' 有 "having" or ''méiyǒu'' 沒有 "not having" "face", such as ''dàjiā yǒu miànzi'' 大家沒有面子 "everybody has mutual honor" and ''méiyǒu miànzi'' "lacking prestige". Fourth, "losing face" can be expressed with the common "lose" verb ''shī'' 失 and the rarer ''diū'' 丟, for instance, ''shī miànzi'' 失面子 and ''diū miànzi'' 丟面子 "lose face; lose prestige".

Recent studies of Chinese "face" have principally accepted Hu Hsien-chin's original distinction between a person's ''miànzi'' "social status" and ''lián'' "moral character".&lt;ref&gt;Hu 1944:45{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; dichotomized ''miànzi'' as "a reputation achieved through getting on in life, through success and ostentation" versus ''liǎn'' which "represents the confidence of society in the integrity of ego's moral character, the loss of which makes it impossible for him to function properly within the community". Ho qualified this dichotomy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;although the distinction between the two sets of criteria for judging face&amp;nbsp;– based on judgments of character and, broadly, of the amoral aspects of social performance – is justified, it cannot be anchored to a linguistic distinction between the two terms, ''lien'' and ''mien-tzu'', as proposed by Hu. However, we may continue to use these terms in the senses that Hu has defined.&lt;ref&gt;1975:868{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the basis of experiments showing that Chinese high school students defined losses of ''miànzi'' and ''liǎn'' interchangeably, while university students distinguished them, Huang Shuanfan concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Succinctly, among college subjects, loss of ''mianzi'' is more definitely tied to failure to measure up to one's sense of self-esteem or to what is expected by others, whereas loss of ''lian'' is closely tied to transgression of social codes. Hu's (1944) forty-year-old distinction between the two Chinese concepts of faces appears to stand very well, even today. (1987:73) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Liǎn'' is the confidence of society in a person's moral character, while ''miànzi'' represents social perceptions of a person's prestige. For a person to maintain face is important with Chinese social relations because face translates into power and influence and affects [[Goodwill (business)|goodwill]]. A loss of ''lian'' would result in a loss of trust within a [[social network]], while a loss of ''miànzi'' would likely result in a loss of [[authority]].

Two "face"-related concepts in [[Chinese social relations]] are "[[guanxi|guānxi]]" 關係 ("connections; relationships") and [[ganqing|gǎnqíng]] 感情 ("feelings") .

=== English ===
The English [[semantic field]] for "face" words meaning "prestige; honor" is smaller than the corresponding Chinese field, but historical dictionaries more accurately record its history. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (2nd ed., 1989) documents how the English community in China originated ''lose face'' and ''save face'' in the late 19th century, and how [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] variants like ''face-saver'' subsequently developed.

''[[wikt:lose face|Lose face]]'' is a linguistic [[calque]] from Chinese ''diūliǎn'' 丟臉 "lose face". The ''OED2'' '''Face 10''' definition distinguishes meanings between native '''10a. ''' "Outward show; assumed or factitious appearance; disguise, pretence; an instance of this; a pretext" (for instance, ''to put a good face on'') and borrowed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''10b. ''' '''to save one's face''': see '''save''' v. '''8f'''; also '''to save face'''; '''to lose face''' [tr. Chinese ''diu lien'']: to be humiliated, lose one's credit, good name, or reputation; similarly, '''loss of face'''. Hence ''face'' = reputation, good name. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Sir Robert Hart, 1st Baronet|Robert Hart]] originally translated ''lose face'' in a January 23, 1876 [[Zongli Yamen]] customs memorandum, "The Inspector General's Memorandum Concerning Commercial Relations" (Appendix II in Hart 1901:182-251).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The country begins to feel that Government consented to arrangements by which China has lost face; the officials have long been conscious that they are becoming ridiculous in the eyes of the people, seeing that where a foreigner is concerned they can neither enforce a Chinese right, nor redress a Chinese grievance, even on Chinese soil. (1901:225)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Loss of face'' occurs in ''[[The Times]]'' (August 3, 1929): "Each wishes to concede only what can be conceded without loss of 'face'."

''[[Wikt:save face|Save face]]'' was coined from ''lose face'' applying the semantic [[opposite (semantics)|opposition]] between ''[[Wikt:lose|lose]]'' and ''[[Wikt:save|save]]'' [tr. Chinese ''保面子／bǎo miànzi／guard/save face''; when successful, it's called "保住面子／bǎozhu miànzi /saved/guarded face "].

''OED'' defines '''Save 8''' "To keep, protect or guard (a thing) from damage, loss, or destruction", and elaborates,
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''8f. ''' '''to save one's face''': to avoid being disgraced or humiliated. Similarly, '''to save (another's) face'''. Hence '''save-face''' adj. = ''face-saving'' … Originally used by the English community in China, with reference to the continual devices among the Chinese to avoid incurring or inflicting disgrace. The exact phrase appears not to occur in Chinese, but ‘to lose face’ (''diu lien''), and ‘for the sake of his face’, are common. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
For the earliest usage examples, the ''OED'' gives the following. ''Save one's face'' is recorded in the ''[[Westminster Gazette]]'' (April 5, 1898): "Unquestionably the process of saving one's face leads to curious results in other countries than China." ''Save-face'' is found in ''[[Chambers Journal of Literature, Science and Arts]]'' (1917): "The civilian native staff had bolted at the first sign of trouble, 'going to report to the authorities' being their 'save face' for it!" ''Face-saving'' first appears in Enoch A. Bennett's ''Lilian'' (1922): "She had been trapped beyond any chance of a face-saving lie." ''Face-saver'', defined as "something that 'saves one's face', " originated in [[Edgar Snow]]'s ''Scorched Earth'' (1941): "As a face-saver, however, Doihara was given enough support, from the Kwantung Army in Manchuria." Carr (1993:74) notes, "It is significant that the earliest usages for English ''lose face'', ''save face'', ''save-face'' and ''face-saver'' refer to China, while later ones are more international in application."

By expanding "lose face" into "save face", English developed oppositely from Chinese, which has many "lose face" [[collocation]]s, but none literally meaning "save face". ''Yào miànzi'' 要面子 "eager to gain reputation; be concerned about appearances" is (Hu 1944:58) "the closest Chinese approximation" for "save face".

The underlying reason for this difference is that English "face" lacks the sociological contrast between Chinese ''liǎn'' and ''miànzi''. Since Chinese ''liǎn'' is ethically absolute while ''miànzi'' is socially quantitative, losing the former is more significant. According to Huang:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The fact that Chinese lexicalizes losing face (丟臉, 沒面子), but not gaining face is a potent reminder that losing face has far more serious implications for one's sense of self-esteem or decency than gaining face. (1987:71) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Ho explains how "losing" one's "face" is more sociodynamically significant than "saving" it. &lt;blockquote&gt;Previous writers on face have treated losing face and gaining face simply as if they were opposite outcomes in a social encounter and have thus failed to notice the basic difference between two social processes that are involved. In the first instance, while it is meaningful to speak of both losing and gaining ''mien-tzu'' it is meaningful to speak only of losing ''lien''. One does not speak of gaining ''lien'' because, regardless of one's station in life, one is expected to behave in accordance with the precepts of the culture; correctly conceptualized, exemplary conduct adds not to one's ''lien'', but to one's ''mien-tzu''. (1975:870) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
"Losing face" brings into question one's moral decency and societal adequacy, but not "gaining face".

The ''lose'' verb in ''lose face'' means "fail to maintain" (cf. ''lose one's life''), while the ''save'' in ''save face'' means "avoid loss/damage" (cf. ''save one's honor''). "The English creation of ''save face'' as the opposite of ''lose face'' was arbitrary because ''lose'' has other antonyms: ''win'', ''find'', ''keep'', ''catch'', ''maintain'', ''preserve'', ''gain'', and ''regain''", Carr (1993:77) notes, "Speakers occasionally use the last three (esp. ''gain'') regarding ''face'' 'prestige', though less frequently than ''save''". Another usage example is ''[[Wikt:give face|give face]]'', which is included in the [[Wiktionary]] but not the ''OED2''.

Among the [[List of English words of Chinese origin|English words of Chinese origin]], ''lose face'' is an uncommon [[verb phrase]] and a unique [[semantic loan]] translation. Most Anglo-Chinese borrowings are [[noun]]s (Yuan 1981:250), with a few exceptions such as ''[[kowtow|to kowtow]]'', ''[[Shanghaiing|to Shanghai]]'', ''[[brainwashing|to brainwash]]'', and ''lose face''. English ''face'' meaning "prestige; honor" is the only case of a Chinese [[semantic loan]]. Semantic loans extend an indigenous word's meaning in conformity with a foreign model (e.g., French ''realiser'' "achieve; create; construct" used in the sense of English ''realize''). The vast majority of English words from Chinese are ordinary [[loanwords]] with regular phonemic adaptation (e.g., ''[[chop suey]]'' &lt; Cantonese ''tsap-sui'' [[Wikt:雜碎|雜碎]] "miscellaneous pieces"). A few are [[calque]]s where a borrowing is blended with native elements (e.g., ''chopsticks'' &lt; Pidgin ''chop'' "quick, fast" &lt; Cantonese ''kap'' [[Wikt:急|急]] "quick" + ''stick''). ''Face'' meaning "prestige" is technically a "loan synonym" owing to semantic overlap between the native English meaning "outward semblance; effrontery" and the borrowed Chinese meaning "prestige; dignity".

John Orr (1953) coined the term "invisible exports" to describe how French ''forme'', ''ouverte'', and ''courir'' borrowed the sports meanings of English ''form'', ''open'', and ''run''. Chinese ''lose face'' is an imperceptible English import because it appears to be a predictable semantic extension of ''face'', and not a noticeable foreign borrowing. This invisible ''face'' "prestige; status" loan is, Chan and Kwok (1985:60) explain, "so firmly established in the English vocabulary that the average native speaker is unaware of its Chinese origin."

When ''face'' acquired its Chinese sense of "prestige; honor", it filled a [[lexical gap]] in the English lexicon. Chan and Kwok write,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chinese has supplied a specific "name" for a "thing" embodying qualities not expressed or possibly not fully expressed, by a number of terms in English. The aptness of the figurative extension has probably also played a part (1985:61-62). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Carr concludes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The nearest English synonyms of the apt figurative ''face'' are ''prestige'', ''honor'', ''respect'', ''dignity'', ''status'', ''reputation'', ''social acceptance'', or ''good name''.&lt;ref&gt;Ho 1975:874-880{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; explains how "face" is a more basic meaning than "status", "dignity", or "honor". "Prestige" appears to be semantically closest to "face", however a person can be said to have ''face'' but not ''prestige'', or vice versa. Prestige is not necessary; one can easily live without it, but hardly without "face".&lt;ref&gt;1993:87-88{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Arabic ===
In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the expression ''hafiẓa māʼ al-wajh'' ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:حفظ ماء الوجه|حفظ ماء الوجه]]}}), which literally translate as ''save the face's water'', is used to mean ''save face''.  The entire Arab culture of social and family behavior is based around Islamic concepts of dignity, or "Face", which has its basis in the social and family ranking system found in the Treatise of Rights, [[Al-Risalah al-Huquq]], Islam's primary source for social behaviors.&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"&gt;The Treatise of Rights, ''see various Chapters'' https://www.al-islam.org/treatise-rights-risalat-al-huquq-imam-zain-ul-abideen&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Persian ===
In [[Persian language|Persian]], expressions like "Aab ro rizi" ({{lang|fa|{{nq|آبروريزی}}}}) literally - ''losing the face's water'', is used to mean ''save face'' and "Dou roi" ({{lang|fa|{{nq|دورويی}}}}) (lit. two-facedness), "Ro seyahi "({{lang|fa|{{nq|روسياهی}}}}) (lit. Black-facedness) meaning "ashamed and embarrassed"  and  "Ro sepidi" ({{lang|fa|{{nq|روسپيدی}}}}) (lit. White-facedness) meaning "proud" (opposite of Ro seyahi) are used.

In Iranian culture the meaning of linguistic face is much closer to the meaning of "Personality". So Persian speakers use some strategies in saving the face or personality of each other while they communicate. The most frequent way to express face saving act is the application of first person plural pronoun "{{lang|fa|{{nq|شما}}}}" instead of first person singular "{{lang|fa|{{nq|تو}}}}". The other common way of expressing care about the face, is the indirectenss. Instead of saying "{{lang|fa|{{nq|نمک را بده به من}}}}" (pass me the salt) one can say "{{lang|fa|{{nq|می شه ازتون خواهش کنم نمک را به من بدید؟}}}}" (Can I ask you to pass me the salt?)

The entire Iranian culture of social and family behavior is based around Islamic concepts of dignity, or "Face", which has its basis in the social and family ranking system found in The Treatise of Rights, [[Al-Risalah al-Huquq]], Islam's primary source for social behaviors.&lt;ref name="al-islam.org"/&gt;  "To Ask, Listen, Know" is how Irani children learn this concept.{{explain|reason=how does this mnemonic relate to the concept?|date=October 2017}}

=== South Slavic ===
Among [[South Slavs]], especially in [[Serbo-Croatian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], the word ''obraz'' ([[Cyrillic]]: образ) is used as a traditional expression for [[honor]] and the sociological concept of face. Medieval Slavic documents have shown that the word has been used with various meanings, such as form, image, character, person, symbol, face, figure, statue, idol, guise and mask. The languages also have a derived adjective ''bezobrazan'' ([[Cyrillic]]: безобразен) "without face", used to associate [[shame]] to a person.&lt;ref name=TraianS&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoianovich|first=Traian|title=Balkan Worlds: The First and Last Europe|date=1994|publisher=M.E.

=== Thai ===
The Thai word for face is หน้า, meaning literally face. There are basically two main ways of expressing loss of face. One, เสียหน้า, [sia naa] translates literally as 'lose face.' Another term, ขายหน้า, or [khai naa], means sale of face - actual connotation is that the person who lost face did so through fault of self or through the thoughtless action of another. As in China and other regions where loss of face is important, the Thai version involves sociodynamic status.

=== Korea ===
The concept of "face" or "chemyon" ({{Korean|체면}} {{Hanja|體面}}, {{IPA-ko|/t͡ɕʰe̞mjʌ̹n/|lang}}) is extremely important in Korean culture.

== Academic interpretations ==
Figurative "face" meaning "prestige; honor; dignity" is applied across many [[academic disciplines]].

=== Sociology ===
"Face" is central to [[sociology]] and [[sociolinguistics]]. Martin C. Yang analyzed eight sociological factors in losing or gaining face: the kinds of equality between the people involved, their ages, personal sensibilities, inequality in social status, social relationship, consciousness of personal prestige, presence of a witness, and the particular social value/sanction involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Martin C.|title=A Chinese Village; Taitou, Shantung Province|date=1945|publisher=Kegan Paul Reprint|pages=167–179|edition=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] introduced the concept of "face" into [[social theory]] with his (1955) article "On Face-work: An Analysis of Ritual Elements of Social Interaction" and (1967) book ''Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior''. According to Goffman's [[dramaturgical perspective]], face is a [[mask]] that changes depending on the [[audience]] and the variety of social interaction. People strive to maintain the face they have created in social situations. They are emotionally attached to their faces, so they feel good when their faces are maintained; loss of face results in emotional pain, so in [[social interaction]]s people [[cooperation|cooperate]] by using politeness strategies to maintain each other's faces.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

"Face" is sociologically universal. People "are human", [[Joseph Agassi]] and I. C. Jarvie (1969:140) believe, "because they have face to care for – without it they lose human dignity." Ho elaborates:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The point is that face is distinctively human. Anyone who does not wish to declare his social bankruptcy must show a regard for face: he must claim for himself, and must extend to others, some degree of compliance, respect, and deference in order to maintain a minimum level of effective social functioning. While it is true that the conceptualization of what constitutes face and the rules governing face behavior vary considerably across cultures, the concern for face is invariant. Defined at a high level of generality, the concept of face is a universal.&lt;ref&gt;1976:881-2{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The sociological concept of face has recently been reanalysed through consideration of the Chinese concepts of face (mianzi and lian) which permits deeper understanding of the various dimensions of experience of face, including moral and social evaluation, and its emotional mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1440783311407692 |title=Face |journal=Journal of Sociology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=279–295 |year=2011 |last1=Xiaoying Qi }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marketing ===

According to Hu (1944), mianzi stands for 'the kind of prestige that is emphasized…a reputation achieved through getting on in life, through success and ostentation', while face is 'the respect of a group for a man with a good moral reputation: the man who will fulfill his obligations regardless of the hardships involved, who under all circumstances shows himself a decent human being'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/aa.1944.46.1.02a00040 |title=The Chinese Concepts of "Face" |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=46 |pages=45–64 |year=1944 |last1=Hu |first1=Hsien Chin }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept seems to relate to two different meanings, from one side Chinese consumers try to increase or maintain their reputation (mianzi) in front of socially and culturally significant others (e.g. friends); on the other hand, they try to defend or save face.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Mianzi is not only important to improve the consumer’s reputation in front of significant others, but rather it is also associated with feelings of dignity, honor, and pride.&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1057/s41262-018-0137-x |title=A cultural approach to brand equity: The role of brand mianzi and brand popularity in China |journal=Journal of Brand Management |year=2018 |last1=Filieri |first1=Raffaele |last2=Lin |first2=Zhibin |last3=d'Antone |first3=Simona |last4=Chatzopoulou |first4=Elena }}&lt;/ref&gt; In consumer behaviour literature, mianzi has been used to explain Chinese consumer purchasing behaviour and brand choice&lt;ref name="Filieri &amp; Lin 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.057 |title=The role of aesthetic, cultural, utilitarian and branding factors in young Chinese consumers' repurchase intention of smartphone brands |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=67 |pages=139–150 |year=2017 |last1=Filieri |first1=Raffaele |last2=Lin |first2=Zhibin |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/23476/1/23476.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; and considered it as a ‘quality’ owned by some brands. Some consumers tend to favour some brands (and their products and services) because of their capacity to enable them to 'gain' mianzi, which does not mean simply increase their reputation but also to show achievements and communicate these achievements to others in order to be more accepted in social circles, especially upper class circles.&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1108/ITP-09-2015-0230 |title=The importance of enhancing, maintaining and saving face in smartphone repurchase intentions of Chinese early adopters |journal=Information Technology &amp; People |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=629–652 |year=2017 |last1=Filieri |first1=Raffaele |last2=Chen |first2=Wenshin |last3=Lal Dey |first3=Bidit }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese consumers tend to believe that if they buy some brands it is easier to be accepted in the social circles of powerful and wealthy people. Connections are particularly important in Chinese culture as people use social connections to achieve their goals.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

However, mianzi has also an emotional facet.&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2017"/&gt; Consumer feel proud, special, honoured, even more valuable as individuals if they can afford to buy  brands that can enhance their mainzi.&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.057 |title=The role of aesthetic, cultural, utilitarian and branding factors in young Chinese consumers' repurchase intention of smartphone brands |journal=Computers in Human Behavior |volume=67 |pages=139–150 |year=2017 |last1=Filieri |first1=Raffaele |last2=Lin |first2=Zhibin |url=http://dro.dur.ac.uk/23476/1/23476.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, some branded products and services, especially those that require conspicuous consumption (e.g. smartphones, bags, shoes), are chosen because they foster feelings of pride and vanity in the owner.&lt;ref name="Filieri &amp; Lin 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2017"/&gt;

A brand that enables an individual to achieve such goals in life, in branding literature, it is labelled as 'brand mianzi', which is the capacity of a brand to provide emotions and self-enhancement to its owner.&lt;ref name="Filieri &amp; Lin 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2017"/&gt;
  
Scholars have proved that brand mianzi affects consumer purchase intentions&lt;ref name="Filieri &amp; Lin 2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2017"/&gt; and brand equity.&lt;ref name="Filieri et al 2018"/&gt;

In summary, mianzi is a cultural concept that relates to the social, emotional and psychological dimension of consumption and has an impact on consumers’ perception of their self and purchase decisions. Purchase and consumption of brands (but also other activities, like choosing a specific university), in Chinese culture, are profoundly affected by mianzi and different brands can be more or less apt to enhance or maintain mianzi, while others can cause a loss of face.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

=== Politeness theory ===
Penelope Brown and [[Stephen C. Levinson]] (1987) expanded Goffman's [[theory]] of face in their [[politeness theory]], which differentiated between [[Politeness theory#Positive and negative face|positive and negative face]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005{{full|date=November 2018}}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Positive face''' is "the positive consistent [[Self image|self-image]] or '[[Personality type|personality]]' (crucially including the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] that this self-image be appreciated and approved of) claimed by interactants"{{fact|date=November 2018}}
* '''Negative face''' is "the basic claim to territories, personal preserves, [[rights]] to non-[[distraction]]—i.e., to freedom of action and freedom from imposition"{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In human interactions, people are often forced to threaten either an addressee's positive and/or negative face, and so there are various politeness strategies to mitigate those face-threatening acts.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

===Communication theory===
Tae-Seop Lim and John Waite Bowers (1991) claim that face is the public image that a person claims for himself. Within this claim there are three dimensions. "''Autonomy face''" describes a desire to appear independent, in control, and responsible. "''Fellowship face''" describes a desire to seem cooperative, accepted, and loved. "''Competence face''" describes a desire to appear intelligent, accomplished, and capable.&lt;ref&gt;Miller 2005{{full|date=November 2018}}{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oetzel et al (2000) defined "facework" as "the communicative strategies one uses to enact self-face and to uphold, support, or challenge another person's face". In terms of [[interpersonal communication]], Facework refers to an individual’s [[Personal identity|identity]] in a [[Social reality|social world]] and how that identity is created, reinforced, diminished, and maintained in [[Communication|communicative]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/01463370009385606 |title=A typology of facework behaviors in conflicts with best friends and relative strangers |journal=Communication Quarterly |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=397–419 |year=2000 |last1=Oetzel |first1=John G. |last2=Ting‐Toomey |first2=Stella |last3=Yokochi |first3=Yumiko |last4=Masumoto |first4=Tomoko |last5=Takai |first5=Jiro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intercultural communication===
Face is central to [[intercultural communication]] or [[cross-cultural communication]]. Bert Brown explains the importance of both personal and national face in international negotiations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the most troublesome kinds of problems that arise in negotiation are the intangible issues related to loss of face. In some instances, protecting against loss of face becomes so central an issue that it swamps the importance of the tangible issues at stake and generates intense conflicts that can impede progress toward agreement and increase substantially the costs of conflict resolution. (1977:275) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In terms of [[Edward T. Hall]]'s dichotomy between [[high context culture]]s focused upon in-groups and [[low context culture]]s focused upon individuals, face-saving is generally viewed as more important in high context cultures such as China or Japan than in low-context ones such as the United States or Germany.&lt;ref name="face-saving"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Raymond|title=Negotiating Across Cultures: Communication Obstacles in International Diplomacy |year=1977|publisher=United States Inst of Peace Pr (September 1, 1991)| isbn=978-1878379085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Face-negotiation theory===
Stella Ting-Toomey developed [[Face negotiation theory|Face Negotiation Theory]] to explain cultural differences in communication and conflict resolution. Ting-Toomey defines face as
&lt;blockquote&gt;the interaction between the degree of threats or considerations one party offers to another party, and the degree of claim for a sense of self-respect (or demand for respect toward one's national image or cultural group) put forth by the other party in a given situation. (1990) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Psychology===
The [[psychology]] of "face" is another field of research. [[Wolfram Eberhard]], who analyzed Chinese "[[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]" and "[[sin]]" in terms of literary psychology, debunked the persistent myth that "face" is peculiar to the Chinese rather than a force in every human society. Eberhard noted
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is mainly in the writings of foreigners that we find the stress upon shame in Chinese society; it is they who stated that the Chinese were typically afraid of "losing their face". It is they who reported many cases of suicide because of loss of face, or of suicide in order to punish another person after one's death as a ghost, or to cause through suicide endless difficulties or even punishment to the other person. But in the Chinese literature used here, including also the short stories, I did not once find the phrase "losing face"; and there was no clear case of suicide because of shame alone. (1967:119-120) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Chinese University of Hong Kong social psychologist Michael Harris Bond observed that in Hong Kong,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the importance of having face and of being related to those who do, there is a plethora of relationship politics in Chinese culture. Name dropping, eagerness to associate with the rich and famous, the use of external status symbols, sensitivity to insult, lavish gift-giving, the use of titles, the sedulous avoidance of criticism, all abound, and require considerable readjustment for someone used to organizing social life by impersonal rules, frankness, and greater equality. (1991:59)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Political science===
"Face" has further applications in [[political science]]. For instance, [[Susan Pharr]] (1989) stressed the importance of "losing face" in Japanese [[comparative politics]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

===Semantics===
Linguists have analyzed the [[semantics]] of "face". Huang (1985, cited above) used [[prototype semantics]] to differentiate ''lian'' and ''mianzi''.{{fact|date=November 2018}} [[George Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]]'s ''[[Metaphors We Live By]]'' (1980:37) emphasizes "the face for the person" metonymy. [[Keith Allan (linguist)|Keith Allan]] (1986) extended "face" into theoretical semantics.{{fact|date=November 2018}} He postulated it to be an essential element of all language interchanges, and claimed: "A satisfactory theory of linguistic meaning cannot ignore questions of face presentation, nor other politeness phenomena that maintain the co-operative nature of language interchange."&lt;ref&gt;Huang 1986:10{{full|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gonzalo Rodriguez-Pereyra''' (born 7 August 1969) is a philosopher. He is currently a lecturer at the [[University of Oxford]], where he has the title of Professor of Metaphysics, and a Tutorial Fellow at [[Oriel College]].

Rodriguez-Pereyra has previously been a Research Fellow at [[Churchill College]], [[University of Cambridge]], Lecturer at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Lecturer at the [[University of Oxford]] and Tutorial Fellow at [[Hertford College]], and Professor at the [[University of Nottingham]] and [[Universidad Torcuato Di Tella]].

His interests are primarily in [[Metaphysics]] and the philosophy of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. His work on resemblance [[nominalism]] provides a response to that of [[David Malet Armstrong]] and grounds resemblance relations in the sort of modal realism expressed in ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]'' by [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Mumford2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Mumford|authorlink=Stephen Mumford|title=David Armstrong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i0EQAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=8 March 2011|year=2007|publisher=Acumen|isbn=978-1-84465-100-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Gregory Bateson''' (9 May 1904 – 4 July 1980) was an English [[anthropology|anthropologist]], [[social sciences|social scientist]], [[linguistics|linguist]], [[visual anthropology|visual anthropologist]], [[semiotics|semiotician]], and [[cybernetics|cyberneticist]] whose work intersected that of many other fields. In the 1940s, he helped extend [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]] to the social and behavioral sciences. He spent the last decade of his life developing a "meta-science" of [[epistemology]] to bring together the various early forms of systems theory developing in different fields of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gregory Bateson: Legacy of a Scientist | publisher=[[Prentice-Hall]] | author=Lipset, David | year=1980 | isbn=0133650561 | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Gregory_Bateson.html?id=hUSAAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings include ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'' (1972) and ''Mind and Nature'' (1979). ''Angels Fear'' (published posthumously in 1987) was co-authored by his daughter [[Mary Catherine Bateson]].

Bateson was born in [[Grantchester]] in [[Cambridgeshire|Cambridgeshire, England]], on 9 May 1904. He was the third and youngest son of (Caroline) Beatrice Durham and the distinguished geneticist [[William Bateson]]. He was named Gregory after [[Gregor Mendel]], the Austrian monk who founded the modern science of [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Koestler |first=Arthur |title = The Case of the Midwife Toad |year=1926}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The younger Bateson attended [[Charterhouse School]] from 1917 to 1921, obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[biology]] at [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], in 1925, and continued at Cambridge from 1927 to 1929.  Bateson lectured in linguistics at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1928. From 1931 to 1937, he was a Fellow of [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], spent the years before [[World War II]] in the South Pacific in [[New Guinea]] and [[Bali]] doing anthropology.  During 1936–1950, he was married to [[Margaret Mead]].&lt;ref&gt;[[NNDB]], [http://www.nndb.com/people/169/000100866/ Gregory Bateson], Soylent Communications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; At that time he applied his knowledge to the war effort before moving to the United States.

In [[Palo Alto]], California, Bateson and his colleagues [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]] and [[John Weakland|John H. Weakland]] developed the [[double bind|double-bind]] theory (see also ''[[Bateson Project]]'').&lt;ref name="Bateson, G. 1956"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Bateson |first=G. |last2=Jackson |first2=D. D. |last3=Haley |first3=J. |last4=Weakland |first4=J. |year=1956 |title=Toward a theory of schizophrenia |journal=[[Behavioral Science (journal)|Behavioral Science]] |volume=1 |issue= 4|pages=251–264 |url= |doi=10.1002/bs.3830010402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson's interest in [[systems theory]] and [[cybernetics]] forms a thread running through his work. He was one of the original members of the core group of the [[Macy conferences]] in Cybernetics, and the later set on Group Processes, where he represented the social and behavioral sciences. Bateson was interested in the relationship of these fields to [[epistemology]]. His association with the editor and author [[Stewart Brand]] helped to widen his influence. From the 1970s until his last years, a broader audience of university students and educated people working in many fields came to know his thought.

In 1956, he became a [[naturalised citizen]] of the United States. Bateson was a member of [[William Irwin Thompson]]'s [[Lindisfarne Association]]. In the 1970s, he taught at the Humanistic Psychology Institute (renamed the [[Saybrook University]]) in San Francisco;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gordon |first= Susan |chapter= Editor's Introduction |title= Neurophenomenology and Its Applications to Psychology |editor= Susan Gordon |location= New York |publisher= [[Springer Publishing]] |year= 2013 |page= xxxii |ISBN= 978-1-4614-7238-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1972 joined the faculty of [[Kresge College]] at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref&gt;Per the jacket copy of the first edition of ''Mind and Nature'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf |publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] appointed Bateson to the [[Regents of the University of California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Regents of the University of California (list) |url=http://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/_documents/pdf/regentslistb.pdf |publisher=[[University of California]] |accessdate=31 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which position he served until his death (although he resigned from the Special Research Projects committee in 1979, in opposition to the university's work on [[nuclear weapons]]). He died on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], 1980, in the guest house of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wholeearth.com/issue/2035/article/298/gregory.bateson.old.men.ought.to.be.explorers, 'Gregory Bateson: Old Men Ought to be Explorers'], [[Stephen Nachmanovitch]], ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'', Fall 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Bateson's life, according to Lipset (1982), was greatly affected by the death of his two brothers.  John Bateson (1898–1918), the eldest of the three, was killed in [[World War I]].  Martin Bateson (1900–1922), the second brother, was then expected to follow in his father's footsteps as a scientist, but came into conflict with his father over his ambition to become a poet and playwright.  The resulting stress, combined with a disappointment in love, resulted in Martin's public suicide by gunshot under the statue of [[Anteros]] in [[Piccadilly Circus]] on 22 April 1922, which was John's birthday.  After this event, which transformed a private family tragedy into public scandal, all William and Beatrice's ambitious expectations fell on Gregory, their only surviving son.&lt;ref&gt;Schuetzenberger, Anne.  ''The Ancestor Syndrome''.  New York, [[Routledge]].  1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson's first marriage, in 1936, was to American cultural anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (2007). "Gregory Bateson". Retrieved from [https://web.archive.org/web/20060413134325/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356738/Gregory-Bateson Britannica Concise], 5 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson and Mead had a daughter, [[Mary Catherine Bateson]] (born 1939), who also became an anthropologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marycatherinebateson.com |title=Mary Catherine Bateson |publisher=Mary Catherine Bateson |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson separated from Mead in 1947, and they were divorced in 1950.&lt;ref name="Mead letters"&gt;''To Cherish the Life of the World: Selected Letters of Margaret Mead''. Margaret M. Caffey and Patricia A. Francis, eds. With foreword by Mary Catherine Bateson. New York. [[Basic Books]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 he married his second wife Elizabeth "Betty" Sumner (1919–1992), the daughter of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] [[Bishop of Oregon]], [[Walter Taylor Sumner]].&lt;ref name="Findagrave"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Find a Grave]]|title=Walter Taylor Sumner|date=August 21, 2011|accessdate=2016-02-28|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/75267297}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son, John Sumner Bateson (1951-2015), as well as twins who died shortly after birth in 1953.  Bateson and Sumner were divorced in 1957, after which Bateson married his third wife, the therapist and social worker Lois Cammack (born 1928), in 1961.  They had one daughter, Nora Bateson (born 1969).&lt;ref name="Mead letters"/&gt;

Bateson was a lifelong atheist, as his family had been for several generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Gregory Bateson: mind, beauty, and the sacred earth |year=2008 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9780791474525|page=29 |author=Noel G. Charlton |quote=This was to be the last large-scale work of lifelong atheist Bateson, seeking to understand the meaning of the sacred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 novel ''Euphoria'' by [[Lily King]] is a fictionalized account of Bateson's relationships with Mead and [[Reo Fortune]] in pre-WWII New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Eakin|first1=Emily|title=Going Native: 'Euphoria,' by Lily King|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/books/review/euphoria-by-lily-king.html|accessdate=29 September 2017|work=The New York Times|date=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Where others might see a set of inexplicable details, Bateson perceived simple relationships.&lt;ref name=Tognetti2002&gt;{{cite book |last=Tognetti |first=Sylvia S. |title=Encyclopedia of Global Environmental Chang e|year=2002 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] |location=Chichester |isbn=0-471-97796-9 |pages=183–184|url=http://www.sylviatognetti.org/data/BatesonEGEC.pdf |editor=Peter Timmerman|accessdate=15 August 2012|chapter=Bateson, Gregory|quote=Instead, Bateson stressed the importance of relationships that provide the basis for organization, and that are a greater limiting factor than energy. Relationships, which are sustained through communication of information rather than by energy flows, are also important as a source of information about context and meaning.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "From Versailles to Cybernetics," Bateson argues that the history of the twentieth century can be perceived as the history of a malfunctioning relationship. In his view, the [[Treaty of Versailles]] exemplifies a whole pattern of human relationships based on betrayal and hate. He therefore claims that the treaty of Versailles and the development of [[cybernetics]]—which for him represented the possibility of ''improved'' relationships—are the only two anthropologically important events of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Bateson—Versailles–Cybernetics"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bateson |first=Gregory |title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind |pages=477–485 |url=http://www.ralphmag.org/batesonP.html |accessdate=15 August 2012 |chapter="Versailles to Cybernetics" |date=21 April 1966 |quote=This is what mammals are about. They are concerned with patterns of relationship, with where they stand in love, hate, respect, dependency, trust, and similar abstractions, vis-à-vis somebody else.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

===WWII and Office of Strategic Services career===
Although initially reluctant to join the intelligence services, Bateson served in [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] during [[World War II]] along with dozens of other anthropologists.&lt;ref name="currentconcerns.ch"&gt;Gregory Bateson and the OSS: World War II and Bateson's Assessment of Applied Anthropology, by Dr David H. Price, http://www.currentconcerns.ch/index.php?id=1110&lt;/ref&gt; He was stationed in the same offices as [[Julia Child]] (then Julia McWilliams), [[Paul Cushing Child]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conant|first1=Jennet|title=A Covert Affair Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS|date=2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of the war designing 'black propaganda' radio broadcasts. He was deployed on covert operations in Burma and Thailand, and worked in China, India, and Ceylon as well. Bateson used his theory of [[schismogenesis]] to help foster discord among enemy fighters. He was upset by his wartime experience and disagreed with his wife over whether science should be applied to social planning or used only to foster understanding rather than action.&lt;ref name="currentconcerns.ch"/&gt;

=== Early Work: New Guinea and Bali ===
Bateson's beginning years as an anthropologist were spent floundering, lost without a specific objective in mind. He began first with a trip to [[New Guinea]], spurred by mentor [[A. C. Haddon]].&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"&gt;Lipset, 1982 {{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!--Actually must need separate page numbers for each ref to Lipset 1982, so these references need to be split--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His goal, as suggested by Haddon, was to explore the effects of contact between the [[Sepik]] natives and whites.  Unfortunately for Bateson, his time spent with the [[Baining]] of New Guinea was halted and difficult. The Baining turned out to be secretive and excluded him from many aspects of their society. On more than one occasion he was tricked into missing communal activities, and they held out on their religion.&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt; He left them, frustrated. He next studied the [[Sulka language|Sulka]], another native population of New Guinea. Although the Sulka were dramatically different from the Baining and their culture much more "visible" to the observer, he felt their culture was dying, which left him feeling dispirited and discouraged.&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt;

He experienced more success with the [[Iatmul people]], another indigenous people of the [[Sepik River]] region of New Guinea. He would always return to the idea of communications and relations or interactions between and among people. The observations he made of the Iatmul allowed him to develop his concept of [[schismogenesis]]. He studied the 'naven', an honorific ceremony among the Iatmul, still continued today, that celebrates first-time cultural achievements.  The ceremony entails many antics that are normally forbidden during everyday social life.  For example, men and women reverse and exaggerate gender roles; men dress in women's skirts, and women dress in men's attire and ornaments.&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt; Additionally, certain categories of female kin smear mud in the faces of other relatives, beat them with sticks, and hurl bawdy insults.  Mothers may drop to the ground so their celebrated 'child' walks over them.  And during a male rite, a mother's brother may slide his buttocks down the leg of his honoured sister's son, a complex gesture of masculine birthing, pride, and insult, rarely performed before women, that brings the honoured sister's son to tears.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Eric Kline (2001) ''Masculinity, Motherhood and Mockery: Psychoanalyzing Culture and the Iatmul Naven Rite in New Guinea''. University of Michigan Press&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson suggested the influence of a circular system of causation, and proposed that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Women watched for the spectacular performances of the men, and there can be no reasonable doubt that the presence of an audience is a very important factor in shaping the men's behavior. In fact, it is probable that the men are more exhibitionistic because the women admire their performances. Conversely, there can be no doubt that the spectacular behavior is a stimulus which summons the audience together, promoting in the women the appropriate behavior.&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!--direct quote requires exact page--&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, the behaviour of person X affects person Y, and the reaction of person Y to person X's behaviour will then affect person X's behaviour, which in turn will affect person Y, and so on. Bateson called this the "vicious circle."&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt; He then discerned two models of schismogenesis: symmetrical and complementary.&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt; Symmetrical relationships are those in which the two parties are equals, competitors, such as in sports. Complementary relationships feature an unequal balance, such as dominance-submission (parent-child), or exhibitionism-spectatorship (performer-audience). Bateson's experiences with the Iatmul led him to publish a book in 1936 titled ''Naven: A Survey of the Problems suggested by a Composite Picture of the Culture of a New Guinea Tribe drawn from Three Points of View'' (Cambridge University Press).  The book proved to be a watershed in anthropology and modern social science.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, George (1985) A Timely Rereading of Naven: Gregory Bateson as Oracular Essayist. ''Raritan'' 12:66–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until Bateson published ''Naven,'' most anthropologists assumed a realist approach to studying culture, in which one simply described social reality. Bateson's book argued that this approach was naive, since an anthropologist's account of a culture was always and fundamentally shaped by whatever theory the anthropologist employed to define and analyse the data. To think otherwise, stated Bateson, was to be guilty of what [[Alfred North Whitehead]] called the "fallacy of misplaced concreteness."  There was no singular or self-evident way to understand the Iatmul naven rite.  Instead, Bateson analysed the rite from three unique points of view: [[Sociology|sociological]], [[Ethology|ethological]], and eidological. The book, then, was not a presentation of anthropological analysis but an epistemological account that explored the nature of anthropological analysis itself.

The sociological point of view sought to identify how the ritual helped bring about social integration. In the 1930s, most anthropologists understood marriage rules to regularly ensure that social groups renewed their alliances.  But Iatmul, argued Bateson, had contradictory marriage rules. Marriage, in other words, could not guarantee that a marriage between two clans would at some definite point in the future recur. Instead, Bateson continued, the naven rite filled this function by regularly ensuring exchanges of food, valuables, and sentiment between mothers' brothers and their sisters' children, or between separate lineages. Naven, from this angle, held together the different social groups of each village into a unified whole.

The ethological point of view interpreted the ritual in terms of the conventional emotions associated with normative male and female behaviour, which Bateson called ethos. In Iatmul culture, observed Bateson, men and women lived different emotional lives.  For example, women were rather submissive and took delight in the achievement of others; men fiercely competitive and flamboyant. During the ritual, however, men celebrated the achievement of their nieces and nephews while women were given ritual license to act raucously. In effect, naven allowed men and women to experience momentarily the emotional lives of each other, and thereby to achieve a level of psychological integration.

The third and final point of view, the eidological, was the least successful. Here Bateson endeavoured to correlate the organisation structure of the naven ceremony with the habitual patterns of Iatmul thought. Much later, Bateson would harness the very same idea to the development of the double-bind theory of schizophrenia.

In the Epilogue to the book, Bateson was clear: "The writing of this book has been an experiment, or rather a series of experiments, in methods of thinking about anthropological material." That is to say, his overall point was not to describe Iatmul culture of the naven ceremony but to explore how different modes of analysis, using different premises and analytic frameworks, could lead to different explanations of the same sociocultural phenomenon.  Not only did Bateson's approach re-shape fundamentally the anthropological approach to culture, but the naven rite itself has remained a locus classicus in the discipline.  In fact, the meaning of the ritual continues to inspire anthropological analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See, most recently, Michael Houseman and Carlo Seviri, 1998, ''Naven or the Other Self: A Relational Approach to Ritual Action'' (Leiden: Brill); Eric Kline Silverman, 2001, ''Masculinity, Motherhood and Mockery: Psychoanalyzing Culture and the Iatmul Naven Rite in New Guinea'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press); Andrew Moutu, 2013, ''Names are Thicker than Blood: Kinship and Ownership amongst the Iatmul'' (Oxford University Press).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson next travelled to [[Bali]] with his new wife [[Margaret Mead]]. They studied the people of the Balinese village Bajoeng Gede. Here, Lipset states, "in the short history of [[ethnographic]] fieldwork, film was used both on a large scale and as the primary research tool."&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt; Indeed, Bateson took 25,000 photographs of their Balinese subjects.&lt;ref name=" Harries-Jones 1995"&gt;{{cite book | author=Harries-Jones, Peter | title= A Recursive Vision: Ecological Understanding and Gregory Bateson | publisher=University of Toronto Press | year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bateson discovered that the people of Bajoeng Gede raised their children very unlike children raised in Western societies. Instead of attention being paid to a child who was displaying a climax of emotion (love or anger), Balinese mothers would ignore them. Bateson notes, "The child responds to [a mother's] advances with either affection or temper, but the response falls into a vacuum. In Western cultures, such sequences lead to small climaxes of love or anger, but not so in Bali. At the moment when a child throws its arms around the mother's neck or bursts into tears, the mother's attention wanders".&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt; This model of stimulation and refusal was also seen in other areas of the culture. Bateson later described the style of Balinese relations as stasis instead of schismogenesis.  Their interactions were "muted" and did not follow the schismogenetic process because they did not often escalate competition, dominance, or submission.&lt;ref name="Lipset 1982"/&gt;

After Bali, Bateson and Mead returned to the Sepik River in 1938, and settled into the village of Tambunum, where Bateson spent three days in the 1920s.  They aimed to replicate the Balinese project on the relationship between childraising and temperament, and between conventions of the body – such as pose, grimace, holding infants, facial expressions, etc. – reflected wider cultural themes and values.  Bateson snapped some 10,000 black and white photographs, and Mead typed thousands of pages of fieldnotes.  But Bateson and Mead never published anything substantial from this research.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Eric Kline.

London.  1973). Catherine's birth in New York on 8 December 1939 is recounted in Chapter 18.

=== Double bind ===
{{Main|Double bind}}
In 1956 in [[Palo Alto]], Bateson and his colleagues [[Donald deAvila Jackson|Donald Jackson]], [[Jay Haley]], and [[John Weakland]]&lt;ref name="Bateson, G. 1956"/&gt; articulated a related theory of schizophrenia as stemming from [[double bind]] situations. The [[double bind]] refers to a communication paradox described first in families with a schizophrenic member. The first place where double binds were described (though not named as such) was according to Bateson, in [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[The Way of All Flesh]]'' (a semi-autobiographical novel about Victorian hypocrisy and cover-up).&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, ''Steps to an ecology of mind''&lt;/ref&gt;

Full double bind requires several conditions to be met:{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

# The victim of double bind receives contradictory injunctions or emotional messages on different levels of communication (for example, love is expressed by words, and [[hate]] or detachment by nonverbal behaviour; or a child is encouraged to speak freely, but criticised or silenced whenever he or she actually does so).
# No metacommunication is possible – for example, asking which of the two messages is valid or describing the communication as making no sense.
# The victim cannot leave the communication field.
# Failing to fulfill the contradictory injunctions is punished (for example, by withdrawal of love).

The strange behaviour and speech of schizophrenics was explained by Bateson et al. as an expression of this paradoxical situation, and were seen in fact as an adaptive response, which should be valued as a cathartic and transformative experience.

The double bind was originally presented (probably mainly under the influence of Bateson's psychiatric co-workers) as an explanation of part of the [[etiology]] of [[schizophrenia]]. Currently, it is considered to be more important as an example of Bateson's approach to the complexities of communication which is what he understood it to be.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== The role of somatic change in evolution ===
According to [[Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's dictionary]] the term [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] is basically defined as the body or body cells of change distinguished from [[germplasm]] or psyche/mind. Bateson writes about how the actual physical changes in the body occur within [[evolutionary]] processes.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bateson |first=Gregory |title=The Role of Somatic Change in Evolution |date=December 1963 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=529–539 |journal=Evolution |jstor=2407104 |doi=10.2307/2407104}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes this through the introduction of the concept of "economics of flexibility".&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt; In his conclusion he makes seven statements or theoretical positions which may be supported by his ideology.

The first is the idea that although environmental stresses have theoretically been believed to guide or dictate the changes in the [[wikt:soma|soma]] (physical body), the introduction of new stresses do not automatically result in the physical changes necessary for survival as suggested by original evolutionary theory.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt; In fact the introduction of these stresses can greatly weaken the organism.   An example that he gives is the sheltering of a sick person from the weather or the fact that someone who works in an office would have a hard time working as a rock climber and vice versa.  The second position states that though "the economics of flexibility has a logical structure-each successive demand upon flexibility fractioning the set of available possibilities".&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt; This means that theoretically speaking each demand or variable creates a new set of possibilities.  Bateson's third conclusion is "that the [[genotypic]] change commonly makes demand upon the adjustive ability of the soma".&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt; This, he states, is the commonly held belief among biologists although there is no evidence to support the claim.  Added demands are made on the soma by sequential genotypic modifications is the fourth position.  Through this he suggests the following three expectations:&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt;

# The idea that organisms that have been through recent modifications will be delicate.
# The belief that these organisms will become progressively harmful or dangerous.
# That over time these new "breeds" will become more resistant to the stresses of the environment and change in [[genetics|genetic]] traits.

The fifth theoretical position which Bateson believes is supported by his data is that characteristics within an organism that have been modified due to environmental stresses may coincide with genetically determined attributes.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt; His sixth position is that it takes less economic flexibility to create somatic change than it does to cause a genotypic modification.  The seventh and final theory he believes to be supported is the idea that in rare occasions there will be populations whose changes will not be in accordance with the thesis presented within this paper.  According to Bateson, none of these positions (at the time) could be tested but he called for the creation of a test which could possibly prove or disprove the theoretical positions suggested within.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1963"/&gt;

===Ecological anthropology and cybernetics===
In his book ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'', Bateson applied [[cybernetics]] to the field of [[ecological anthropology]] and the concept of [[homeostasis]].&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bateson, Gregory | title=Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1972 | isbn=0-226-03905-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the world as a series of systems containing those of individuals, societies and ecosystems. Within each system is found competition and dependency. Each of these systems has adaptive changes which depend upon [[feedback loops]] to control balance by changing multiple variables.  Bateson believed that these self-correcting systems were conservative by controlling exponential slippage.  He saw the natural ecological system as innately good as long as it was allowed to maintain homeostasis&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt; and that the key unit of survival in evolution was an organism and its environment.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt;

Bateson also viewed that all three systems of the individual, society and ecosystem were all together a part of one supreme cybernetic system that controls everything instead of just interacting systems.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt; This supreme cybernetic system is beyond the self of the individual and could be equated to what many people refer to as God, though Bateson referred to it as Mind.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt; While Mind is a cybernetic system, it can only be distinguished as a whole and not parts. Bateson felt Mind was immanent in the messages and pathways of the supreme cybernetic system. He saw the root of system collapses as a result of [[Occidentalism|Occidental]] or [[Western culture|Western]] [[epistemology]]. According to Bateson, consciousness is the bridge between the cybernetic networks of individual, society and ecology and the mismatch between the systems due to improper understanding will result in the degradation of the entire supreme cybernetic system or Mind. Bateson thought that consciousness as developed through Occidental epistemology was at direct odds with Mind.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt;

At the heart of the matter is scientific [[hubris]]. Bateson argues that Occidental epistemology perpetuates a system of understanding which is purpose or means-to-an-end driven.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt; Purpose controls attention and narrows perception, thus limiting what comes into consciousness and therefore limiting the amount of wisdom that can be generated from the perception.  Additionally Occidental epistemology propagates the false notion that man exists outside Mind and this leads man to believe in what Bateson calls the philosophy of control based upon false knowledge.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt;

Bateson presents Occidental epistemology as a method of thinking that leads to a mindset in which man exerts an [[autocratic]] rule over all cybernetic systems.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt; In exerting his autocratic rule man changes the environment to suit him and in doing so he unbalances the natural cybernetic system of controlled competition and mutual dependency. The purpose-driven accumulation of knowledge ignores the supreme cybernetic system and leads to the eventual breakdown of the entire system. Bateson claims that man will never be able to control the whole system because it does not operate in a [[linear]] fashion and if man creates his own rules for the system, he opens himself up to becoming a slave to the self-made system due to the non-linear nature of cybernetics.  Lastly, man's technological prowess combined with his scientific hubris gives him the potential to irrevocably damage and destroy the supreme cybernetic system, instead of just disrupting the system temporally until the system can self-correct.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt;

Bateson argues for a position of humility and acceptance of the natural cybernetic system instead of scientific arrogance as a solution.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt; He believes that humility can come about by abandoning the view of operating through consciousness alone. Consciousness is only one way in which to obtain knowledge and without complete knowledge of the entire cybernetic system disaster is inevitable. The limited conscious must be combined with the unconscious in complete synthesis. Only when thought and emotion are combined in whole is man able to obtain complete knowledge. He believed that religion and art are some of the few areas in which a man is acting as a whole individual in complete consciousness.  By acting with this greater wisdom of the supreme cybernetic system as a whole man can change his relationship to Mind from one of [[schism (religion)|schism]], in which he is endlessly tied up in constant competition, to one of [[:wikt:complementarity|complementarity]].  Bateson argues for a culture that promotes the most general wisdom and is able to flexibly change within the supreme cybernetic system.&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt;

=== Other terms used by Bateson ===
*'''[[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]]'''.  Used by Bateson to refer to a third scientific methodology (along with [[Inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]) which was central to his own holistic and qualitative approach. Refers to a method of comparing patterns of relationship, and their symmetry or asymmetry (as in, for example, [[comparative anatomy]]), especially in complex organic (or mental) systems.  The term was originally coined by American Philosopher/Logician [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who used it to refer to the process by which scientific hypotheses are generated.
*'''Criteria of Mind (from ''Mind and Nature A Necessary Unity'')''':&lt;ref name="Bateson 1972"/&gt;
#Mind is an aggregate of interacting parts or components.
#The interaction between parts of mind is triggered by difference.
#Mental process requires collateral energy.
#Mental process requires circular (or more complex) chains of determination.
#In mental process the effects of difference are to be regarded as transforms (that is, coded versions) of the difference which preceded them.
#The description and classification of these processes of transformation discloses a hierarchy of [[type theory|logical types]] immanent in the phenomena.
*'''Creatura and [[Pleroma]]'''.  Borrowed from [[Carl Jung]] who applied these [[gnosis|gnostic]] terms in his "Seven Sermons To the Dead".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Jung, ''Memories, Dreams, Reflections'', Vintage Books, 1961, {{ISBN|0-394-70268-9}}, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] term [[maya (illusion)|maya]], the basic idea captured in this distinction is that meaning and organisation are projected onto the world. Pleroma refers to the non-living world that is undifferentiated by subjectivity; Creatura for the living world, subject to perceptual difference, distinction, and information.
*'''Deuterolearning'''. A term he coined in the 1940s referring to the organisation of learning, or learning to learn:&lt;ref name="Visser 2002"&gt;{{cite book | author=Visser, Max | title=Managing knowledge and action in organizations; towards a behavioral theory of organizational learning | publisher=EURAM Conference, Organizational Learning and Knowledge Management, Stockholm, Sweden | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Schismogenesis]]''' – the emergence of divisions within social groups.
* '''Information''' – Bateson defined information as "a difference which makes a difference." For Bateson, information in fact mediated [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[map–territory relation]], and thereby resolved, according to Bateson, the mind-body problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Form, Substance, and Difference'', in ''Steps to an Ecology of Mind, p. 448-466''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David A Reid |url=http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html |title=plato.acadiau.ca |publisher=plato.acadiau.ca |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204101244/http://plato.acadiau.ca/courses/educ/reid/papers/PME25-WS4/SEM.html |archivedate=4 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=author:%22Jacob%22%20intitle:%22Classification%20and%20Categorization:%20A%20Difference%20that%20...%22%20 |title=Scholar.google.com |publisher=Scholar.google.com |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuing extensions of Bateson's work ===
His daughter Mary Catherine Bateson published a joint biography of her parents (Bateson and Margaret Mead) in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, M. C. (1984). ''With a daughter's eye: A memoir of Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson''. New York: Pocket Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Bateson's legacy was reintroduced to new audiences by his daughter the filmmaker Nora Bateson, with the release of ''An Ecology of Mind'', a documentary that premiered at the [[Vancouver International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.viff.org/VIFFBLAST2010/viffaug23.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film was selected as the audience favourite with the ''Morton Marcus Documentary Feature Award'' at the 2011 [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://santacruzfilmfestival.org/2011-scff-award-winners/ |title=2011 SCFF Award Winners |publisher=Santa Cruz Film Festival |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729192322/http://santacruzfilmfestival.org/2011-scff-award-winners/ |archivedate=29 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and honoured with the 2011 ''John Culkin Award for Outstanding Praxis in the Field of Media Ecology'' by the [[Media Ecology Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/awards/2011_awards.html |title=The 2011 MEA Awards |publisher=Media-ecology.org |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bateson Idea Group (BIG) initiated a web presence in October 2010.  The group collaborated with the [[American Society for Cybernetics]] for a joint meeting in July 2012 at the [[Asilomar Conference Grounds]] in California.

The '''Hinman collator''', an early [[optical collator]], was an [[opto-mechanical]] device for comparing pairs of documents for differences in the text. Documents that appeared similar were said to “collate”. The collator resulted in rapid advances in the study of [[Literature|literary]] works.

Invented by [[Charlton Hinman]] in the late 1940s, the device used [[light bulb|lights]] and [[mirror]]s to superimpose images of the two documents so that differences in text alignment or wording stood out. This resulted in huge improvements in speed and efficiency compared to the traditional [[Cross-reference|cross-referencing]] of texts by eye.

The idea built on earlier work such as [[Carl Pulfrich|Carl Pulfrich's]] [[blink comparator]] used to help identify the former planet [[Pluto]], and Hinman's work analysing aerial photographs during [[World War II]].

Hinman used his device to compare the many slightly different impressions of the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare]]'s works. The [[printing]] and [[bookbinding]] processes used in the time of Shakespeare often resulted in variations in the pages bound into the final books, and the collator enabled Hinman to describe the exact order in which the Folios had been composited and printed. He used the collator to compare 55 different copies of the First Folio held by the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], and subsequently wrote about his findings in ''Printing and Proof-reading of the First Folio of Shakespeare'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://collation.folger.edu/2011/08/welcome-to-the-collation/ |title=Welcome to The Collation |last1=Werner |first1=Sarah |date=August 18, 2011 |website=The Collation |publisher=[[Folger Shakespeare Library]] |access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of Hinman's success, the device was purchased by a number of universities, libraries and other institutions (allegedly including the [[CIA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more compact types of collator were developed in the 1960s, the last Hinman was built in 1978. In his 2002 survey of mechanical collators, Steven Escar Smith estimates from scattered records that as many as 59 Hinman Collators were produced, 41 of these surviving at the time of his survey's publication. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The device was developed further by Randall McLeod.&lt;ref&gt;Zalewski, Daniel. [http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9706/fieldnotes.html ''Through the looking glass.''] Lingua franca, June 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bdobrzynski.jpg|thumb|Jan Góra in 2007]]

'''Jan Wojciech Góra OP''' (8 February 1948 – 21 December 2015) was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]], [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Priest]], [[Doctor of Theology]], academic and chaplain. Since 1997, he had been the organiser of the [[Lednica 2000|Polish Youth Meeting Lednica 2000]] at the [[Lednica (lake)|Lednica]] Fields. Animator for the academic chaplaincy centre "Respublica Dominicana" in [[Jamna, Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Jamna]]. Author of numerous books and articles. He was born in [[Prudnik]].

In 1966, he entered the [[Dominican Order]]; during the years 1967-1974, he studied at the Dominican College of Philosophy and Theology in [[Cracow]]. During the years 1977-1987, he was chaplain to secondary school pupils in [[Poznań]] and since 1987 he is an academic chaplain in [[Poznań]] at the Queen of the Holy Rosary church.

His first evangelising work was the annual summer youth colloquia in Ustronie-Hermanice. In 1991, he was co-organizer of the VI [[World Youth Day]]s at [[Jasna Góra]]. It was then that the words of the hymn entitled "[[Abba Ojcze]]" were composed for this meeting. During the winter of 1992, he set up the "Dom Świętego Jacka" – a chaplaincy centre on the Jamna Mountain near [[Tarnów]]. Initially the "School of Faith" started in the old building of the school and later on, due to the personal intervention of [[Pope]] [[John Paul II]], he built the Sanctuary of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] of Unfailing Hope.

In 1997, he organized for the first time the [[Lednica 2000|Polish Youth Meeting Lednica 2000]] nearby the [[Lednica Lake]] near [[Gniezno]]. Since that time youth meetings by the Fish-Gate have taken place, initially on the Eve of [[Pentecost]] and now on the first Saturday of June. Since 2004, annually, at the beginning of September, he also organizes Lednica for Seniors. He is founder of the Museum of the history of Lednica in Poznań and of the John Paul II House on the Lednica Fields. On 21 December 2015, he died at the age of 67 in [[Poznań]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://fakty.interia.pl/polska/news-nie-zyje-ojciec-jan-gora-mial-67-lat,nId,1943298 | title=Nie żyje ojciec Jan Góra.

{{Saivism}}
'''Kashmir Shaivism''' is a group of [[nondualist]] [[Tantra|Tantric]] [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] exegetical traditions from [[Kashmir]] that originated after 850 CE.&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/kashmiri/ David Peter Lawrence, ''Kashmiri Shaiva Philosophy'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term [[Trika]] was used by [[Abhinavagupta]] to represent the entire Kashmir Shaivism or to designate the [[Pratyabhijna|Pratyabhijna system]] and this was actually pan-Indian, also flourishing in [[Odisha|Oḍiśā]] and [[Mahārāṣṭra]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Christopher; Tantra Illuminated, chapter II, 
The History
of Śaiva Tantra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson, [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=RVWKClYq4TUC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;lpg=PA237&amp;dq=Pratyabhij%C3%B1a+%2B+trika&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XMtcasRsNW&amp;sig=vm9DvUxFM7HwppycoxtFWAsK96M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwim5dWp6oTdAhUEfysKHfDADRcQ6AEwBHoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pratyabhij%C3%B1a%20%2B%20trika&amp;f=false The Many Colors of Hinduism], Rutgers University Press, 2007,  page 237&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tantrāloka'', ''Mālinīślokavārttika'', and ''Tantrasāra'' of the Kashmirian [[Abhinavagupta]] (975–1025 CE) are formally an exegesis on the [[Trika|''Mālinīvijayottara Tantra'']], although they also drew heavily on the [[Kali]]-based Krama subcategory of the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kulamārga]].&lt;ref name="The Śaiva Literature."&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kashmir Shaivism claimed to supersede [[Shaiva Siddhanta]], a dualistic tradition which scholars consider normative [[Tantra|tantric]] [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. 2006. The Tantric Body. P.61&lt;/ref&gt; The Shaiva Siddhanta goal of becoming an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace) was replaced by recognizing oneself as Shiva who, in Kashmir Shaivism's monism, is the entirety of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. 2006. The Tantric Body. P.66-67, 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===''Shiva Sutras'' and ''Spandakārikā''===
Dating from around 850-900 CE, the ''Shiva Sutras'' and ''Spandakārikā'' were the first attempt from the Śākta Śaiva domain to present a non-dualistic metaphysics and gnostic soteriology in opposition to the dualistic exegesis of the [[Shaiva Siddhanta]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/hinduismofkashmirarticle.pdf "The Hinduism of Kashmir."] June 9, 2009. pg.31-32.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shiva Sutras'' appeared to [[Vasugupta]] in a dream, according to tradition. The ''Spandakārikā'' was either composed by Vasugupta or his student [[Bhatta Kallata]].&lt;ref name="Singh2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lalan Prasad Singh|title=Tantra, Its Mystic and Scientific Basis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1pz28mw2zywC&amp;pg=PA9|year=2010|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=978-81-8069-640-4|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Parmeshwaranand2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|title=Encyclopaedia of the Śaivism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4xIBNmhpXcC&amp;pg=PA32|year=2004|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|isbn=978-81-7625-427-4|pages=32–}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Dyczkowski|1987|p=21}}

===Lineage===
Somananda, the first theologian of monistic Shaivism, was the teacher of Utpaladeva, who was the grand-teacher of [[Abhinavagupta]], who in turn was the teacher of  Ksemaraja.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. 1996. An Introduction to Hinduism. P.164-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. 2006. The Tantric Body. P.66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abhinavagupta===
The ''[[Tantrāloka]]'', ''Mālinīślokavārttika'', and ''[[Tantrasāra]]'' of the Kashmirian [[Abhinavagupta]] (975–1025 CE) are formally an exegesis on the [[Trika|''Mālinīvijayottara Tantra'']], although they also drew heavily on the [[Kali]]-based Krama tradition of the [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kulamārga]].&lt;ref name="The Śaiva Literature."/&gt;

[[Jayaratha]] (1150-1200 CE) wrote a commentary on the ''[[Tantrāloka]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/sanderson_2014_the_saiva_literature_jist_kyoto_(1).pdf "The Śaiva Literature."] Journal of Indological Studies (Kyoto), Nos. 24 &amp; 25 (2012–2013), 2014, pp. 53, 59, 61, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century revival===
{{tone |section|date=July 2018}}
While there may have been yogis and practitioners quietly following the teachings, there were no major writers or publications after perhaps the 14th century. In the 20th century [[Swami Lakshman Joo]], himself a [[Kashmiri Pandit|Kashmiri Brahmin]], helped revive both the scholarly and yogic streams of Kashmir Shaivism.&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme, Revealed by Swami Lakshmanjoo&lt;/ref&gt; His contribution is enormous. He inspired a generation of scholars who made Kashmir Shaivism a legitimate field of inquiry within the academy.&lt;ref&gt;"Foreword", Lance E. Nelson in Self Realization in Kashmir Shaivism, John Hughes, pp.xxii-iv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Consciousness is Everything, The Yoga of Kashmir Shaivism, Swami Shankarananda pp. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Acharya Rameshwar Jha]], a disciple of Swami Lakshman Joo, is often credited with firmly establishing the roots of Kashmir Shaivism in the learned community of [[Varanasi]]. Rameshwar Jha with his extraordinary creativity, innate familiarity with the ancient texts and personal experiences  was able to provide easy access to abstruse concepts of non dualistic Kashmir Shaivism to the layman and scholars alike.  His original writings of Sanskrit verses have been compiled and published as books ''Purnta Pratyabhijna''&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Pratyabhijna Press Varanasi, Publishers Arun Krishna Joshi, Vijay Krishna Joshi, Nichi bag Varanasi&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Samit Swatantram''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Nor should the contribution of [[Muktananda|Swami Muktananda]] be overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Lal Ded: The great Kashmiri Saint-poetess, Proceedings of the National Seminar Conducted by Kashmir Education, Culture and Science Society. p12&lt;/ref&gt; While himself not belonging to the direct lineage of Kashmir Shaivism, Muktananda felt a great affinity for the teachings which were validated by his own direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Play of Consciousness – A Spiritual Autobiography, Swami Muktananda, p117&lt;/ref&gt; He encouraged and endorsed [[Motilal Banarsidass]] to publish [[Jaideva Singh]]'s translations of Shiva Sutras, Pratyabhijnahrdayam, Spanda Karikas and Vijnana Bhairava.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Durgananda,‘To See the World Full of Saints’ in Meditation Revolution, Brooks, Durgananda et al, pp96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras – The Yoga of Supreme Identity, Jaideva Singh p iv&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced Kashmir Shaivism to a wide audience of western meditators through his writings and lectures on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Swami Durgananda, ‘To See the World Full of Saints’ in Meditation Revolution, Brooks, Durgananda et al, pp.96-97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Secret of the Siddhas, Swami Muktananda, Chapters 9-37&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra]]'', a chapter from the ''[[Rudrayamala Tantra]]'', was introduced{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} to the West by [[Paul Reps]], a student of Lakshman Joo. Reps brought the text to wider attention by including an English translation in his popular book ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]''. Cast as a discourse between the god [[Shiva]] and his consort [[Devi]] or [[Shakti]], it briefly presents 112 meditation methods or centering techniques (''[[dharana]]''s).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Reps, ''Zen Flesh, Zen Bones, A Collection of Zen and Pre-Zen Writings'' ({{ISBN|0-8048-0644-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
{{Advaita}}
To attain ''moksha'', ''sādhana'' or spiritual practice is necessary. Kashmir Shaivism describes four methods (''upāya''-s):&lt;ref name="KM339-350"&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, The Central Philosophy of Tantrism, Kamalakar Mishra p339-350&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''āṇavopāya'', the method of the body, 
# ''śaktopāya'', the method of the mind, 
# ''śāmbhavopāya'', the method of Consciousness, 
# ''anupāya'' the ‘methodless’ method.

===''Āṇavopāya'' - purification of the body===
While most other paths observe offering incense and external objects to the deity, this path takes on to offering breaths. The individual controls his heart and pulse by reducing it significantly. The final stage is renouncing consumption of food and water. As a result, he/she connects the state of the supreme in the form of Shiva which results in purification of the body and generation of ojas.&lt;ref name="KM339-350" /&gt;

===Kaula===
{{Main|Kaula (Hinduism)}}
Although domesticated into a householder tradition, Kashmir Shaivism recommended a ''secret'' performance of Kaula practices in keeping with its heritage. This was to be done in seclusion from public eyes, therefore allowing one to maintain the appearance of a typical householder.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. 2006. The Tantric Body. P.14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:A stone carving of Shiva and Parvati.jpg|thumb|right|262px|A stone carving of Shiva and [[Parvati]], associated with [[Shakti]].]]

Tantric scholar-practitioner Christopher Wallis outlines the philosophical view of non-dual Shaiva Tantra thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All that exists, throughout all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects within the field of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, is the result of the natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the reality of a universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.&lt;ref&gt;Wallis, Christopher; Tantra Illuminated, chapter I, 1
The Philosophy of Nondual Śaiva Tantra&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pratyabhijñā philosophy===
{{main|Pratyabhijna}}
The nondual or monistic philosophy of Kashmir Shaivism is called [[Pratyabhijna]]. Ksemaraja, the student of [[Abhinavagupta]], extended this philosophy to a broad range of tantric Saiva texts.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Alexis. [http://www.alexissanderson.com/uploads/6/2/7/6/6276908/hinduismofkashmirarticle.pdf "The Hinduism of Kashmir."] June 9, 2009. pg.32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aham, the Heart of Śiva===
{{Main|Aham (Kashmir Shaivism)}}
''Aham'' is the concept of supreme reality as heart. It is considered to be a non-dual interior space of Śiva, support for the entire manifestation,&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, [[Jaideva Singh]], page 194&lt;/ref&gt; supreme mantra&lt;ref&gt;''{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}'', Jaideva Singh, page 180&lt;/ref&gt; and identical to Śakti.&lt;ref&gt;{{IAST|Parā-trīśikā Vivaraṇa}}, Jaideva Singh, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with Advaita Vedanta===
Kashmir Shaivism and [[Advaita Vedanta]] are both non-dual philosophies that give primacy to Universal Consciousness (''Chit'' or ''Brahman'').&lt;ref&gt;Jaideva Singh (2008), ''Pratyãbhijñahṛdayam: The Secret of Self-Recognition'', Moltilal Banarsidass, 2008 p.24-26&lt;/ref&gt; In Kashmir Shaivism, all things are a manifestation of this Consciousness,{{sfn|Dyczkowski|1987|p=44}} but the phenomenal world (''Śakti'') is real, existing and having its being in Consciousness (''Chit'').&lt;ref&gt;Ksemaraja, trans. by Jaidev Singh, Spanda Karikas: The Divine Creative Pulsation, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, p.119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
As a monistic [[Tantras|tantric]] system, [[Trika]] Shaivism, as it is also known, draws teachings from [[shrutis]], such as the monistic ''[[Vijnana Bhairava Tantra|Bhairava Tantras]]'', [[Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta]], and also a unique version of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|{{IAST|Bhagavad Gītā}}]]'' which has a commentary by [[Abhinavagupta]], known as the ''[[Gitartha Samgraha]]''. Teachings are also drawn from the ''Tantrāloka'' of Abhinavagupta, prominent among a vast body of ''[[smritis]]'' employed by Kashmir Shaivism.

In general, the whole written tradition of Shaivism can be divided in three fundamental parts: ''Āgama Śāstra'', ''Spanda Śāstra'' and ''Pratyabhijñā Śāstra''.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Shaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pag. IX&lt;/ref&gt;

1. ''[[Āgama (Hinduism)|Āgama]] Śāstra'' are those writings that are considered as being a direct revelation from Siva. These writings were first communicated orally, from the master to the worthy disciple. They include essential works such as ''{{IAST|Mālinīvijaya Tantra}}'', ''{{IAST|Svacchanda Tantra}}'', ''{{IAST|Vijñāna Bhairava Tantra}}'', ''{{IAST|Netra Tantra}}'', ''{{IAST|Mṛgendra Tantra}}'', ''{{IAST|Rudrayāmala Tantra}}'', ''[[Shiva Sutras (Kashmir Shaivism)|{{IAST|Śivasūtra}}]]'' and others. There are also numerous commentaries to these works, ''{{IAST|Śivasūtra}}'' having most of them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Trika Shaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pag. X&lt;/ref&gt;

2. ''{{IAST|Spanda Śāstra}}'', the main work of which is ''{{IAST|Spanda Kārikā}}'' of [[Bhatta Kallata]], a disciple of [[Vasugupta]], with its many commentaries. Out of them, two are of major importance: ''{{IAST|Spanda Sandoha}}'' (this commentary talks only about the first verses of ''{{IAST|Spanda Kārikā}}''), and ''{{IAST|Spanda Nirṇaya}}'' (which is a commentary of the complete text).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

3. ''Pratyabhijñā Śāstra'' are those writings which have mainly a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] content. Due to their extremely high spiritual and intellectual level, this part of the written tradition of Shaivism is the least accessible for the uninitiated. Nevertheless, this corpus of writings refer to the simplest and most direct modality of spiritual realization. ''Pratyabhijñā'' means "recognition" and refers to the spontaneous recognition of the divine nature hidden in each human being ([[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]). The most important works in this category are: ''{{IAST|Īśvara Pratyabhijñā}}'', the fundamental work of [[Utpaladeva]], and ''{{IAST|Pratyabhijñā Vimarśinī}}'', a commentary to ''{{IAST|Īśvara Pratyabhijñā}}''. ''{{IAST|Īśvara Pratyabhijñā}}'' means in fact the direct recognition of the Lord (''Īśvara'') as identical to one's Heart. Before ''Utpaladeva'', his master ''Somānanda'' wrote ''{{IAST|Śiva Dṛṣṭi}}'' (''The Vision of Siva''), a [[:wikt:devotional|devotional]] [[poem]] written on multiple levels of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;The Trika Shaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pag. XI&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knowledge enterprise''', also named as knowledge company or knowledge-intensive company, or enterprise. According  to D. Jemielniak, origin, and scope of this term is unclear. How this can be understood depends on how much company  depends on knowledge, that in such a configuration, should be  a critical asset of organization. There is no agreement on how knowledge-intensive (to what extent) companies should be to be named like so. However, there are some hints to distinguish knowledge companies, since in economies, there are two groups of companies, of which one is labor-intensive, and another knowledge intensive.&lt;ref&gt;Praca oparta na wiedzy: praca w przedsiębiorstwach wiedzy na przykładzie organizacji high-tech, Wydawnictwa Akademickie i Profesjonalne, Akademia Leona Koźmińskiego, Warszawa 2008, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergence of knowledge enterprises ==
According to Jemielniak, knowledge enterprises have emerged due to changes in the global economy, which throughout decades has been giving greater priorities to services. The emergence of knowledge companies is also called as a symptom of the third industrial revolution where boundaries between owners of production resources, and workers. On the example of IBM it can be seen that such a change have influenced the structure of income of companies. In 1924, IBM’s profits were generated by leasing of manufacturing equipment in 96%, while punched cards were responsible for 4% of the profit. In 1970’s, 80% of profit came from equipment divisions, 15% from software division and 5% from services. In 1990’s services contributed to 30% of IBM’s profits, later in 2007 it was already 45% that the company had earned from rendering services, and 20% from software. This example only reflects the overall change, that is manifested by the reversed proportion between [[Tangible asset|tangible]] and [[intangible asset]]s of companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem, pp. 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt; This evolution has forced a shift in the access to these resources from manual to non-manual (knowledge) workers. Also decision making power is handed in top-down, from owners, and top managers to mid-managers and specialists. These developments accompany the emergence and  growing importance of knowledge enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem, pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification of knowledge enterprises ==
Knowledge enterprises, according to Lowendahl, can  be divided into:
*Client-based companies, which in terms of strategic concentration are client-oriented, which resources are controlled individually, and example industries that can be mentioned are law offices and accounting bureaus,
*Problem solving-oriented companies, which strategic concentration is focused on creative problem solving, and innovation, their resources allocated on team basis, example industries: advertising companies, software development companies,
*Output-based companies, which strategic concentration is based on adaptability and application of already existing solutions, resources are allocated by the organization, 
and example companies are: management consultancy companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem, pp. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;
In another approach knowledge companies are divided into professional service companies, and research and development companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ibidem, pp. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tools of knowledge enterprises ==
Knowledge enterprises, due to their high-tech profile, chiefly have to base on IT technologies, including hardware and [[software]] to conduct managerial processes, and to organize working environments for all the staff, from executive to top management. This is why software development is crucial for existence and evolution of such companies. Software applications are developed for many areas within such organizations, since without them it is difficult to control, and coordinate work that is dedicated to innovation, and problem solving.

== Knowledge enterprises and brain drain ==
The main reason of ‘drain brain’ phenomenon and involvement of knowledge companies into it, is a great gap between educational infrastructure in the origin countries that IT professionals can get (but it is not limited to this profession), and low wages that they can be proposed  in the origin country. The problem is that educational infrastructure in the  transition countries (Central and Eastern Europe) does not actually  have to catch-up with the counterparts in knowledge-based economies, like the United States.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gerbasi, D. Latusek, Cultural Differences in Trust in High-Tech International Business Ventures: The Case of a US-Poland Cooperation, [in:] D. Jemielniak, A. Marks,  (eds.), Managing Dynamic Technology-Oriented Businesses: High Tech Organizations and Workplaces, Business Science Reference – IGI Global, Hershey 2012, pp. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; However salaries of the knowledge workers in both groups of countries differ very much. Knowledge-intensive companies from knowledge-based economies may propose much better incentives to have them move and work for them. This is the reason why human resources from transition countries are drained to those countries, that are characterized by the salary competitive advantage.

== Books ==
Van Mensvoort has co-authored numerous books and publications.
* ''Next Nature: Nature Changes Along With Us'',&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archief.nrc.nl/index.php/2011/November/25/Boeken/b01/Techtuur+heeft+de+toekomst/check=Y |title=Techtuur heeft de toekomst |publisher=Archief.nrc.nl |date=November 25, 2011 |accessdate=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited and designed by Koert van Mensvoort and [[Hendrik-Jan Grievink]]. The book examines people’s notion of nature and how the image of nature as static, balanced and harmonic is naive and up for reconsideration. Where technology and nature are traditionally seen as opposed, they now appear to merge or even trade places.

'''Lawrence Pearsall Jacks''' (9 October 1860 – 17 February 1955), abbreviated '''L. P. Jacks''' was an English educator, philosopher, and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister who rose to prominence in the period from [[World War I]] to [[World War II]].

==Early life==
Jacks was born on 9 October 1860 in [[Nottingham]]. In 1882, he enrolled in [[Manchester College, Oxford|Manchester New College]] (which then was in London). After graduating with a M.A. in 1886, he spent a year at [[Harvard University]], where he studied with the philosopher [[Josiah Royce]].&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt; In 1887, he became assistant minister to [[Stopford Brooke (chaplain)|Stopford Brooke]] in his chapel in  [[Bloomsbury]], London. He served as assistant minister for a year, and then accepted a position as Unitarian minister for [[Renshaw Street Unitarian Chapel]] in Liverpool.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt;

In 1889 Jacks married Olive Brooke, the daughter of Stopford Brooke. They had six children together.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt; During this time, Jacks' circle of associates included [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name="dobe"&gt;Richard Aldrich and Peter Gordon, ''Dictionary of British Educationists''. London: Woburn, 1989. {{ISBN|0-7130-4011-4}} (p. 129)&lt;/ref&gt; Jacks was appointed minister for the [[Church of the Messiah, Birmingham]] in 1894.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt;

==Oxford==
Jacks served as Principal of Manchester College, which was by then based in [[Oxford]], from 1915 until his retirement in 1931.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt;

Jacks served as the editor of the ''[[Hibbert Journal]]'' from its founding in 1902 until 1948. Under his editorship the ''Journal'' became one of the leading forums in England for work in philosophy and religion, and introduced the work of [[Alfred Loisy]] to British readers.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt; In September 1915, he wrote in support of the war effort, citing the need to defeat German militarism and defend "the liberties of our race." His article, titled [http://fair-use.org/the-new-republic/1915/09/11/the-peacefulness-of-being-at-war "The Peacefulness of Being at War"] in ''[[The New Republic]]'', argued that the war had "brought to England a peace of mind such as she had not possessed for decades," claiming that the sense of common purpose brought on by the war had overcome social fragmentation and improved English life. Jacks was interested in [[parapsychology]] and was President for the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (1917-1918).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/jacks-lawrence-pearsall-1860-1955 "Lawrence Pearsall Jacks"]. Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the war, Jacks wrote prolifically and gained popularity as a lecturer in Britain and America. He frequently returned to the theme of militarism and the "mechanical" mindset, which he regarded as one of the greatest threats in modern life. In his ''Revolt Against Mechanism'' (1933), he wrote that "The mechanical mind has a passion for control—of everything except itself. Beyond the control it has won over the forces of nature it would now win control over the forces of society of stating the problem and producing the solution, with social machinery to correspond."&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt; He proposed [[liberal education]] and world vision as a hope for salvation from the mechanistic world, in books such as his ''Education for the Whole Man'' (1931) and his 1938 BBC Radio Lectures.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt; In his article "A Demilitarized League of Nations", ("Hibbert Journal", August 1936) Jacks argued the [[League of Nations]] should completely eschew military force.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Seeley, ''The Handbook Of Non-Violence; including [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley's]] An Encyclopedia Of Pacifism''. Westport, Conn.: L. Hill; Great Neck, N.Y.: Lakeville Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-88208-208-6}} (p. 52).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he continued to preach Unitarianism, he became increasingly critical of all forms of institutional religion and denominationalism, and refused to let his name be added to a list of Unitarian ministers published by the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]] in 1928. He accepted an invitation to preach in [[Liverpool Cathedral]] in 1933; a Convocation of the Church of England rebuked the cathedral for allowing a Unitarian to preach, igniting a controversy in the press.

Jacks published prolifically over a period of fifty years, including philosophical and visionary treatises, biographies, articles, and moral parables. He died in Oxford on 17 February 1955, at the age of 94.&lt;ref name="ar"&gt;{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Rushton |chapter=Jacks, Lawrence Pearsall |editor-first=Stuart |editor-last=Brown |title=The Dictionary Of Twentieth-Century British Philosophers |publisher=Thoemmes Continuum |year=2005 |isbn=1-84371-096-X |pages=472-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uL3UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leon Chwistek''' ([[Kraków]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 13 June 1884 – 20 August 1944, [[Barvikha]] near [[Moscow]], [[Russian SFSR|Russia]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[avant-garde]] [[Painting|painter]], theoretician of modern art, [[literary critic]], [[logician]], [[philosopher]] and [[mathematician]].

==Logic and philosophy==
Starting in 1929 Chwistek was a Professor of Logic at the [[University of Lwów]] in a position for which [[Alfred Tarski]] had also applied. His interests in the 1930s were in a general system of philosophy of science, which was published in a book translated in English 1948 as ''The Limits of Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/v078l3n714589036/ | doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2401-5_15 | title=Leon Chwistek’s Theory of Constructive Types | year=2009 | journal=The Golden Age of Polish Philosophy | pages=203–219 | last1 = Linsky | first1 = Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s-30s, many [[Europe]]an philosophers attempted to reform traditional philosophy by means of [[mathematical logic]]. Leon Chwistek did not believe that such reform could succeed. He thought that [[reality]] could not be described in one homogeneous system, based on the principles of [[formal logic]], because there was not one reality but many.

Chwistek argued against the [[axiomatic method]] by demonstrating that the extant axiomatic systems are inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;First chapter of Chwistek, ''The Limits of Science''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artist==
Chwistek developed his theory of the multiplicity of realities first with regard to the [[art]]s. He distinguished four basic types of realities, then matched them with four basic types of painting.

The four types of realities were:
:1. popular reality (common-sense realism)
:2. physical reality (constructed by physics)
:3. phenomenal reality (sensory impressions)
:4. visionary/intuitive reality (dreams, hallucinations, subconscious states).

The types of painting corresponding to the above were:
:1. [[Primitivism]]
:2. [[Realism (arts)|Realism]]
:3. [[Impressionism]]
:4. [[Futurism (art)|Futurism]]
Chwistek never intended his views to constitute a new [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] theory. He was a defender of "common sense" against metaphysics and irrational feeling. His theory of plural reality was merely an attempt to specify the various ways in which the term, “real,” is used.
 
Chwistek's fellow-artist and closest friend, [[Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], harshly criticized his  philosophical views.  Witkiewicz’s own philosophy was based on a [[Monad (philosophy)|monad]]ic character to the individual's existence, embracing a multiplicity of existences, with the world being made up of a multiplicity of Particular Existences.

'''Leslie Dewart''' (December 18, 1922 – December 20, 2009) was a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and Professor Emeritus at the  Graduate Department of Philosophy and the Centre for the Study of Religion at the [[University of Toronto]].

Dewart was born in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], in 1922, but he was raised by his mother in Cuba. Coming to Canada at the age of 19, he served in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in bomber-reconnaissance operations on the Atlantic Coast from 1942 to 1947, subsequently becoming a Canadian citizen. He then began his studies at the University of Toronto.

He was a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=John R. |year=1977 |title=Martin Heidegger's Philosophy of Religion |series=SR Supplements |volume=2 |location=Waterloo, Ontario |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |page=78 |isbn=978-0-919812-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Dewart's academic interests were wide-ranging, and evolved considerably over the course of his career. He first graduated with a BA in Honours [[Psychology]] in 1951. He then enrolled in the Graduate Department of Philosophy, receiving his MA in 1952 and his PhD quickly thereafter in 1954. He began his teaching career in Philosophy at the University of Detroit in 1954, then returned to Toronto to teach at [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|St. Michael’s College]] in its then independent Department of Philosophy from 1956 to 1968.

He was appointed to the Department of Philosophy, School of Graduate Studies in 1961. His interests in theory of knowledge and religion then led him to join the Department of Religious Studies, St. Michael’s College in 1968 to 1975, and he served in the Institute of Christian Thought there from 1969 to 1979, and the Faculty of Theology from 1968 to 1988.

Late in 1969 an investigation by the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] was convened to examine the theological opinions in Dewart's writings, particularly ''The Future of Belief''. However, no condemnatory action was taken by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Authors|last=|first=|publisher=Gale Publishing|year=1974|isbn=|location=Detroit, MI|pages=226–27, Vols. 9–12, 1st revision|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among his other appointments in the field were: Chair of the University of Toronto Combined Departments of Religious Studies (1970 to 1971), Professor in the later University of Toronto Department of Religious Studies (1975 to 1988) and the Graduate Centre for Religious Studies (1976 to 1988 – the year of his retirement). During this time, Professor Dewart strongly argued for the continuation of a place for Theology in these University divisions.

During his time in Philosophy and Religious Studies, Dewart served in editorial or advisory capacities for journals such as ''Continuum'', ''Internationale Dialog Zeitschrift'', ''Concurrence'', ''Studies in Religion – Sciences réligieuses'' and ''Journal of Ultimate Reality and Meaning''.

In the late 1970s Dewart turned his attention to the study of law, receiving the [[LLB]] from the Faculty of Law, University of Toronto in 1979, and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1981.

== Dewart's personal epilogue ==
Dewart’s obituary [Globe and Mail, 2 Jan., 2010] begins, "His plan completed.…"  These terse words beg examination of his "plan" which he had outlined as an afterword in his last book published posthumously, ''Hume's Challenge and the Renewal of Modern Philosophy.'' In the epilogue (cf. [[David Hume]]). "The Future of Philosophy," he judged that his attempts at understanding the failure of modern philosophy may or may not have succeeded. "It is not out of the question that in the future there should be other attempts, besides mine, to understand the historical causes of the failure of modern philosophy, and to attempt to remedy them. And if such attempts reach the correct conclusions that have escaped me, they should yield more adequate proposals than mine." In its intent, Dewart's purpose was not unlike like that of Edmund Husserl. Quentin Lauer notes that Husserl, "conceived it as his task to establish the method whereby phenomenological analyses and essential intuitions would be made possible, thus devoting his whole life to the development of a phenomenological program rather than to the actual carrying out of the phenomenological analyses, which he hoped would be accomplished, generation after generation, by a whole community of scholars devoting itself to the sort of method he tried to perfect during his lifetime." &lt;ref&gt;Lauer, Q. (1965:44) Phenomenology: Its Genesis and Prospect (Harper Torchbooks)&lt;/ref&gt; Dewart realized that his generation had not seen philosophy overcome the mistakes that brought it down. And returning, in this secular age, to theology or a religious faith to overcome these mistakes was not an option in Dewart’s plan for the future of philosophy. Science’s brief ascendency and profitable contribution to civilized society, which is currently waning, had not taught modern society how to wield power without doing harm to itself and the world. Philosophy needs a sound understanding of human nature to do that. However, his plan for philosophy amounted to minority viewpoint within a minority viewpoint. Regarding this minority community of philosophers, whom he referenced in his books, he wrote: "I have referred to a few of the few others who are like-minded," acknowledging, however, that their reasons for their discontent differed from his. He accepted that his recommendations for future philosophical improvement may ultimately prove useless. But, he acknowledged at the same time that reason may eventually prevail.

== Dewart's philosphical perspective. ==

'''An exercise in "Dehellenization.'''"

Western philosophy is no longer restricted to the ideas of a classical world, but may be consciously undertaken within the personal world of experience that is beginning to "dehellenize" itself. Although written as a text on political philosophy, this philosophical lesson was learned from the Cuban revolutionary experience (cf. his first book). Although not widely recognized at the time, the revolutionary experience was, in fact, a process of "dehellenization," as Dewart understands the process throughout in his writings. Thinkers will conceive of God, in a dehellenized future of thought, as an existential reality, Dewart maintains.

Western philosophy, "come of age," does not experience the world as hostile, as did the Hellenists, but rather, as stimulating and challenging and Western philosophy must dehellenize its interpretation of experience accordingly. This dehellenization requires the abandonment of scholasticism, with the subsequent development of a conscious re-conceptualization of experience. Dewart identifies the development of human conscious re-conceptualization as dehellenization, which is a positive term. It is not "un-hellenization," since dehellenization evolves out of Hellenization. Dehellenization is but the current stage within Western philosophy’s evolution, and it may not be the last.

The religious perspective motivates Dewart’s thinking, to varying degrees throughout all his works, and it is by his own words that his notion of dehellenization is expressed most succinctly.

{{quote|I am disinclined to believe in the hidden power of the immanent divinities which, as Thales thought, all things are full of. Belief in the Christian God implies, so far as I am concerned, a positive disbelief in Fate: necessity be damned, for all I care. I refuse -- let me make the religious nature of this act of un-faith clear, I refuse -- until, if ever, I should be shown otherwise, to believe the primitive superstitions that there are implicit necessities within being, that being has, as its very reality, an inner warrant to command assent, and that invisible predeterminations constitute it and make it definable as that which has an antecedent call on the intellect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion, Language and Truth|last=Dewart|first=Leslie|publisher=Herder &amp; Herder|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=162|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Dewart on Conscious Communication and Computers'''

Indeed, some people who have first hand acquaintance with speech are nevertheless so confused about what they do when they speak - and therefore when they think - that they even wonder whether computers do not think.

An eminent computer scientist once thus proposed - he was serious, and convinced many of his colleagues - that unless one could tell the difference between teleprinter exchanges between oneself and a computer, and like exchanges between oneself and another human being, one should admit that there is no essential difference between the human's and the machine's 'thinking' processes.
 
However, not a few philosophical arguments to the contrary have been comparably wide of the mark, such as those based on absence of emotion, moral sensibility, and so on, in computers. Strangely, those who raise these objections rarely point out what would be more relevant: that computers are not even alive. Objections based on the supposed differences between what the computer and what human beings can do are beside the point - which is that the computer does not perform at all any of the vital activities that the absent-minded project onto them.

This shows, however, the same absent-minded muddle that would be revealed by someone who wondered whether telephones did not speak and think (for, tinny voice aside, they are apt to give very thoughtful replies), or who reasoned that books think (since they contain and communicate thoughts). The user is not in communication with the computer, any more than the reader communicates with the book or the caller with the telephone - even when he is greeted by an answering machine. Quite as the reader. of the book communicates with the author and with himself, the user of a computer is in communication, first, with himself, using the machine to think more efficiently than otherwise, and, second, with the programmer who wrote the application, whose thinking is embodied in the program. A user may well be unable to determine whether he is in communication with other human beings through a computer or else directly. But this should be no more astonishing than the inability to determine, in like circumstances, whether one is receiving a telephone message viva voce or only a prerecorded one. Even with unlimited exchanges, the mediation of a computer could be detected only by a user who was more skilled at detecting the programmed nature of the responses than the programmer - not the computer - was at hiding it. As an abacus and a slide rule are tools wherewith the user can perform complex mathematical operations more efficiently than without, though the instruments themselves cannot so much as add one plus one, a computer is a machine for thinking, not a machine that thinks.

Evidently, those who fail to perceive the difference disregard the distinction between the activity of thinking and the contents of thought. The latter can be objectified and embodied by the thinker - through his manipulation of, say, ink and paper, sliding beads, or electric currents and magnetic fields - in visual or other signs that he (and other human beings) can understand. Only such disregard would permit their ignoring the fact that being alive and being capable of experiencing are among the indispensable prerequisites of thinking. Nor do they seem to realize that even true communication with another would not be, of itself, proof that the communicator thinks; the latter would require evidence that the communicator communicates to himself what he also communicates to his communicand.

(Cf. ''Evolution and Consciousness'', pp.&amp;nbsp;106–07.)

[In the short run the invention of the computer, and in particular of computers having what is misleadingly called ‘artificial intelligence,’ can be an asset.] This may be deemed a close parallel of the invention of phonetic writing not least of all because it may prove to be the cause of cultural changes comparable in magnitude only to the Sumerian innovation. It is already possible - though with limitations that are certain to be overcome before long - to build computers that (to put it loosely) understand spoken instructions and reply in kind, that can translate from one human language to another, that exercise judgment 'on the basis of previous experience (for instance, they offer medical diagnoses and prescribe medical procedures), and that seem to think and reason in ways that are distinguishable from the human processes only in being more reliable and exceedingly faster. Of course, a computer that takes verbal instructions and responds with intelligible vocal sounds - either in the same or in another language - discoursing on, say, medical subjects, no more understands speech or medicine than a typewriter thil1ks and then communicates its medical wisdom by typing out a medical textbook. It is the human beings who use it, and who interact by means of it, that alone perform these activities; the computer could be attributed 'artificial intelligence' only in the same metaphorical sense in which levers might be ascribed 'artificial muscle power.' Thus, using a computer that has been appropriately programmed to lend him tile skills of human medical experts, a person can produce results that surpass what he could do on his own - the very thing that a medical textbook can help him do, though on a much smaller scale.

But many people are unclear about the difference between the activity and the contents of thought; they therefore assume that 'artificial intelligence' is possible, and are inspired to create it. My point is that their not knowing better facilitates their success. For instance, they analyse human speech and thought in order to recreate these processes electronically in computers. Now, if they took into account the assertiveness of speech and thought, they would realize that the threshold requirement for producing these is some sort of self-oriented causal process - in other words, the purposiveness that is found only in living entities - and would therefore deem impossible the creation of a machine with artificial intelligence. Their unawareness of this impossibility, however, holds a paradoxical advantage: speech and thought as they mistakenly conceive them are the kind that can be electronically reproduced. In the end they do not, to be sure, create a true counterpart of the human processes; but what they actually achieve is a marvel none the less, and multiplies immeasurably the power of human beings to bring about change. Now, why should 'artificial intelligence' be created? And for what ends should it be used once it is created? These questions are not likely to be adequately answered either by scientists who are so confused about themselves that they conceive the idea of creating it, nor by the equally perplexed, eager consumers of scientific technology who defer to them.

{{italic title}}
'''''Life of Apollonius of Tyana''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Τὰ ἐς τὸν Τυανέα Ἀπολλώνιον}}) is a text in eight books written in [[Ancient Greece]] by [[Philostratus]] (c. 170 – c. 245 AD). It tells the story of [[Apollonius of Tyana]] (c. 15 – c. 100 AD), a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] philosopher and teacher.

==Contents==
The book extensively describes the alleged travels of Apollonius to [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]], [[Hispania]], [[Nubia]], [[Mesopotamia]] and [[India]]. Some scholars view it as fiction, and contend that Apollonius probably never reached any of these countries, but spent his entire life in the East of the Roman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Dzielska]], ''Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History'', Rome 1986, p. 51-84, 186-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Philostratus, his book relies on a multiplicity of sources:
 
* A book on the youth of Apollonius, written by [[Maximus of Tyre|Maximus of Aegae]]
* Memoirs written by a disciple of Apollonius, [[Damis]].
* The "Memorabilia of Apollonius of Tyana, magician and philosopher", written by a [[Moeragenes]], although Philostratus considers that account rather unreliable.
* Local knowledge from towns like [[Ephesus]], [[Tyana]], [[Aigai (Aeolis)|Aegae]], and [[Antioch]].

The eastward travel of Apollonius is described in Book I. Apollonius receives from the Parthian king [[Vardanes I of Parthia|Vardanes]] (40–47) a safe-conduct to the Parthian ruler [[Phraotes]] in India:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And with that, he showed them a letter, written to that effect, and this gave them occasion to marvel afresh at the humanity and foresight of Vardanes. For he had addressed the letter in question to the [[satrap]] of the [[Indus]], although he was not subject to his dominion; and in it he reminded him of the good service he had done him, but declared that he would not ask any recompense for the same, "for", he said, "it is not my habit to ask for a return of favors." But he said he would be very grateful, if he could give a welcome to Apollonius and send him on wherever he wished to go. And he had given gold to the guide, so that in case he found Apollonius in want thereof, he might give it him and save him from looking to the generosity of anyone else. – Book II:17 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_16.html#§16 Life of Apollonius Tyana II 17]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The description of Apollonius's visit to India is made in Book II, and particularly the visit to the city of [[Taxila]], described in chapters 20 to 24. He describes constructions of the Greek type in Taxila, probably referring to [[Sirkap]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Taxila, they tell us, is about as big as Nineveh, and was fortified fairly well after the manner of Greek cities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_16.html#§20 Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 20]&lt;/ref&gt;
I have already described the way in which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a way that if you look at them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above. – Book II:23&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_21.html#§23 Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 23]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also explains that the [[Indo-Parthian]] king of [[Taxila]], named Phraotes, speaks [[Koine Greek|Greek]] fluently, a language in which he had been educated while in exile to the east, beyond the river [[Hyphasis]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tell me, O King, how you acquired such a command of the Greek tongue, and whence you derived all your philosophical attainments in this place? – Book II:29 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_26.html#§29 Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;My father, after a Greek education, brought me to the sages at an age somewhat too early perhaps, for I was only twelve at the time, but they brought me up like their own son; for any that they admit knowing the Greek tongue they are especially fond of, because they consider that in virtue of the similarity of his disposition he already belongs to themselves. – Book II:31 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/ap-ark/apollonius/life/va_2_31.html#§31 Life of Apollonius Tyana, II 31]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Work and writing==
[[File:Marilyn McCord Adams 20070801.jpg|thumb|right|Marilyn McCord Adams speaking in 2007]]
Adams' work in philosophy focused on the philosophy of religion, especially the [[problem of evil]], philosophical theology, metaphysics and medieval philosophy. Her work on the problem of evil largely focused on what she calls "horrendous evils".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Horrendous-Goodness-Cornell-Philosophy-Religion/dp/0801486866 |title=Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God (Cornell Studies in the Philosophy of Religion) |isbn=9780801486869 |author=Marilyn McCord Adams |website=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an avowed [[universal reconciliation|Christian universalist]], believing that ultimately all will receive salvation and restoration in Christ:&lt;blockquote&gt;Traditional doctrines of [[hell]] err again by supposing either that God does not get what God wants with every human being ("God wills all humans to be saved" by God's antecedent will) or that God deliberately creates some for ruin. To be sure, many human beings have conducted their ante-mortem lives in such a way as to become anti-social persons. Almost none of us dies with all the virtues needed to be fit for heaven. Traditional doctrines of hell suppose that God lacks the will or the patience or the resourcefulness to civilize each and all of us, to rear each and all of us up into the household of God. They conclude that God is left with the option of merely human penal systems &amp;ndash; viz., liquidation or quarantine!&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Richard Beck: "[http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2007/03/christ-and-horrors-part-3-horror-defeat.html Christ and Horrors, Part 3: Horror Defeat, Universalism, and God's Reputation]", ''Experimental Theology'',  March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Meontology''' is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] study of non-being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/arsbrevis/article/viewFile/257019/344061 Schelling’s meontology and the concept of possibility in Kierkegaard]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] μή, ''me'' "non" and ὄν, ''on'' "being" (confer [[ontology]]). It refers not exactly to the study of what does not exist, but an attempt to cover what may remain outside of ontology. ''Meontology'' has a slim tradition in the West (see [[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]] and [[negative theology]]), but has always been central to the Eastern philosophies of [[Taoism]] and the later [[Buddhism]].

[[Nishida Kitaro|Nishida]] was the first to thoroughly expand the Eastern notion of nothingness in the Continental paradigm and is thus responsible for bringing to the West a clearer understanding of the Buddhist notion of non-being.

It can also be associated more recently, with the emphasis placed upon absence or deferral by both [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Jacques Derrida]].

French philosopher [[Jean-Luc Nancy]] distinguishes nothingness from nothing. He writes, “Nothingness is not nothing [''rien'']....There is no ontology without the dialectic or the paradox of a meontology....Nothing is the thing tending toward its pure and simple being of a thing.” Nothing is “the vanishing, momentary quality of the smallest amount of beingness (''étantité'').” &lt;ref&gt;Jean-Luc Nancy, ''The Creation of the World or Globalization'', (SUNY Press. Albany, 2007, pp. 102-03.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levinas on meontology==
{{importance-section|date=December 2015}}
For [[Emmanuel Levinas]], what was meontological was what had meaning beyond being, beyond ontology; for him this was the ethical, the primary demand of the other in the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter. In this sense he sought to clarify or take further some of  the issues raised by Heidegger and explicitly give ontology a secondary role to ethics rather than continue to parallel them in saying that the [[Being]] means [[wikt:cura|care]] ([[German language|German]]: ''Sorge'').

'''Nāda yoga''' (नादयोग) is an ancient Indian metaphysical system. It is equally a philosophical system, a medicine, and a form of [[yoga]]. The system's theoretical and practical aspects are based on the premise that the entire cosmos and all that exists in the cosmos, including human beings, consists of sound vibrations, called nāda.  This concept holds that it is the sound energy in motion rather than of matter and particles which form the building blocks of the cosmos.

Nada

Nāda yoga is also a reverential way to approach and respond to sound. In this context, sound [and] music carry a spiritual weight more meaningful, respectively, than what sensory properties normally provide. Sound and music are considered to play a potential medium/intermediary role to achieve a deeper unity with both the outer and inner cosmos.


Nāda yoga's use of sound vibrations and resonances are also used to pursue palliative effects on various problematic psychological and spiritual conditions. It is also employed to raise the level of awareness of the postulated energy centers called [[chakra]]. 

Music has been used by most Indian saints as an important and powerful tool in the quest for the achievement of [[nirvana]]; notable names to be mentioned here include [[Kanakadasa]], [[Thyagaraja]], [[Kabir]], [[Meerabai]], [[Namdeo]], [[Purandaradasa]] and [[Tukaram]]... Nada

==Description==
The Nāda yoga system divides music into two categories: internal music, ''anahata'', and external music, ''ahata''.  While the external music is conveyed to consciousness via sensory organs in the form of the ears, in which mechanical energy is converted to electrochemical energy and then transformed in the brain to sensations of sound, it is the [[anahata|anahata chakra]], which is considered responsible for the reception of the internal music, but not in the way of a normal sensory organ. 

The anahata concept refers to one's own personal sound vibrations, which are thought to be so closely associated with one's self and the Self that a person can not share their anahata with another human being. In other words, this inner sound is sacred and once reached will open the practitioner's chakras, which ultimately will unite the body to the divine/cosmos.

With continued sounds, a focused mind and controlled breath, the individual can, according to Nāda yoga, "listen in on" their own anahata, their own "inner sound", which can take up to nine different forms. Such a process of inner awareness and sensitivity leads to increased self-recollectedness and finally to awakening.

To concentrate on this inner sound as a support for meditation is very helpful to tame the mind, and when it has been clearly recognized, used for self-recollectedness in outer life as well. Eventually, it can be experienced as penetrating all matter and indeed vibrates eternally throughout the Creation.

In Nāda yoga, one of the main breathing sounds is ahaṃ, where each part of the word (a ha ṃ) is focused on and spoken individually. The echoes produced by each of these spoken letters is a time where the yogi should immerse herself and rest. Now, because of imbalances within the human body, Nāda yoga begins by removing the ailments and impurities by "awakening the fire in the body (jāṭhara)" (Timalsina 212) with the use of a sound resembling that of a bee. It is important to note that when the yogi/yogini is forming sounds, their mind should not wander off to other entities. 

One group to incorporate yoga, Nāda yoga specifically, and the practice of sound into the spiritual transformation is the Josmanĩ. The Josmanĩ are identified as a Sant tradition, and they are a blend of Śrī Vaiṣṇava Bhakti tradition with the Nāth Yoga tradition. Yoga is used in "personal and social transformation" (Timalsina 202). The Josmani's spiritual quest interlinks the practice of Kuṇḍali and Nāda Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Timalsina, Sthaneshwar.

In the West, detailed indications and advice have been given by [[Edward Salim Michael]] in his book : the Law of attention, Nada Yoga and the way of inner vigilance. [[Ajahn Sumedho]], from the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] also teaches the practice of this inner sound.

The condition known in western medicine as [[tinnitus]] is considered in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic medicine]] to possibly be caused by spiritual awakening to  the ''anahata.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/david-green/tinnitus---the-mystery-solved_b_4976290.html|title=Tinnitus - The Mystery Solved? {{!}} The Huffington Post|website=The Huffington Post|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary literature==
''[[Nada Bindu Upanishad]]''

''[[Shurangama Sutra]]''

The Śūraṅgama Sūtra, often spelled Shurangama Sutra or Surangama Sutra in English, is a Mahayana sutra and one of the main texts used in the Chán school in Chinese Buddhism. In the Surangama Sutra, Avalokitesvara says that he attained enlightenment through concentration on the subtle inner sound. The Buddha then praises Avalokitesvara and says that this is the supreme way to go.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How sweetly mysterious is the Transcendental Sound of Avalokiteshvara! It is the pure Brahman Sound. It is the subdued murmur of the seatide setting inward. Its mysterious Sound brings liberation and peace to all sentient beings who in their distress are calling for aid; it brings a sense of permanency to those who are truly seeking the attainment of Nirvana's Peace . . ."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All the Brothers in this Great Assembly, and you too, Ananda, should reverse your outward perception of hearing and listen inwardly for the perfectly unified and intrinsic sound of your own Mind-Essence, for as soon as you have attained perfect accommodation, you will have attained to Supreme Enlightenment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Secondary literature==

===Mantrayana===
1. [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] (1813–1899) provides an important paradigm of salience for the esoteric [[Dzogchen]] doctrine of "sound, light and rays" (Wylie: sgra 'od zer gsum) and the 'mantra' of the [[Mantrayana]] tradition in particular, Kongtrul, ''et al.'' (2005: p.&amp;nbsp;431) identifies the “primordial sound” (''nāda'') and its [[semantic field]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The primordial indestructible great vital essence (''gdod ma'i mi shigs pa'i thig le chen po''), which is the root or ground of all of cyclic life [samsara] and perfect peace [nirvana], is known as primordial (''gdod ma'') because it has no beginning or end; as indestructible (''mi shigs pa'') because it is indivisible; as vital essence (''thig le'') because it pervades the various appearances; and as great (''chen po'') because there is nothing that it does not encompass.
There are countless synonyms for the primordial indestructible great vital essence, such as "great seal" (''phyag rgya chen po, mahāmudrā''), "great bliss" (''bde ba chen po, mahāsukha''), "primordial sound" (''nāda''), "all-pervading vajra of space" (''mkha' khyab nam mkha'i rdo rje''), "ordinary awareness" (''tha mal shes pa''), "pristine awareness channel" (''ye shes kyi rtsa''), "pristine awareness wind" (''ye she kyi rlung''), "invincible ''ham''" (''gzhom med kyi ham''), "invincible vital essence" (''gzhom med kyi thig le''), "essence of enlightenment" (''sugatagarbha''), and "transcendent wisdom" (''she rab phar phyin, prajnā-pāramitā'') (CPR, f. 29a3-b2).&lt;ref&gt;Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé (author, compiler); Elio Guarisco (translator); Ingrid McLeon (translator, editor) (2005). ''The treasury of knowledge: book six, part four: Systems of Buddhist Tantra''. Ithaca, New York, USA: Snow Lion Publications. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-210-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quotation comes from the famed ''[[Sheja Dzö]]'' or 'The Treasury of Knowledge' ({{bo|t=ཤེས་བྱ་མཛོད|w=shes bya mdzod}})&lt;ref&gt;Kongtrul Lodro Taye (author, compiler); Kalu Rinpoche Translation Group (translators) (1995, 2003). ''The Treasury of Knowledge, Book One; Myriad Worlds: Buddhist Cosmology in Abhidharma, Kãlacakra, Dzog-chen''. {{ISBN|978-1-55939-188-7}}, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; a voluminous work, encyclopedic in breadth, by Jamgon Kongtrul.

2. The [[Mahasiddha]] Vinapa (The Musician) achieved [[mahamudra]] through contemplation of the unborn, unstruck sound:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With perseverance and devotion&lt;br /&gt;
I mastered the vina's errant chords;&lt;br /&gt;
but then practicing the unborn, unstruck sound&lt;br /&gt;
I, Vinapa, lost my self.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...his mastery of the "unborn, unstruck sound" made audible by eradication of concepts, judgements, comparisons and criticism that obscure cognition of the pure sound of the instrument, is accomplishment of the fulfilment process. The unstruck sound is the sound of silence and is the auditory equivalent of phenomenal emptiness. It is absolute sound; it is the potential sound of everything composed and waiting to be composed. Lost in this non-sound, the sense of self becomes infinitely diffused in emptiness.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These quotes are from p.&amp;nbsp;91 and p.&amp;nbsp;93 respectively of "Masters of Mahamudra: Songs and Histories of the Eighty-four Buddhist Siddhas" by Keith Dowman, Publisher: State University of New York Press ({{ISBN|978-0-88706-160-8}})

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5916">The '''self-model''' is the central concept in the theory of [[consciousness]] called the '''self-model theory of subjectivity''' ('''SMT'''). This concept comprises experiences of ownership, of first person perspective, and of a long-term unity of beliefs and attitudes. These features are instantiated in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. This theory is an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and explaining the phenomenology of [[consciousness]] and the self. This theory has two core contents, the phenomenal self-model (PSM) and the phenomenal model of the intentionality relation (PMIR).&lt;ref name="pmid18166398"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Metzinger T. |title=Empirical perspectives from the self-model theory of subjectivity: a brief summary with examples |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=168 |pages=215–45 |year=2008 |pmid=18166398 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(07)68018-2 |series=Progress in Brain Research |isbn=978-0-444-53050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Metzinger]] advanced the theory in his 1993 book ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell'' (Subject and self-model).&lt;ref&gt;Metzinger, T. (1993). ''Subjekt und Selbstmodell''. Paderborn: Schoningh.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the PSM==
The PSM is an entity that “actually exists, not only as a distinct theoretical entity but something that will be empirically discovered in the future- for instance, as a specific stage of the global neural dynamics in the human brain”. Involved in the PSM are three phenomenal properties that must occur in order to explain the concept of the self. The first is mineness, “a higher order property of particular forms of phenomenal content,” or the idea of ownership.&lt;ref name="Being No One"&gt;Being No One&lt;/ref&gt; The second is perspectivalness, which is “a global, structural property of phenomenal space as a whole”.&lt;ref&gt;Being No one&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, it is what is commonly referred to as the ecological self, the immovable center of perception. The third phenomenal property is selfhood, which is “the phenomenal target property” or the idea of the self over time. It is the property of phenomenal selfhood that plays the most important role in creating the fictional self and the first person perspective. Metzinger defines the first person perspective as the “existence of single coherent and temporally stable model of reality which is representationally centered around or on a single coherent and temporally stable phenomenal subject”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The first-person perspective can be non-conceptual and is autonomously active due to the constant reception of perceptual information by the brain. The brain, specifically the brainstem and hypothalamus, processes this information into representational content, namely linguistic reflections. The PSM then uses this representational content to attribute phenomenal states to our perceived objects and ourselves. We are thus what Metzinger calls naïve realists, who believe we are perceiving reality directly when in actuality we are only perceiving representations of reality. The data structures and transport mechanisms of the data are “transparent” so that we can introspect on our representations of perceptions, but cannot introspect on the data or mechanisms themselves.  These systemic representational experiences are then connected by subjective experience to generate the phenomenal property of selfhood. Subjective experience is the result of the Phenomenal Model of Intentionality Relationship (PMIR). The PMIR is a “conscious mental model, and its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation”.&lt;ref name="Being No One"/&gt; The model is a result of the combination of our unique set of sensory receptors that acquire input, our unique set of experiences that shape connections within the brain, and our unique positions in space that give our perception perspectivalness.

==Role of the prefrontal cortex==
The prefrontal cortex is implicated in all the functions of the human self model. The following functions all require communication with the prefrontal cortex; agency and association areas of the cortex; spatial perspectivity and the [[parietal lobe]]s, unity and the [[temporal lobe]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10487788"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vogeley K. |author2=Kurthen M. |author3=Falkai P. |author4=Maier W. |title=Essential functions of the human self model are implemented in the prefrontal cortex |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=343–63 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10487788 |doi=10.1006/ccog.1999.0394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to psychopathology==
Disorders of the self model are implicated in several disorders including [[schizophrenia]], [[autism]], and [[depersonalization]]. According to this theory, long-term unity is impaired in autism, similar to [[theory of mind]] deficits and [[weak central coherence theory]]. Individuals with autism are thought to be impaired in assigning mental states to other people, an ability that probably codevelops with long-term unity of self. Weak central coherence, that is, the inability to assemble information into a cohesive whole, reflects the same problems with creating a unified sense of self and benific sense extreme in [[narcissism]].&lt;ref name="pmid10993669"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ben Shalom D |title=Developmental depersonalization: the prefrontal cortex and self-functions in autism |journal=Conscious Cogn |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=457–60 |date=September 2000 |pmid =10993669 |doi=10.1006/ccog.2000.0453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the [[Insight Meditation Society]] (IMS) was founded in Barre, MA by a group of Western meditation teachers trained in Asia,&lt;ref name="OtaganontaWipaweeTaking"&gt;Otaganonta, Wipawee,"Taking the high road back home," Bangkok Post, March 31, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Jack Kornfield]], [[Joseph Goldstein (writer)|Joseph Goldstein]] and [[Sharon Salzberg]].&lt;ref name="ThompsonKeithSpirit"&gt;Thompson, Keith,"Spirit Rock," Pacific Sun, October 7–13, 1998, p 13-15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, after ten years at IMS, Kornfield moved to Northern California with his family&lt;ref name="OtaganontaWipaweeTaking" /&gt; and began hosting a Monday night meditation class in a private home in San Anselmo.&lt;ref name="ThompsonKeithSpirit" /&gt; Eventually the class expanded to a clinic and then to a local church.&lt;ref name="HamburgLauraThe"&gt;Hamburg,Laura, "The Dharma Bums Grow Up," San Francisco Chronicle, March 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 a group of meditation teachers in the San Francisco Bay Area incorporated as Insight Meditation West, for the purpose of acquiring land and establishing a west coast Insight Meditation center.&lt;ref name="LattinDon" /&gt;  The group included Kornfield, James Baraz, [[Sylvia Boorstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Faiths merge over wisdom of Buddhism|last=Bearden|first=Michelle|publisher=The Tampa Tribune|page=4|date=May 18, 1996|quote=When she's not writing and speaking, Boorstein is the founding teacher at Spirit Rock Meditation Center in Woodacre, Calif.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Douglas and Howard Cohn.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;

In 1988, with funds from an anonymous donation,&lt;ref name="HamburgLauraThe" /&gt; 412 acres of undeveloped land in the [[San Geronimo Valley]], an hour north of San Francisco, was purchased from [[Nature conservancy|The Nature Conservancy]]&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Ronnie, "View from the Dharma Seat," Pacific Sun, November 28 – December 4, 2008, p 13 -15&lt;/ref&gt; in order to start a permanent meditation center, and the name Spirit Rock Meditation Center was formally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Impact Analysis|url=http://www.hartwestsa.com/public/sr4mpa/documents/mpa%20book/13.8-1EDS.pdf|work=October 24, 2008|publisher=Hart Martin|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990 temporary construction trailers were erected to house the community meditation hall, administrative offices and caretaker residences. Construction for permanent replacement facilities began in 2014.&lt;ref name="ThompsonKeithSpirit" /&gt; and in 2016, a new Community Meditation Center, staff village and administrative buildings were completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marinij.com/social-affairs/20160606/west-marins-spirit-rock-meditation-center-opens-new-11800-square-foot-hub|title=West Marin’s Spirit Rock meditation center opens new 11,800-square-foot hub|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residential retreat center opened in July 1998.&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt; The majority of the center’s land is protected by an open space easement and kept in conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Nels|title=County supervisors approve Spirit Rock Meditation Center plan|url=http://www.marinij.com/sanrafael/ci_18508802|work=July 19, 2011|publisher=Marin Independent Journal|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==

The teachings at Spirit Rock focus on the practice of [[vipassanā]] as taught in the [[Theravada]] tradition. Teachings focus on training and quieting the mind,&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt; on the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]] as found in [[Buddhist texts]], and on incorporating the [[Dharma]] into daily life.&lt;ref name="AshleyBeth"&gt;Ashley, Beth, "He’s the Father of Spirit Rock," Marin Independent Journal, March 22, 1998, D1&lt;/ref&gt; Retreats are modeled on those held for lay people in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], including sitting and walking meditation, meetings with the teachers and the observation of silence by practitioners.&lt;ref name="OtaganontaWipaweeTaking" /&gt;

In addition to vipassana teachings, Spirit Rock hosts teachers from [[Zen]], [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] and [[Nondualism|nondual traditions]] as guest teachers throughout the year. Visiting teachers have included the [[14th Dalai Lama]],&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt; [[Thích Nhất Hạnh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zen Master's Message of Peace - Vietnamese poet helps to ease anguish of refugees, veterans|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|page=A15|last=Lattin|first=Don|date=October 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ba Khin]], [[Preah Maha Ghosananda]],&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt;  [[Anagarika Munindra]], [[Kalu Rinpoche]], [[Ram Dass]],&lt;ref name="AshleyBeth" /&gt; [[Pema Chödrön]], [[Tsoknyi Rinpoche]], [[Huston Smith]],&lt;ref name=Chronicle /&gt; [[Adyashanti]], [[Tara Brach]], [[Alice Walker]], [[Zoketsu Norman Fischer]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Wise Heart|url=http://www.tricycle.com/interview/wise-heart|work=Summer, 2008|publisher=Tricycle|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs ==

A portion of the classes, daylongs and retreats at Spirit Rock are organized as community-specific programs to promote diversity.&lt;ref name=Gate&gt;{{cite news|last=Yun|first=Dawn|title=COMMUNITY / Spirit Rock's new mantra - diversity|url=http://www.sfgate.com/default/article/COMMUNITY-Spirit-Rock-s-new-mantra-diversity-2724842.php#page-1|work=September 17, 2004|publisher=San Francisco Gate|accessdate=9 August 2013|date=September 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are referred to as Kindred [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]] and include self-identified people of color, women, [[LGBTIQ|LGBT-IQ]] community,&lt;ref name=Gate /&gt; families,&lt;ref name="HamburgLauraThe" /&gt; young adults, and elders. Class offerings also address the application of Buddhist teachings to modern issues such as addiction and trauma. Spirit Rock offers scholarships to make classes and retreats available to those who cannot otherwise afford them.&lt;ref name="HamburgLauraThe" /&gt;

== Organization ==

The center is supported by fees charged for classes and retreats, and by donations.&lt;ref name=Fronsdal&gt;{{cite web|last=Fronsdal|first=Gil|title=Insight Meditation in the United States: Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness|url=http://www.insightmeditationcenter.org/articles/InsightinUS.pdf|work=1998|accessdate=9 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paid staff runs the day-to-day operations of Spirit Rock Meditation Center with support from volunteers.&lt;ref name="ThompsonKeithSpirit" /&gt;  Residential retreat managers are volunteers who rely on voluntary [[dāna]] (donations) from participants to support their work. Teachers on residential retreats are supported by donations from the students,&lt;ref name="HamburgLauraThe" /&gt; as is the practice in the Buddhist tradition.&lt;ref name=Fronsdal /&gt; but on non-residential retreats, daylong retreats, events and classes teachers are supported by fees paid by attendees to Spirit Rock.

Spirit Rock’s teaching programs are developed by the Teachers Council, a collective of teachers.&lt;ref name="ThompsonKeithSpirit" /&gt; A volunteer Board of Directors, composed of teachers and community members, is the central decision-making body for Spirit Rock. The work of the Board is supported by a number of committees.

Current Spirit Rock teachers (as of 2017) include Ajahn Amaro, Ayya Anandabodhi; Sally Armstrong; Guy Armstrong; James Baraz; Sylvia Boorstein; Eugene Cash; Debra Chamberlin-Taylor; Howard Cohn; Mark Coleman; Dana DePalma; Anna Douglas; Andrea Fella; Anushka Fernandopulle; [[Gil fronsdal|Gil Fronsdal]]; Robert Hall; Will Kabat-Zinn; [[Jack Kornfield]]; [[Phillip Moffitt]]; [[Wes Nisker]]; Mary Grace Orr; Sharda Rogell; Donald Rothberg; Tempel Smith; John Travis; Spring Washam; Julie Wester; Diana Winston; and Larry Yang.

== Collaborations ==

A number of Spirit Rock teachers also offer their teachings, or serve on the Board of Directors, at other meditation centers including East Bay Meditation Center in [[Oakland, California]],&lt;ref name=Gate /&gt;   the Modesto Almond Blossom Sangha in [[Modesto, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Time to Reflect—Buddhists and Others Find Harmony in Weekly Meditation|first=Lisa|last=Millegan|publisher=The Modesto Bee|date=March 7, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insight Meditation Society in [[Barre, Massachusetts]],  Insight Meditation Center in [[Redwood City]], [[California]], Mountain Stream Meditation Center in [[Nevada City, California]], and Aloka Vihara, a forest monastery of bikkhunis (fully ordained nuns) in the Sierra Foothills of California.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48356">The theory of '''structuration''' is a [[social theory]] of the creation and reproduction of social systems that is based in the analysis of both ''[[Social structure|structure]]'' and ''[[Agency (sociology)|agents]]'' (see [[structure and agency]]), without giving primacy to either. Further, in structuration theory, neither [[Microsociology|micro]]- nor [[Macrosociology|macro-focused]] analysis alone is sufficient. The theory was proposed by [[sociologist]] [[Anthony Giddens]], most significantly in ''The Constitution of Society'',&lt;ref name="The constitution of society"&gt;{{cite book|last=Giddens|first=A.|year=1984|title=The constitution of society: Outline of the theory of structuration|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=978-0-520-05728-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[hermeneutics]], and social practices at the inseparable intersection of structures and agents. Its proponents have adopted and expanded this balanced position.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory"&gt;Stones, R. (2005). ''Structuration theory.'' New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the theory has received much criticism, it remains a pillar of contemporary [[sociological theory]].&lt;ref name="Critical appreciation"&gt;Bryant, C.G.A., &amp;amp; Jary, D. (1991). Coming to terms with Anthony Giddens. In C.G.A. Bryant &amp;amp; D. Jary (Eds.), ''Giddens' theory of structuration: A critical appreciation'' (pp. 1-32). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{toclimit|3}}

==Premises and origins==
Sociologist Anthony Giddens adopted a [[post-empiricism|post-empiricist]] frame for his theory, as he was concerned with the abstract characteristics of social relations.{{according to whom|date=May 2012}} This leaves each level more accessible to analysis via the [[Ontology|ontologies]] which constitute the human social experience: space and time ("and thus, in one sense, 'history'.")&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|3}} His aim was to build a broad social theory which viewed "[t]he basic domain of study of the social sciences... [as] neither the experience of the individual actor, nor the existence of any form of societal totality, but social practices ordered across space and time."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|189}} His focus on abstract [[ontology]] accompanied a general and purposeful neglect of [[epistemology]] or detailed [[research methodology]].

Giddens used concepts from [[Objectivity (philosophy)#Objectivism|objectivist]] and [[subjectivism|subjectivist]] social theories, discarding objectivism's focus on detached structures, which lacked regard for humanist elements and subjectivism's exclusive attention to individual or group agency without consideration for socio-structural context. He critically engaged classical nineteenth and early twentieth century social theorists such as [[Positivism#Comte's positivism|Auguste Comte]], [[Materialism#Materialist conception of history and Marx|Karl Marx]], [[Max Weber]], [[Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]], [[Alfred Schutz]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Erving Goffman]], and [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Thus, in many ways, structuration was "an exercise in clarification of logical issues."&lt;ref name="New rules of sociological method"&gt;Giddens, A. (1993). ''New rules of sociological method: A positive critique of interpretative sociologies.'' Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|viii}} Structuration drew on other fields, as well: "He also wanted to bring in from other disciplines novel aspects of ontology that he felt had been neglected by social theorists working in the domains that most interested him. Thus, for example, he enlisted the aid of geographers, historians and philosophers in bringing notions of time and space into the central heartlands of social theory."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|16}} Giddens hoped that a subject-wide "coming together" might occur which would involve greater cross-disciplinary dialogue and cooperation, especially between [[anthropologists]], social scientists and sociologists of all types, historians, geographers, and even novelists. Believing that "literary style matters", he held that social scientists are communicators who share frames of meaning across cultural contexts through their work by utilising "the same sources of description (mutual knowledge) as novelists or others who write fictional accounts of social life."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|285}}

Structuration differs from its historical sources. Unlike structuralism it sees the reproduction of social systems not "as a mechanical outcome, [but] rather ... as an active constituting process, accomplished by, and consisting in, the doings of active subjects."&lt;ref name="New rules of sociological method" /&gt;{{rp|121}} Unlike [[Althusser]]'s concept of agents as "bearers" of structures, structuration theory sees them as active participants. Unlike the [[philosophy of action]] and other forms of [[interpretative sociology]], structuration focuses on structure rather than production exclusively. Unlike [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure's]] production of an utterance, structuration sees language as a tool from which to view society, not as the constitution of society—parting with [[Structural linguistics|structural linguists]] such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[generative grammar]] theorists such as [[Noam Chomsky]]. Unlike [[post-structuralist]] theory, which put similar focus on the effects of time and space, structuration does not recognise {{em|only}} movement, change and transition. Unlike [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalism]], in which structures and their virtual synonyms, "systems", comprise organisations, structuration sees structures and systems as separate concepts. Unlike [[Marxism]], structuration avoids an overly restrictive concept of "society" and Marxism's reliance on a universal "motor of history" (i.e. [[class conflict]]), its theories of societal "adaptation", and its insistence on the working class as universal class and socialism as the ultimate form of modern society. Finally, "structuration theory cannot be expected to furnish the moral guarantees that [[critical theorists]] sometimes purport to offer."&lt;ref name="Critical appreciation" /&gt;{{rp|16}}

== Duality of structure ==
Giddens observed that in social analysis, the term ''structure'' referred generally to "rules and resources" and more specifically to "the structuring properties allowing the 'binding' of time-space in social systems". These properties make it possible for similar social practices to exist across time and space and that lend them "systemic" form.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|17}} Agents—groups or individuals—draw upon these structures to perform social actions through embedded memory, called ''memory traces''. Memory traces are thus the vehicle&lt;!-- need a word here that is not metaphorical. I thought maybe "means" but later "modality" gets that definition. --&gt; through which social actions are carried out. Structure is also, however, the result of these social practices. Thus, Giddens conceives of the ''duality of structure'' as being:
{{Quote|...the essential recursiveness of social life, as constituted in social practices: structure is both medium and outcome of reproduction of practices. Structure enters simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and social practices, and 'exists' in the generating moments of this constitution.&lt;ref name="Central problems"&gt;Giddens, A. (1979). ''Central problems in social theory: Action, structure, and contradiction in social analysis.'' Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}}}

Giddens uses "the duality of structure" (i.e. material/ideational, micro/macro) to emphasize structure's nature as both medium and outcome. Structures exist both internally within agents as memory traces that are the product of phenomenological and hermeneutic inheritance&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|27}} and externally as the manifestation of social actions. Similarly, social structures contain agents and/or are the product of past actions of agents. Giddens holds this duality, alongside "structure" and "system," in addition to the concept of recursiveness, as the core of structuration theory.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|17}} His theory has been adopted by those with [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] inclinations, but who wish to situate such structures in human practice rather than to [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reify]] them as an [[ideal type]] or material property. (This is different, for example, from [[actor–network theory]] which appears to grant a certain autonomy to technical artifacts.)

Social systems have patterns of social relation that change over time; the changing nature of space and time determines the interaction of social relations and therefore structure.&lt;!-- huh? changing nature of s&amp;t? --&gt; Hitherto, social structures or models were either taken to be beyond the realm of human control—the [[positivistic]] approach—or posit that action creates them—the [[Interpretivism (social science)|interpretivist]] approach. The duality of structure emphasizes that they are different sides to the same central question of how social order is created.

[[Gregor McLennan]] suggested renaming this process "the duality of structure {{em|and agency}}", since both aspects are involved in using and producing social actions.&lt;ref name="Critical assessments"&gt;McLennan, G. (1997/2000/2001). Critical or positive theory? A comment on the status of Anthony Giddens' social theory. In C.G.A. Bryant &amp; D. Jary (Eds.), ''Anthony Giddens: Critical assessments'' (pp. 318-327). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|322}}

=== Cycle of structuration ===
The duality of structure is essentially a [[feedback]]–[[Feed forward (control)|feedforward]]{{clarify|date=May 2012}} process whereby agents and structures mutually enact social systems, and social systems in turn become part of that duality.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Structuration thus recognizes a social cycle. In examining social systems, structuration theory examines ''structure'', ''[[Modalities (sociology)|modality]]'', and ''interaction''. The "modality" (discussed below) of a structural system is the means by which structures are translated into actions.

==== Interaction ====
Interaction is the agent's activity within the social system, space and time. "It can be understood as the fitful yet routinized occurrence of encounters, fading away in time and space, yet constantly reconstituted within different areas of time-space."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|86}} [[Unspoken rule|Rule]]s can affect interaction, as originally suggested by [[Goffman]]. "Frames" are "clusters of rules which help to constitute and regulate activities, defining them as activities of a certain sort and as subject to a given range of sanctions."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|87}} Frames are necessary for agents to feel "ontological security, the trust that everyday actions have some degree of predictability. Whenever individuals interact in a specific context they address—without any difficulty and in many cases without conscious acknowledgement—the question: "What is going on here?" Framing is the practice by which agents make sense of what they are doing.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

==== Routinization ====
Structuration theory is centrally concerned with ''order'' as "the transcending of time and space in human social relationships".&lt;ref name="The constitution of society"/&gt; ''[[Institutionalization#Institutionalization|Institutionalized]] action'' and ''routinization'' are foundational in the establishment of social order and the reproduction of social systems. Routine persists in society, even during social and political revolutions, where daily life is greatly deformed, "as Bettelheim demonstrates so well, routines, including those of an obnoxious sort, are re-established."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|87}} Routine interactions become institutionalized features of social systems via tradition, custom and/or habit, but this is no easy societal task and it "is a major error to suppose that these phenomena need no explanation. On the contrary, as [[Goffman]] (together with [[ethnomethodology]]) has helped to demonstrate, the routinized character of most social activity is something that has to be 'worked at' continually by those who sustain it in their day-to-day conduct."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt; Therefore, routinized social practices do not stem from coincidence, "but the skilled accomplishments of knowledgeable agents."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|26}}&lt;!--this reads as though Bettelheim (routines are durable) contradicts Goffman (routines have to be "worked at"--&gt;

''Trust'' and ''tact'' are essential for the existence of a "basic security system, the sustaining (in ''praxis'') of a sense of ontological security, and [thus] the routine nature of social reproduction which agents skilfully organize. The monitoring of the body, the control and use of face in '[[facework|face work]]'—these are fundamental to social integration in time and space."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

==== Explanation ====
{{Quote|When I utter a sentence I draw upon various syntactical rules (sedimented in my practical consciousness of the language) in order to do so. These structural features of the language are the medium whereby I generate the utterance. But in producing a syntactically correct utterance I simultaneously contribute to the reproduction of the language as a whole. ...The relation between moment and totality for social theory... [involves] a dialectic of presence and absence which ties the most minor or trivial forms of social action to structural properties of the overall society, and to the coalescence of institutions over long stretches of historical time.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|24}}}}
Thus, even the smallest social actions contribute to the alteration or reproduction of social systems. Social stability and order is not permanent; agents always possess a ''[[dialectic]] of control'' (discussed below) which allows them to break away from normative actions. Depending on the social factors present, agents may cause shifts in social structure.

The cycle of structuration is not a defined sequence; it is rarely a direct succession of causal events. Structures and agents are both internal and external to each other, mingling, interrupting, and continually changing each other as feedbacks and feedforwards occur. Giddens stated, "The degree of "[[systemness]]" is very variable. ...I take it to be one of the main features of structuration theory that the extension and 'closure' of societies across space and time is regarded as problematic."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

The use of "patriot" in political speech reflects this mingling, borrowing from and contributing to nationalistic norms and supports structures such as a [[police state]], from which it in turn gains impact.

==Structure and society==
Structures are the "rules and resources" embedded in agents' memory traces. Agents call upon their memory traces of which they are "knowledgeable" to perform social actions. "Knowledgeability" refers to "what agents know about what they do, and why they do it."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt; Giddens divides memory traces (''structures-within-knowledgeability''&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;) into three types:
* Domination (power): Giddens also uses "resources" to refer to this type. "Authoritative resources" allow agents to control persons, whereas "allocative resources" allow agents to control material objects.
* Signification (meaning)
* Legitimation (norms): Giddens sometimes uses "rules" to refer to either signification or legitimation. An agent draws upon these ''stocks of knowledge'' via memory to inform him or herself about the external context, conditions, and potential results of an action.

When an agent uses these structures for social interactions, they are called ''modalities'' and present themselves in the forms of facility (domination), interpretive scheme/communication (signification) and norms/sanctions (legitimation).

Thus, he distinguishes between overall "structures-within-knowledgeability" and the more limited and task-specific "modalities" on which these agents subsequently draw when they interact.

The duality of structures means that structures enter "simultaneously into the constitution of the agent and social practices, and 'exists' in the generating moments of this constitution."&lt;ref name="Central problems" /&gt;{{rp|5}} "Structures exist paradigmatically, as an absent set of differences, temporally "present" only in their instantiation, in the constituting moments of social systems."&lt;ref name="Central problems" /&gt;{{rp|64}} Giddens draws upon [[structuralism]] and [[post-structuralism]] in theorizing that structures and their meaning are understood by their differences.

==Agents and society==
Giddens' agents follow previous [[psychoanalysis]] work done by [[Sigmund Freud]] and others.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt; Agency, as Giddens calls it, is human action. To be human is to be an agent (not all agents are human). Agency is critical to both the reproduction and the transformation of society. Another way to explain this concept is by what Giddens calls the "reflexive monitoring of actions."&lt;ref name="Modernity and self-identity"&gt;Giddens, A. (1991). ''Modernity and self-identity: Self and society in the late modern age.'' Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; "Reflexive monitoring" refers to agents' ability to monitor their actions and those actions' settings and contexts. Monitoring is an essential characteristic of agency. Agents subsequently "rationalize," or evaluate, the success of those efforts. All humans engage in this process, and expect the same from others. Through action, agents produce structures; through reflexive monitoring and rationalization, they transform them. To act, agents must be motivated, must be knowledgeable must be able to rationalize the action; and must reflexively monitor the action.

Agents, while bounded in structure, draw upon their knowledge of that structural context when they act. However, actions are constrained by agents' inherent capabilities and their understandings of available actions and external limitations. ''Practical consciousness'' and ''discursive consciousness'' inform these abilities. Practical consciousness is the knowledgeability that an agent brings to the tasks required by everyday life, which is so integrated as to be hardly noticed. Reflexive monitoring occurs at the level of practical consciousness.&lt;ref name="Ordinary consumption"&gt;Ilmonen, K. (2001). Sociology, consumption, and routine. In J. Gronow &amp; A. Warde (Eds.), ''Ordinary Consumption'' (pp. 9-25). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Discursive consciousness is the ability to verbally express knowledge. Alongside practical and discursive consciousness, Giddens recognizes actors as having reflexive, contextual knowledge, and that habitual, widespread use of knowledgeability makes structures become institutionalized.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

Agents rationalize, and in doing so, link the agent and the agent's knowledgeability. Agents must coordinate ongoing projects, goals, and contexts while performing actions. This coordination is called reflexive monitoring and is connected to ethnomethodology's emphasis on agents' intrinsic sense of accountability.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

The factors that can enable or constrain an agent, as well as how an agent uses structures, are known as ''capability constraints'' include age, cognitive/physical limits on performing multiple tasks at once and the physical impossibility of being in multiple places at once, available time and the relationship between movement in space and movement in time.

Location offers are a particular type of capability constraint. Examples include:
* Locale
* Regionalization: political or geographical zones, or rooms in a building
* Presence: Do other actors participate in the action? (see [[Dynamic awareness theory#Presence|co-presence]]); and more specifically
* Physical presence: Are other actors physically nearby?

Agents are always able to engage in a ''dialectic of control'', able to "intervene in the world or to refrain from such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or state of affairs."&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;{{rp|14}} In essence, agents experience inherent and contrasting amounts of autonomy and dependence; agents can always either act or not.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

==Methodology==
Structuration theory is relevant to research, but does not prescribe a methodology and its use in research has been problematic. Giddens intended his theory to be abstract and theoretical, informing the hermeneutic aspects of research rather than guiding practice. Giddens wrote that structuration theory "establishes the internal logical coherence of concepts within a theoretical network."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|34}} Giddens criticized many researchers who used structuration theory for empirical research, critiquing their "en bloc" use of the theory's abstract concepts in a burdensome way. "The works applying concepts from the logical framework of structuration theory that Giddens approved of were those that used them more selectively, 'in a spare and critical fashion.'"&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|2}} Giddens and followers used structuration theory more as "a sensitizing device".&lt;ref name="Turner 1986"&gt;Turner, J.H. (1986). Review essay: The theory of structuration. ''American Journal of Sociology'', ''91''(4), 969-977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuration theory allows researchers to focus on any structure or concept individually or in combination. In this way, structuration theory prioritizes [[ontology]] over [[epistemology]]. In his own work, Giddens focuses on production and reproduction of social practices in some context. He looked for stasis and change, [[Expectation (epistemic)|agent expectations]], relative degrees of routine, [[tradition]], behavior, and creative, skillful, and strategic thought simultaneously. He examined spatial organization, [[Unintended consequences|intended and unintended consequences]], skilled and knowledgeable agents, [[explicit knowledge|discursive]] and [[tacit knowledge]], dialectic of control, actions with motivational content, and constraints.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Structuration theorists conduct analytical research of social relations, rather than organically discovering them, since they use structuration theory to reveal specific research questions, though that technique has been criticized as [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry-picking]].&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

Giddens preferred ''strategic conduct analysis'', which focuses on contextually situated actions. It employs detailed accounts of agents' knowledgeability, motivation, and the dialectic of control.&lt;ref name="The constitution of society" /&gt;

==Criticisms and additions==
Though structuration theory has received critical expansion since its origination,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Giddens' concepts remained pivotal for later extension of the theory, especially the duality of structure.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Strong structuration===
Rob Stones argued that many aspects of Gidden's original theory had little place in its modern manifestation. Stones focused on clarifying its scope, reconfiguring some concepts and inserting new ones, and refining methodology and research orientations. Strong structuration:
#Places its ontology more [[in situ]] than abstractly.&lt;!--what does that mean?--&gt;
#Introduces the ''quadripartite cycle'', which details the elements in the duality of structure. These are:
#* ''external structures'' as conditions of action;
#* ''internal structures'' within the agent;
#* ''active agency'', "including a range of aspects involved when agents draw upon internal structures in producing practical action";&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|9}} and
#* ''outcomes'' (as both structures and events).
#Increases attention to epistemology and methodology. Ontology supports epistemology and methodology by prioritising:
#* the question-at-hand;
#* appropriate forms of methodological bracketing;
#* distinct methodological steps in research; and
#* "[t]he specific combinations of all the above in composite forms of research."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|189}}
#Discovers the "meso-level of ontology between the abstract, philosophical level of ontology and the ''in-situ'', [[ontic]] level."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Strong structuration allows varied abstract ontological concepts in experiential conditions.
#Focuses on the meso-level at the temporal and spatial scale.
#Conceptualises ''independent causal forces'' and ''irresistible causal forces'', which take into account how external structures, internal structures, and active agency affect agent choices (or lack of them). "Irresistible forces" are the connected concepts of a horizon of action with a set of "actions-in-hand" and a hierarchical ordering of purposes and concerns. An agent is affected by external influences. This aspect of strong structuration helps reconcile an agent's dialectic of control and his/her more constrained set of "real choices."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

===Post-structuration and dualism===
[[Margaret Archer]] objected to the inseparability of [[structure and agency]] in structuration theory.&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;Archer, M. (1995). ''Realist social theory: The morphogenetic approach.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; She proposed a notion of ''dualism'' rather than "duality of structure". She primarily examined structural frameworks and the action within the limits allowed by those conditions. She combined realist ontology and called her methodology ''analytical dualism''. Archer maintained that structure precedes agency in social structure reproduction and analytical importance, and that they should be analysed separately. She emphasised the importance of temporality in social analysis, dividing it into four stages: structural conditioning, social interaction, its immediate outcome and structural elaboration. Thus her analysis considered embedded "structural conditions, emergent causal powers and properties, social interactions between agents, and subsequent structural changes or reproductions arising from the latter."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt; Archer criticised structuration theory for denying time and place because of the inseparability between structure and agency.&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;

Nicos Mouzelis reconstructed Giddens' original theories.&lt;ref name="Conceptualising constraint"&gt;Healy, K. (1998). "Conceptualising constraint: Mouzelis, Archer, and the concept of social structure." ''Sociology, 613''(4), pp.613-635.&lt;/ref&gt; Mouzelis kept Giddens' original formulation of structure as "rules and resources." However, he was considered a dualist, because he argued for dualism to be as important in social analysis as the duality of structure.&lt;ref name="Restructuring structuration theory"&gt;Mouzelis, N. (1989). "Restructuring structuration theory." ''The Sociological Review, 32''(3), pp.509-522.&lt;/ref&gt; Mouzelis reexamined human social action at the "[[Syntagmatic analysis|syntagmatic]]" (syntactic) level. He claimed that the duality of structure does not account for all types of social relationships. Duality of structure works when agents do not question or disrupt rules, and interaction resembles "natural/performative" actions with a practical orientation. However, in other contexts, the relationship between structure and agency can resemble dualism more than duality, such as systems that are the result of powerful agents. In these situations, rules are not viewed as resources, but are in states of transition or redefinition, where actions are seen from a "strategic/monitoring orientation."&lt;ref name="Back to sociological theory" /&gt;{{rp|28}} In this orientation, dualism shows the distance between agents and structures. He called these situations "syntagmatic duality". For example, a professor can change the class he or she teaches, but has little capability to change the larger university structure. "In that case, syntagmatic duality gives way to syntagmatic dualism."&lt;ref name="Back to sociological theory"&gt;Mouzelis, N. (1991). ''Back to sociological theory: The construction of social orders.'' New York, NY: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} This implies that systems are the outcome, but not the medium, of social actions. Mouzelis also criticised Giddens' lack of consideration for social hierarchies.

John Parker built on Archer and Mouzelis's support for dualism to propose a theoretical reclamation of historical sociology and macro-structures using concrete historical cases, claiming that dualism better explained the dynamics of social structures.&lt;ref name="Parker structuration theory"&gt;Parker, J. (2000). ''Structuration'' Buckingham: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Equally, Robert Archer developed and applied analytical dualism in his critical analysis of the impact of New Managerialism on education policy in England in Wales during the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Archer |first1=Robert |title=Education policy and realist social theory : primary teachers, child-centred philosophy and new managerialism. |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415464338 |url=https://www.routledge.com/Education-Policy-and-Realist-Social-Theory-Primary-Teachers-Child-Centred/Archer/p/book/9780415464338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===John B. Thompson===
{{Main|John Thompson (sociologist)}}
Though he agreed with the soundness and overall purposes of Giddens' most expansive structuration concepts (i.e., against dualism and for the study of structure in concert with agency), John B. Thompson ("a close friend and colleague of Giddens at Cambridge University")&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|46}} wrote one of the most widely cited critiques of structuration theory.&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology"&gt;Thompson, J.B. (1984). ''Studies in the theory of ideology''. Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His central argument was that it needed to be more specific and more consistent both internally and with conventional social structure theory. Thompson focused on problematic aspects of Giddens' concept of structure as "rules and resources," focusing on "rules". He argued that Giddens' concept of rule was too broad.

Thompson claimed that Giddens presupposed a ''criterion of importance'' in contending that rules are a generalizable enough tool to apply to every aspect of human action and interaction; "on the other hand, Giddens is well aware that {{em|some}} rules, or some kinds or aspects of rules, are much more important than others for the analysis of, for example, the social structure of capitalist societies."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|159}} He found the term to be imprecise and to not designate which rules are more relevant for which social structures.

Thompson used the example of [[linguistic analysis]] to point out that the need for a prior framework which to enable analysis of, for example, the social structure of an entire nation. While [[semantic rule]]s may be relevant to social structure, to study them "presupposes some structural points of reference which are not themselves {{em|rules}}, with regard to which [of] these semantic rules are differentiated"&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|159}} according to class, sex, region and so on. He called this ''structural differentiation.''

Rules differently affect variously situated individuals. Thompson gave the example of a private school which restricts enrollment and thus participation. Thus rules—in this case, restrictions—"operate {{em|differentially}}, affecting unevenly various groups of individuals whose categorization depends on certain assumptions about social structures."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|159}} The isolated analysis of rules does not incorporate differences among agents.

Thompson claimed that Giddens offered no way of formulating ''structural identity''. Some "rules" are better conceived of as broad inherent elements that define a structure's identity (e.g., [[Henry Ford]] and [[Harold Macmillan]] are "capitalistic"). These agents may differ, but have important traits in common due to their "capitalistic" identity. Thompson theorized that these traits were not rules in the sense that a manager could draw upon a "rule" to fire a tardy employee; rather, they were {{em|elements}} which "{{em|limit}} the kinds of rules which are possible and which thereby {{em|delimit}} the scope for institutional variation."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|160}} It is necessary to outline the broader social system to be able to analyze agents, actors, and rules within that system.

Thus Thompson concluded that Giddens' use of the term "rules" is problematic. "Structure" is similarly objectionable: "But to adhere to this conception of structure, while at the same time acknowledging the need for the study of 'structural principles,' 'structural sets' and 'axes of structuration,' is simply a recipe for conceptual confusion."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|163}}

Thompson proposed several amendments. He requested sharper differentiation between the reproduction of institutions and the reproduction of social structure. He proposed an altered version of the structuration cycle. He defined "[[social institutions|institutions]]" as "characterized by rules, regulations and conventions of various sorts, by differing kinds and quantities of resources and by hierarchical power relations between the occupants of institutional positions."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|165}} Agents acting within institutions and conforming to institutional rules and regulations or using institutionally endowed power reproduce the institution. "If, in so doing, the institutions continue to satisfy certain structural conditions, both in the sense of conditions which delimit the scope for ''institutional variation'' and the conditions which underlie the operation of ''structural differentiation'', then the agents may be said to reproduce social structure."&lt;ref name="Theory of Ideology" /&gt;{{rp|165}}

Thompson also proposed adding a ''range of alternatives'' to Giddens' conception of constraints on human action. He pointed out the paradoxical relationship between Giddens' "dialectic of control" and his acknowledgement that constraints may leave an agent with no choice. He demanded that Giddens better show how wants and desires relate to choice.

Giddens replied that a structural principle is not equivalent with rules, and pointed to his definition from ''A Contemporary Critique of Historical Materialism'': "Structural principles are principles of organisation implicated in those practices most "deeply" (in time) and "pervasively" (in space) sedimented in society",&lt;ref name="Contemporary critique"&gt;Giddens, A. (1981). ''A contemporary critique of historical materialism: vol 1: Power, property, and the state.'' London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} and described structuration as a "mode of institutional articulation"&lt;ref name="A reply to my critics"&gt;Giddens, A. (1989). A reply to my critics. In D. Held &amp; J. B. Thompson (Eds.), ''Social theory of modern societies: Anthony Giddens and his critics'' (pp.249-301). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|257}} with emphasis on the relationship between time and space and a host of institutional orderings including, but not limited to, rules.

Ultimately, Thompson concluded that the concept of structure as "rules and resources" in an elemental and ontological way resulted in conceptual confusion. Many theorists supported Thompson's argument that an analysis "based on structuration's ontology of structures as norms, interpretative schemes and power resources radically limits itself if it does not frame and locate itself within a more broadly conceived notion of social structures."&lt;ref name="Structuration theory" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref name="Sewell" /&gt;

===Change===
Sewell provided a useful summary that included one of the theory's less specified aspects: the question "Why are structural transformations possible?" He claimed that Giddens' overrelied on rules and modified Giddens' argument by re-defining "resources" as the embodiment of cultural [[Schema (Kant)|schemas]]. He argued that change arises from the multiplicity of structures, the ''transposable'' nature of schemas, the unpredictability of resource accumulation, the [[polysemy]] of resources and the intersection of structures.&lt;ref name="Sewell" /&gt;{{rp|20}}

The existence of multiple structures implies that the knowledgeable agents whose actions produce systems are capable of applying different schemas to contexts with differing resources, contrary to the conception of a universal [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] (learned dispositions, skills and ways of acting). He wrote that "Societies are based on practices that derived from many distinct structures, which exist at different levels, operate in different modalities, and are themselves based on widely varying types and quantities of resources. ...It is never true that all of them are homologous."&lt;ref name="Sewell"&gt;Sewell, Jr., W. H. (1992). A theory of structure: duality, agency, and transformation. ''The American Journal of Sociology, 98''(1):1-29.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}}

Originally from [[Bourdieu]], ''transposable'' schemas can be "applied to a wide and not fully predictable range of cases outside the context in which they were initially learned." That capacity "is inherent in the knowledge of cultural schemas that characterizes all minimally competent members of society."&lt;ref name="Sewell" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

Agents may modify schemas even though their use does not predictably accumulate resources. For example, the effect of a joke is never quite certain, but a comedian may alter it based on the amount of laughter it garners regardless of this variability.

Agents may interpret a particular resource according to different schemas. E.g., a commander could attribute his wealth to military prowess, while others could see it as a blessing from the gods or a coincidental initial advantage.

Structures often overlap, confusing interpretation (e.g., the structure of capitalist society includes production from both private property and worker [[social solidarity|solidarity]]).

===Technology===
{{see also|Theories of technology}}
This theory was adapted and augmented by researchers interested in the relationship between [[technology]] and social structures, such as [[information technology]] in organizations. [[Gerardine DeSanctis |DeSanctis]] and Poole proposed an "adaptive structuration theory" with respect to the emergence and use of group decision support systems. In particular, they chose Giddens' notion of modalities to consider how technology is used with respect to its "spirit". "[[Appropriation (sociology)|Appropriation]]s" are the immediate, visible actions that reveal deeper structuration processes and are enacted with "moves". Appropriations may be faithful or unfaithful, be instrumental and be used with various attitudes.&lt;ref name="DeSanctis and Poole"&gt;Desanctis, G. &amp; Poole, M. S. (1994). Capturing the complexity in advanced technology use: adaptive structuration theory. ''Organization Science, 5''(2):121-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wanda Orlikowski]] applied her critique of the duality of structure to technology: "The duality of technology identifies prior views of technology as either objective force or as socially constructed product–as a false dichotomy."&lt;ref name="Orlikowski 1992"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. (1992). The duality of technology: rethinking the concept of technology in organizations. ''Organization Science, 3''(3):398-427. Earlier version at the URI http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/2300&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13}} She compared this to previous models (the technological imperative, strategic choice, and technology as a trigger) and considered the importance of meaning, power, norms, and interpretive flexibility. Orlikowski later replaced the notion of embedded properties&lt;ref name="DeSanctis and Poole" /&gt; for enactment (use). The "practice lens" shows how people enact structures which shape their use of technology that they employ in their practices.&lt;ref name="Orlikowski 2000"&gt;Orlikowski, W. J. (2000). Using technology and constituting structures: a practice lens for studying technology in organizations. ''Organization Science, 11''(4):404-428.&lt;/ref&gt; While Orlikowski's work focused on corporations, it is equally applicable to the technology cultures that have emerged in smaller community-based organizations, and can be adapted through the ''gender sensitivity lens'' in approaches to technology governance.&lt;ref name="Stillman 2006"&gt;Stillman, L. (2006). (Ph.D Thesis). Understandings of Technology in Community-Based Organisations: A Structurational Analysis. Monash University, Australia. Retrieved from: http://webstylus.net/?q=node/182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Workman, Ford and Allen rearticulated structuration theory as ''structuration agency theory'' for modeling socio-biologically inspired structuration in [[security software]].&lt;ref name="Workman, Ford, &amp; Allen 2008"&gt;Workman, M., Ford, R., &amp; Allen, W. (2008). A structuration agency approach to security policy enforcement in mobile ad hoc networks. ''Information Security Journal, 17'', 267-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Software agents join humans to engage in social actions of information exchange, giving and receiving instructions, responding to other agents, and pursuing goals individually or jointly.

===Business===
Pavlou and Majchrzak argued that research on business-to-business [[e-commerce]] portrayed technology as overly [[determinism|deterministic]]. The authors employed structuration theory to re-examine outcomes such as economic/business success as well as trust, coordination, innovation, and shared knowledge. They looked beyond technology into organizational structure and practices, and examined the effects on the structure of adapting to new technologies. The authors held that technology needs to be aligned and compatible with the existing "trustworthy"&lt;ref name="Business to business"&gt;Pavlou, P.A&gt;, &amp; Majchrzak, A. (2002). Structuration theory: Capturing the complexity of business-to-business intermediaries. In M. Warkentin (Ed.), ''Business to business electronic commerce: Challenges &amp; solutions'' (pp.175-189). Hershey, PA: Idea Group Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}} practices and organizational and market structure. The authors recommended measuring long-term adaptations using ethnography, monitoring and other methods to observe causal relationships and generate better predictions.

===Group communication===
Poole, Seibold, and McPhee wrote that "group structuration theory,"&lt;ref name="Group communication"&gt;Waldeck, J.H., Shepard, C.A., Teitelbaum, J., Farrar, W.J., &amp; Seibold, D.R. (2002). New directions for functional, symbolic convergence, structuration, and bona fide group perspectives of group communication. In L.R. Frey (Ed.), ''New directions in group communication'' (pp.3-25). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} provides "a theory of group interaction commensurate with the complexities of the phenomenon."&lt;ref name="Group communication 2"&gt;Poole, M.S., Seibold, D.R., &amp; McPhee, R.D. (1996). The structuration of group decisions. In R.Y. Hirokawa &amp; M.S. Poole (Eds.), ''Communication and group decision making'' (pp.114-146). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|116}}

The theory attempts to integrate macrosocial theories and individuals or small groups, as well as how to avoid the binary categorization of either "stable" or "[[Emergent properties|emergent]]" groups.

Waldeck et al. concluded that the theory needs to better predict outcomes, rather than merely explaining them. ''Decision rules'' support decision-making, which produces a communication pattern that can be directly observable. Research has not yet examined the "rational" function of group communication and decision-making (i.e., how well it achieves goals), nor structural production or constraints. Researchers must empirically demonstrate the recursivity of action and structure, examine how structures stabilize and change over time due to group communication, and may want to integrate argumentation research.&lt;ref name="Group communication" /&gt;

===Public relations===
Falkheimer claimed that integrating structuration theory into [[public relations]] (PR) strategies could result in a less agency-driven business, return theoretical focus to the role of power structures in PR, and reject massive PR campaigns in favor of a more "holistic understanding of how PR may be used in local contexts both as a reproductive and [transformational] social instrument."&lt;ref name="PR"&gt;Falkheimer, J. (2009). On Giddens: Interpreting public relations through Anthony Giddens' structuration and late modernity theory. In O. Ihlen, B. van Ruler, &amp; M. Frederiksson (Eds.), ''Public relations and social theory: Key figures and concepts'' (pp.103-119). New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|103}} Falkheimer portrayed PR as a method of communication and action whereby social systems emerge and reproduce. Structuration theory reinvigorates the study of space and time in PR theory. Applied structuration theory may emphasize community-based approaches, storytelling, rituals, and informal communication systems. Moreover, structuration theory integrates all organizational members in PR actions, integrating PR into all organizational levels rather than a separate office. Finally, structuration reveals interesting ethical considerations relating to whether a social system {{em|should}} transform.&lt;ref name="PR" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10488">There are three central ideas in '''[[Sufism|Sufi]] [[Psychology in medieval Islam|Islamic psychology]]''', which are the [[Nafs]] (self, ego or psyche), the [[Qalb]] (heart) and the [[Ruh]] (spirit). The origin and basis of these terms is [[Qur'an]]ic and they have been expounded upon by centuries of Sufic commentaries.
{{Sufism|Ideas}}

==Overview==
Nafs is considered to be the lowest principle of man. Higher than the nafs is the Qalb (heart), and the Ruh (spirit). This tripartition forms the foundation of later, more complicated systems; it is found as early as the Koranic commentary by [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. He holds that the nafs is peculiar to the zalim (tyrant), the qalb to the muqtasid (moderate), and the rūh to the sābiq (preceding one, winner); the zālim loves God for his own sake, the muqtasid loves Him for Himself, and the sābiq annihilates his own will in God's will. Bayezid Bistami, Hakīm at-Tirmidhī, and Junayd have followed this tripartition. Kharrāz, however, inserts between nafs and qalb the element tab', "nature," the natural functions of man. The spiritual body (soul) was created in adult form of the living body.

At almost the same time in history, Nūrī saw in man four different aspects of the heart, which he derived from the Koran:

''Sadr (breast) is connected with Islam (Sūra 39:23); qalb (heart) is the seat of īmān (faith) (Sūra 49:7; 16:106); fuad (heart) is connected with marifa (gnosis) (Sūra 53:11); and lubb (innermost heart) is the seat of tauhīd (Sūra 3:190).''

The Sufis often add the element of sirr, the innermost part of the heart in which the divine revelation is experienced. Jafar introduced, in an interesting comparison, reason, aql, as the barrier between nafs and qalb -- "the barrier which they both cannot transcend" (Sūra 55:20), so that the dark lower instincts cannot jeopardize the heart's purity. Each of these spiritual centers has its own functions, and Amr al-Makkī has summed up some of the early Sufi ideas in a myth:

''God created the hearts seven thousand years before the bodies and kept them in the station of proximity to Himself and He created the spirits seven thousand years before the hearts and kept them in the garden of intimate fellowship (uns) with Himself, and the consciences—the innermost part—He created seven thousand years before the spirits and kept them in the degree of union (waṣl) with Himself. Then he imprisoned the conscience in the spirit and the spirit in the heart and the heart in the body. Then He tested them and sent prophets, and then each began to seek its own station. The body occupied itself with prayer, the heart attained to love, the spirit arrived at proximity to its Lord, and the innermost part found rest in union with Him''.&lt;ref&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, Mystical dimensions of Islam (1975), p.191&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nafs ==

"Nafs" (self or ego) is the aspect of the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] that can be viewed along a continuum, and has the potential of functioning from the grossest to the highest level. The self at its lowest level refers to our negative traits and tendencies, controlled by [[emotion]]s, desires and its gratification. Sufic psychology identifies seven levels of the nafs, which have been identified in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islam.stackexchange.com/q/37824/17163 "Where are the seven levels of the nafs in Sufism mentioned in the Qur'an?"] Retrieved on 13 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of growth depends on working through these levels. These are: tyrannical self, regretful self, inspired self, serene self, pleased self, pleasing self and the pure self.&lt;ref name=IdriesShah&gt;{{cite book

==Qalb==

In Sufi psychology the heart refers to the spiritual heart or ''qalb'', not the physical organ. It is this spiritual heart that contains the deeper intelligence and wisdom. It holds the [[Divine spark]] or [[spirit]] and is the place of [[gnosis]] and deep spiritual knowledge. In Sufism, the goal is to develop a heart that is sincere, loving and compassionate, and to develop the heart's intelligence, which is deeper, and more grounded than the rational, abstract intelligence of the mind. Just as the physical heart supplies blood to the body, the spiritual heart nourishes the soul with wisdom and spiritual light, and it also purifies the gross personality traits. According to Sufic psychology emotions are from the self or nafs, not from the heart.
The qalb mediates between the Nafs and spirit. Its task is control the nafs and direct the man toward the spirit.

== Ruh ==

The spirit ''[[ruh]]'' is in direct connection with the Divine, even if one is [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] of that connection. The spirit has seven levels or facets of the complete spirit. These levels are: [[mineral]], [[vegetable]], [[animal]], personal, [[human]], secret and secret of secret souls. Each level represents the stages of evolution, and the process that it goes through in its growth. The spirit is [[Holism|holistic]], and extends to all aspects of the person, i.e. the body, the mind and the soul. Each level of the spirit has valuable gifts and strengths, as well as weaknesses. The goal is to develop the strengths and to achieve a balance between these levels, not forgoing the lower ones to focus only on the higher ones. In traditional psychology, [[Ego psychology]] deals with the animal soul, [[Behavioral psychology]] focuses on the conditioned functioning of the vegetable and animal soul, [[Cognitive psychology]] deals with the mental functions of the personal soul, [[Humanistic psychology]] deals with the activities of the human soul and [[Transpersonal psychology]] deals with ego-transcending consciousness of the secret soul and the secret of secret souls.
 
Spirit is beyond the realm of creation. It is directly connected with Alam e Lahoot(Unity of attributes and names) which is from Amr Allah (Command of Allah), Therefore Spirit already knows everything including its own source.

== Happiness in Sufism ==
{{primary sources|section|date=June 2016}}
Sufism aspires towards developing a soft, feeling, compassionate heart. Understanding through the ‘‘heart’s intelligence’’ is superior to understanding through the intelligence of the head. Indeed, the intelligence of the heart is the only instrument that can be used to discover the ultimate truth.&lt;ref name="Joshanloo2012"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2012-12-15|title=A Comparison of Western and Islamic Conceptions of Happiness|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=6|pages=1857–1874|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9406-7|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Sufis, reason is limited in many ways and cannot outgrow its inherent limitations. In particular, when reason denies intuitive knowledge and ‘‘blinds the eye of the heart’’, it becomes the target of strong criticism from Sufism. This stands in stark contrast to the Aristotelian and contemporary western emphasis on logical reasoning as the highest human faculty, which should rule the whole personality. On this basis, happiness cannot be achieved by reason and intellect, rather happiness is pursued via intuition and mystical experience.&lt;ref name="Joshanloo2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joshanloo|first=Mohsen|date=2013-03-21|title=Eastern Conceptualizations of Happiness: Fundamental Differences with Western Views|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=15|issue=2|pages=475–493|doi=10.1007/s10902-013-9431-1|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important concept in Sufism is the ego (the self or the nafs). The ego is a part of our psyche that consistently leads us off the spiritual path, a part of the self which commands us to do evil. The ego can impede the actualization of the spiritual potential of the heart if not controlled by the divine aspects of the personality. To achieve authentic happiness, the ego should be actively fought against throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sufi science of self-realization: A guide to the seventeen ruinous traits, the ten steps to discipleship and the six realities of the heart|last=Kabbani|first=S.

This state refers to the destruction of the individual self to become one with the Divine Being.&lt;ref name="Joshanloo2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshanloo2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Joshanloo2012"/&gt;

==Al-Ghazali==

One of the most influential Sufi psychologists was [[Al-Ghazali]] (1058–1111). He discussed the concept of the [[Self (philosophy)|self]] and the causes of its [[Depression (mood)|misery]] and [[happiness]].

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Questions asked to the group and the response rates:&lt;br&gt;
Is Philadelphia the capital of Pennsylvania?
* Yes: 65%
* No: 35%
What do you think most people will respond to that question?
* Yes: 75%
* No: 25%

The difference between the answers to the ''right'' question and the ''popular'' question:
* Yes: 65% - 75% = -10%
* No: 35% - 25% = 10%

Thus, the ''No'' answer is surprisingly popular (10% &gt; -10%). Because of the relatively high margin of 10%, there can be high confidence that the correct answer is ''No''.

Dr. '''Soyu Matsuoka''' ('''松岡 操雄''', 1912–1997), along with [[Sokei-an]] and [[Nyogen Senzaki]], was one of the early [[Zen]] teachers to make the [[United States]] his home.

==Biography==
Shortly before World War II Matsuoka came to the USA, to serve Japanese immigrants.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=80–81}} He came to be the assistant to the abbott of Zenshuji Temple in Los Angeles, and was later the supervisor at Sokoji Soto Zen Mission (Temple) in San Francisco.

Matsuoka established the Chicago Buddhist Temple in 1949 (now the Zen Buddhist Temple of Chicago). In the 1960s he gathered a following of [[United States|Americans]]. Richard Langlois was one of the first Americans ever to receive [[Dharma transmission]]. In 1970 Matsuoka left Chicago and moved to [[Long Beach, California]], where he continued to preside over other communities. Matsuoka left the Soto-shu,{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=80–81}} Matsuoka holding that Zen is a personal experience, and that the authority of the Soto Sect and its training monasteries (専門僧堂) inhibit the practice of Zen.

Matsuoka died in 1997.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=80–81}}{{sfn|Prebish|1999|p=13}}{{sfn|Williams|Queen|1999|p=118}}

==Dharma heirs==
Matsuoka named many [[Dharma heir]]s, though their qualifications as teachers have been questioned, given the short time of practice required by Matsuoka and the absence of formal ordination.{{sfn|Ford|2006|p=80–81}} According to Kozen Sampson, at least three of Matsuoka's students received inka shomei. These three "were considered to be fully transmitted priests with the status of Roshi by him".&lt;ref name=Samson /&gt; Four students were registered with the Soto-Shu as "initial novice priest", and to five students was conferred "full priesthood".&lt;ref name=Samson&gt;[https://mtadamszen.org/dedication-to-soyu-matsuoka-zenkaku-roshi/ Mount Adams Zen Center, ''Rev. Dr. Soyu Zengaku Matsuoka, Roshi. 25 November 1912 – 20 November 1997'']&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four living Dharma Heirs of Soyu Matsuoka:
* Hogaku Shozen McGuire,
* Zenkai Taiun Michael Elliston,
* Kaiten Johndennis Govert,
* Shogaku Zenshin Stephen Echard Musgrave, who retired from the Zen institute of San Diego due to ill health.

Hogaku established Daibutsuji Zen Temple in Cloudcroft and the [[Zen Center of Las Cruces]], in Las Cruces, New Mexico. So Gozen is now the Abbot of Daibutsuji and the Zen Center of Las Cruces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/cgi-bin/prcdtl.cgi?1372796+DAIBUTSUJI+ZEN+TEMPLE NMPRC.state.nm.us]&lt;/ref&gt;
Daiho Hilbert left Daibutsuji to establish the [[Order of Clear Mind Zen]], a socially engaged sangha in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/cgi-bin/prcdtl.cgi?4313136+ORDER+OF+CLEAR+MIND+ZEN NMPRC.state.nm.us]&lt;/ref&gt;
Taiun Elliston Sensei established the Atlanta Soto Zen Center and is working to establish an order honoring Matsuoka.

Tao is renowned for his witty and humorous teaching style. "Philosophy of Love" and "Death and Immorality" are popular courses among students in the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

=== "Philosophy of Love" ===

"Analyze love in a solemn philosophical way" ({{zh|labels=no|t="把愛情當做哲學命題進行嚴肅分析"}})&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; is what Tao aimed to do when he started the course "Philosophy of Love". In philosophy, topics like freedom, death and democracy are widely discussed in depth. Yet, people rarely interpret 'love' in philosophy, probably because philosophers are not experienced in love, and that they like to talk about the love in ethics and morality, but not the love between people. Also, it is difficult for philosophers to analyze “Love” as it cannot be explained by theories or other rather rational methods. Therefore, Tao aspired to fill the vacuum in philosophy by investigating the unexplored topic of love.

=== "Death and Immorality" ===

Though death is much discussed in the field of philosophy, it is not brought up to a great concern in Hong Kong, because 'death' is a traditional Chinese taboo word, where people do not usually mention it in public but keep it as a topic to be discussed in private. Being diagnosed with [[nephrosis]] at an early age, Tao particularly sympathizes with the topic of 'death' where he constantly suffers from pain. Since the 1990s, he has been teaching the course “Death and Immorality” and keep modifying it. At first, he attempted to categorize deaths conscientiously, such as chronic disease, suicide, sudden death. Recent years, he switched to a more relaxing and interactive teaching style, in which he would talk about the unfortunate death of male or female protagonists in romantic story, invite masters in Buddhism to share a religious view of death and organize a workshop for students to feel death. Tao has been teaching this course for over twenty years, he concluded his insights about death in a University talk, he said “When people talk about death, it is very easy for them to view it as ‘others’ death, thus neglect its personal meaning. In fact, death is the reflection of humans on their own existence, we should treat it as a memory of life and let it be our motivation to live, it might change your views on the world" ({{zh|labels=no|t="當人們談論死亡時，往往容易將其視為‘他人之死’，而忽視了對於自我的意義。其實，死亡是人類對存在的自我反省，我們應當把它變成一生的感受，同樣也是一生的促進，這樣一來它也許會改變你對世界的看法。"}}).&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Writing style ==
Tao uses terse and clear language to illustrate complex philosophical theories in both Chinese and Western world to readers, such as metaphysics, phenomenal and neo-Confucianism. Since Tao mainly writes about Philosophical theories, he keeps his language in an objective manner and seldom reveals personal feelings in his works. His works are well-structured and served as introductory books to beginners in Philosophy. For instance, in his most up-to-date book ''Post-80s·The Blind Spot of Love'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=《愛的盲點‧80後篇》}}), incorporated simple ideas in Philosophy, Psychology, and Sociology in analysing the development of mentality in the post-1980s generation. Hence, portrays the phenomenon of love in the post-1980s generation and unlocks their sentimental world.

Though Tao uses plain words, his works are poetic and lively, which challenge the perception that Philosophy is meant to be solemn. In ''The Foreignness of Philosophy'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=《哲學的陌生感》}}) , the famous line "Foreignness is the oblivion over a long period of time, they do not know who they are as being long in their bustling real-life. " ({{zh|labels=no|t="陌生是長時間的遺忘，長期在現實生活中營役而不知其所歸向。"}}) &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; reflects Tao's use of simple yet beautiful Chinese in explaining Phenomenon in Philosophy.

'''''The Spear of Destiny: the occult power behind the spear which pierced the side of Christ''''' is a bestselling 1972 popular occult book by the [[anthroposophist]] writer Trevor Ravenscroft (1921-1989), published by Neville Armstrong's Neville Spearman Publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/26/pressandpublishing|title=Neville Armstrong|first=Ian|last=Miller|date=25 September 2008|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ravenscroft claimed that the book was based on research "by using mystical meditation" and on the papers of the Austrian anthroposophist [[Walter Stein]] given to Ravenscroft by his widow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ravenscroft V.

'''Thomas Gisborne''' (31 October 1758 – 24 March 1846) was an English [[Anglican]] priest and poet. He was a member of the [[Clapham Sect]], who fought for the [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition]] of the [[slave trade]] in England.

==Life==
Gisborne was born at Bridge Gate, Derby, the son of [[John Gisborne]] of Yoxhall Lodge in [[Needwood Forest]], Staffordshire and his wife Anne Bateman. He was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and entered [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1776, where he established lifelong friendships with [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Babington]]. At Cambridge, he became the first Chancellor's medallist in 1780.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=GSBN776T|name=Gisborne, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1783 he became curate of [[Barton-under-Needwood]], and later that year inherited [[Yoxall]] Lodge, [[Staffordshire]], which was 3 miles from the church. The next year he married [[Babington family|Mary Babington]] (b. 1760), only sister of Thomas Babington. They had six sons and two daughters. The eldest son, [[Thomas Gisborne the Younger|Thomas Gisborne]] (1794–1852), became a member of parliament, and the fourth son, James, a clergyman, succeeded his father as perpetual curate of Barton in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hole|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gisborne was a central figure in the [[Clapham Sect]], an abolitionist group which included William Wilberforce and Gisborne's brother-in-law Thomas Babington. Yoxall Lodge acted as a major focus of the group, and Wilberforce was a frequent visitor there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hole|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gisborne was appointed [[prebendary]] of [[Durham Cathedral]] in 1823.

[[image:Thomas Gisborne Joseph Wright Derby.jpg|thumb|left|Thomas and Mary Gisborne in a 1786 painting by [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].]]
Gisborne's ''Principles of Moral Philosophy'' (1789) was a forceful [[evangelical]] attack on [[William Paley]]'s ''Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy'' (1785), an influential work studied at both [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Oxford University|Oxford]] Universities, arguing [[morality]] as a [[categorical imperative]] against Paley's [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] standpoint. Gisborne also wrote ''Enquiry into the Duties of Men'' (1795) and ''Enquiry into the Duties of the Female Sex'' (1797) stressing subordination to the divinely imposed social hierarchy. His ''Walks in a Forest'' (1794) was a book of poems describing the scenery of [[Needwood Forest]], which bordered his estate at [[Yoxall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hole|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scriptural geologist==
A [[scriptural geologist]], Gisborne wrote two books which criticised the trend of geology away from a basis in the Bible: ''Testimony of Natural Theology to Christianity'' (1818) and ''Considerations on Modern Theories of Geology'' (1837).

'''''Urdoxa''''' is a [[portmanteau]] of the German prefix ''ur-'' and the [[Ancient Greek]] δόξα (''doxa''), meaning "primary" or "first" doctrine. For [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], the notion of "doxa" meant "opinion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink1=Gilles Deleuze|first1=Gilles|last1=Deleuze|authorlink2=Félix Guattari|first2=Félix|last2=Guattari| title=What is Philosophy? |translator=Hugh Tomlinson |translator2=Graham Burchell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term grew in popular usage in the work of [[Edmund Husserl]] whose phenomenological project was indexed on attempting, via the descriptive method, to ground the notion of a proto-doxa or ''urdoxa'' of experience. The term has since paled in poststructuralist discourse, and usually carries a negative connotation insofar as it assumes a transcendental subjectivity which overly privileges a humanistic conception of Being (see [[Michel Foucault]], ''The Order of Things''). Against such anthropocentricity, the term has fallen into relative disuse.

Two other notable uses of the term have appeared insince the year 2000:{{when|date=November 2015}} a progressive musical ensemble by the name of [[Thork]] produced an album entitled ''Urdoxa'' (2000), and a novel by the Canadian author [[Kane X. Faucher]] also has this term as its title (2004).

"'''What the Tortoise Said to Achilles'''", written by [[Lewis Carroll]] in 1895 for the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', is a brief allegorical dialogue on the foundations of [[logic]]. The title [[allusion|alludes]] to one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's paradoxes of motion]], in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll's dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an [[infinite regression]].

==Summary of the dialogue==
The discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:
* ''A'': "Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other" ([[Euclidean relation]], a weakened form of the [[transitive property]])
* ''B'': "The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same"
* Therefore, ''Z'': "The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other"

The Tortoise asks Achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and Achilles grants that it obviously does. The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether there might be a reader of [[Euclid]] who grants that the argument is ''logically valid'', as a ''sequence'', while denying that ''A'' and ''B'' are true. Achilles accepts that such a reader might exist, and that he would hold that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true, while not yet accepting that ''A'' and ''B'' are true (that is, a reader who denies the premises).

The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that ''A'' and ''B'' are true, but who does ''not'' yet accept the principle that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are both true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true. Achilles grants the Tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist. The Tortoise, then, asks Achilles to treat the Tortoise as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel the Tortoise to accept that ''Z'' must be true. (The tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the [[syllogism]]'s conclusion, structure, or validity.)

After writing down ''A'', ''B'', and ''Z'' in his notebook, Achilles asks the Tortoise to accept the hypothetical:
* ''C'': "If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true"

The Tortoise agrees to accept ''C'', if Achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook, making the new argument:
* ''A'': "Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other"
* ''B'': "The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same"
* ''C'': "If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true"
* Therefore, ''Z'': "The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other"

But now that the Tortoise accepts premise ''C'', it still refuses to accept the expanded argument. When Achilles demands that "If you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'', you must accept ''Z''," the Tortoise remarks that that's ''another'' hypothetical proposition, and suggests even if it accepts ''C'', it could still fail to conclude ''Z'' if it did not see the truth of:
* ''D'': "If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' are true, ''Z'' must be true"

The Tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once Achilles writes it down, but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows, since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true, ''Z'' must be true:
{{quote|"And at last we've got to the end of this ideal racecourse! Now that you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', ''of course'' you accept ''Z''."

"Do I?" said the Tortoise innocently. "Let's make that quite clear. I accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D''. Suppose I ''still'' refused to accept ''Z''?"

"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and ''force'' you to do it!" Achilles triumphantly replied. "Logic would tell you, 'You can't help yourself. Now that you've accepted ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', you must accept ''Z''!' So you've no choice, you see."

"Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth ''writing down''," said the Tortoise. "So enter it in your notebook, please. We will call it
{{block indent|(''E'') If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'' are true, ''Z'' must be true.}}

Until I've granted that, of course I needn't grant ''Z''. So it's quite a necessary step, you see?"

"I see," said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.}}

Thus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:
* (1): "Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other"
* (2): "The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same"
* (3): (1) and (2) ⇒ (Z)
* (4): (1) and (2) and (3) ⇒ (Z)
* ...
* (''n''): (1) and (2) and (3) and (4) and ... and (''n'' − 1) ⇒ (''Z'')
* Therefore, (''Z''): "The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other"

At each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)&amp;ndash;(''n'') are true, then (''Z'') must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (''Z'') is true.

==Explanation==
Lewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from ''[[modus ponens]]'' deductions. 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{P \to Q,\; P}{\therefore Q}&lt;/math&gt;
Or, in words: proposition ''P'' (is true) implies ''Q'' (is true), and given ''P'', therefore ''Q''.

The regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once ''that'' principle is explained, ''another'' principle is required to explain ''that'' principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a [[rule of inference]] defined by the system, then it can be abided by simply because it is so. For example, chess has particular rules that simply go without question and players must abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. Likewise, a formal system of logic is defined by rules that are to be followed, by definition, without question. Having a defined formal system of logic stops the infinite regression{{mdash}}that is, the regression stops at the axioms or rules, per se, of the given game, system, etc.

In propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:

P implies Q  if and only if the proposition ''not P or Q'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].

Hence de modus ponens, [P ∧ (P → Q)] ⇒ Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.

In addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.

Some logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the [[material conditional|conditional connective]] and the [[Logical consequence|implication relation]]. These logicians use the phrase ''not p or q'' for the conditional connective and the term ''implies'' for an asserted implication relation.

==Discussion==
Several philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. [[Bertrand Russell]] discussed the paradox briefly in [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/s.38 § 38 of ''The Principles of Mathematics''] (1903), distinguishing between ''implication'' (associated with the form "if ''p'', then ''q''"), which he held to be a relation between ''unasserted'' propositions, and ''inference'' (associated with the form "''p'', therefore ''q''"), which he held to be a relation between ''asserted'' propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat ''inferring'' ''Z'' from ''A'' and ''B'' as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the ''hypothetical'' "If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, then ''Z'' is true."

The [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] philosopher [[Peter Winch]] discussed the paradox in ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that "the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning ''to do'' something" (p.&amp;nbsp;57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper ''application'' of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of ''further'' rules, and so that "a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts" (p.&amp;nbsp;53).

Carroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to [[conventionalism]] about logical truth,&lt;ref name="Maddy"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Philosophy of Logic | author=[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, P.]] | journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |date=December 2012  | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=481–504 | doi=10.2178/bsl.1804010 | jstor=23316289}}&lt;/ref&gt; later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O.

'''''Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics into Being''''' (hereinafter ''WMCF'') is a book by [[George Lakoff]], a [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguist]], and [[Rafael E. Núñez]], a [[psychologist]]. Published in 2000, ''WMCF'' seeks to found a [[cognitive science of mathematics]], a theory of [[embodied philosophy|embodied]] mathematics based on [[conceptual metaphor]].

==''WMCF'' definition of mathematics==
Mathematics makes up that part of the human conceptual system that is special in the following way:
:"It is precise, consistent, stable across time and human communities, symbolizable, calculable, generalizable, universally available, consistent within each of its subject matters, and effective as a general tool for description, explanation, and prediction in a vast number of everyday activities, [ranging from] sports, to building, business, technology, and science." (''WMCF'', pp. 50, 377)

Nikolay Lobachevsky said "There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world." A common type of [[conceptual blending]] process would seem to apply to the entire mathematical procession.

== Human cognition and mathematics ==
Lakoff and Núñez's avowed purpose is to begin laying the foundations for a truly scientific understanding of mathematics, one grounded in processes common to all human cognition. They find that four distinct but related processes [[metaphor]]ically structure basic arithmetic: object collection, object construction, using a measuring stick, and moving along a path.

''WMCF'' builds on earlier books by Lakoff (1987) and Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), which analyze such concepts of [[metaphor]] and image schemata from second-generation [[cognitive science]].  Some of the concepts in these earlier books, such as the interesting technical ideas in Lakoff (1987), are absent from ''WMCF''.

Lakoff and Núñez hold that mathematics results from the human cognitive apparatus and must therefore be understood in cognitive terms. ''WMCF'' advocates (and includes some examples of) a ''cognitive idea analysis'' of [[mathematics]] which analyzes mathematical ideas in terms of the human experiences, metaphors, generalizations, and other cognitive mechanisms giving rise to them. A standard mathematical education does not develop such idea analysis techniques because it does not pursue considerations of A) what structures of the mind allow it to do mathematics or B) the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

Lakoff and Núñez start by reviewing the psychological literature, concluding that human beings appear to have an innate ability, called [[subitizing]], to count, add, and subtract up to about 4 or 5. They document this conclusion by reviewing the literature, published in recent decades, describing experiments with infant subjects. For example, infants quickly become excited or curious when presented with "impossible" situations, such as having three toys appear when only two were initially present.

The authors argue that mathematics goes far beyond this very elementary level due to a large number of [[metaphor]]ical constructions. For example, the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] position that all is number, and the associated crisis of confidence that came about with the discovery of the irrationality of the [[square root of two]], arises solely from a metaphorical relation between the length of the diagonal of a square, and the possible numbers of objects.

Much of ''WMCF'' deals with the important concepts of [[infinity]] and of limit processes, seeking to explain how finite humans living in a finite world could ultimately conceive of the [[actual infinite]]. Thus much of ''WMCF'' is, in effect, a study of the [[epistemology|epistemological]] foundations of the [[calculus]]. Lakoff and Núñez conclude that while the [[potential infinite]] is not metaphorical, the actual infinite is. Moreover, they deem all manifestations of actual infinity to be instances of what they call the "Basic Metaphor of Infinity", as represented by the ever-increasing sequence 1, 2, 3, ...

''WMCF'' emphatically rejects the [[Platonism|Platonistic]] [[philosophy of mathematics]]. They emphasize that all we know and can ever know is ''human mathematics'', the mathematics arising from the human intellect. The question of whether there is a "transcendent" mathematics independent of human thought is a meaningless question, like asking if colors are transcendent of human thought—colors are only varying wavelengths of light, it is our interpretation of physical stimuli that make them colors.

''WMCF'' (p.&amp;nbsp;81) likewise criticizes the emphasis mathematicians place on the concept of [[closure (mathematics)|closure]]. Lakoff and Núñez argue that the expectation of closure is an artifact of the human mind's ability to relate fundamentally different concepts via metaphor.

''WMCF'' concerns itself mainly with proposing and establishing an alternative view of mathematics, one grounding the field in the realities of human biology and experience. It is not a work of technical mathematics or philosophy. Lakoff and Núñez are not the first to argue that conventional approaches to the philosophy of mathematics are flawed. For example, they do not seem all that familiar with the content of Davis and [[Reuben Hersh|Hersh]] (1981), even though the book warmly acknowledges Hersh's support.

Lakoff and Núñez cite [[Saunders Mac Lane]] (the inventor, with [[Samuel Eilenberg]], of [[category theory]]) in support of their position. ''[[Mathematics, Form and Function]]'' (1986), an overview of mathematics intended for philosophers, proposes that mathematical concepts are ultimately grounded in ordinary human activities, mostly interactions with the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;See especially the table in Mac Lane (1986), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Educators have taken some interest in what ''WMCF'' suggests about how mathematics is learned, and why students find some elementary concepts more difficult than others.

==Examples of mathematical metaphors==
[[Conceptual metaphor]]s described in ''WMCF'', in addition to the Basic Metaphor of Infinity, include:
*[[Arithmetic]] is motion along a path, object collection/construction;
*Change is motion;
*[[Set (mathematics)|Sets]] are containers, objects;
*[[continuous function|Continuity]] is gapless;
*Mathematical systems have an "essence," namely their [[axiom]]atic [[algebraic structure]];
*[[Function (mathematics)|Function]]s are sets of [[ordered pair]]s, curves in the [[Cartesian plane]];
*Geometric figures are objects in space;
*[[Logical independence]] is geometric [[orthogonal]]ity;
*[[Number]]s are sets, object collections, physical segments, points on a line;
*Recurrence is circular.
Mathematical reasoning requires [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] ranging over some [[universe of discourse]], so that we can reason about generalities rather than merely about particulars. ''WMCF'' argues that reasoning with such variables implicitly relies on what it terms the Fundamental [[Metonymy]] of Algebra.

==Example of metaphorical ambiguity==
''WMCF'' (p.&amp;nbsp;151) includes the following example of what the authors term "metaphorical ambiguity." Take the set &lt;math&gt;A = \{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset, \{\emptyset\}\}\}.&lt;/math&gt; Then recall two bits of standard terminology from [[naive set theory|elementary set theory]]:
#The [[recursively enumerable set|recursive]] construction of the [[Set-theoretic definition of natural numbers|ordinal natural numbers]], whereby 0 is &lt;math&gt;\empty&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n \cup \{n\}.&lt;/math&gt;
#The [[ordered pair]] (''a,b''), defined as &lt;math&gt;\{\{a\},\{a,b\}\}.&lt;/math&gt;
By (1), ''A'' is the set {1,2}. But (1) and (2) together say that ''A'' is also the ordered pair (0,1). Both statements cannot be correct; the [[ordered pair]] (0,1) and the unordered pair {1,2} are fully distinct concepts. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) term this situation "metaphorically ambiguous." This simple example calls into question any [[platonism|Platonistic]] foundations for mathematics.

While (1) and (2) above are admittedly canonical, especially within the consensus [[set theory]] known as the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axiomatization]], ''WMCF'' does not let on that they are but one of several definitions that have been proposed since the dawning of set theory. For example, [[Frege]], ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', and [[New Foundations]] (a body of [[axiomatic set theory]] begun by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]] in 1937) define [[cardinal number|cardinals]] and [[ordinal number|ordinals]] as [[equivalence class]]es under the [[relation (mathematics)|relations]] of [[equinumerosity]] and [[ordinal number|similarity]], so that this conundrum does not arise. In Quinian set theory, ''A'' is simply an instance of the number 2. For technical reasons, defining the ordered pair as in (2) above is awkward in Quinian set theory. Two solutions have been proposed:
*A variant set-theoretic definition of the ordered pair more complicated than the usual one;
*Taking ordered pairs as primitive.

==The Romance of Mathematics==
The "Romance of Mathematics" is ''WMCF''{{'}}s light-hearted term for a perennial philosophical viewpoint about mathematics which the authors describe and then dismiss as an intellectual myth:
* Mathematics is transcendent, namely it exists independently of human beings, and structures our actual physical [[universe]] and any possible universe. Mathematics is the language of nature, and is the primary conceptual structure we would have in common with extraterrestrial aliens, if any such there be.
*[[Mathematical proof]] is the gateway to a realm of transcendent truth.
* [[Reasoning]] is [[logic]], and logic is essentially mathematical. Hence mathematics structures all possible reasoning.
* Because mathematics exists independently of human beings, and reasoning is essentially mathematical, reason itself is disembodied. Therefore, [[artificial intelligence]] is possible, at least in principle.

It is very much an open question whether ''WMCF'' will eventually prove to be the start of a new school in the [[philosophy of mathematics]]. Hence the main value of ''WMCF'' so far may be a critical one: its critique of [[Platonism]] and romanticism in mathematics.

== Critical response ==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{Original research section|date=March 2010}}
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2007}}}}

Many working mathematicians resist the approach and conclusions of Lakoff and Núñez. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060716051333/perso.unifr.ch/rafael.nunez/reviews.html Reviews] by mathematicians of ''WMCF'' in professional journals, while often respectful of its focus on conceptual strategies and metaphors as paths for understanding mathematics, have taken exception to some of the ''WMCF''{{'}}s philosophical arguments on the grounds that mathematical statements have lasting 'objective' meanings. For example, [[Fermat's last theorem]] means exactly what it meant when [[Fermat]] initially proposed it 1664. Other reviewers have pointed out that multiple conceptual strategies can be employed in connection with the same mathematically defined term, often by the same person (a point that is compatible with the view that we routinely understand the 'same' concept with different metaphors). The [[metaphor]] and the conceptual strategy are not the same as the formal [[definition]] which mathematicians employ. However, ''WMCF'' points out that formal definitions are built using words and symbols that have meaning only in terms of human experience.

Critiques of ''WMCF'' include the humorous:
:"It's difficult for me to conceive of a metaphor for a real number raised to a complex power, but if there is one, I'd sure like to see it." — Joseph Auslander&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe&gt;[http://www.sutcliffe.com/blog/?m=200709 What is the Nature of Mathematics?], Michael Sutcliffe, referenced February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
and the physically informed:

:"But their analysis leaves at least a couple of questions insufficiently answered. For one thing, the authors ignore the fact that brains not only observe nature, but also are part of nature. Perhaps the math that brains invent takes the form it does because math had a hand in forming the brains in the first place (through the operation of natural laws in constraining the evolution of life). Furthermore, it's one thing to fit equations to aspects of reality that are already known. It's something else for that math to tell of phenomena never previously suspected. When Paul Dirac's equations describing electrons produced more than one solution, he surmised that nature must possess other particles, now known as antimatter. But scientists did not discover such particles until after Dirac's math told him they must exist. If math is a human invention, nature seems to know what was going to be invented."&lt;ref name=Sutcliffe/&gt;

Lakoff made his reputation by linking [[linguistics]] to [[cognitive science]] and the analysis of [[metaphor]]. Núñez, educated in [[Switzerland]], is a product of [[Jean Piaget]]'s school of [[cognitive psychology]] as a basis for logic and mathematics. Núñez has thought much about the foundations of [[real analysis]], the [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s, and the Basic Metaphor of Infinity. These topics, however, worthy though they be, form part of the superstructure of mathematics. Cognitive science should take more interest in the [[foundations of mathematics]]. And indeed, the authors do pay a fair bit of attention early on to [[logic]], [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] and the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms]], even lingering a bit over [[group theory]]. But neither author is well-trained in [[first-order logic|logic]] (there is no index entry for "[[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]" or "quantification"), the philosophy of set theory, the [[axiomatic method]], [[metamathematics]], and [[model theory]]. Nor does ''WMCF'' say enough about the derivation of [[number system]]s (the [[Peano axioms]] go unmentioned), [[abstract algebra]], [[equivalence relation|equivalence]] and [[partial order|order]] relations, [[mereology]], [[topology]], and [[geometry]].

Lakoff and Núñez tend to dismiss the negative opinions mathematicians have expressed about ''WMCF'', because their critics do not appreciate the insights of cognitive science. Lakoff and Núñez maintain that their argument can only be understood using the discoveries of recent decades about the way human brains process language and meaning. They argue that any arguments or criticisms that are not grounded in this understanding cannot address the content of the book.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020613231421/http://www.unifr.ch/perso/nunezr/warning.html |date=June 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been pointed out that it is not at all clear that ''WMCF'' establishes that the claim "intelligent alien life would have mathematical ability" is a myth. To do this, it would be required to show that intelligence and mathematical ability are separable, and this has not been done. On Earth, intelligence and mathematical ability seem to go hand in hand in all life-forms, as pointed out by [[Keith Devlin]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Keith|last=Devlin|title=The Math Instinct / Why You're a Mathematical Genius (Along with Lobsters, Birds, Cats and Dogs)|year=2005|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|isbn=1-56025-839-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of ''WMCF'' have not explained how this situation would (or even could) be different anywhere else.

Lakoff and Núñez also appear not to appreciate the extent to which [[intuitionist]]s and [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]]s have anticipated their attack on the Romance of (Platonic) Mathematics. [[Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|Brouwer]], the founder of the [[intuitionist]]/[[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] point of view, in his dissertation ''On the Foundation of Mathematics'', argued that mathematics was a mental construction, a free creation of the mind and totally independent of logic and language. He goes on to upbraid the formalists for building verbal structures that are studied without intuitive interpretation. Symbolic language should not be confused with mathematics; it reflects, but does not contain, mathematical reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=David M.|last=Burton|title=The History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=7th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=712|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-338315-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summing up==
''WMCF'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;378–79) concludes with some key points, a number of which follow. Mathematics arises from our bodies and brains, our everyday experiences, and the concerns of human societies and cultures. It is:
*The result of normal adult cognitive capacities, in particular the capacity for conceptual metaphor, and as such is a human universal. The ability to construct [[conceptual metaphor]]s is neurologically based, and enables humans to reason about one domain using the language and concepts of another domain. [[Conceptual metaphor]] is both what enabled mathematics to grow out of everyday activities, and what enables mathematics to grow by a continual process of analogy and abstraction;
*[[Symbol]]ic, thereby enormously facilitating precise calculation;
*Not transcendent, but the result of human [[evolution]] and [[culture]], to which it owes its effectiveness. During experience of the world a connection to mathematical ideas is going on within the human mind;
*A system of human concepts making extraordinary use of the ordinary tools of human cognition;
*An open-ended creation of human beings, who remain responsible for maintaining and extending it;
*One of the greatest products of the collective human imagination, and a magnificent example of the beauty, richness, complexity, diversity, and importance of human ideas.

The cognitive approach to [[formal system]]s, as described and implemented in ''WMCF'', need not be confined to mathematics, but should also prove fruitful when applied to formal logic, and to formal philosophy such as [[Edward Zalta]]'s [http://mally.stanford.edu/theory.html theory of abstract objects]. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) fruitfully employ the cognitive approach to rethink a good deal of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], [[metaphysics]], and the [[history of ideas]].

{{Buzzword|date=September 2014}}
The '''wisdom of the crowd''' is the collective opinion of a group of individuals rather than that of a single expert.

A large group's aggregated answers to questions involving quantity estimation, general world knowledge, and spatial reasoning has generally been found to be as good as, but often superior to, the answer given by any of the individuals within the group. An explanation for this phenomenon is that there is idiosyncratic noise associated with each individual judgment, and taking the average over a large number of responses will go some way toward canceling the effect of this noise.&lt;ref name="WoC-Combi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yi|first=Sheng Kung Michael|last2=Steyvers|first2=Mark|last3=Lee|first3=Michael  D.|last4=Dry|first4=Matthew  J.|date=April 2012|title=The Wisdom of the Crowd in Combinatorial Problems|url=|journal=[[Cognitive Science]]|volume=36|issue=3|pages=452–470|doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2011.01223.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process, while not new to the [[Information Age]], has been pushed into the mainstream spotlight by social information sites such as [[Wikipedia]], [[Yahoo! Answers]], [[Quora]], [[Stack Exchange]] and other web resources that rely on human opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Baase, Sara (2007). ''A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet''. 3rd edition. Prentice Hall. pp. 351–357. {{ISBN|0-13-600848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trial by jury can be understood as wisdom of the crowd, especially when compared to the alternative, trial by a judge, the single expert. In politics, sometimes [[sortition]] is held as an example of what wisdom of the crowd would look like. [[Decision-making]] would happen by a diverse group instead of by a fairly homogenous political group or party.

Research within [[cognitive science]] has sought to model the relationship between wisdom of the crowd effects and individual cognition.

==Definition of crowd==
{{original research section|date=June 2016}}
In the context of wisdom of the crowd, the term "crowd" takes on a broad meaning. One definition characterizes a crowd as a group of people amassed by an open call for participation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prpić|first=John|last2=Shukla|first2=Prashant P.|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan H.|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-01-01|title=How to work a crowd: Developing crowd capital through crowdsourcing|url=|journal=Business Horizons|volume=58|issue=1|pages=77–85|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2014.09.005|arxiv=1702.04214}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While crowds are often leveraged in online applications, they can also be utilized in offline contexts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In some cases, members of a crowd may be offered monetary incentives for participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Wisdom of the crowd|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/438281a|journal=Nature|volume=438|issue=7066|pages=281–281|doi=10.1038/438281a|bibcode=2005Natur.438..281.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain applications of "wisdom of the crowd", such as jury duty in the United States, mandate crowd participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/judge-extols-wisdom-of-juries/article_8dad172c-2521-11e4-8891-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Judge extols wisdom of juries|last=modonnell@journalnet.com|first=Michael H. O’Donnell|work=Idaho State Journal|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Aristotle is credited as the first person to write about the "wisdom of the crowd" in his work titled ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~pswpc/pdfs/ober/090901.pdf|title=An Aristotelian middle way between deliberation and independent-guess aggregation|last=Ober|first=Josiah|date=September 2009|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Collective wisdom : principles and mechanisms|last=Landemore|first=Hélène|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107010338|editor-last=Landemore|editor-first=Hélène|location=Cambridge|pages=|chapter=Collective Wisdom—Old and New|oclc=752249923|editor-last2=Elster|editor-first2=Jon|chapter-url=https://assets.cambridge.org/97811070/10338/excerpt/9781107010338_excerpt.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, "it is possible that the many, though not individually good men, yet when they come together may be better, not individually but collectively, than those who are so, just as public dinners to which many contribute are better than those supplied at one man's cost".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle: ''Politics'' III.1281b.

The classic wisdom-of-the-crowds finding involves point estimation of a continuous quantity. At a 1906 country fair in [[Plymouth]], 800 people participated in a contest to estimate the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician [[Francis Galton]] observed that the [[median]] guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Galton | first1 = F. | authorlink = Francis Galton | year = 1907 | title = Vox populi | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 450–451 | doi=10.1038/075450a0| bibcode = 1907Natur..75..450G}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has contributed to the insight in cognitive science that a crowd's individual judgments can be modeled as a [[probability distribution]] of responses with the median centered near the true value of the quantity to be estimated.&lt;ref name="Surowiecki"&gt;Surowiecki, James. ''[[The Wisdom of Crowds]]''. Doubleday, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-385-50386-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the "wisdom of the crowd" phenomenon has been leveraged in business strategy and advertising spaces. Firms such as Napkin Labs aggregate consumer feedback and brand impressions for clients. Meanwhile, companies such as Trada invoke crowds to design advertisements based on clients' requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/business/smallbusiness/05sbiz.html|title=Tapping the Wisdom of the Crowd|last=Rich|first=Laura|date=2010-08-04|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-human examples are prevalent.  For example, the [[Golden Shiner]] is a fish that prefers shady areas.  The single Shiner has a very difficult time finding shady regions in a body of water whereas a large group is much more efficient at finding the shade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/31/the-real-wisdom-of-the-crowds/|title=The Real Wisdom of the Crowds|date=2013-01-31|website=Phenomena|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems==
Wisdom-of-the-crowds research routinely attributes the superiority of crowd averages over individual judgments to the elimination of individual noise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benhenda, Mostapha |title=A Model of Deliberation Based on Rawls’s Political Liberalism |journal=Social Choice and Welfare |ssrn=1616519 |volume=36 |pages=121–178 |year=2011 |doi=10.1007/s00355-010-0469-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; an explanation that assumes [[independence]] of the individual judgments from each other.&lt;ref name="Surowiecki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vul-Pashler"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vul | first1 = E. | last2 = Pashler | first2 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Measuring the Crowd Within: Probabilistic Representations Within Individuals | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 19 | issue = 7| pages = 645–647 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the crowd tends to make its best decisions if it is made up of diverse opinions and ideologies.

[[Scott E. Page]] introduced the diversity prediction theorem: "The squared error of the collective prediction equals the average squared error minus the predictive diversity". Therefore, when the diversity in a group is large, the error of the crowd is small.&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite book|last=Page|first=Scott E.|title=The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies|year=2007|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-13854-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller and Stevyers reduced the independence of individual responses in a wisdom-of-the-crowds experiment by allowing limited communication between participants. Participants were asked to answer ordering questions for general knowledge questions such as the order of U.S. presidents. For half of the questions, each participant started with the ordering submitted by another participant (and alerted to this fact), and for the other half, they started with a random ordering, and in both cases were asked to rearrange them (if necessary) to the correct order. Answers where participants started with another participant's ranking were on average more accurate than those from the random starting condition. Miller and Steyvers conclude that different item-level knowledge among participants is responsible for this phenomenon, and that participants integrated and augmented previous participants' knowledge with their own knowledge.&lt;ref name="WoC-Communi"&gt;Miller, B., and Steyvers, M. (in press). "The Wisdom of Crowds with Communication". In L. Carlson, C. Hölscher, &amp; T.F. Shipley (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society''. Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowds tend to work best when there is a correct answer to the question being posed, such as a question about geography or mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/175380/the-wisdom-of-crowds-by-james-surowiecki/|title=The Wisdom of Crowds|work=randomhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When there is not a precise answer crowds can come to arbitrary conclusions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The wisdom of the crowd effect is easily undermined. Social influence can cause the average of the crowd answers to be wildly inaccurate, while the geometric mean and the median are far more robust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/108/22/9020.full.pdf+html "How Social Influence can Undermine the Wisdom of Crowd Effect"]. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments run by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology found that when a group of people were asked to answer a question together they would attempt to come to a consensus which would frequently cause the accuracy of the answer to decrease.  i.e. what is the length of a border between two countries?  One suggestion to counter this effect is to ensure that the group contains a population with diverse backgrounds.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140708-when-crowd-wisdom-goes-wrong|title=‘Wisdom of the crowd’: The myths and realities|last=Ball|first=Philip|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analogues with individual cognition: the "crowd within"==

The insight that crowd responses to an estimation task can be modeled as a sample from a [[probability distribution]] invites comparisons with individual cognition. In particular, it is possible that individual cognition is probabilistic in the sense that individual estimates are drawn from an "internal probability distribution." If this is the case, then two or more estimates of the same quantity from the same person should average to a value closer to ground truth than either of the individual judgments, since the effect of [[statistical noise]] within each of these judgments is reduced. This of course rests on the assumption that the noise associated with each judgment is (at least somewhat) [[statistically independent]]. Another caveat is that individual probability judgments are often biased toward extreme values (e.g., 0 or 1). Thus any beneficial effect of multiple judgments from the same person is likely to be limited to samples from an unbiased distribution.&lt;ref name="Vul-Pashler"/&gt;

Vul and Pashler (2008) asked participants for point estimates of continuous quantities associated with general world knowledge, such as "What percentage of the world's airports are in the United States?" Without being alerted to the procedure in advance, half of the participants were immediately asked to make a second, different guess in response to the same question, and the other half were asked to do this three weeks later. The average of a participant's two guesses was more accurate than either individual guess. Furthermore, the averages of guesses made in the three-week delay condition were more accurate than guesses made in immediate succession. One explanation of this effect is that guesses in the immediate condition were less independent of each other (an [[anchoring]] effect) and were thus subject to (some of) the same kind of noise. In general, these results suggest that individual cognition may indeed be subject to an internal probability distribution characterized by stochastic noise, rather than consistently producing the best answer based on all the knowledge a person has.&lt;ref name="Vul-Pashler"/&gt; These results were mostly confirmed in a high-powered pre-registered replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steegen|first1=S|last2=Dewitte|first2=L|last3=Tuerlinckx|first3=F|last4=Vanpaemel|first4=W |title=Measuring the crowd within again: A pre-registered replication study|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2014|volume=5|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00786}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only result that was not fully replicated was that a delay in the second guess generates a better estimate.

Hourihan and Benjamin (2010) tested the hypothesis that the estimate improvements observed by Vul and Pashler in the delayed responding condition were the result of increased independence of the estimates. To do this Hourihan and Benjamin capitalized on variations in [[memory span]] among their participants. In support they found that averaging repeated estimates of those with lower memory spans showed greater estimate improvements than the averaging the repeated estimates of those with larger memory spans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hourihan | first1 = K. L. | last2 = Benjamin | first2 = A. S. | year = 2010 | title = Smaller is better (when sampling from the crowd within): Low memory-span individuals benefit more from multiple opportunities for estimation | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1068–1074 | doi=10.1037/a0019694| pmc = 2891554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rauhut and Lorenz (2011) expanded on this research by again asking participants to make estimates of continuous quantities related to real world knowledge – however, in this case participants were informed that they would make five consecutive estimates. This approach allowed the researchers to determine, firstly, the number of times one needs to ask oneself in order to match the accuracy of asking others and then, the rate at which estimates made by oneself improve estimates compared to asking others. The authors concluded that asking oneself an infinite number of times does not surpass the accuracy of asking just one other individual. Overall, they found little support for a so-called “mental distribution” from which individuals draw their estimates; in fact, they found that in some cases asking oneself multiple times actually reduces accuracy. Ultimately, they argue that the results of Vul and Pashler (2008) overestimate the wisdom of the “crowd within” – as their results show that asking oneself more than three times actually reduces accuracy to levels below that reported by Vul and Pashler (who only asked participants to make two estimates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rauhut|first=H|author2=Lorenz |title=The wisdom of the crowds in one mind: How individuals can simulate the knowledge of diverse societies to reach better decisions|journal=Journal of Mathematical Psychology|year=2011|volume=55|pages=191–197|doi=10.1016/j.jmp.2010.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Müller-Trede (2011) attempted to investigate the types of questions in which utilizing the “crowd within” is most effective. He found that while accuracy gains were smaller than would be expected from averaging ones’ estimates with another individual, repeated judgments lead to increases in accuracy for both year estimation questions (e.g., when was the thermometer invented?) and questions about estimated percentages (e.g., what percentage of internet users connect from China?). General numerical questions (e.g., what is the speed of sound, in kilometers per hour?), however, did not show improvement with repeated judgments, while averaging individual judgments with those of a random other did improve accuracy. This, Müller-Trede argues, is the result of the bounds implied by year and percentage questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Müller-Trede|first=J.|title=Repeated judgment sampling: Boundaries.|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2011|volume=6|pages=283–294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Dolder and Van den Assem (2018) studied the "crowd within" using a large database from three estimation competitions organised by Holland Casino. For each of these competitions, they find that within-person aggregation indeed improves accuracy of estimates. Furthermore, they also confirm that this method works better if there is a time delay between subsequent judgments. However, even when there is considerable delay between estimates, the benefit pales against that of between-person aggregation: the average of a large number of judgements from the same person is barely better than the average of two judgements from different people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Dolder|first=Dennie|last2=Assem|first2=Martijn J. van den|date=2018|title=The wisdom of the inner crowd in three large natural experiments|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0247-6|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En| volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–26 | doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0247-6|issn=2397-3374 | lay-url=http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3099179|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialectical Bootstrapping: Improving the estimates of the “crowd within”===

Herzog and Hertwig (2009) attempted to improve on the “wisdom of many in one mind” (i.e., the “crowd within”) by asking participants to use dialectical bootstrapping. Dialectical bootstrapping involves the use of [[dialectic]] (reasoned discussion that takes place between two or more parties with opposing views, in an attempt to determine the best answer) and [[bootstrapping]] (advancing oneself without the assistance of external forces). They posited that people should be able to make greater improvements on their original estimates by basing the second estimate on [[Antithesis|antithetical]] information. Therefore, these second estimates, based on different assumptions and knowledge than that used to generate the first estimate would also have a different error (both [[Systematic error|systematic]] and [[Random error|random]]) than the first estimate – increasing the accuracy of the average judgment. From an analytical perspective dialectical bootstrapping should increase accuracy so long as the dialectical estimate is not too far off and the errors of the first and dialectical estimates are different. To test this, Herzog and Hertwig asked participants to make a series of date estimations regarding historical events (e.g., when electricity was discovered), without knowledge that they would be asked to provide a second estimate. Next, half of the participants were simply asked to make a second estimate. The other half were asked to use a consider-the-opposite strategy to make dialectical estimates (using their initial estimates as a reference point). Specifically, participants were asked to imagine that their initial estimate was off, consider what information may have been wrong, what this alternative information would suggest, if that would have made their estimate an overestimate or an underestimate, and finally, based on this perspective what their new estimate would be. Results of this study revealed that while dialectical bootstrapping did not outperform the wisdom of the crowd (averaging each participants’ first estimate with that of a random other participant), it did render better estimates than simply asking individuals to make two estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herzog|first=S. M.|author2=Hertwig, R. |title=The wisdom of many in one mind: Improving individual judgments with dialectical bootstrapping.|journal=Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=20|pages=231–237|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02271.x|pmid=19170937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirt and Markman (1995) found that participants need not be limited to a consider-the-opposite strategy in order to improve judgments. Researchers asked participants to consider-an-alternative – operationalized as any plausible alternative (rather than simply focusing on the “opposite” alternative) – finding that simply considering an alternative improved judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hirt | first1 = E.

Not all studies have shown support for the “crowd within” improving judgments. Ariely and colleagues asked participants to provide responses based on their answers to true-false items and their confidence in those answers. They found that while averaging judgment estimates between individuals significantly improved estimates, averaging repeated judgment estimates made by the same individuals did not significantly improve estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ariely | first1 = D. | last2 = Au | first2 = W.

==Higher-dimensional problems and modeling==
Although classic wisdom-of-the-crowds findings center on point estimates of single continuous quantities, the phenomenon also scales up to higher-dimensional problems that do not lend themselves to aggregation methods such as taking the mean. More complex models have been developed for these purposes. A few examples of higher-dimensional problems that exhibit wisdom-of-the-crowds effects include:
* Combinatorial problems such as [[minimum spanning tree]]s and the [[traveling salesman problem]], in which participants must find the shortest route between an array of points. Models of these problems either break the problem into common pieces (the ''local decomposition method'' of aggregation) or find solutions that are most similar to the individual human solutions (the ''global similarity aggregation'' method).&lt;ref name="WoC-Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yi, S.K.M., Steyvers, M., Lee, M.D., and Dry, M. (2010). Wisdom of Crowds in Minimum Spanning Tree Problems. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ordering problems such as the order of the U.S. presidents or world cities by population. A useful approach in this situation is [[Thurstonian model]]ing, which each participant has access to the ground truth ordering but with varying degrees of [[stochastic]] [[Statistical noise|noise]], leading to variance in the final ordering given by different individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lee|first=Michael D.|last2=Steyvers|first2=Mark|last3=de Young|first3=Mindy|last4=Miller|first4=Brent|date=January 2012|title=Inferring Expertise in Knowledge and Prediction Ranking Tasks|url=|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|volume=4|pages=151–163|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2011.01175.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=M.

* [[Multi-armed bandit]] problems, in which participants choose from a set of alternatives with fixed but unknown reward rates with the goal of maximizing return after a number of trials. To accommodate mixtures of decision processes and individual differences in probabilities of ''winning and staying'' with a given alternative versus ''losing and shifting'' to another alternative, [[hierarchical Bayesian model]]s have been employed which include parameters for individual people drawn from [[Gaussian]] distributions&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, S., and Lee, M.D., (2010).

Ohlsson (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society'', pp. 1118–1123. Austin, TX: Cognitive Science Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New developments==
===Surprisingly popular===
In further exploring the ways to improve the results a new technique called the "[[surprisingly popular]]" was developed by scientists at MIT's Sloan Neuroeconomics Lab in collaboration with Princeton University. For a given question, people are asked to give two responses: What they think the right answer is, and what they think popular opinion will be. The averaged difference between the two indicates the correct answer. It was found that the "surprisingly popular" algorithm reduces errors by 21.3 percent in comparison to simple majority votes, and by 24.2 percent in comparison to basic confidence-weighted votes where people express how confident they are of their answers and 22.2 percent compared to advanced confidence-weighted votes, where one only uses the answers with the highest average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Prelec | first1 = Dražen | last2 = Seung | first2 = H.

{{nihongo|'''''Zenrin-kushū'''''|禪林句集|, meaning "Anthology of Passages from the Forests of Zen"}} is a collection of writings used in the [[Rinzai school]] of [[Zen]]. Initially it was a compilation of Zen writings by [[Tōyō Eichō]] (東陽榮朝, 1428-1504) a disciple of [[Kanzan Egen]] of the [[Myōshin-ji]] line of Rinzai school in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. Tōyō's anthology consisted of 5,000 writings compiled from writings of various traditions, such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen]], and the poetry of [[Tang poetry|Tang]] and [[Sung poetry|Sung]] China.&lt;ref&gt;Shigematsu, p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The original sources include the [[Blue Cliff Record]], [[The Gateless Gate]], the [[Sutra]]s, [[Analects|The Analects]], [[Great Learning|The Great Learning]], [[Doctrine of the Mean|The Doctrine of the Mean]], writings by [[Mencius]], [[Laozi]] and [[Zhuang Zhou]], and the poetry of [[Hanshan (poet)|Hanshan]], [[Tao Yuanming]], [[Du Fu]], [[Li Bai]], and [[Bai Juyi]], among others. Tōyō arranged the writings in order of length, from single- to eight-character expressions, interspersing parallel verses of five through eight characters.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, p.389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blyth, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

This was known as the Ku Zōshi (''The Phrase Book''), and circulated in manuscript form until the 17th century, when [[Ijūshi]] published for the first time in 1688 an expanded version of the book, titled Zenrin-kushū.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, p.201&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that at least since the time of [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (1685-1788) the Zenrin-kushū has been used as part of the [[kōan]] practice, as the [[jakugo]] or capping verses - responses by students to problems given to them by their teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Baroni, p.389&lt;/ref&gt;
