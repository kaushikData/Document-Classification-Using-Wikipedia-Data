'''''Algemeen Handelsblad''''' was an influential [[Amsterdam]]-based [[Liberalism|liberal]] daily [[newspaper]] published between 1828 and 1970. 

==History and profile==
''Algemeen Handelsblad'' was founded in 1828&lt;ref name=cordula&gt;{{cite book|author=Cordula Rooijendijk|title=That City is Mine!: Urban Ideal Images in Public Debates and City Plans, Amsterdam &amp; Rotterdam 1945-1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pW9ZAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=9 December 2014|year=2005|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-5629-382-6|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[J.W. van den Biesen]], a [[stock broker]].&lt;ref name=amst&gt;{{cite web|title=Algemeen Handelsblad Newspaper|url=http://www.amsterdamtourism.net/algemeen_handelsblad.html|publisher=Amsterdam Tourism|accessdate=19 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150119192349/http://www.amsterdamtourism.net/algemeen_handelsblad.html|archivedate=19 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper aimed at providing news about [[trade]], [[Share (finance)|share holding]] and [[banking]].&lt;ref name=amst/&gt; Later its coverage was expanded to cover political news.&lt;ref name=amst/&gt;

At the peak of its influence—from the time of the [[Boer War]], when it championed the [[Boer]] cause in [[South Africa]], through [[World War I]] -- it was edited by [[Charles Boissevain]]. The paper had a [[Liberalism in the Netherlands|liberal]] stance.&lt;ref name=cordula/&gt;

''Algemeen Handelsblad'' merged in 1970 with the [[Rotterdam]]-based liberal daily newspaper ''[[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant]]'' into the ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]''.&lt;ref name=cordula/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRC Handelsblad|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/medienindex/media_articles/?frommedia=241|publisher=Euro Topics|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3240">The '''Biblioteca Europea di Informazione e Cultura''' ('''BEIC''', "European library of information and culture") is an ongoing project based in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] for the realization of a new modern [[library]]. It began in the late nineties, when [[Antonio Padoa-Schioppa]] submitted the idea for the first time to the City of Milan and the [[Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities|Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beic.it/it/articoli/genesi-e-sviluppi-del-progetto-1996-2011|title=Genesi e sviluppi del progetto (1996-2011) - www.beic.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library will be split in two main units: physical and virtual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beic.it/it/articoli/il-sistema-beic|title=Il sistema BEIC - www.beic.it|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bung language''' is a nearly extinct, [[endangered language]] of [[Cameroon]] spoken by 3 people (in 1995) at the village of Boung on the [[Adamawa Plateau]].&lt;ref name=connell&gt;[http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/dz/connell/Mori/Moribundlngs.html Bruce Connell, 1997: Moribund Languages of the Nigeria-Cameroon Borderland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814144719/http://lucy.ukc.ac.uk/dz/connell/Mori/Moribundlngs.html |date=2004-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is remembered best by one speaker who learned the language at a young age, though it is not their mother tongue. A wordlist shows its strongest resemblance to be with the Ndung dialect of [[Mambiloid languages|Mambiloid language]] [[Kwanja language|Kwanja]], although that may simply be because this has become the dominant language of the village where Bung's last speakers reside.&lt;ref name=connell/&gt; It also has words in common with other Mambiloid languages such as [[Tep language|Tep]], [[Somyev language|Somyev]] and [[Vute language|Vute]], while a number of words' origins remain unclear (possibly [[Adamawa languages|Adamawan]]).&lt;ref name=connell/&gt; For lack of data, it is [[unclassified language|not definitively classified]].

The '''Chapel of St Michael''' more popularly known in [[Maltese language|Maltese]] as '''Il-Kappella tas-San Ċir''' or '''Il-Kappella ta' San Mikiel is Sanċir''' is a medieval chapel located in the limits of [[Rabat, Malta]] in an area referred to as ''Ġnien is-Sultan'' (King's Garden).

==Origins==
The chapel's architecture dates back to the middle of the [[15th century]]. The first mention of the chapel is found in a report written by Bishop Pietro Dusino when he visited Malta in 1575. The report refers to the church as the church of St Michael in the garden of ''Ġnien is-Sultan''. The chapel was mentioned numerous times through the years, notably in 1615 when Bishop [[Baldassare Cagliares]] described the painting of St Michael located in the church as barely recognizable, indicating the poor state of the chapel. In 1598 Bishop Gargallo mentions that the feast of St Michael was celebrated every September 29 with vespers, which were attended by the local farmers. Due to its neglected state, in 1678 Bishop [[Miguel Jerónimo de Molina]] deconsecrated the church and ordered that the painting of St Michael be transferred to the parish church of Rabat.&lt;ref&gt;Spiteri, Mikiel (2000).

[[File:Interior_of_San_Mikiel_is-Sancier.jpg|230px|thumb|left|Interior of the chapel]]

==Use as a stable==
After the chapel fell in disrepair it was used as a stable and storage space by local farmers. A wall was built inside the chapel to divide it in two sections.

==Restoration==
In 1981 the chapel was restored and the wall that divided the chapel was demolished. The chapel was restored by volunteers from the Sanċir Trust and volunteers from the National Students Travel Foundation and the Friends of Malta. A stone altar was built and the church was reopened for religious services on October 2, 1988. The [[President of Malta]], [[Ugo Mifsud Bonnici]] attended the opening service. The service was led by Monsignor Gwann Azzopardi who was a benefactor of the chapel's restoration.

==Present day==
In the 30 years since the church was restored, it has fallen into disuse and disrepair and is in danger of collapsing. Vegetation has grown on the walls of the chapel and trees have blocked the main entrance of the chapel. Part of the roof near the altar has collapsed, and cracks in the chapel's walls are visible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130512/local/chapel.469441 "NGO calls for rehabilitation of chapel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919000539/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130512/local/chapel.469441 |date=2016-09-19 }}, ''[[Times of Malta]]'', Malta, 12 May 2014.

Retrieved on 18 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior==
The interior of the chapel is quite bare. The interior is one spacious room with the walls built in the form of pointed arches, typical to medieval architecture in Malta. There is one stone altar. During the restoration of the 1980s, stone benches were discovered along the wall of the chapel. The chapel can be accessed by two doors. A [[Graffiti]] of a ship, which was discovered on the walls of the chapel, is probably some kind of [[Ex-voto]].

==Name of the chapel== 
The chapel's origins may date to the  Byzantine era, as evidenced by the chapel's name, ''Is-Sanċir''. According to Professor Stanley Fiorini, the name ''is-Sanċir'' may indicate that the chapel was dedicated to [[Cyriacus the Anchorite]], a Greek saint. After the Moors were driven out of Malta, Christianity regained its power over Malta. Western Latin Christianity was spreading, replacing any traces of the Greek Christianity in Malta,which dated from Byzantine times. As a result, the names of churches in Malta which had been dedicated to Greek saints were replaced by the names of popular Western saints. Thus, the name of this chapel might have been changed from St Cyriacus (''San Ċirijaku'' or ''San Ċir'' in Maltese) to St Michael (''San Mikiel''). It is possible that the local people referred to the chapel by its original name, hence the name ''San Mikiel Is-Sanċir'' or literal translation in English, St Michael the St Cyr. However, no documentation survives to prove this theory.&lt;ref&gt;Ciantar, Noel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1946">The '''Commission on Global Governance''' was an organization co-chaired by [[Sweden|Swedish]] Prime Minister [[Ingvar Carlsson]], and former [[Commonwealth Secretary-General]] [[Shridath Ramphal]], that produced a controversial report, ''[[Our Global Neighborhood]]'', in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf166/ngo/950307140407.htm SPEECH BY MINISTER JAN PRONK AT THE WORLD SUMMIT FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT]&lt;/ref&gt;  The report was attacked by pro-[[sovereignty]] groups for calling for [[United Nations]] reforms that would increase its power. It also was criticized by [[world government|world federalist]]s who disliked the terminology of "[[global governance]]", which seemed clunkier than "world federalism."

The Commission was established in 1992 with the full support of [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Boutros Boutros-Ghali]].

The Commission made a standard definition of [[global governance]] stating that “Governance is the sum of many ways individuals and institutions, public and private, manage their common affairs. It is a continuing process through which conflicting or diverse interests may be accommodated and co-operative action taken. It includes formal institutions and regimes empowered to enforce compliance, as well as informal arrangements that people and institutions either have agreed to or perceive to be in their interest”&lt;ref&gt;The Commission on Global Governance, ''Our Global Neighbourhood'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dietrich III''' was [[Count of Cleves]] from 1172 through 1188. He was the son of Dietrich II, Count of Cleves, and Adelaide, daughter of Gebhard III of Sulzbach. 

The County of Cleves ({{lang-de|Grafschaft Kleve}}; {{lang-nl|Graafschap Kleef}}) was a [[comity|comital]] polity of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in present [[Germany]] (part of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]) and the [[Netherlands]] (parts of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Noord-Brabant]] and [[Gelderland]]). Its rulers, called [[counts]], had a special and privileged standing in the Empire. The County of Cleves  was first mentioned in the 11th century. In 1417, the [[county]] became a [[duchy]] ({{lang-de|Herzogtum Kleve}}; {{lang-nl|Hertogdom Kleef}}), and its rulers were raised to the status of [[Duke]]s.

Its history is closely related to that of its neighbours: the Duchies of [[Duchy of Jülich|Jülich]], [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[Guelders]] and the [[County of Mark]]. In 1368, Cleves and Mark were united. In 1521 Jülich, Berg, Cleves and Mark formed the [[United Duchies of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]].  The territory was situated on both sides of the river [[Rhine]], around its capital [[Cleves]] and roughly covering today's [[Cleves (district)|districts of Cleves]], [[Wesel (district)|Wesel]] and the city of [[Duisburg]].

According to the German, Dutch and French Wikipedia there was only one Dietrich between 1172 and 1198. This Dietrich was the son of Dietrich II and Adelaide of Sulzbach and was married to Margaret of Holland. This would make Dietrich III and Dietrich IV the same person.

'''Eldgjá''' ({{IPA-is|ˈɛltcau|-|Is-Eldgjá pronunciation.ogg}}, "fire canyon") is a [[volcano]] and a [[canyon]]  in [[Iceland]]. Eldgjá and the [[Katla volcano|Katla]] volcano are part of the same volcanic system in the south of the country.

Situated between [[Landmannalaugar]] and [[Kirkjubæjarklaustur]], Eldgjá is the largest volcanic canyon in the world, approx. 40 km long, 270 m deep and 600 m wide at its greatest.

==History==
It was discovered by [[Þorvaldur Thoroddsen]] in 1893. 

The first documented eruption in 939&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |  url=http://www.volcanocafe.org/eldgja-eruption-dating | title=Eldgja: Eruption dating |date = 29 September 2016 | access-date=1 January 2017 | author=Albert Zijlstra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oppenheime|first1=Clive|last2=et al|title=The Eldgjá eruption: timing, long-range impacts and influence on the Christianisation of Iceland|journal=Climatic Change|date=19 March 2018|doi=10.1007/s10584-018-2171-9|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10584-018-2171-9|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the largest [[flood basalt]] in historic time.

Summer average temperatures in places as disparate as [[Central Europe]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Canada]], [[Alaska]], and [[Central Asia]] were 2°C lower than normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/03/180319090740.htm|title=Volcanic eruption influenced Iceland's conversion to Christianity|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, a team of medieval historians and scientists from the [[University of Cambridge]] suggested that a famous medieval Icelandic poem, [[Völuspá|Vǫluspá]], estimated to date from 961, was a roughly contemporary chronicle of Eldgjá's eruption in 939.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://icelandmonitor.mbl.is/news/nature_and_travel/2018/03/19/10th_century_eldgja_eruption_thought_to_have_influe/|title=10th century Eldgjá eruption thought to have influenced Christianisation of Iceland|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers suggested that the dramatic imagery of Eldgjá's eruption was purposefully invoked in order to accelerate the [[Christianization of Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/science/935196/iceland-volcano-eruption-news-eldgja-volcano|title=Iceland volcano ERUPTION: Scientists make shock discovery about Eldgja volcanic apocalypse|last=Kettley|first=Sebastian|date=2018-03-21|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/how-a-volcanic-outburst-1-000-years-ago-was-so-brutal-it-slayed-gods-ragnarok-norse-voluspa-eldgja|title=A Volcanic Explosion 1,000 Years Ago Was So Brutal, It Slayed Icelandic Gods|last=Dockrill|first=Peter|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a waterfall named [[Ófærufoss]] within the canyon. A [[Natural arch|natural bridge]] across the waterfall vanished in 1993, reportedly due to excess water from melting ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://icelandreview.com/stuff/ask-ir/2007/08/28/can-you-tell-me-what-happened-natural-stone-bridge-over-ofaerufoss-eldgja|title=Can you tell me what happened to the natural stone bridge over Ófaerufoss at Eldgjá?|last=Review|first=Iceland|date=2007-08-28|work=Iceland Review|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern part of Eldgjá, including Ófærufoss, and surrounding areas, have been a part of [[Vatnajökull National Park]] since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ósnortin víðerni og einstakar jarðmyndanir|url=http://www.umhverfisraduneyti.is/frettir/nr/1858|publisher=Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources|accessdate=24 March 2014|language=Icelandic|date=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">The '''Ellsworth–Whitmore Mountains''' ('''EWM''') is the innermost of the four or five [[allochthon]]ous [[terrane]]s, or tectonic blocks, that form [[West Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|Pankhurst|2008|loc=4.3 West Antarctica&lt;!-- PDF pages 17–18 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  EWM was located in an [[embayment]] off [[Natal (region)|Natal]], [[South Africa]], before the break-up of [[Gondwana]] during which it was rotated 90° anticlockwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Randall|Mac Niocaill|2004|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The EWM is named for the [[Ellsworth Mountains|Ellsworth]] and [[Whitmore Mountains|Whitmore]] mountain ranges.

The EWM was deformed during Gondwanan [[Late Permian]]–[[Late Jurassic]] [[Orogeny|orogenic events]] and is underlain by [[Grenville orogeny|Grenvillan]] crust that much older than the amalgamation of Gondwana.  A 90° anticlockwise rotation of the EWM during the Gondwana break-up is supported by [[Paleomagnetism|palaeomagnetic]] data from several primary [[remanence]]s: the [[Late Cambrian]] [[Frazier Ridge|Frazier Ridge Formation]] and the [[Nash Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Randall|Mac Niocaill|2004|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the crustal blocks of West Antarctica and [[Zealandia]] remained enigmatic for decades largely because of their locations on the Pacific margin of Gondwana from where they were transported large distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grunov|Dalziel|Kent|1987|loc=West Antarctica and the Pacific Margin of Gondwanaland, pp. 161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The EWM formed part of Gondwana's southern margin, Earth's longest and most long-lived [[active margin]].  Stretching from South America over South Africa, West Antarctica, [[Victoria Land]], New Zealand, and Eastern Australia, this margin was the location of the {{Convert|18000|km|abbr=on}}-long [[Terra Australis Orogen|Terra Australis orogeny]] that began during the Neoproterozoic break-up of [[Rodinia]] and culminated in the closure of the [[Adamastor Ocean|Adamastor]] and [[Mozambique Ocean|Mozambique]] oceans.  During the Palaeozoic the central part of the southern margin, EWM together with the [[Sierra de la Ventana]] (Argentina) and the [[Cape Fold Belt]] (South Africa), was a [[passive margin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Vaughan|Pankhurst|2008|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ermita del Cristo de la Vega''' is an [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] located in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] ([[Castile-La Mancha]], [[Spain]]) It is built on the remains of the Visigoth Basílica de Santa Leocadia, built in the 7th-century where the apse is preserved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia de las Calles de Toledo| url = http://abierto.toledo.es/open/pom/12%20Catalogo/Fichas/09-Ermita%20Cristo%20Vega.pdf |author=Julio Porres Martín-Cleto.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rest was destroyed in the [[Spanish War of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Historia de las Calles de Toledo| url = http://abierto.toledo.es/open/pom/12%20Catalogo/Fichas/09-Ermita%20Cristo%20Vega.pdf |author=Julio Porres Martín-Cleto.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1816-1826, it rebuilt the building and the new image of the Christ, dating from its present structure, and since then has been used as a hermitage under the invocation of the Cristo de la Vega.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= #19 Ermita del Cristo de la Vega| url = http://ilovetoledo.es/es/ver/ermita-del-cristo-de-la-vega/ |author=http://ilovetoledo.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is located in Vega Baja de Toledo, in the old [[cemetery]] area of the city.

During the Visigothic period, was held in the interior "the Councils", ecclesiastical assemblies of bishops who called regularly to legislate or deliberate on religious matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= #19 Ermita del Cristo de la Vega| url = http://ilovetoledo.es/es/ver/ermita-del-cristo-de-la-vega/ |author=http://ilovetoledo.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presbytery is watched over by a sculpture of Christ with one hand free of the crucifixion nails, hero of the famous legend recorded by Zorrilla as "A good judge, a better witness".

In its vicinity were buried the remains of [[Ildefonsus|Saint Idelfonsus]], [[Leocadia|Saint Leocadia]] and [[Eugenius II of Toledo|Saint Eugenius]] and later were moved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= #19 Ermita del Cristo de la Vega| url = http://ilovetoledo.es/es/ver/ermita-del-cristo-de-la-vega/ |author=http://ilovetoledo.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eugênia Anna Santos''' (''Mãe Aninha, Oba Biyi''; [[Salvador, Bahia]], 13 July 1869 - Salvador, 3 January 1938) was a Brazilian [[Mãe-de-santo|Iyalorixá]]. She founded the [[candomblé]] [[Ilê Axé Opó Afonjá]] in Salvador, now considered a National Historic Landmark, and in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name=palmares.gov.br&gt;{{cite web|title=Personalidades Negras – Mãe Aninha|url=http://www.palmares.gov.br/?page_id=9854|publisher=Government of Brazil - Fundação Cultural Palmares|accessdate=13 December 2015|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Santos was born in 1869 to African parents of the [[Gurunsi]] nation.{{Sfn|Bay|Mann|2013|p=193}} She served as the chief female officer, known as ''prioreza'', of the Boa Morte sisterhood and Rosario brotherhood.{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=199}} In 1936, Santos was one of the founders of the Segundo Congresso Afro-Brasileiro.{{Sfn|Lopes|2015|p=207}}

==Legacy==
Santos is remembered for her great leadership qualities and strength.{{Sfn|Lopes|2015|p=207}} Author [[Kim Butler]] states that she "went further than any other priest in transforming the terreiro into an alternative, African world in the heart of Brazil", which "reflected ways in which the [[candomblé]] community was part of the larger Afro-Bahaian community".{{sfn|Butler|1998|p=199}} Darlene Clark Hine and [[Jacqueline McLeod]] credit her with moving the "candomblé out of the shadows by opening the doors of her terreiro to the international community".{{sfn|Hine|McLeod|1999|p=128}}

The Municipal School Eugenia Anna dos Santos was established in her name in 1978 to cater for nursery children aged 6 months to 5 years, and from 1986, for elementary children from 1st to 4th grade.{{Sfn|Wolhuter|Wet|2014|p=163}}

The '''European Law Moot Court''' ('''ELMC''') is an annual [[moot court]] competition between rival teams of university students who have an interest in [[European Union law]].

The competition consists of a written round, regional finals, and an Europe-wide final. During the written round the teams of three or four students write two legal pleadings (one each for the applicant and respondent). From these written pleadings the teams are scored and the 48 highest scoring teams proceed to one of the four regional finals across the globe for oral hearings. One team from each regional final goes on to the all-European final where the four regional final winning teams argue before the judges of the [[European Court of Justice]] in [[Luxembourg]].

In addition, one member from each team at the regional finals can participate in the competition as the representative of the [[European Commission]] or [[Advocate-General]] of the European Court of Justice and is eligible to receive a separate award for his or her effort at the all-European finals. There is also a special award for the best oral speaker and the best written pleadings.

The motto of the competition is "moot, meet and compete".

'''''Going Nowhere Slowly''''' was a [[South Africa]]n travel-orientated television series, that attained [[Cult following|cult status]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Stuart Taylor|publisher=HDS Entertainment|location=South Africa|url=http://www.hdsentertainment.co.za/stuart-taylor/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105163859/http://www.hdsentertainment.co.za/stuart-taylor/|archivedate=5 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows a number of off beat travellers as they cruise across [[Southern Africa]], in an old American muscle car (usually a '1966s [[Chevrolet Impala]] known as the ''Chilli Pepper''). Along the way, the characters share their thoughts and experiences, many times ending up in sticky situations, such as running out of gas, falling out of moving cars and with the occasional injury they move through the least travelled spots to find the unique and crazy people who bring the magic to those destinations.

The show was completely unscripted. The travelers covered a total of 150 000&amp;nbsp;km in 176 episodes through the following countries: South Africa, [[Namibia]], [[Zambia]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Botswana]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Malawi]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Madagascar]].

The show launched some of the actors into careers as comedians, the well remembered characters include [[Vivienne Vermaak]], [[Stuart Taylor (comedian)|Stuart Taylor]],&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; [[Marc Lottering]], [[Ian Roberts (South African actor)|Ian Roberts]] and [[Fiona Coyne (presenter)|Fiona Coyne]].

The programme aired on [[SABC3]] from 2005 to 2009. After its initial season in 2005, it was renewed by the SABC for an additional 153 Episodes over six more Seasons, the series ended in 2009 having airing 176 episodes in seven Seasons . In the United States, it was syndicated for broadcast on [[The Africa Channel]]. A book for the second season, ''[[Red Car Diaries]]'', was published in 2006. This hit show syndicated across the planet, became the most successful travel documentary out of Africa.{{Citation needed|reason=use of a superlative|date=January 2014}}

During and after the last couple of seasons, the production company [[Big Blue Productions]] attempted to take the programme concept globally.{{Citation needed|reason=forecasting?|date=January 2014}}

==History==
HEPCO was established and registered in 1972, with the intention of assembly &amp; production of road construction equipments.&lt;ref name=BYI/&gt; In 1975 HEPCO resumed operation in its premises in [[Arak, Iran|Arak]] consistory of 1000,000 square meters of land &amp; 40,000 square meters of production hall in collaboration with licencors; namely : International Harvester, [[Dynapac]], [[Poclain]], Sakai &amp; [[Lokomo]] .

In 1984, HEPCO development project was designed in collaboration with [[Liebherr Group|Liebherr]] &amp; [[Volvo]] companies, aiming at fabrication of steel structures of road construction equipments.

The project recalled for construction of a 60,000 square meter hall and installation of numbers of modern cutting, welding and milling machines, capable of production 2100 units of equipments, in the first phase. In 1993, HEPCO Engineering &amp; Parts was established, enabling HEPCO to produce more parts and component locally (other that steel structures).

As there was ample capacity in fabrication hall, from 1996 on the Company gradually engaged in fabrication of parts and components for industrial projects, as power stations, oil, gas and petrochemical complexes, portal cranes, etc. The capabilities thus gained, was later consolidated in a new Company in 2002 Energy Equipment Production Co. (Teta), fully owned by HEPCO. Today, HEPCO, together with its subsidiaries, and in collaboration with its world partners is active in production, supply and support of road construction mining  and industrial projects.

Today HEPCO has close cooperation with companies Like: [[Volvo]], [[Komatsu Limited|Komatsu]], [[Liebherr Group|Liebherr]], [[New Holland Agriculture|Newholland]], [[XCMG]], [[Ingersoll Rand]], [[Case IH]], [[Deutz AG|Deutz]], Berco Carraro, [[Bosch Rexroth|Rexroth]] and Sauer.

'''Hucbert''' (820 - 864) was a [[Franks|Frank]] and son of [[Boso the Elder]]. Therefore, he was a [[Bosonid]]. His sister was [[Teutberga]], who married [[Lothair II]], a prince of the [[Carolingian dynasty]], the imperial family of [[Francia]]. Hucbert was lay-abbot of the [[St. Maurice's Abbey|Abbey of Saint Maurice-in-Valais]].

Lothair's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain a divorce from his wife Theutberga,  and his relations with his uncles [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Louis the German]] were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavor. Lothair, whose desire for the divorce was prompted by his affection for his mistress [[Waldrada of Lotharingia|Waldrada]], put away Theutberga, but Hucbert took up arms on her behalf.

Hucbert is the father of [[Theobald of Arles]] (c. 854 - c. 895).

[[File:Sex ratio below 15 per country smooth 2.png|thumb|450px|Sex ratio by country for population aged below 15. Red represents &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;more girls&lt;/span&gt;, blue &lt;span style="color:Blue;"&gt;more boys&lt;/span&gt; than the world average of 1.06 males/females.]]
[[File:Sex ratio over 65 per country smooth 2.png|thumb|450px|Sex ratio by country for population aged above 65. Red represents &lt;span style="color:red;"&gt;more women&lt;/span&gt;, blue &lt;span style="color:Blue;"&gt;more men&lt;/span&gt; than the world average of 0.79 males/females.]]
The [[human sex ratio]] is the number of males for each female in a population. This is a list of sex ratios by country or region.

== Methodology ==
The table's data is derived from ''[[The World Factbook]]'',&lt;ref name="cia"&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2018.html&lt;/ref&gt; except when otherwise indicated. It shows the male to female sex ratio as estimated by the United States' [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. However, there are differences between the estimates by ''The World Factbook'' and numbers reported by the census offices of respective countries. The world average for the ratio of males/females is 1.01, which means there are 1.01 males for every female (more males than females).

For example, ''The World Factbook'' in 2001 reported Switzerland's sex ratio at birth as 1.05,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europe-Switzerland-People-Sex Ratio-at birth|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sz.html|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Switzerland's Federal Office of Statistics in 2011 reported Switzerland's sex ratio at birth as 1.07 per its birth records census data.&lt;ref name=CHactual&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistical Data on Switzerland 2011, see page 6 for sex ratio at birth | url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/themen/00/01/blank/02.html | publisher=Switzerland Federal Statistics Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar differences between estimates by "The World Factbook" and census numbers from birth records are known for Sweden, Norway, Ireland, India and Japan.

A ratio above 1, e.g. 1.1, means there are 1.1 males for every 1 female (more males than females). A ratio below 1, e.g. 0.8, means there are 0.8 males for every 1 female (more females than males). A ratio of 1 means there are equal numbers of females and males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World Factbook 2010 (CIA’s 2009 Editthan ion)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6UgzYKpcZIC&amp;lpg=PT99&amp;ots=1-oEihUeli&amp;dq=sex%20ratio%20CIA%20numbers&amp;pg=PT99#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20ratio%20CIA%20numbers&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4874">The '''National Library of the Republic of Mauritius''', has been entrusted by law as the national institution responsible for collecting, bibliographically recording, preserving and making available the nation’s [[collective memory]]. It provides information on practically all branches of knowledge and function as a center of coordination, planning and stimulation of the country’s [[library]] system. The institution was established by the Government under the National Library Act, 1996 (Act No. 32) as a [[body corporate]], under the Ministry of Arts and Culture. The National Library of the Republic of Mauritius was officially opened to the public in January 2000.

==Vision==
The National Library of the Republic of Mauritius aims to be a top class library in the provision of [[information service]]s to the nation, thus contributing to its development.

==Mission statement==
The National Library would provide equal access to information to all [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] nationals, thus leveling educational opportunities and deepening the [[democratization]] process. The objectives of the National Library are to promote and encourage the use of library materials; to acquire  new library materials generally, and, in particular, materials relating to Mauritius; to lend library materials to the public; to participate in planning library services in Mauritius; to promote research in library fields and provide assistance in information handling techniques; to act as the national bibliographic center and maintain the national [[bibliography]]; to act as an organizing agency for national and international lending and exchange of library materials; and to initiate and promote cooperation between the library and other libraries, both at national and international levels.

==Role of the National Library of Mauritius==
The main role of the National Library of Mauritius is to build a comprehensive collection of our national heritage by collecting, receiving and preserving all [[publication]]s and productions, printed and produced in Mauritius for present and future generations. The main source of acquisition is by means of the [[legal deposit]] system as per the National Library Act 1996 which stipulates that every printer in Mauritius is required to deposit, free of charge, with the Director of the National Library six copies of each publication, be it a book, periodical, report, newspaper or any other printed document. The same rule applies to all the producers in Mauritius who have to deposit six copies of any non-print materials produced. To ensure that access is given to the most comprehensive collection of [[Mauritiana]] materials, the National Library has to acquire all print and non-print materials published and printed abroad, whose subject matter is related to Mauritius. The National Library is also responsible to build a collection of foreign reference materials on different subjects of interest for the benefit of the Mauritian public at large. As an apex institution in the field of information in Mauritius, the National Library functions as a central institution for coordination, planning and development of the entire [[library system]] of Mauritius.

==Holdings==
The National Library’s Mauritius collection consists of materials in various formats such as: written or graphic records, typescripts, books, newspapers, periodicals, music scores, photographs, maps, drawings, and non-print materials such as films, filmstrips, audiovisual items including tapes, discs and reproductions relating to any subject and produced in Mauritius or relating to Mauritius and produced overseas.  The Library's holdings totaled 510,000 as of 2014-15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdnl.info/sites/default/files/docs/reports/2015_Annual_Report_Mauritius_2014_15.pdf|title=National Library (Republic of Mauritius), Annual Report to CDNL 2014-15|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subject coverage includes: [[agriculture]], [[architecture]], [[biography]], [[computer science]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[handicraft]], [[history]], [[language]]s, [[literature]], [[politics]], pure and applied sciences, [[religion]] and so on. Our holdings also comprise rare documents namely bluebooks, almanacs, administrative reports, National Assembly debates, manuscripts, theses/dissertations, government gazettes, newspapers, and other documents dating back to 1777.

'''''Prince Bob''''' (''Bob herceg'') is an [[operetta]] in three acts by [[Jeno Huszka|Jenő Huszka]]. The [[libretto]] was written by [[Ferenc Martos]] and [[Károly Bakonyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Huska|author=Andrew Lamb|access-date=17 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==
The operetta premiered on 20 December 1902 at [[Népszínház]] in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] and is considered to be Huszka's first critical success.

==Synopsis==
The story concerns a young prince named George. However, he does not enjoy his princely duties and does not love the princess to whom he is betrothed, so he and his friend sneak out to [[London]] for some fun ("Londonban, hej"). He uses a [[pseudonym]], Bob. In London, he meets the pretty Annie, a poor girl. She does not know that he is the prince in disguise. The story is about how George becomes king, and the romances between George and Annie and between his betrothed princess and a soldier.

==Films==
It was filmed by [[László Kalmár]] in 1941 and produced for TV in 1972.

The '''Sliema Batteries''' ({{lang-mt|Batteriji ta' Tas-Sliema}}) were a series of [[artillery battery|artillery batteries]] in [[Sliema]], [[Malta]], that were built by Maltese insurgents during the [[Siege of Malta (1798–1800)|French blockade]] of 1798–1800. They were the first in [[Fortifications of Malta#French occupation (1798–1800)|a chain of batteries, redoubts and entrenchments]] encircling the French positions in [[Marsamxett Harbour|Marsamxett]] and the [[Grand Harbour]].

The batteries were built by [[Vincenzo Borg]]. The following batteries are known to have existed:&lt;ref name=lloyd1811&gt;{{cite book|title=The Appeals of the Nobility and People of Malta to the Justice, Public Faith, and Policy of the British Government, for the Fulfillment of the Conditions Upon which They Gave Up Their Island to the King, Namely Their Ancient Rights Under a Free Constitution|date=1811|publisher=R.

*'''Imrabat Battery''': This was armed with two or four mortars. It had an underground casemate (similar to the one at [[Għargħar Battery]]) and a gun crew shelter. It was surrounded by extensive walls and had a bastion.
* '''Ischina Battery''': This was a small battery equipped with an 18-pounder, and was situated in a field known as ''ta' Xini''. It was possibly located at Fond Għadir, close to where [[Sliema Point Battery]] was later built. Vincenzo Borg often stood guard at this battery.
*'''Sqaq Kappara Battery''': This battery overlooked and bombarded [[Fort Manoel]].
*Six walled positions along present day Main Street, including two batteries at Għar il-Lembi, armed with two and three guns.
Other batteries known as ''tal-Blat'' and ''ta' Sbiese'' also existed.

The Sliema batteries still existed in 1811, but like the other French blockade fortifications, they were dismantled, possibly sometime after 1814. No traces of the batteries can be seen today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spiteri|first1=Stephen C.|title=Maltese ‘siege’ batteries of the blockade 1798–1800|journal=Arx – Online Journal of Military Architecture and Fortification|date=May 2008|issue=6|pages=41–43|url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|accessdate=30 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6hBuv3cHQ?url=http://www.militaryarchitecture.com/images/stories/Arx/arx6-2008.pdf|archivedate=1 May 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stereotypes and generalizations about [[Africa|Africans]] and their [[Culture of Africa|culture]] have evolved within the [[Western world]] since the years of colonial settlement, particularly after slavery became a heritable racial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/africa-stereotype-article-1.1197466|title=The Africa Stereotype|website=Nydailynews.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/africa-beyond-the-stereotypes-73190999/|title=Africa: Beyond the Stereotypes|website=Smithsonianmag.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmag.unict.it/Public/Uploads/links/Stereotypes%20and%20prejudice%20toward%20Africans%20in%20univ%20students.pdf |format=PDF |title=WCPCG 2013 : The relationship between stereotypes and prejudice toward the Africans in Italian university students |author1=Rossella Falanga |author2=Maria Elvira De Carolia |author3=Elisabetta Sagone |website=Fmag.uniict.it |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=myLOFYZ4dQ0C&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=Stereotypes+of+Africans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWsaf2h_XTAhWpC8AKHc-8BtQQ6AEISTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes+of+Africans&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on Africa: A Reader in Culture, History and Representation|first1=Roy Richard|last1=Grinker|first2=Stephen C.|last2=Lubkemann|first3=Christopher|last3=Steiner|date=17 May 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|accessdate=16 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xSqIrrswbG0C&amp;pg=PA485&amp;dq=Stereotypes+of+Africans&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWsaf2h_XTAhWpC8AKHc-8BtQQ6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Stereotypes+of+Africans&amp;f=false|title=African Sexualities: A Reader|first=Sylvia|last=Tamale|date=23 June 2011|publisher=Fahamu/Pambazuka|accessdate=16 May 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Common stereotypes==

===One country===

One of the common misperceptions of Africa is that it is a single country as opposed to [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Africa|54 countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118600/america-must-stop-stereotyping-africa-continent-animals|title=Americans Think Africa Is One Big Wild Animal Reserve|website=Newrepublic.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/07/world/africa/africa-is-not-a-country-campaign/index.html|title='Africa is not a country': Campaign dispels stereotypes|first=Teo Kermeliotis, for|last=CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/28/africans-worry-how-africa-portrayed-western-media |title=Why Africans worry about how Africa is portrayed in western media &amp;#124; Remi Adekoya &amp;#124; Opinion |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== One language ====
Similarly, many believe Africans speak 'African' and that 'African' is an actual language. In reality, African as a language does not exist; over 2000 [[Languages of Africa|distinct languages]] are currently spoken throughout the continent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Backwardness===
[[File:Lagos.png|thumb|[[Lagos]] is a city in [[Nigeria]]. With a population of 21 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/this-is-africas-new-biggest-city-lagos-nigeria-population-21-million/259611/|title=This Is Africa's New Biggest City: Lagos, Nigeria, Population 21 Million|last=Campbell|first=John|date=10 July 2012|website=[[The Atlantic]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the largest city in Africa.|alt=5 photos of buildings in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. With a population of 21 million, it is the largest city in Africa.|265x265px]]
==== Poverty ====
A common misconception is that the continent is the epicentre of a primitive culture and poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/08/stereotyping-of-africans-is-everywhere-but-australians-are-particularly-clueless|title=Stereotyping of Africans is everywhere, but Australians are particularly clueless|date=7 March 2016|website=Theguardian.com|accessdate=16 May 2017|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/tech/2017-02/09/content_28144901.htm|title=Young Africans embrace Chinese gadgets, shatter stereotypes  - Business |website=Chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/news-views/africa-by-the-africans-034#axzz4hGgdHalT|title=AFRICA BY THE AFRICANS: Young Tastemakers Aim to Challenge Stereotypes - EBONY|website=Ebony.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newafricanmagazine.com/erasing-stereotypes-africa/|title=Erasing stereotypes about Africa - New African Magazine|date=13 January 2015|website=Newafricanmagazine.com|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voicesofafrica.co.za/dispelling-stereotypes-about-africans/|title=Dispelling stereotypes about Africans - Voices of Africa|date=3 February 2014|website=Voicesofafrica.co.za|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/fighting-stereotypes-with-stories/a-36433960|title=Fighting stereotypes with stories - Africa - DW.COM - 18.11.2016|website=DW.COM|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While a number of countries in Africa are indeed poor, many countries in Africa have thriving and prosperous economies, including [[Economy of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Economy of Nigeria|Nigeria]], and [[Economy of Kenya|Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bremmem |first1=Nur |title=7 African countries with booming ecommerce markets |url=http://ventureburn.com/2014/12/7-african-countries-booming-ecommerce-markets/ |website=Ventureburn |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Technology ====
Africans are often perceived as having "no access to modern technology" but this is inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/africans-are-all-poor-and-15-other-myths/|title=15 Reasons African Countries Aren't 'Shitholes'|last=Kelland|first=Zoe|last2=Sanchez|first2=Erica|date=12 January 2018|website=Global Citizen|publisher=Global Poverty Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, 80% of Africans could access a [[mobile phone]] in 2013. [[Internet in Africa|Internet usage across Africa]] has also grown by 20% in 2018, with penetration rates across [[North Africa]] of 59%, [[West Africa]] of 39%, and [[Southern Africa]] of 51%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/02/06/digital-in-2018-africa-s-internet-users-increase-by-20-percent//|title=Digital in 2018: Africa's internet users increase by 20% {{!}} Africanews|last=AfricaNews|work=Africanews|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Urbanisation ====
Many people falsely believe that all Africans live in "mud house[s] in the middle of nowhere".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In reality, 43% of the continent's population dwells in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/270860/urbanization-by-continent/|title=Urbanization in 2018, by continent|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Crime===
====Fraud====

A common [[Stereotypes of Nigerians|stereotype]] is that [[Nigerians]] commit [[Internet fraud|online fraud]]. The most well-known Nigerian scam is the [[Advance-fee scam]].

===Wildlife===

Another mistaken belief about Africa is that [[Fauna of Africa|wild animals]] are commonplace. While there are many large wild animals (such as lions) in Africa, many citizens of African countries typically don't see these types of animals outside of zoos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.socialstudies.org/publications/ssyl/march-april2008/beyond_wildlife_teaching_about_africa_and_stereotypes|title=Beyond Wildlife: Teaching about Africa and Stereotypes|date=12 April 2016|website=Socialstudies.org|accessdate=16 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Televisão Pública de Angola E.P.''' or '''TPA''' is the national broadcaster of the Southern [[Africa|African]] state of [[Angola]]. It also operates an international channel '''TPA Internacional'''. TPA is headquartered in the capital city [[Luanda]] and broadcasts in [[Portuguese language]]. The international channel broadcasts selected shows targeted at foreign audiences and the Angolan community abroad.

TPA1 is currently the only state-owned broadcaster in Angola following the arrival of private channels [[TV Zimbo]] and [[Palanca TV]] and the privatization of TPA2.

==History==
Prior to TPA's establishment, there were some experiments made in colonial-era Angola: the first was made in 1962, from Rádio Clube do Huambo. On January 8, 1964, Rádio Clube de Benguela made the second experiment, and then, on June 22, 1970, Luanda tested television for the first time.

Televisão Pública de Angola was founded on June 27, 1973 as '''Radiotelevisão Portuguesa de Angola''' from [[Government of Portugal|Portuguese government]] authorities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tpa.ao/artigo.aspx?sid=eb8eb85a-e984-4b92-9324-22f35e2f9475&amp;cntx=LGs9L0SGj6h3fLc9epT1tXZgIp3%2BbMhOKXTneaEaxyA%3D{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first television signal launched on October 18, 1975 in [[Luanda]]. Less than a year after the official launch and the country's independence, the company changed its name for the first time to '''Televisão Popular de Angola''', on June 25, 1976.

In 1979, TPA began to look into expansion, starting with [[Benguela]], then in 1981 in [[Huambo]]. It was in Huambo that the first regional production centre was established.

In 1982, TPA started producing programming in native languages, with the first two being [[Malanje]] and [[N'dalatando|N'Dalatando]]. Currently the so-called "national languages" have a special focus on the news, of which a dedicated block exists on the main channel.

Colour television arrived to Angola in 1983.

In 1992, TPA expanded to the whole of the country thanks to [[Satellite television|satellite connections]].

In 1997, TPA became a [[public company]] and the official name changed to '''Televisão Pública de Angola'''.

In 2000 TPA 2 started [[broadcasting]]. Broadcasts did not become official for another two years.

In 2003, TPA's channels started broadcasting through the [[Ku band|KU band]], launching the channels on the international [[DStv]] platform.

On 31 January 2007, TPA began broadcasting 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/sociedade/2007/0/5/TPA-comeca-emitir-horas-partir-hoje,286fda96-fc73-4dff-89f7-d4f6fa873df7.html |title=TPA começa a emitir 24/24 horas a partir de hoje |publisher=ANGOP.com |date= 31 Jan 2007 |accessdate= 4 Dec 2014|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 July 2008 the international channel was launched and became available in Portugal's main cable and [[IPTV]] platforms.

The most successful songs were ''I man i dram'', ''Schneemensch'', and ''Und wem's net gfoid, der soll sich haun über d'Häusa''. [[Georg Danzer]], one of the members who wrote some of their songs, later started a solo career.

{{History of Berlin}}

'''West Berlin''' ({{lang-de|Berlin (West)}} or colloquially ''West-Berlin'') was a political [[enclave]] which comprised the western part of [[Berlin]] during the years of the [[Cold War]]. There was no specific date on which the sectors of Berlin occupied by the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]] became "West Berlin", but 1949 is widely accepted as the year in which the name was adopted. West Berlin aligned itself politically with [[West Germany|the Federal Republic of Germany]] (also known as the "Bonn Republic") and was directly or indirectly represented in its federal institutions.

West Berlin was formally controlled by the Western Allies and was entirely surrounded by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-controlled [[East Berlin]] and [[East Germany]]. West Berlin had great symbolic significance during the Cold War, as it was widely considered by westerners as an "island of [[free world|freedom]]". It was heavily subsidised by West Germany as a "showcase of the West".&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Hochscherf, Christoph Laucht, Andrew Plowman, ''Divided, But Not Disconnected: German Experiences of the Cold War'', p. 109, Berghahn Books, 2013, {{ISBN|9781782381006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wealthy city, West Berlin was noted for its distinctly cosmopolitan character, and as a centre of education, research and culture. With about two million inhabitants, West Berlin had the largest population of any city in Germany during the Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/07/berlin-where-rivalry-of-east-west-soars "Berlin: Where Rivalry of East, West Soars"], ''[[US News and World Report]]'', 18 July 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

West Berlin was {{convert|100|mi|km|0|abbr=off}} east and north of the [[Inner German border]] and only accessible by land from West Germany by narrow rail and highway corridors. It consisted of the American, British, and French occupation sectors established in 1945. The [[Berlin Wall]], built in 1961, physically separated West Berlin from its East Berlin and East German surroundings until it [[Fall of the Berlin Wall|fell]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/13/newsid_3054000/3054060.stm "1961: Berliners wake to divided city"], [[BBC News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Wberlin transport 78.jpg|thumb|West Berlin, as of 1978]]
[[File:West and East Berlin.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Map of West and East Berlin, border crossings, metro networks &lt;/center&gt;{{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/West and East Berlin|interactive map]])}}]]
The [[Potsdam Agreement]] established the legal framework for the occupation of Germany in the wake of World War II. According to this agreement, Germany would be formally under the administration of the three major wartime [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (the United States, the United Kingdom, and the [[Soviet Union]]) as well as France until a German government "acceptable to all parties" could be established. The territory of Germany, as it existed in 1937, would be reduced by most of ''Eastern Germany'' thus creating the [[Former eastern territories of Germany#Post World War II|former eastern territories of Germany]]. The remaining territory would be divided into four zones, each administered by one of the four allied countries. Berlin, which was surrounded by the [[Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany|Soviet zone of occupation]]—newly established in most of [[Middle Germany]]—would be similarly divided, with the Western Allies occupying an enclave consisting of the western parts of the city. According to the agreement, the occupation of Berlin could end only as a result of a [[wikt:quadripartite|quadripartite]] agreement. The Western Allies were guaranteed three air corridors to their sectors of Berlin, and the Soviets also informally allowed road and rail access between West Berlin and the western parts of Germany (see section on traffic).{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

At first, this arrangement was intended to be of a temporary administrative nature, with all parties declaring that Germany and Berlin would soon be reunited. However, as the relations between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union soured and the Cold War began, the joint administration of Germany and Berlin broke down. Soon, Soviet-occupied Berlin and western-occupied Berlin had separate city administrations.&lt;ref name=Ladd&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladd|first=Brian|title=The Ghosts of Berlin: Confronting German History in the Urban Landscape|date=1997|pages=178–179|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226467627}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the Soviets tried to force the Western Allies out of Berlin by imposing a land blockade on the western sectors—the [[Berlin Blockade]]. The West responded by using its [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] for supplying their part of the city with food and other goods through the [[Berlin Airlift]]. In May 1949, the Soviets lifted the blockade, and West Berlin as a separate city with its own jurisdiction was maintained.&lt;ref name=Ladd/&gt;

Following the Berlin Blockade, normal contacts between East and West Berlin resumed. This was temporary until talks were resumed.&lt;ref name=Ladd/&gt;  In 1952, the East German government began sealing its borders, further isolating West Berlin.&lt;ref name="Attwood"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Attwood |first=William |editor-last=Cowles |editor-first=Gardner |title=Berlin calmly rides out its Pinprick War |department=European Affairs, Look Reports |magazine=LOOK |language=English |location=Des Moines, Iowa |publisher= Cowles Magazines, Incorporated|publication-date=15 July 1952 |volume=16 |issue=15 |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a direct result, electrical grids were separated and phone lines were cut.&lt;ref name=Ladd/&gt; The [[Volkspolizei]] and Soviet military personnel also continued the process of blocking all the roads leading away from the city, resulting in several armed standoffs and at least one skirmish with the [[National Gendarmerie|French Gendarmerie]] and the [[Bundesgrenzschutz]] that June.&lt;ref name="Attwood"/&gt; However, the culmination of the schism did not occur until 1961 with the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]].&lt;ref name=Ladd/&gt;

==Legal status==
From the legal theory followed by the Western Allies, the occupation of most of Germany ended in 1949 with the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany (23 May 1949) and of the German Democratic Republic (7 October 1949). Under Article 127 of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] (or constitution) of the Federal Republic, provision was made for federal laws to be extended to Greater Berlin (as West Berlin was officially known) as well as [[Baden]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]] within one year of its promulgation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf Article 127 &amp;#91;Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin&amp;#93; {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075359/https://www.bundestag.de/blob/284870/ce0d03414872b427e57fccb703634dcd/basic_law-data.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }} Within one year after the promulgation of this Basic Law the Federal Government, with the consent of the governments of the Länder concerned, may extend to the Länder of Baden, Greater Berlin, Rhineland-Palatinate and Württemberg-Hohenzollern any law of the Administration of the Combined Economic Area, insofar as it remains in force as federal law under Article 124 or 125.]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the occupation of Berlin could only be ended by a quadripartite agreement, Berlin remained an occupied territory under the formal sovereignty of the allies. Hence, the Basic Law was not fully applicable to West Berlin.&lt;ref name="currie"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oWFzvKt8fVoC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=constitution+berlin+1950&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hyuCIJgkpd&amp;sig=6M92IDToC3d9dPMZ0Z_d5ugtsuc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiLgOHypbbKAhWGtxQKHaDVD3MQ6AEITDAL#v=onepage&amp;q=constitution%20berlin%201950&amp;f=true ''The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany''], David P. Currie University of Chicago Press, 1994, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 1950 the [[House of Representatives of Berlin|House of Representatives]] (the city's legislature) passed a new constitution, declaring Berlin to be a state of the Federal Republic and the provisions of the Basic Law as binding law superior to Berlin state law (Article 1, clauses 2 and 3). However, this became statutory law only on 1 September and only with the inclusion of the western Allied provision&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Berlin [[Allied Kommandatura|Kommandatura]] Ordinance BK/O (50) 75, 29 August 1950, clause 2b, published in the then Berlin legal gazette VOBl. I, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which Art. 1, clauses 2 and 3, were deferred for the time being; the clauses became valid law only on 3 October 1990 (the day of Germany's unification). It stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 87 is interpreted as meaning that during the transitional period Berlin shall possess none of the attributes of a twelfth Land. The provision of this Article concerning the Basic Law will only apply to the extent necessary to prevent a conflict between this Law and the Berlin Constitution...&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=N6DFsKBss-wC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=Die+Bestimmungen+dieses+Artikels+(87)+betreffend+das+Basic+Law,+finden+nur+in+dem+Ma%C3%9Fe+Anwendung,+als+es+zwecks+Vorbeugung+eines+Konflikts+zwischen+diesem+Gesetz+und+der+Berliner+Verfassung+erforderlich+ist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iQqWEbHUY3&amp;sig=GydD0ZsmDVxQ0EJQHE1GSYhrn98&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgqZvwu7bKAhXDuBQKHRKyA-wQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Die%20Bestimmungen%20dieses%20Artikels%20(87)%20betreffend%20das%20Basic%20Law%2C%20finden%20nur%20in%20dem%20Ma%C3%9Fe%20Anwendung%2C%20als%20es%20zwecks%20Vorbeugung%20eines%20Konflikts%20zwischen%20diesem%20Gesetz%20und%20der%20Berliner%20Verfassung%20erforderlich%20ist&amp;f=false ''Das richterliche Prüfungsrecht in Berlin''], Peter Hauck
Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1969, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the German translation the respective clause of the Kommandatura Ordinance reads as follows: "Die Bestimmungen dieses Artikels (87) betreffend das Basic Law, finden nur in dem Maße Anwendung, als es zwecks Vorbeugung eines Konflikts zwischen diesem Gesetz und der Berliner Verfassung erforderlich ist". Cf. Decision of the [[Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court of the Federal Republic of Germany]] [http://opinioiuris.de/entscheidung/764 ''BVerfG, 25.10.1951 - 1 BvR 24/51'' (Der Grundrechtsteil des Bonner Basic Lawes gilt auch in West-Berlin.)], on: [http://opinioiuris.de/ ''OpinioIuris: Die freie juristische Bibliothek''], retrieved on 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus civic liberties and personal rights (except for the privacy of telecommunications) guaranteed by the Basic Law were also valid in West Berlin.

In addition, West German federal statutes could only take effect in West Berlin with the approval of the city's legislature.&lt;ref name="currie" /&gt;
The ambiguous legal status of the city, then still legally styled as Greater Berlin (although technically only comprising the western sectors), meant that West Berliners were not eligible to vote in federal elections. In their notification of permission of 12 May 1949 the three western military governors for Germany explained their proviso in No. 4, as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A third reservation concerns the participation of Greater Berlin in the Federation. We interpret the effect of Articles 23 and 144 (2) of the Basic Law as constituting acceptance of our previous request that while Berlin may not be accorded voting membership in the Bundestag or Bundesrat nor be governed by the Federation she may, nevertheless, designate a small number of representatives to the meetings of those legislative bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga4-490512.htm ''Approval by Western Military Governors''], on [http://usa.usembassy.de/ U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Germany], retrieved on 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Consequently, West Berliners were indirectly represented in the [[Bundestag]] in [[Bonn]] by 22 non-voting delegates&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=F54jJBcrs50C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=bundestag+west+berlin+22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fHvcgFedJi&amp;sig=TOHuagAFxKdwr04qEslLTYLQzyM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQxITa37PKAhUC1hQKHddqCikQ6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=bundestag%20west%20berlin%2022&amp;f=true ''Germany at the Polls: The Bundestag Elections of the 1980s''], Karl H. Cerny, Duke University Press, 1990, page 34&lt;/ref&gt; chosen by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/GERMANY_FEDERAL_REPUBLIC_1980.PDF GERMANY (FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF) Date of Elections: 5 October 1980], [[International Parliamentary Union]]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Senate of Berlin|Senate]] (the city's executive) sent four non-voting delegates to the [[Bundesrat (Germany)|Bundesrat]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGbfBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=bundesrat+west+berlin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6F09K0wr5v&amp;sig=8CyWHFI1bbFhtK_o2YZR962zV_M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiloZSi3rPKAhUEvhQKHY7PBEgQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=bundesrat%20west%20berlin&amp;f=false ''West Germany Today (RLE: German Politics)''], Karl Koch, Routledge, 1989, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, when the [[European Parliament election, 1979|first direct elections]] to the [[European Parliament]] were held in 1979, West Berlin's three members were instead indirectly elected by the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BTrjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Bundestag%22+%22West+Berlin%22+%22House+of+Representatives%22&amp;dq=%22Bundestag%22+%22West+Berlin%22+%22House+of+Representatives%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSnouOnNTeAhWrrVQKHbrpDIcQ6AEINDAC ''The Bulletin''], Issues 1-3, 1979, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, as [[#Citizenship|West German citizens]], West Berliners were able to stand for election in West Germany. For example, Social Democrat [[Willy Brandt]], who eventually became Chancellor, was elected via his party's list of candidates. It should be noted that the West German government considered all West Berliners as well as all citizens of the GDR to be citizens of West Germany. Also, male residents of West Berlin were exempt from the Federal Republic's compulsory military service; this exemption made the city a popular destination for West German young people, which resulted in a flourishing [[counterculture]], which in turn became one of the defining features of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RjY4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;lpg=PA166&amp;dq=military+service+%22west+berlin%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IGeH7y4dGs&amp;sig=d5tFMsf12M0kJ9038y89RHBrRf0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSsdyRibfKAhXLvhQKHXVMAmcQ6AEIUjAL#v=onepage&amp;q=military%20service%20%22west%20berlin%22&amp;f=true ''Avant-Garde Film: Motion Studies''], Scott MacDonald, CUP Archive, 1993, page 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/tracing-west-berlins-70s-and-80s-subculture/a-16615845 Tracing West Berlin's 70s and 80s subculture], [[Deutsche Welle]], 21 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin Alert 0400.jpg|thumb|left|In 1969 U.S. military vehicles pass through the residential district of [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]], a routine reminder that West Berlin was still legally occupied by the Western Allies of World War II]]
The Western Allies remained the ultimate political authorities in West Berlin. All legislation of the House of Representatives, whether of the West Berlin legislature or adopted federal law, only applied under the proviso of confirmation by the three Western Allied commanders-in-chief. If they approved a bill, it was enacted as part of West Berlin's statutory law. If the commanders-in-chief rejected a bill, it did not become law in West Berlin; this, for example, was the case with West German laws on military duty. West Berlin was run by the elected [[Governing Mayor of Berlin|Governing Mayor]] and Senate seated at [[Rathaus Schöneberg]]. The Governing Mayor and Senators (ministers) had to be approved by the Western Allies and thus derived their authority from the occupying forces, not from their electoral mandate.

The Soviets unilaterally declared the occupation of East Berlin at an end along with the rest of East Germany. This move was, however, not recognised by the Western Allies, who continued to view all of Berlin as a jointly occupied territory belonging to neither of the two countries. This view was supported by the continued practice of patrols of all four sectors by soldiers of all four occupying powers. Thus, occasionally Western Allied soldiers were on patrol in East Berlin as were Soviet soldiers in West Berlin. After the Wall was built, East Germany wanted to control Western Allied patrols upon entering or leaving East Berlin, a practice that the Western Allies regarded as unacceptable. So, after protests to the Soviets, the patrols continued uncontrolled on both sides, with the tacit agreement that the western Allies would not use their patrolling privileges for helping Easterners to flee to the West.

In many ways, West Berlin functioned as the ''de facto'' 11th [[states of Germany|state]] of West Germany, and was depicted on maps published in the West as being a part of West Germany. There was freedom of movement (to the extent allowed by geography) between West Berlin and West Germany. There were no separate immigration regulations for West Berlin, all immigration rules for West Germany being followed in West Berlin. West German entry [[Visa (document)|visas]] issued to visitors were stamped with "for the Federal Republic of Germany, including Land Berlin", in German "''für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland einschl. [einschließlich] des Landes Berlin''", prompting complaints from the Soviet Union. However, this wording remained on the visas throughout the rest of the entire period of West Berlin's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CMibQNH4U4IC&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;vq=valid%20for%20entry&amp;pg=PA100#v=snippet&amp;q=valid%20for%20entry&amp;f=false ''Bridge Builder: An Insider's Account of Over Sixty Years in Post-war Reconstruction, International Diplomacy, and German-American Relations''], Walther Leisler Kiep Purdue University Press, 2012, page 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldpassportstamps.com/germany-transit-visa-1991/ ''Germany – transit visa, 1991 (issued 24 July 1990)''], World of Passport Stamps&lt;/ref&gt;

West Berlin remained under military occupation until 3 October 1990, the day of [[German reunification|unification]] of East Germany, East and West Berlin with [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. The West German Federal Government, as well as the governments of most western nations, considered East Berlin to be a "separate entity" from East Germany, and while the Western Allies later opened embassies in East Berlin, they recognised the city only as the ''seat of government'' of the GDR, not as its ''capital''.&lt;ref name="pugh"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=Embassy+of+the+French+Republic+in+Berlin+gdr&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ0bKp2bjKAhXM2xoKHSq8AywQ6AEIcjAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Embassy%20of%20the%20French%20Republic%20in%20Berlin%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, pages 158-159&lt;/ref&gt;

Communist countries, however, did not recognise West Berlin as part of West Germany and usually described it as a "third" German jurisdiction, called in German ''selbständige politische Einheit'' ("independent political unit").&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vzmNb84n7sUC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=West+Berlin+special+political+area&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OBy00qbYpg&amp;sig=vLbh048ZkEnC4mRtnepDCkZUVtg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVvp3zobbKAhUIaxQKHXWfDPQQ6AEIbTAR#v=onepage&amp;q=West%20Berlin%20special%20political%20area&amp;f=true ''The East German Leadership, 1946-73: Conflict and Crisis''],
Peter Grieder, Manchester University Press, 1999, page 183&lt;/ref&gt; On maps of East Berlin, West Berlin often did not appear as an adjacent urban area but as a monochrome terra incognita, sometimes showing the letters WB, meaning West Berlin, or overlaid with a legend or pictures. It was often labelled "Besonderes politisches Gebiet Westberlin" (West Berlin special political area).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iS5YAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Besonderes+politisches+Gebiet+Westberlin%22&amp;dq=%22Besonderes+politisches+Gebiet+Westberlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif6KHmo7bKAhVL1xQKHcf_AwUQ6AEISDAG ''Städte und Stadtzentren in der DDR: Ergebnisse und reale Perspektiven des Städtebaus in der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''], Gerhard Krenz, Verlag für Bauwesen, 1969, page 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration==
The Federal Republic of Germany issued West German passports to West Berliners on request that showed West Berlin as their place of residence. However, West Berliners could not use their passports for crossing East German borders and were denied entrance by any country of the [[Eastern Bloc]], since governments of these countries held the view that West Germany was not authorized to issue legal papers for West Berliners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P3AXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA191&amp;lpg=PA191&amp;dq=valid+for+entry+into+the+Federal+Republic+of+Germany+including+Berlin+(West)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ja7vC0-hPl&amp;sig=naUWLfbvWfrTYiGtPm8KQYLxEmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3jLTC5bPKAhUBNhQKHZvdC6EQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=valid%20for%20entry%20into%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Germany%20including%20Berlin%20(West)&amp;f=true The Path to the Berlin Wall: Critical Stages in the History of Divided Germany],
Manfred Wilke, Berghahn Books, 15 Apr 2014, page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

Since West Berlin was not a sovereign state, it did not issue passports. Instead, West Berliners were issued with "auxiliary identity cards" by the West Berlin authorities. These differed visually from the regular West German identity cards, with green bindings instead of the grey standard, they did not show the [[Coat of arms of Germany|"Federal Eagle" or coat of arms]], and did not contain any indications as to the issuing State. However, they did have a statement that the holder of the document was a German citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:FnN3a03STPYJ:www.themediateur.eu/resources/publications/item/download/1_d5ca8722620387e09afa7b980d03cace+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk Comparative Study on Status Neutral Travel Documents], [http://www.themediateur.eu/resources/publications/item/download/1_d5ca8722620387e09afa7b980d03cace], mediatEUr, July 2011, page 29&lt;/ref&gt; From 11 June 1968, East Germany made it mandatory that West Berlin and West German "transit passengers" obtain a [[transit visa]], issued upon entering East Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0Gk6XkKL0aEC&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;ots=1yCmBbs5av&amp;dq=west%20berlin%20visas%20east%20germany%201968&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20berlin%20visas%20east%20germany%201968&amp;f=true ''Moscow, Germany and the West''], Michael Sodaro
I.B.Tauris, 1993, page 115&lt;/ref&gt; because under its second constitution East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners as foreigners. Since identity cards had no pages to stamp visas, issuers of East German visas stamped their visas onto separate leaflets which were loosely stuck into the identity cards, which, until the mid-1980s, were little booklets. Although the West German government subsidized visa fees, they were still payable by individual travellers.&lt;ref name="pugh" /&gt;

In order to enter visa-requiring Western countries, such as the US, West Berliners commonly used West German passports. However, for countries which did not require stamped visas for entry, including Switzerland, Austria, and many members of the then [[European Economic Community]], including the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://treaties.fco.gov.uk/docs/fullnames/pdf/1960/TS0056%20(1960)%20CMND-1157%201960%2020%20JUNE,%20BONN%3B%20EXCHANGE%20OF%20NOTES%20BETWEEN%20GOVT%20OF%20UK%20AND%20NI%20AND%20GOVT%20OF%20GERMANY%20CONCERNING%20ARRANGEMENTS%20TO%20FACILITATE%20TRAVEL.PDF Exchange of Notes between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany concerning Arrangements to Facilitate Travel between the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic, Bonn, 20 June 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; West Berlin identity cards were also acceptable for entry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kdu9z7L3ulcC&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;dq=West%20Berlin%20identity%20cards&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q=West%20Berlin%20identity%20cards&amp;f=false ''Basic Documents on International Migration Law''], Richard Plender, Aire Centre
Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, page 301&lt;/ref&gt;

Active immigration and asylum politics in West Berlin triggered waves of immigration in the 1960s and 1970s. Currently, Berlin is home to at least 178,000 [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Turks in Germany|Turkish German]] residents,&lt;ref name="pop-detail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/publikationen/Stat_Berichte/2018/SB_A01-05-00_2017h02_BE.pdf|format=PDF|title=Statistischer Bericht: Einwohnerinnen und Einwohner im Land Berlin am 31.

==Naming conventions==
Most Westerners called the Western sectors "Berlin", unless further distinction was necessary. The West German Federal government officially called West Berlin "Berlin (West)", although it also used the hyphenated "West-Berlin", whereas the East German government commonly referred to it as "Westberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=s7kGqJGbaI4C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=%22Berlin+(West)%22+westberlin+name&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic28LjsMbKAhVFvRoKHRFoCQwQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Berlin%20(West)%22%20westberlin%20name&amp;f=true ''Divided in Unity: Identity, Germany, and the Berlin Police''], Andreas Glaeser
University of Chicago Press, 2000, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from 31 May 1961, East Berlin was officially called ''Berlin, Hauptstadt der DDR'' (Berlin, Capital of the GDR), replacing the formerly used term ''Demokratisches Berlin'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DhuQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;pg=PA344#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Democratic%20Berlin%22%20gdr&amp;f=false ''Architecture, Politics, and Identity in Divided Berlin''], Emily Pugh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014, page 344&lt;/ref&gt; or simply "Berlin", by East Germany, and "Berlin (Ost)" by the West German Federal government. Other names used by West German media included "Ost-Berlin", "Ostberlin", or "Ostsektor". These different naming conventions for the divided parts of Berlin, when followed by individuals, governments, or media, commonly indicated their political leanings, with the centre-right ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' using "Ost-Berlin" and the centre-left ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' using "Ostberlin".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vgoqqs9l7ikC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;lpg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Ost+Berlin%22,+%22Ostberlin%22,+or+%22Ostsektor%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=dUlLgVcMcg&amp;sig=yg5HL2-Z23u3emp_z7D_ikH9sc0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjoo6r-yrbKAhWGwxQKHeiNBxIQ6AEIUDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ost%20Berlin%22%2C%20%22Ostberlin%22%2C%20or%20%22Ostsektor%22&amp;f=true ''Bezeichnungen für "Deutschland" in der Zeit der "Wende": dargestellt an ausgewählten westdeutschen Printmedien''], Ute Röding-Lange Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 1997, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Period following the building of the Berlin Wall==
[[File:JFK speech lch bin ein berliner 1.jpg|thumb|right| President [[John F. Kennedy]] addressing from [[Rathaus Schöneberg]] the people of West Berlin on Rudolf-Wilde-Platz (today's John-F.-Kennedy-Platz), 26 June 1963]]
[[File:ReaganBerlinWall.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] speaking in front of the [[Brandenburg Gate]] giving the "[[Tear down this wall!]]" speech in 1987]]

After the Berlin Wall was constructed, West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] suggested to U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] that the United States propose a swap of West Berlin with [[Thuringia]] and parts of [[Saxony]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]]; the city's population would have been relocated to West Germany. While the Kennedy administration seriously considered the idea, it did not make the proposal to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="wiegrefe20110815"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/secret-documents-released-adenauer-wanted-to-swap-west-berlin-for-parts-of-gdr-a-780385.html | title=Secret Documents Released: Adenauer Wanted to Swap West Berlin for Parts of GDR | work=Der Spiegel | date=2011-08-15 | accessdate=7 November 2014 | author=Wiegrefe, Klaus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO also took an increased interest in the specific issue related to West Berlin, and drafted plans to ensure to defend the city against an eventual attack from the East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=NATO PLANNING FOR BERLIN EMERGENCY |title=INSTRUCTIONS TO NATO MILITARY AUTHORITIES |url=http://archives.nato.int/nato-planning-for-berlin-emergency-instructions-to-nato-military-authorities-approved-by-council-on-25th-october-1961;isad |website=archives.nato.int |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_136086.htm|website=nato.int|publisher=North Atlantic Treaty Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tripartite planning group known as [[LIVE OAK]], working together with NATO, was entrusted with potential military responses to any crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Code Name |title=LIVE OAK |url=https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_136184.htm |website=NATO |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 1963, President Kennedy visited West Berlin and gave a public speech known for its famous phrase "[[Ich bin ein Berliner]]".

The [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971) and the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972) helped to significantly ease tensions over the status of West Berlin. While many restrictions remained in place, it also made it easier for West Berliners to travel to East Germany and it simplified the regulations for Germans travelling along the [[autobahn]] transit routes.

At the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in 1987, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]] provided a challenge to the then Soviet leader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]], if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, [[tear down this wall!]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronald Reagan speech, Tear Down This Wall|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/speeches/reagan_berlin.htm |publisher=USAF Air University|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 9 November 1989, the Wall was opened, and the two parts of the city were once again physically—though at this point not legally—united. The [[Two Plus Four Treaty]], signed by the two German states and the four wartime allies, paved the way for [[German reunification]] and an end to the Western Allies' occupation of West Berlin. On 3 October 1990—the day Germany was officially reunified—East and West Berlin formally reunited as the city of Berlin, which then joined the enlarged Federal Republic as a city-state along the lines of the existing West German city-states of [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]. [[Walter Momper]], the mayor of West Berlin, became the first mayor of the reunified city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/01/world/berlin-mayoral-contest-has-many-uncertainties.html Berlin Mayoral Contest Has Many Uncertainties], ''[[New York Times]]'', 1 December 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boroughs of West Berlin==
West Berlin comprised the following [[Boroughs of Berlin|boroughs]]:

In the American Sector:
* [[Neukölln]]
* [[Kreuzberg]]
* [[Schöneberg]]
* [[Steglitz]]
* [[Tempelhof]]
* [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]

In the British Sector:
* [[Charlottenburg]]
* [[Tiergarten (Berlin)|Tiergarten]]
* [[Wilmersdorf]]
* [[Spandau]]

In the French Sector:
* [[Reinickendorf]]
* [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]]

==Exclaves==
{{Main|Exclaves of West Berlin in East Germany}}
[[File:Occupied Berlin.svg|thumb|Map of divided Berlin, indicating by broken lines at Berlin's western border the land swap decided by the Allies. Five bigger of West Berlin's originally twelve exclaves ([[Steinstücken]], Laßzinswiesen, Falkenhagener Wiesen, Wüste Mark, Kienhorst&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/mauer/a_6251_19_1988.pdf?start&amp;ts=1242213630&amp;file=a_6251_19_1988.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053959/http://www.berlin.de/imperia/md/content/mauer/a_6251_19_1988.pdf?start&amp;ts=1242213630&amp;file=a_6251_19_1988.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are shown.]] West Berlin's border was identical to the municipal boundary of Berlin as defined in the [[Greater Berlin Act]] of 1920 and amended in 1938, and the border between the Soviet sector and the French, British, and American sectors respectively, which followed the boundaries of Berlin administrative boroughs as defined in the same years. Another amendment was added in 1945 at the border between the British sector of Berlin (ceding [[West-Staaken]]) and the Soviet zone (ceding the [[Seeburger Zipfel|Seeburg Salient]]) so that the [[Gatow Airport|Wehrmacht airfield at Berlin-Gatow]] became part of the British sector and the airfield at [[Staaken|Berlin-Staaken]] became part of the Soviet sector. The resulting borderline was further complicated with a lot of geographical oddities, including a number of exclaves and enclaves that Greater Berlin had inside some neighbouring municipalities since 1920, all of which happened to become part of the British or American sectors after 1945, so that parts of West Berlin came to be surrounded by East Germany.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

Furthermore, the Gatow/Staaken exchange in August 1945 resulted in the geographically western half of Berlin-Staaken, which was located in the western outskirts of the city, becoming ''de jure'' Soviet occupied. However, the ''de facto'' administration remained with the Borough of Spandau in the British sector. Therefore, all inhabitants of Staaken could vote in West Berlin's city state elections in 1948 and 1950. On 1 February 1951, East German [[Volkspolizei]] surprised the people of western Staaken by occupying the area and ended its administration by the Spandau Borough; instead, western Staaken became an exclave of the Soviet occupied borough [[Mitte (locality)|Berlin-Mitte]] in the city centre. However, on 1 June 1952, western Staaken's ''de facto'' administration was placed with neighbouring East German [[Falkensee]] in the East German district [[Nauen]]. This situation was undone on 3 October 1990, the day of German unification, when western Staaken was reincorporated into united Berlin.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

==Post and telecommunications==
West Berlin had its own postal administration first called ''Deutsche Post Berlin'' (1947–1955) and then [[Deutsche Bundespost Berlin]], separate from West Germany's [[Deutsche Bundespost]], and issuing its own postage stamps until 1990. However, the separation was merely symbolic; in reality West Berlin's postal service was completely integrated with West Germany's, using the same [[List of postal codes in Germany|postal code]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aMgiAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%221000+Berlin%22&amp;dq=%221000+Berlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-6YKez8LMAhVIAcAKHWyrCrkQ6AEIHTAA ''Guide to World Commodity Markets''], John Parry, Kogan Page, 1982, page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

West Berlin was also integrated into the West German telephone network, using the same international dialling code as West Germany, [[+49]], with the [[Area codes in Germany#030|area code 030]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uQsjAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=vorwahl+westberlin+030&amp;dq=vorwahl+westberlin+030&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin_6mjhrnKAhVHaRQKHTW7ADsQ6AEIIzAA MM; MASCHINENMARKT: - Volume 85, Issues 71-88], 1979&lt;/ref&gt; As in West Germany, calls to East Berlin from West Berlin were made using the prefix 00372 (international access code 00, East German country code 37, area code 2).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=n0wdAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=0037+ddr&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=0037 ''Der Fischer Weltalmanach''], Fischer Taschenbuch, 1991, pages 2091-2093&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to reduce eastern tapping of telecommunications between West Berlin and West Germany, microwave radio relay connections were built, which transmitted telephone calls between antenna towers in West Germany and West Berlin by radio. Two such towers were built, one antenna in Berlin-[[Wannsee]] and later a second in Berlin-[[Frohnau]], finished on 16 May 1980 with a height of {{convert|358|m|0|abbr=on}} (this tower was demolished on 8 February 2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://structurae.net/structures/richtfunkmast-berlin-frohnau&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport and transit travel==
West Berliners could travel to West Germany and all Western and [[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned]] states at all times, except during the [[Berlin Blockade]] by the Soviet Union (24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949) when there were restrictions on passenger flight capacity imposed by the airlift.

Travelling to and from West Berlin by road or train always required passing through East German border checks, since West Berlin was an [[enclave]] surrounded by East Germany and East Berlin. On 2 October 1967, six years after the Wall was constructed, tram tracks in West Berlin were lifted because the authorities wanted to promote car usage, meaning that the tram system remaining today runs almost entirely within the former East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/the-tram-disappears-from-west-berlin-575/ The tram disappears from West-Berlin - The Berlin Wall], [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|RBB]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road traffic===
For travel from West Berlin through East Germany by car or rail a valid passport was required for citizens of West Germany and other western nationals to be produced at East German border checks; West Berliners could get admission only through their identity cards (see above). For travel from West Berlin to Denmark, Sweden and West Germany via dedicated East German transit routes ({{lang-de|link=no|Transitstrecke}}), East German border guards issued a ''transit visa'' for a fee of 5 [[Deutsche Mark|Western Deutsche Mark]]. For journeys between West Berlin and [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] or [[Czechoslovakia]] through East Germany, each traveller was also required to present a valid visa for the destination country.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

The transit routes for road travel connecting West Berlin to other destinations usually consisted of [[autobahn]]s and other highways, marked by ''Transit'' signs. ''Transit travellers'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Transitreisende}}) were prohibited to leave the transit routes, and occasional traffic checkpoints would check for violators.

There were four transit routes between West Berlin and West Germany:
* One between West Berlin's ''Heerstraße'' with the East German checkpoint in [[Dallgow-Döberitz|Dallgow]] until 1951, then replaced by [[Staaken]] for destinations in [[Northern Germany]] (originally via highway ''[[Bundesstraße 5|F 5]]'') at the Eastern checkpoint in Horst (a part of today's [[Nostorf]]) and the Western [[Lauenburg/Elbe|Lauenburg upon Elbe]]. These were replaced on 20 November 1982 by a new autobahn crossing at [[Zarrentin]] (E)/[[Gudow]] (W).&lt;ref&gt;According to the German-German ''Traffic Agreement'' of 29 November 1978, the transit via highway ''F 5'' was replaced by a new autobahn connecting Hamburg with [[Wittstock]] (today's [[Bundesautobahn 24|A 24]]), from there on using the existing autobahn between Berlin and [[Rostock]] (today's [[Bundesautobahn 19|A 19]]). The West German ''Federal Government'' paid DM 1.2 billion to co-finance the construction of these roads. East Germany, in chronic need of [[foreign exchange reserves|western foreign currencies]], often showed cooperation whenever Western payments were involved.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 January 1988, the new Stolpe checkpoint opened on this route to West Berlin. This is part of today's [[Hohen Neuendorf]] (E)/Berlin-[[Heiligensee]] (W).{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}
* A second transit route led to Northwestern and [[Western Germany]] – following today's [[Bundesautobahn 2|A 2]] – crossing the [[inner German border]] at [[Helmstedt-Marienborn border crossing|Marienborn]] (E)/[[Helmstedt]] (W), also called ''Checkpoint Alpha''.
* A third route to Southwestern Germany consisted of today's [[Bundesautobahn 9|A 9]] and [[Bundesautobahn 4|A 4]] with border crossing at [[Wartha (Eisenach)|Wartha]] (E)/[[Herleshausen]] (W).{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}
* A fourth (via today's A 9) to [[Southern Germany]] had border crossings originally at [[Juchhöh|Mount Juchhöh]] (E)/[[Töpen]] (W) and later at [[Hirschberg, Thuringia|Hirschberg upon Saale]] (E)/ Rudolphstein (a part of today's [[Berg, Upper Franconia|Berg in Upper Franconia]]) (W).{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

The latter three routes used autobahns built during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] era. They left West Berlin at ''Checkpoint Dreilinden'', also called [[Checkpoint Bravo]] (W)/[[Potsdam]]-Drewitz (E). Transit routes to Poland were via today's [[Bundesautobahn 11|A 11]] to [[Nadrensee]]-Pomellen (East Germany, GDR)/[[Kołbaskowo|Kołbaskowo (Kolbitzow)]] (PL), eastwards via today's [[Bundesautobahn 12|A 12]] to [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankfurt upon Oder]] (GDR)/[[Słubice]] (PL), or southeastwards via today's [[Bundesautobahn 13|A 13]] and [[Bundesautobahn 15|A 15]] to [[Forst (Lausitz)|Forst in Lusatia/Baršć]] (GDR)/[[Zasieki|Zasieki (Berge)]] (PL). Additional routes led to Denmark and Sweden by ferry between Warnemünde (GDR) and [[Gedser]] (DK) and by ferry between [[Sassnitz]] (GDR) and [[Rønne]] (DK) or [[Trelleborg]] (S). Routes to Czechoslovakia were via [[Schmilka]] (GDR)/[[Hřensko|Hřensko (Herrnskretschen)]] (ČSSR) and via Fürstenau (a part of today's [[Geising]]) (GDR)/[[Cínovec|Cínovec (Cinvald/Böhmisch Zinnwald)]] (ČSSR).

The transit routes were also used for East German domestic traffic. This meant that transit passengers could potentially meet with East Germans and East Berliners at restaurants at motorway rest stops. Since such meetings were deemed illegal by the East German government, border guards would calculate the travel duration from the time of entry and exit of the transit route. Excessive time spent for transit travel could arouse their suspicion and prompt questioning or additional checking by the border guards. Western [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]]es could stop only at dedicated service areas, since the East German government was concerned that East Germans might potentially use coaches to escape into the West.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

On 1 September 1951 East Germany, because of a shortage in [[foreign exchange reserves|foreign currencies]], started to levy road tolls on cars using the transit routes. At first the toll amounted to 10 [[East German mark|Ostmark]] per passenger car and 10 to 50 for trucks, depending on size. Ostmarks had to be exchanged at Deutsche Mark a rate of 1:1. On 30 March 1955, East Germany raised the toll for passenger cars to 30 Deutsche Marks, but after West German protests, in June of the same year it changed it back to the previous rate. Following a new agreement between East and West Germany, starting from 1 January 1980 the Federal Government in Bonn paid an annual lump sum ({{lang-de|link=no|Transitpauschale}}) of 50 million Deutsche Marks to the Eastern government, so that transit passengers no longer had to pay tolls individually.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

===Railway===
Four transit train connections—earlier also called ''interzonal train'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Interzonenzug}})—connected West Berlin with [[Hamburg]] via [[Schwanheide]] (E)/[[Büchen]] (W) in the North, with [[Hanover]] via Marienborn (E)/Helmstedt (W) in the West, with [[Frankfurt (Main)|Frankfurt upon Main]] via [[Gerstungen]] (E)/[[Wildeck|Hönebach]] (W) in the Southwest, and with [[Nuremberg]] via [[Probstzella]] (E)/[[Ludwigsstadt]] (W) in the South of West Germany. These transit trains did not service domestic passengers of East Germany and made stops in East Germany almost exclusively for East German border guards upon entering and leaving the country. Until the construction of the Berlin Wall, ''interzonal trains'' would also stop once on their way within East Germany for travellers having a visa for entering or leaving East Germany. Train travel from West Berlin to Czechoslovakia, Denmark (by ferry), Poland and Sweden (by ferry) required a visa to enter East Berlin or East Germany to allow transfer to an international train—which also carried domestic passengers—bound for an international destination. One railway connection between West Berlin and [[Oebisfelde]] (E)/[[Wolfsburg]] (W) was reserved for freight trains only.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

In July and August 1945, the three Western Allies and the Soviet Union decided that the railways, previously serviced by the [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (German Reich Railways), should continue to be operated by one railway administration to service all four sectors. So West Berlin had – with the exception of a few small private railway lines – no separate railway administration. Furthermore, the operation of the Reichsbahn's [[Berlin S-Bahn]] electric metropolitan transport network, consisting of commuter trains, was also maintained. After the founding of East Germany on 7 October 1949 it gained responsibility for the Reichsbahn in its territory. East Germany continued to run its railways under the official name [[Deutsche Reichsbahn (East Germany)|Deutsche Reichsbahn]], which thus maintained responsibility for almost all railway transport in all four sectors of Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;This explains the retaining of the name "Deutsche Reichsbahn" despite containing the word "Reich" (Nation or Empire) replaced in the names of all other institutions taken over by the communist GDR.&lt;/ref&gt; The GDR-controlled 'Bahnpolizei', the Reichsbahn's railway police, were authorised to patrol station premises and other railway property in the whole city including West Berlin.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}} The legal necessity of keeping the term 'Deutsche Reichsbahn' explains the surprising use of the word 'Reich' (with its Imperial and Nazi connotations) in the name of an official organisation of the communist GDR.

After the Berlin Blockade ''transit trains'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Transitzüge}}) would leave and enter West Berlin only via one line through [[Berlin-Wannsee railway station]] (W) and [[Potsdam Griebnitzsee railway station]] (E). All ''transit trains'' would start or end in East Berlin, passing through West Berlin with only one stop in the Western [[Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station]], which became West Berlin's main railway station. Until 1952, the Reichsbahn also permitted stops at other stations on the way through the Western sectors. After easing of tensions between East and West Germany, starting on 30 May 1976 ''transit trains'' going westwards, southwestwards, or southwards stopped once again at Wannsee. For ''transit trains'' going northwestwards, a shorter line was reopened on 26 September 1976 with an additional stop at the [[Berlin-Stresow railway station|then Berlin-Spandau railway station]], entering East Germany at [[Staaken]].{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

Many Reichsbahn employees working in West Berlin were West Berliners. Their East German employer, whose proceeds from ticket sales for Western Deutsche Marks contributed to East Germany's foreign revenues, tried to hold down wage [[social security]] contributions in Western Deutsche Mark. Therefore, West Berlin employees of the Reichsbahn were paid partly in Eastern German currency. They could spend this money in East Germany and take their purchases to West Berlin, which other Westerners could not do to the same extent. West Berlin employees were trained in East Germany and employed under East German labour laws.&lt;ref&gt;This was felt in 1980. The Reichsbahn tried to reduce its losses from operating West Berlin's S-Bahns by reducing the staff and the operation time in the evenings and nights, further reducing the salaries of the remaining employees. Being paid worse than West German railway workers, the West Berlin S-Bahn employees went on strike, which was legal in capitalist West Berlin, but illegal in communist East Berlin, because it was regarded as lacking loyalty to the communist party. The strikers occupied the signal towers, blocking any rail traffic in West Berlin as of 20 September. With the help of Soviet patrollers in West Berlin, East German railway workers recaptured the signal towers and other railway premises on 22 September. More than 200 West Berlin Reichsbahn employees who did not return to work were then dismissed. This was illegal under West Berlin law, because going on strike there does not provide legal grounds for a dismissal. However, as the Reichsbahn was out of western jurisdiction, the West Berlin government provided payment of unemployment benefits to the former Reichsbahn workers, despite the Reichsbahn never having paid contributions to the unemployment insurance fund in West Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; West Berliners employed by the Reichsbahn were not included in the Western health insurance system either. The Reichsbahn ran its own hospital for them in West Berlin, the building of which is now used as the headquarters of [[Bombardier Transportation]]. For certain patients, the Reichsbahn would facilitate treatment in a hospital in East Berlin. In medical emergencies, the employees could use West Berlin doctors and hospitals, which would then be paid for by the Reichsbahn.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

The GDR used the western stations to distribute propaganda and display posters with slogans like "Americans Go Home." On 1 May, May Day, a state holiday in East and West, S-Bahn trains were sometimes decorated with the East German banner and a red flag.

===Waterways===
Two waterways via the rivers and canals [[Havel]] and [[Mittellandkanal]] were open for [[inland navigation]], but only freight vessels were allowed to cross from West Berlin into East German waters. The Havel crossed at the East German border in Nedlitz (a part of [[Bornstedt (Potsdam)|Potsdam-Bornstedt]]), continuing through the [[Elbe-Havel Canal]] and then either taking the [[Elbe]] northwestwards crossing the border again at [[Cumlosen]] (E)/[[Schnackenburg]] (W) or westwards following the Mittellandkanal to [[Buchhorst (Oebisfelde)]] (E)/[[Rühen]] (W). Western freight vessels could stop only at dedicated service areas, because the East German government wanted to prevent any East Germans from boarding them. Through these waterways, West Berlin was linked to the western European inland navigation network, connecting to seaports like Hamburg and [[Rotterdam]], as well as to industrial areas such as the [[Ruhr Area]], [[Mannheim]], [[Basel]], Belgium, and eastern France.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

In July and August 1945, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union decided that the operation and maintenance of the waterways and locks, which were previously run by the national German directorate for inland navigation ({{lang-de|[[:de:Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Berlin|Wasser- und Schifffahrtsamt Berlin]]}}), should be continued and reconstructed in all four sectors.&lt;ref name="Karwelat 1984 5"&gt;Jürgen Karwelat, ''Passagen: Geschichte am Landwehrkanal'', Berliner Geschichtswerkstatt (ed.), Berlin: no publ., 1984, p. 5. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; So, except for the originally city-owned [[Neukölln Ship Canal]] and some canals built later (e.g. [[Westhafen Canal]]) and locks, West Berlin had no separate inland navigation authority, but the East Berlin-based authority operated most waterways and locks, their lockmasters were employed by the East.&lt;ref name="Karwelat 1984 5"/&gt; Because of their negligent maintenance, the western Allies later transferred their control to the Senate of Berlin (West).&lt;ref name="Karwelat 1984 6"&gt;Jürgen Karwelat, ''Passagen: Geschichte am Landwehrkanal'', Berliner Geschichtswerkstatt (ed.), Berlin: no publ., 1984, p. 6. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt;

The western entrance to the [[Teltowkanal]], connecting several industrial areas of West Berlin for heavy freight transport, was blocked by East Germany in Potsdam-[[Glienicke Bridge|Klein Glienicke]]. Therefore, vessels going to the Teltowkanal had to take a detour via the river [[Spree]] through West and East Berlin's city centre to enter the canal from the East. On 20 November 1981, East Germany reopened the western entrance, which required two more vessel border checkpoints – Dreilinden and [[Kleinmachnow]] – because the waterway crossed the border between East Germany and West Berlin four times. Another transit waterway connected West Berlin via the East German vessel checkpoint at Hennigsdorf and the [[Oder-Havel Canal]] with the [[Oder]] river and Polish [[Szczecin|Szczecin (Stettin)]].{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

===Air traffic===
[[File:Avro York - Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P004762, Berlin-Tempelhof, Flüchtlinge.jpg|thumb|right|Eastern refugees boarding an [[Avro York]] at [[Tempelhof Central Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] to fly into West Germany, 1953]] 
Air traffic was the only connection between West Berlin and the Western world that was not directly under East German control. On 4 July 1948, [[British European Airways]] opened the first regular service for civilians between West Berlin and Hamburg. Tickets were originally sold for [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] only.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} West Berliners and West Germans who had earlier fled East Germany or East Berlin, and thus could face imprisonment on entering East Germany or East Berlin, could only take flights for travel to and from West Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;East Germany requested East Germans and East Berliners wishing to leave the country to get exit permissions first. However, permissions were usually denied, and leaving the country without permission was [[Republikflucht]], considered as a criminal act by the East German justice system.&lt;/ref&gt; To enable individuals threatened by East German imprisonment to fly to and from West Berlin the West German government subsidised the flights.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

Flights between West Germany and West Berlin were under Allied control by the quadripartite [[Berlin Air Safety Center]]. According to permanent agreements, three [[West Berlin Air Corridor|air corridors]] to West Germany were provided, which were open only for British, French, or U.S. military planes or civilian planes registered with companies in those countries.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

The airspace controlled by the ''Berlin Air Safety Center'' comprised a radius of 20 miles (32.12&amp;nbsp;km) around the seat of the Center in the [[Kammergericht]] building in Berlin-[[Schöneberg]] – thus covering most of East and West Berlin and the three corridors, of the same width – one northwestwards to Hamburg ([[Fuhlsbüttel Airport]]), one westwards to Hanover, and one southwestwards to Frankfurt upon Main ([[Rhein-Main Air Base]]). The airspace expanding to a width of {{convert|20|mi|km|}} over the German–German border was subject to the control by the ''Berlin Air Safety Center''.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

The West German airline [[Lufthansa]] and most other international airlines were not permitted to fly to West Berlin. Flights by Lufthansa or the East German airline [[Interflug]] servicing connections between East and West Germany (such as between [[Düsseldorf]] and Hamburg in West Germany and the East German city of [[Leipzig]]) began in August 1989, but these routes had to go through Czechoslovak or Danish airspace.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

===Traffic between West Berlin and East Germany===
Until 1953, travelling from West Berlin into East Germany ([[German Democratic Republic]] (GDR)) fell under [[Interzonal traffic]] regulations overseen by the three Allied military governments (the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany|Soviet Military Administration in Germany (SVAG)]], the [[Control Commission for Germany – British Element]], and the [[Office of Military Government, United States|Office of Military Government/United States (OMGUS)]]). On 27 May 1952, East Germany closed its border with West Germany and its {{convert|115|km|mi|adj=on}}-long border with West Berlin. From then on West Berliners required a permit to enter East Germany. East German border checkpoints were established in East German suburbs of West Berlin, and most streets were gradually closed for interzonal travel into East Germany. The last checkpoint to remain open was located at the [[Glienicker Brücke]] near Potsdam, until it was also closed by East Germany on 3 July 1953. The checkpoint at Staaken's Heerstraße remained open only for transit traffic to West Germany.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}
[[File:BerlinerBlockadeLuftwege.png|thumb|left|300px|The only three permissible [[West Berlin Air Corridor]]s]] 

This caused hardship for many West Berlin residents, especially those who had friends and family in East Germany. However, East Germans could still enter West Berlin. A number of cemeteries located in East Germany were also affected by the closure. Many church congregations in Berlin owned cemeteries outside the city, so many West Berlin congregations had cemeteries that were located in East Germany. For example, the ''Friedhof vor Charlottenburg'' (in ''Cemetery in front/outside of Charlottenburg'') was located in the East German suburb of [[Dallgow-Döberitz|Dallgow]], yet belonged to Catholic congregations in Berlin-[[Charlottenburg]]. So many West Berliners wishing to visit the grave of a relative or friend on cemeteries located in East Germany were now unable to do so. Until 1961, East Germany sparsely issued permits to West Berliners to visit the cemeteries on the Catholic feast of ''All Saints'' on 1 November and on the Protestant [[Buß- und Bettag|Day of Repentance and Prayer]].{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

In 1948–1952, the Reichsbahn connected the western suburbs of West Berlin to its S-Bahn network. Train routes servicing these suburbs formerly went through West Berlin stations, but ceased to make stops in the western stations or terminated service before entering West Berlin. Private West Berlin railway lines like the [[Neukölln–Mittenwalde railway]] (Neukölln-Mittenwalder Eisenbahn, NME), connecting the East German [[Mittenwalde]] with West Berlin-[[Neukölln]] and the ''Bötzowbahn'' between West Berlin-[[Spandau]] and East German [[Hennigsdorf]], were disrupted at the border between West Berlin and East Germany on 26 October 1948 and August 1950, respectively.

Tramways and bus routes that connected West Berlin with its East German suburbs and were operated by West Berlin's public transport operator [[Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe|Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe Gesellschaft (''BVG'' West)]] ceased operation on 14 October 1950, after West Berlin tram and bus drivers had been repeatedly stopped and arrested by East German police for having western currency on them, considered a crime in the East.&lt;ref name="BVG"&gt;Cf. [http://home.arcor.de/boerge74/stadtbahn/text/tram/text/ausserhalb.html "BVG-Straßenbahnlinien außerhalb Berlins (Linien 47 und 96)"], on: [http://home.arcor.de/boerge74/stadtbahn/ ''Öffentlicher Nahverkehr in Berlin''], retrieved on 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The BVG (West) terminated route sections that extended into East Germany, like the southern end of tram line 47 to [[Schönefeld, Brandenburg|Schönefeld]], the southwestern end of tram line 96 to [[Kleinmachnow]], as well as two bus lines to [[Glienicke/Nordbahn|Glienicke at the Nordbahn]], north, and to [[Falkensee]], northwest of West Berlin.&lt;ref name="BVG"/&gt; The East German section of tram line 96 continued operating with eastern personnel and cars, obliging the eastern passengers – rarely westerners who needed special permits to enter East Germany - to change from eastern into western trains crossing the border by foot, until it was closed by the Wall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hahn-homepage.de/index.php/initiativen/linie-96/ "Linie 96, 2009"], on: [http://hahn-homepage.de/ ''Peter Hahn''], retrieved on 2 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reichsbahn shut down all of its West Berlin terminal stations and redirected its trains to stations in East Berlin, starting with [[Berlin Görlitzer Bahnhof]] – closed on 29 April 1951 – before serving rail traffic with [[Görlitz]] and the southeast of East Germany. On 28 August 1951, trains usually serving [[Lehrter Bahnhof|Berlin Lehrter Bahnhof]] were redirected to stations in East Berlin, while trains from West Germany were redirected to the Western ''Berlin Zoologischer Garten''. The Reichsbahn also closed down both [[Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof]] and [[Berlin Nordbahnhof]], on 18 May 1952.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

On 28 August 1951, the Reichsbahn opened a new connection – from Spandau via [[Berlin Jungfernheide station]] – for the S-Bahn lines connecting East German suburbs to the west of West Berlin (namely Falkensee, Staaken) with East Berlin, thus circumventing the centre of West Berlin. In June 1953, the Reichsbahn further cut off West Berlin from its East German suburbs by the introduction of additional ''express S-Bahn trains'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Durchläufer}}). These routes originated from several East German suburbs bordering West Berlin (such as Falkensee, Potsdam, [[Oranienburg]], Staaken, and [[Velten]]), crossing West Berlin non-stop until reaching its destinations in East Berlin. However, the regular S-Bahn connections with West Berlin's East German suburbs, stopping at every Western station, continued. From 17 June to 9 July 1953, East Germany blocked off any traffic between East and West due to the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]].

From 4 October 1953, all S-Bahn trains crossing the border between East Germany and Berlin had to pass a border checkpoint in East Germany. Travellers from East Germany were checked before entering any part of Berlin, to identify individuals intending to escape into West Berlin or smuggling rationed or rare goods into West Berlin. S-Bahn trains were checked at [[Hoppegarten]], [[Mahlow]], and [[Zepernick station|Zepernick]] in East Germany bordering East Berlin and in [[Hohen Neuendorf]], Potsdam-Griebnitzsee, and [[Staaken]]-Albrechtshof in East Germany bordering West Berlin. On 4 June 1954, the ''Bahnhof Hennigsdorf Süd'' station located next to West Berlin was opened solely for border controls, also to monitor West Berliners entering or leaving East Berlin, which they could still do freely, while they were not allowed to cross into East Germany proper without a special permit.

In 1951, the Reichsbahn began construction work on the [[Berlin outer ring|Berlin outer-circle railway line]]. This circular line connected all train routes heading for West Berlin and accommodated all domestic GDR traffic, thus directing railway traffic into East Berlin while by-passing West Berlin. Commuters in the East German suburbs around West Berlin now boarded ''Sputnik'' express trains, which took them into East Berlin without crossing any western sectors. With the completion of the outer-circle railway, there was no further need for express S-Bahn trains crossing the West Berlin border and thus their service ended on 4 May 1958, while stopping S-Bahn trains continued service. However, while East Germans could get off in West Berlin, West Berliners needed the hard-to get permits to enter East Germany by S-Bahn. With the construction of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, any remaining railway traffic between West Berlin and its East German suburbs ended. Rail traffic between East and West Berlin was sharply reduced and restricted to a small number of checkpoints under GDR control. East Berliners and East Germans were then unable to freely enter and leave West Berlin. However, international visitors could obtain visas for East Berlin upon crossing one of the checkpoints at the Wall.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

Following the [[Détente|policy of détente]] of the ''Federal Government'' under Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], West Berliners could again apply for visas to visit East Germany, which were granted more freely than in the period until 1961. On 4 June 1972, West Berlin's public transport operator ''BVG'' could open its first bus line into the East German suburbs since 1950 (line E to Potsdam via ''Checkpoint Bravo'' as it was known to the US military). This route was open only to persons bearing all the necessary East German permits and visas. For visits to East Germany, West Berliners could use four checkpoints along the East German border around West Berlin: The two road transit checkpoints Dreilinden (W)/Drewitz (E) and Berlin-[[Heiligensee]] (W)/Stolpe (E) as well as the old transit checkpoint at Heerstraße (W)/Staaken (E) and the checkpoint at Waltersdorfer Chaussee (W)/[[Schönefeld, Brandenburg|Schönefeld]] (E), which was also open for travellers boarding international flights at [[Berlin Schönefeld Airport|Schönefeld Airport]].{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

===Traffic between East and West Berlin===
While East and West Berlin became formally separate jurisdictions in September 1948, and while there were travel restrictions in all other directions for more than a decade, freedom of movement existed between the western sectors and the eastern sector of the city. However, time and again Soviet and later East German authorities imposed temporary restrictions for certain persons, certain routes, and certain means of transport. Gradually the eastern authorities disconnected and separated the two parts of the city.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

While the Soviets blocked all transport to West Berlin (Berlin Blockade between 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949), they increased food supplies in East Berlin in order to gain the compliance of West Berliners who at that time still had free access to East Berlin. West Berliners buying food in East Berlin were regarded as approving of the Soviet attempt to get rid of the Western Allies in West Berlin. This was seen as support by the communists and as treason by most Westerners. Until that time all over Germany food and other necessary supplies had been available only with ration stamps issued by one's municipality. This was so in East Berlin until the [[Berlin Blockade#The Communist putsch in the municipal government|Communist putsch in Berlin's city government]] in September 1948 – the unitary City Council of [[Greater Berlin]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Magistrat von Groß Berlin}}) for East and West.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

By July 1948 a mere 19,000 West Berliners out of a total of almost 2 million covered their food requirements in East Berlin. Thus, 99% of West Berliners preferred to live on shorter supplies than before the Blockade, to show support for the Western Allies' position. In West Germany rationing of most products ended with the introduction of the Western Deutsche Mark on 21 June 1948. The new currency was also introduced in West Berlin on 24 June and this, at least officially, was the justification for the Soviet Blockade due to which rationing in West Berlin had to continue. However, in the course of the [[Berlin Air Lift]] some supplies were increased beyond the pre-Blockade level and therefore rationing of certain goods in West Berlin was stopped.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

While West Berliners were officially welcome to buy food in East Berlin, the Soviets tried to prevent them from buying other essential supplies, particularly coal and other fuel. For this reason, on 9 November 1948, they opened checkpoints on 70 streets entering West Berlin and closed the others for horse carriages, lorries and cars, later (16 March 1949) the Soviets erected roadblocks on the closed streets. From 15 November 1948 West Berlin ration stamps were no longer accepted in East Berlin. All the same, the Soviets started a campaign with the slogan ''The smart West Berliner buys at the [[Handelsorganisation|HO]]'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Der kluge West-Berliner kauft in der HO}}), the HO being the Soviet zone chain of shops. They also opened so-called "Free Shops" in the Eastern Sector, offering supplies without ration stamps, but denominated at extremely high prices in Eastern [[East German Mark|Deutsche Marks]]. Ordinary East and West Berliners could only afford to buy there if they had income in Western Deutsche Mark and bartered the needed Eastern Deutsche Mark on the spontaneous currency markets, which developed in the British sector at the Zoo station. Their demand and supply determined a barter ratio in favour of the Western Deutsche Mark with more than 2 Eastern Deutsche Marks offered for one Western Deutsche Mark. After the Blockade, when holders of Western Deutsche Marks could buy as much they could afford, up to five and six east marks were offered for one west mark. In the East, however, the Soviets had arbitrarily decreed a rate of 1 for 1 and exchanging at other rates was criminalised.

On 12 May 1949 the Blockade ended and all roadblocks and checkpoints between East and West Berlin were removed. The Berlin Airlift, however, continued until 30 September 1949 in order to build up supplies in West Berlin (the so-called [[Senate Reserve]]), in readiness for another possible blockade, thus ensuring that an airlift could then be restarted with ease. On 2 May 1949 power stations in East Berlin started again to supply West Berlin with sufficient electricity. Before then, electricity supplies had to be reduced to just a few hours a day after the normal supplies had been interrupted at the start of the Blockade. However, the Western Allies and the West Berlin City Council decided to be self-sufficient in terms of electricity generation capacity, to be independent of Eastern supplies and not to be held to ransom by the eastern authorities. On 1 December 1949 the new ''powerhouse West'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Kraftwerk West}}, in 1953 renamed after the former Governing Mayor of West Berlin into ''Kraftwerk [[Ernst Reuter|Reuter]] West'') went online and West Berlin's electricity board declared independence from Eastern supplies. However, for a time Eastern electricity continued to be supplied albeit intermittently. Supply was interrupted from 1 July until the end of 1950 and then started again until 4 March 1952, when the East finally switched it off. From then on West Berlin turned into an 'electricity island' within a pan-European electricity grid that had developed from the 1920s, because electricity transfers between East and West Germany never fully ceased. The 'electricity island' situation was noticed most in situations of particularly high demand; in other areas of Europe peaks in demand could be met by tapping into electricity supplies from neighbouring areas, but in West Berlin this was not an option and for certain users the lights would go out.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

In 1952 West Berliners were restricted entry to East Germany proper by means of a hard-to-obtain East German permit. Free entry to East Berlin remained possible until 1961 and the building of the Wall. [[Berlin U-Bahn|Berlin's underground]] (Untergrundbahn, U-Bahn) and [[Berlin S-Bahn|Berlin's S-Bahn]] (a metropolitan public transit network), rebuilt after the war, continued to span all occupation sectors. Many people lived in one half of the city and had family, friends, and jobs in the other. However, the East continuously reduced the means of public transport between East and West, with private cars being a very rare privilege in the East and still a luxury in the West.

Starting on 15 January 1953 the tram network was interrupted. East Berlin's public transport operator ''Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe'' (''BVG''-East, ''BVB'' as of 1 January 1969) staffed all trams, whose lines crossed the sectorial border, with women drivers, who were not permitted as drivers by the ''BVG'' (West), West Berlin's public transport operator. Instead of changing the Western rules, so that the Easterly intended interruption of the cross-border tram traffic would not happen, the ''BVG'' (West) insisted on male drivers. So cross-border tram traffic ended on 16 January.&lt;ref&gt;It took the ''BVG'' (West) until 1 November 1973 to employ the first female bus driver, by which time all tram lines had been closed down in West Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; In East German propaganda this was a point for the East, arguing that the West did not allow drivers coming with their trams from the East to continue along their line into the West, but remaining silent on the fact that the end of cross-border tram traffic was most welcome to the East. The underground and the S-Bahn networks, except the above-mentioned ''traverse S-Bahn trains'', continued to provide services between East and West Berlin. However, occasionally the East Berlin police – in the streets and on cross-border trains in East Berlin – identified suspicious behaviour (such as carrying heavy loads westwards) and watched out for unwelcome Westerners.

Occasionally, West Germans were banned from entering East Berlin. This was the case between 29 August and 1 September 1960, when ex prisoners of war and deportees, ''homecomers'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Heimkehrer}}), from all around West Germany and West Berlin met for a convention in that city. The ''homecomers'' released mostly from a long detention in the Soviet Union were unwelcome in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;''Homecomers'' were either German civilians who had been deported into the Soviet Union from those territories it conquered, or former [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers and [[SS]] fighters, whom the Soviet Union kept as prisoners of war. They worked for many years as forced labourers in the Soviet Union, before they were finally released.&lt;/ref&gt; As they could not be recognised through their identification papers, all West Germans were banned from East Berlin during those days. West Berliners were allowed, since the quadripartite Allied status quo provided for their free movement around all four sectors. From 8 September 1960 on, the East subjected all West Germans to apply for a permit before entering East Berlin.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

As the communist government in the East gained tighter control, and the economic recovery in the West significantly outperformed the East, more than a hundred thousand East Germans and East Berliners left East Germany and East Berlin for the West every year. East Germany closed the borders between East and West Germany and sealed off the border with West Berlin in 1952; but because of the quadripartite Allied status of the city, the {{convert|46|km|mi|adj=on}}-long sectorial border between East and West Berlin remained open. As there was freedom of movement between West Berlin and West Germany, Easterners could use the city as a transit point to West Germany, usually travelling there by air.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

To stop this drain of people defecting, the East German government built the Berlin Wall, thus physically closing off West Berlin from East Berlin and East Germany, on 13 August 1961. All Eastern streets, bridges, paths, windows, doors, gates, and sewers opening to West Berlin were systematically sealed off by walls, concrete elements, barbed wire, and/or bars. The Wall was directed against the Easterners, who by its construction were no longer allowed to leave the East, except with an Eastern permit, not usually granted.
Westerners were still granted visas on entering East Berlin. Initially eight street checkpoints were opened, and one checkpoint in the [[Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station]], which was reached by one line of the Western underground (today's [[U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U 6]]), two Western S-Bahn lines, one under and one above ground (approximately today's [[S2 (Berlin)|S 2]] and [[S3 (Berlin)|S 3]], however, lines changed significantly from 1990 onwards), and ''transit trains'' between West Germany and West Berlin started and ended there.
[[File:Karte berliner mauer en.jpg|thumb|left| Map showing location of the Berlin Wall and transit points]]
The eight street checkpoints were – from North to South along the Wall – on Bornholmer Straße, Chausseestraße, Invalidenstraße, [[Berlin Friedrichstraße station]], [[Friedrichstraße]] ([[Checkpoint Charlie]] in US military denomination, since this crossing was to their sector), Heinrich-Heine-Straße, [[Oberbaum Bridge|Oberbaumbrücke]], and [[Sonnenallee, Berlin|Sonnenallee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Border crossings between East and West Berlin|url=http://www.berlin.de/mauer/en/sites/former-checkpoints/|website=Berlin.de|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the construction of the Wall started after midnight early on 13 August, West Berlin's Governing Mayor Willy Brandt was on a West German federal election campaigning tour in West Germany. Arriving by train in Hanover at {{nobr|4 am}} he was informed about the Wall and flew back to West Berlin's [[Tempelhof Central Airport]].

In the course of the day he protested along with many other West Berliners on [[Potsdamer Platz]] and at the ''Brandenburg Gate''. On 14 August, under the pretext that Western demonstrations required it, the East closed the checkpoint at the ''Brandenburg Gate'' 'until further notice', a situation that was to last until 22 December 1989, when it was finally reopened.

On 26 August 1961 East Germany generally banned West Berliners from entering the Eastern sector. West Germans and other nationals, however, could still get visas on entering East Berlin. Since intra-city phone lines had been cut by the East already in May 1952 (see below) the only remaining way of communication with family or friends on the other side was by mail or at meeting in a motorway restaurant on a ''transit route'', because the ''transit traffic'' remained unaffected throughout.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

On 18 May 1962 East Germany opened the so-called [[Tränenpalast]] checkpoint hall (''Palace of Tears'') at Berlin Friedrichstraße station, where Easterners had to say a sometimes tearful farewell to returning Westerners as well as the few Easterners who had managed to get a permit to visit the West. Until June 1963 the East deepened its border zone around West Berlin in East Germany and East Berlin by clearing existing buildings and vegetation to create an open field of view, sealed off by the Berlin Wall towards the West and a second wall or fence of similar characteristics to the East, observed by armed men in towers, [[Schießbefehl|with orders to shoot at escapees]].{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

Finally, in 1963, West Berliners were again allowed to visit East Berlin. On this occasion a further checkpoint for pedestrians only was opened on the [[Oberbaumbrücke]]. West Berliners were granted visas for a one-day visit between 17 December 1963 and 5 January the following year. 1.2 million out of a total 1.9 million West Berliners visited East Berlin during this period. In 1964, 1965, and 1966 East Berlin was opened again to West Berliners, but each time only for a limited period.

East Germany assigned different legal statuses to East Germans, East Berliners, West Germans, and West Berliners, as well as citizens from other countries in the world. Until 1990 East Germany designated each [[Berlin border crossings#Border crossings|Border crossings in East Berlin]] for certain categories of persons, with only one street checkpoint being open simultaneously for West Berliners and West Germans (Bornholmer Straße) and ''Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station'' being open for all travellers.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

On 9 September 1964, the East German [[Government of East Germany|Council of Ministers]] (government) decided to allow Eastern pensioners to visit family in West Germany or West Berlin. According to the specified regulations valid from 2 November on Eastern pensioners could apply, and were usually allowed, to travel into the West to visit relatives once a year for a maximum of four weeks. If pensioners decided not to return, the government did not miss them as manpower, unlike younger Easterners, who were subject to a system of labour and employment, which demanded that almost everybody work in the Eastern command production system.

On 2 December 1964 East Germany, always short of hard currency, decreed that every Western visitor had to buy a minimum of 5 Eastern ''Mark der Deutschen Notenbank'' per day (MDN,&lt;ref&gt;Literally in ''Mark of the German Bank of Issue'', which was then the name of the East German state bank.&lt;/ref&gt; 1964–1968 the official name of the East German mark, to distinguish it from the West Deutsche Mark) at the still held arbitrary compulsory rate of 1:1. The 5 marks had to be spent, as exporting Eastern currency was illegal, which is why importing it after having bargained for it at the currency market at Zoo station was also illegal. Western pensioners and children were spared from the compulsory exchange (officially in {{lang-de|[[:de:Mindestumtausch|Mindestumtausch]]}}, i.e. ''minimum exchange''). Not long after East Germany held the first cash harvest from the new compulsory exchange rules by allowing West Berliners to visit East Berlin once more for a day during the Christmas season. The following year, 1965, East Germany opened the travelling season for West Berliners on 18 December. In 1966 it opened for a second harvest of Western money between the Easter (10 April) and [[Pentecost]] (29 May) holidays and later again at Christmas.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

The situation only changed fundamentally after 11 December 1971 when, representing the two German states, [[Egon Bahr]] from the West and Michael Kohl from the East signed the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]]. This was followed by a similar agreement for West Berliners, once more allowing regular visits to East Germany and East Berlin.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

After ratification of the Agreement and specifying the relevant regulations, West Berliners could apply for the first time again for visas for any chosen date to East Berlin or East Germany from 3 October 1972 onwards. If granted, a one-day-visa entitled them to leave the East until 2&amp;nbsp;am the following day. West Berliners were now spared the visa fee of 5 Western Deutsche Marks, not to be confused with the compulsory exchange amounting to the same sum, but yielding in return 5 Eastern marks. This financial relief did not last long, because on 15 November 1973 East Germany doubled the compulsory exchange to 10 Eastern marks, payable in West German Deutsche Marks at par.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

One-day-visas for East Berlin were now issued in a quickened procedure; visas for longer stays and visas for East Germany proper needed a prior application, which could be a lengthy procedure. To ease the application for West Berliners seeking such Eastern visas, the GDR Foreign Ministry was later allowed to open ''Offices for the Affairs of Visits and Travelling'' ({{lang-de|link=no|Büros für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten}}) in West Berlin, but were not allowed to show any official symbols of East Germany. The Eastern officials working commuted every morning and evening between East and West Berlin. Their uniforms showed no official symbols except the name ''Büro für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten''. They accepted visa applications and handed out confirmed visas issued in the East to the West Berlin applicants. A shed formerly housing one such ''Büro für Besuchs- und Reiseangelegenheiten'' can be found on Waterlooufer 5–7 in Berlin-[[Kreuzberg]], close to [[Hallesches Tor (Berlin U-Bahn)|Hallesches Tor underground station]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wissenswertes über Berlin: Nachschlagewerk für zuziehende Arbeitnehmer von A-Z'' (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;1968), Senator für Wirtschaft und Arbeit (ed.), Berlin (West): Senator für Wirtschaft und Arbeit, &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;1986, p. 117. No ISBN.&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement about Berlin's status was one of the most important debates of the Cold War.

Another form of traffic between East and West Berlin was the transfer of West Berlin's sewage into East Berlin and East Germany through the sewer pipes built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The sewage flowed into the East because most of the pre-war premises for sewage treatment, mostly [[sewage farm]]s, happened to be in the East after the division of the city. Sewer pipes, however, once discovered as a way to flee the East, were blocked by bars. West Berlin paid for the treatment of its sewage in Western Deutsche Marks which were desperately needed by the East German government. Since the methods used in the East did not meet Western standards, West Berlin increased the capacity of modern sewage treatment within its own territory, so that the amount of its sewage treated in the East had been considerably reduced by the time the Wall came down.

The situation with refuse was similar. The removal, burning or disposal of the ever-growing amount of West Berlin's rubbish became a costly problem, but here too an agreement was found, since West Berlin would pay in Western Deutsche Marks. On 11 December 1974 East Germany and West Berlin's garbage utility company ''BSR'' signed a contract to dispose of refuse on a dump right beside the Wall in East German Groß-Ziethen (today a part of [[Schönefeld, Brandenburg|Schönefeld]]). An extra checkpoint, solely open for Western bin lorries (garbage trucks), was opened there. Later on, a second dump, further away, was opened in Vorketzin, a part of [[Ketzin]].{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

As for the S-Bahn, operated throughout Berlin by the East German Reichsbahn, the construction of the Wall meant a serious disruption of its integrated network, especially of the [[Berlin Ringbahn|Berlin's circular S-Bahn line]] around all of the Western and Eastern inner city. The lines were separated and those mostly located in West Berlin were continued, but only accessible from West Berlin with all access in East Berlin closed. However, even before the Wall had been built, West Berliners increasingly refrained from using the S-Bahn, since boycotts against it were issued, the argument being that every S-Bahn ticket bought provided the GDR government with valuable Western Deutsche Marks.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

Usage dropped further as the Western public transport operator ''BVG'' (West) offered parallel bus lines and expanded its network of underground lines. After the construction of the Wall usage dropped so much that running the S-Bahn lines in West Berlin turned into a loss-making exercise: wages and maintenance – however badly it was carried out – cost more than income from ticket sales. Finally, the Reichsbahn agreed to surrender operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin, as had been determined by all Allies in 1945, and on 29 December 1983 the Allies, the Senate of Berlin (West; i.e. the city state government) and the Reichsbahn signed an agreement to change the operator from Reichsbahn to ''BVG'' (West) which took effect on 9 January 1984.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

On 9 November 1989 East Germany opened the borders for East Germans and East Berliners, who could then freely enter West Berlin. West Berlin itself had never restricted their entry. For West Berliners and West Germans the opening of the border for free entry lasted longer. The regulation concerning one-day-visas on entering the East and the compulsory minimum exchange of 25 Western Deutsche Marks by 1989, continued. However, more checkpoints were opened. Finally on 22 December 1989 East Germany granted West Berliners and West Germans free entry without charge at the existing checkpoints, demanding only valid papers. Eastern controls were slowly eased into spot checks and finally abolished on 30 June 1990, the day East and West introduced the ''union concerning currency, economy and social security'' ({{lang-de|[[:de:Währungs-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialunion|Währungs-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialunion]]}}).{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}

===Traffic between different parts of West Berlin crossing the East===
When the Wall was built in 1961, three metro lines starting in northern parts of West Berlin passed through tunnels under the Eastern city centre and ended again in southern parts of West Berlin. The lines concerned were today's underground lines [[U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U 6]] and [[U8 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U 8]] and the S-Bahn line [[S2 (Berlin)|S 2]] (today partly also used by other lines). On the sealing off of West Berlin from East Berlin by the Berlin Wall the entrances of the stations on these lines located in East Berlin were shut. However, western trains were allowed to continue to pass through without stopping. Passengers of these trains experienced the empty and barely lit [[Ghost station#Ghost stations in Berlin|ghost stations]] where time had stood still since 13 August 1961. West Berlin's public transport operator ''BVG'' (West) paid the east an annual charge in Western Deutsche Marks for its underground lines to use the tunnels under East Berlin. [[U6 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U 6]] and [[S2 (Berlin)|S 2]] also had one subterranean stop at the Eastern [[Berlin Friedrichstraße railway station]], the only station beneath East Berlin where western U Bahn trains were still allowed to stop. Passengers could change there between U 6, S 2 and the elevated S 3 (then starting and ending in Friedrichstraße) or for the transit trains to West Germany, buy duty-free tobacco and liquor for Western marks in GDR-run [[Intershop]] kiosks, or enter East Berlin through a checkpoint right in the station.{{citation needed|reason=|date=August 2015}}
