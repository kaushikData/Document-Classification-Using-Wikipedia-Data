'''Abu Muhammad Abd al-Wahid 'al-Makhlu'''' (also known as '''Abd al-Wahid I''', {{lang-ar|أبو محمد عبد الواحد بن يوسف}} ''Abū Muḥammad ‘Abd al-Wāhid bin Yūsuf'') was the [[Almohad]] [[King of Morocco|Caliph of Morocco]] for less than a year in 1224.

Abd al-Wahid was the son of the great [[Almohad]] conqueror [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] and younger brother of the late Caliph [[Yaqub al-Mansur]] (d.1199).  He had served with distinction on campaign in [[al-Andalus]], was appointed governor of [[Málaga]] in 1202, and ''sheikh'' of the [[Masmuda]] tribe of the [[Haskura]] in 1206.  He served for some time after that as governor in [[Sijilmassa]], and around 1221, was briefly governor in [[Seville]].&lt;ref name = kennedy&gt;Hugh Kennedy (1996) ''Muslim Spain and Portugal: A Political History of al-Andalus''. London: Addison-Wesley-Longman&lt;/ref&gt;

Abd al-Wahid was back in [[Marrakesh]] in February 1224, when his grand-nephew, the young Almohad caliph [[Yusuf II, Almohad Caliph|Yusuf II]], was accidentally killed, leaving no heirs.  The palace [[vizier]] [[Abu Sa`id Uthman ibn Jam`i]] quickly drafted the elderly Abd al-Wahid, then in his sixties, and presented him before the Almohad sheikhs of Marrakesh, who promptly elected him as the new Almohad Caliph.  However, the hastiness of the election and the probable unconstitutionality of these proceedings, was disputed by his other nephews, the brothers of al-Nasir, who governed in [[al-Andalus]].  Like other leading Almohad family nobles, the brothers had probably hoped for a less-experienced and more pliable candidate, likelier to give them freer rein to carry on autonomously in the provinces, as they had enjoyed during the caliphate of Yusuf II.&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;  The succession stunt unbalanced the careful coalition that had been built up over decades,  setting different branches of the Almohad family member against each other, and against the palace bureaucrats and the tribal sheikhs.

It was the first serious succession dispute in the Almohad Caliphate. Despite disagreements, the Almohad coalition had hitherto loyally lined up behind the new caliph.  Not this time.  Instigated by the shadowy figure of Abu Zayd ibn Yujjan, a former high bureaucrat who been disgraced and exiled by al-Jami'i, the brothers decided to elect their own Caliph [[Abdallah al-Adil]] in [[Seville]], and set about ferrying troops from Spain to challenge Abd al-Wahid I in Morocco.

The new caliphate did not last long.  Ibn Yujjan pulled on his old contacts in southern Morocco, notably Abu Zakariya, the sheikh of the Hintata tribe, and Yusuf ibn Ali, governor of Tinmal, who seized the Marrkesh palace and cleared out Ibn Jami'i and his coterie (Ibn Jami'i was eventually killed, while in exile in the [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]].&lt;ref name = kennedy/&gt;  The caliph himself, Abd al-Wahid I, was murdered by strangulation in September 1224.  The nickname by which he is frequently referred to in the chronicles, "''al-Makhlu''", means "the Deposed".

He was a wealthy merchant. He was known as ''Zad ar-Rakib'' because on all his journeys he paid the expenses of every person in the company.&lt;ref name=Tabari39/&gt;{{rp|80}}

==Rebuilding of the Kaaba==

Abu Umayya was the chief of Mecca at the time when the [[Kaaba]] was rebuilt&lt;ref name=Ishaq2&gt;Guillaume, A. (1960). ''New Light on the Life of Muhammad''. Manchester: Manchester University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}} in 605. All the clans of Quraysh shared this task, with the Makhzum clan working on the section between the Black Stone and the southern corner.&lt;ref name=Ishaq1/&gt;{{rp|84–85}}

Controversy arose over who should have the honour of replacing the Black Stone. The dispute became so severe that for four or five days, all work on the rebuilding ceased. Abu Umayya played a key role in settling the dispute by suggesting that the next man to enter the gate should be appointed umpire. The Quraysh agreed to this. As it happened, the next man to walk in was the future prophet Muhammad. The Quraysh were pleased, saying, "This is the Trustworthy One. We are satisfied. This is Muhammad." He settled the dispute by placing the Black Stone on a cloak. Representatives from each clan took one corner, and they lifted the cloak together. Muhammad then placed the stone with his own hand.&lt;ref name=Ishaq1 /&gt;{{rp|86}}

The relationship between '''antidepressant use and suicide risk''' is a subject of medical research.   Studies have shown that the use of some [[antidepressants]] correlate with an increased risk of [[suicide]] in some patients, and this problem has been serious enough to warrant government interventions in some places to label greater likelihood of suicide as a risk of using antidepressants. The circumstances under which this can happen are not clear, and other studies show that antidepressants treat [[suicidal ideation]].

==Higher risk for youth==
People under the age of 24 who suffer from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] are warned that the use of antidepressants could increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviour.  Federal health officials unveiled proposed changes to the labels on antidepressant drugs in December 2006 to warn people of this danger.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The [[FDA]] warns against the use of [[Paxil]] for children and teens depression in favor of [[Prozac]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

SSRI prescriptions for children and adolescents decreased after U.S. and European regulatory agencies issued warnings about a possible suicide risk with antidepressant use in pediatric patients, and these decreases were associated with increases in suicide rates in children and adolescents in both the United States with a 14% increase, and 50% increase in the [[Netherlands]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

A 2016 review of 70 clinical trials of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs) and [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs) including about 18,500 subjects and relied on clinical reports as well as the available data looked at four outcomes—death, [[Suicidal ideation|suicidality]], aggressive behaviour, and [[akathisia|agitation]]—and found that while the data was insufficient to draw strong conclusions, adults taking these drugs did not appear to be at increased risk for any of the four outcomes, but that for children, the risks of suicidality and for aggression doubled.  The authors expressed frustration with incomplete reporting and lack of access to data, and with some aspects of the clinical trial designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Tarang|last2=Guski|first2=Louise Schow|last3=Freund|first3=Nanna|last4=Gøtzsche|first4=Peter C.|date=2016-01-27|title=Suicidality and aggression during antidepressant treatment: systematic review and meta-analyses based on clinical study reports|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/352/bmj.i65|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=352|pages=i65|doi=10.1136/bmj.i65|issn=1756-1833|pmc=4729837|pmid=26819231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warnings==
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) requires "[[black box warnings]]" on all SSRIs, which state that they double suicidal ideation rates (from 2 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000) in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.332.7542.626-c |title=Antidepressants double suicidality in children, says FDA |year=2006 |last1=Lenzer |first1=J. |journal=BMJ |volume=332 |issue=7542 |pages=626 |pmc=1403224}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remains controversial whether increased risk of suicide is due to the medication (a [[paradoxical effect]]) or part of the depression itself (i.e. the antidepressant enables those who are severely depressed—who ordinarily would be paralyzed by their depression—to become more alert and act out suicidal urges before being fully recovered from their depressive episode).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://patient.info/health/ssri-antidepressants|title = SSRI Antidepressants|publisher = Patient.info|date = 2010-10-27|accessdate = 2012-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased risk for suicidality and suicidal behaviour among adults under 25 approaches that seen in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.b2880 |title=Risk of suicidality in clinical trials of antidepressants in adults: Analysis of proprietary data submitted to US Food and Drug Administration |year=2009 |last1=Stone |first1=M. |last2=Laughren |first2=T. |last3=Jones |first3=M L. |last4=Levenson |first4=M. |last5=Holland |first5=P C. |last6=Hughes |first6=A. |last7=Hammad |first7=T.

Young patients should be closely monitored for signs of suicidal ideation or behaviors, especially in the first eight weeks of therapy.
Sertraline, tricyclic agents and venlafaxine were found to increase the risk of attempted suicide in severely depressed adolescents on Medicaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olfson|first1=Mark|last2=Marcus|first2=Steven|last3=Shaffer|first3=David|title=Antidepressant Drug Therapy and Suicide in Severely Depressed Children and Adults|journal=Arch Gen Psychiatry|date=Aug 2006|volume=63|issue=8|page=868|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.63.8.865|pmid=16894062|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increased risk for quitting medication==
A 2009 study showed increased risk of suicide after [[initiation]], [[Titration (disambiguation)|titration]], and discontinuation of medication.&lt;ref name="Valuck 2009 1069–1077"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4088/JCP.08m04943 |title=Antidepressant Discontinuation and Risk of Suicide Attempt |year=2009 |last1=Valuck |first1=Robert J. |last2=Orton |first2=Heather D. |last3=Libby |first3=Anne M. |journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=70 |issue=8 |pages=1069–77 |pmid=19758520}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 159,810 users of either [[amitriptyline]], [[fluoxetine]], [[paroxetine]] or [[dothiepin]] found that the risk of suicidal behavior is increased in the first month after starting antidepressants, especially during the first 1 to 9 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.292.3.338 |title=Antidepressants and the Risk of Suicidal Behaviors |year=2004 |last1=Jick |first1=H. |journal=JAMA |volume=292 |issue=3 |pages=338–43 |pmid=15265848 |last2=Kaye |first2=JA |last3=Jick |first3=SS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevalence==
On September 6, 2007, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] reported that the suicide rate in American [[adolescents]], (especially girls, 10 to 24 years old), increased 8% (2003 to 2004), the largest jump in 15 years,&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/07/health/07suicide.html |title=Suicide Rises in Youth; Antidepressant Debate Looms |first=Benedict |last=Carey |work=New York Times |date=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 4,599 suicides in Americans ages 10 to 24 in 2004, from 4,232 in 2003, giving a suicide rate of 7.32 per 100,000 people that age. The rate previously dropped to 6.78 per 100,000 in 2003 from 9.48 per 100,000 in 1990. Jon Jureidini, a critic of this study, says that the US "2004 suicide figures were compared simplistically with the previous year, rather than examining the change in trends over several years".&lt;ref name="pmid18056248"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07091463 |title=The Black Box Warning: Decreased Prescriptions and Increased Youth Suicide? |year=2007 |last1=Jureidini |first1=J. |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=164 |issue=12 |pages=1907; author reply 1908–10 |pmid=18056248}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that the pitfalls of such attempts to infer a trend using just two data points (years 2003 and 2004) are further demonstrated by the fact that, according to the new [[epidemiological]] data, the suicide rate in 2005 in children and adolescents actually declined despite the continuing decrease of SSRI prescriptions.

==Antidepressants decrease suicide risk==
A study in 2012, involving the analysis of data from 41 clinical trials with more than 9,000 patients, concluded "Fluoxetine and venlafaxine decreased suicidal thoughts and behavior for adult and geriatric patients. This protective effect is mediated by decreases in depressive symptoms with treatment. For youths, no significant effects of treatment on suicidal thoughts and behavior were found, although depression responded to treatment. No evidence of increased suicide risk was observed in youths receiving active medication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2048 |laysummary=http://health.usnews.com/health-news/news/articles/2012/02/06/antidepressants-may-not-raise-suicide-risk-in-youth-study |laysource=HealthDay News |laydate=February 6, 2012 |title=Suicidal Thoughts and Behavior with Antidepressant Treatment: Reanalysis of the Randomized Placebo-Controlled Studies of Fluoxetine and Venlafaxine |year=2012 |last1=Gibbons |first1=Robert D. |journal=Archives of General Psychiatry |volume=69 |issue=6 |pages=580–7 |pmid=22309973 |last2=Brown |first2=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">The '''Arlington Ladies''' are a group of women who attend the funeral of every member of the [[United States armed forces]] who is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. The group also includes one man who is known as the '''Arlington Gentleman'''.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Helen|title=Special lady for each Arlington soldier-Volunteers honor troops and make sure none is buried alone|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37416579/ns/us_news-life/|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=30 May 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100531192800/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/37416579/ns/us_news-life/| archivedate= 31 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arlington Ladies.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Arlington Lady being escorted to a grave on May 6, 2008]]

The history of the group traces its existence to 1948, when [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]] [[Hoyt Vandenberg]], and his wife Gladys, witnessed young servicemembers being buried without any family members present on one of their walks through the cemetery. Just a chaplain and a military honor guard, the standard attendees, were usually present. The lack of anyone honoring the young airman being buried prompted Gladys to form a group of members of the Officers' Wives Club to attend all Air Force funerals. In 1972, the wife of [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[General]] [[Creighton Abrams]], Julia, founded the [[United States Army|Army's]] version of the group. In 1985, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] also followed suit by creating a group of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/grim-duty-in-sectition-60.htm The Arlington National Cemetery Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The Coast Guard Arlington Ladies group formed in 2006. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.arlingtoncemetery.mil/Funeral-Information/About-Funerals/Arlington-Ladies&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://soldiers.dodlive.mil/2014/05/arlington-ladies-ensure-no-soldier-will-ever-be-buried-alone/&lt;/ref&gt; The Marine Corps Arlington Ladies were established in 2016.

Originally, the women worked alone at the funerals. Escorts were eventually added as it was decided that they should appear to be a more official part of the ceremony. The escorts are also members of the Army's [[3rd US Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|3rd Infantry Regiment]]. The Army soldiers typically spend four months as escorts while the Navy men are permanently assigned and will spend their entire tours on assignment.&lt;ref name=MSNBC /&gt;

The group initially included military wives, but it now includes military daughters and even a gentleman. The Army Arlington ladies must be wives or widows of Army men and be referred by a current wife. The Navy and Air Force follow similar requirements for their ladies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7149">'''Asfar ibn Shiruya''' ([[Gilaki language|Gilaki]]/{{lang-fa|اسفار بن شیرویه}}: died 931) was an Iranian military leader of [[Gilaks|Gilaki]] origin, active in northern [[Iran]] (esp. [[Tabaristan]] and [[Jibal]]) in the early 10th century. He played a major role in the succession disputes of the [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran|Alids of Tabaristan]], and managed to establish himself as the ruler of Tabaristan and northern Jibal briefly from 928 to 930.

==Name==
''Asfār'' is a local [[Caspian languages|Caspian]] form of [[Middle Persian]] ''aswār'', which means "rider, cavalryman". The [[New Persian]] form of the word is ''savār''.{{sfn|Bosworth|1987|pp=747-748}}

== Biography ==
===Background and early life===
[[File:Caspian coast of Iran during the Iranian intermezzo.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of northern Iran]]
A native of [[Lahijan]], Asfar belonged to the Gilaki clan of Varudavand{{cref|b}}, and was the son of a certain Shiruya (Sheroe).{{sfn|Bosworth|1987|pp=747-748}} Asfar had a brother named Shirzad, and grew up in an environment where "[[Culture of Iran|Iranian culture]], memories of the glories of the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]], were alive among them." Like many other Gilakis and Daylamites, Asfar was not a Muslim—he was in fact a nationalist, who admired the Persian Empire.{{sfn|Bosworth|1987|pp=747-748}} According to the 10th-century [[Arabs|Arab]] historian [[al-Masudi]], most of the [[Daylamites|Daylamite]] and Gilaki leaders, who were [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] and pagan, had become [[atheist]]s.{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=88}} Asfar was one of the many Gilaki leaders that entered into the service of the [[Alid dynasties of northern Iran|Alids]], after establishing their rule over [[Tabaristan]], [[Gilan Province|Gilan]], and [[Daylam]].{{sfn|Madelung|1969|p=88}}

===Rise to power===
Asfar is first mentioned in 917, during the succession disputes for control in Tabaristan after the death of the Alid ruler [[Hasan al-Utrush]] (r. 914–917). Eventually, [[Hasan ibn Qasam]] (called ''al-da'i al-saghir'', "the lesser missionary") managed to emerge victorious. It was around this period, that the [[Samanid Empire]] was seeking to expand their power from [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] into northern Iran, opposing [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi Shia Islam]] there whilst advocating the Sunni movement against it.{{sfn|Bosworth|1987|pp=747-748}}

===Reign and downfall===
Asfar now expanded his domains over [[Rey, Iran|Ray]], [[Qazvin]] and other parts of [[Jibal]], initially apparently as a delegate of the Samanids, but thereafter as an sovereign ruler, assuming the emblem of kingship at Ray in disregard of Nasr II and the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[caliph]], [[al-Muqtadir]] (r. 908-932). He reportedly killed a great number of the citizens of Qazvin, burned the markets, demolished mosques and killed the ''[[muezzin]]'', and prohibited the ''[[salah]]''. Furthermore, he enforced a poll-tax on the whole population of the city, along with traders visiting from other countries, thus acquiring a vast sum.{{sfn|Bosworth|1987|pp=747-748}} He also appointed his lieutenant and compatriot [[Mardavij]] as the governor of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]]. 
[[File:Iran - Qazvin - Alamout Castle View.jpg|thumb|260px|View of the [[Alamut Castle]], where Asfar had left his vast treasure.]]
In 930, Mardavij along with Asfar's brother, Shirzad, were ordered to capture [[Tarom County|Tarom]], the capital of the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarid]] ruler [[Muhammad ibn Musafir]]. During the siege, Mardavij, on the urging of Makan and Muhammad, betrayed Asfar by revolting against him. With the aid of Muhammad and Makan, Mardavij defeated and killed Shirzad, including other members of the Varudavand clan. He then marched towards Qazvin, the residence of Asfar. However, Asfar managed to flee. Mardavij thus founded the [[Ziyarid dynasty]], and became ruler of Asfar's former territories.{{sfn|Madelung|1975|p=212}}

Asfar was chased into Khorasan, being left no choice but to leave the treasure which he had assembled in the [[Alamut Castle|castle]] of [[Alamut]] in Daylam. When Asfar arrived at [[Sabzevar|Bayhaq]], however, he went back, aiming to recover his treasure at Alamut. But when he entered Talaqan, a town in Daylam near Qazvin,{{sfn|Pellat|Cahen|2012}} he was overwhelmed and killed by Mardavij, most likely in 931.{{sfn|Bosworth|1987|pp=747-748}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="988">'''Baloma''' is the spirit of the dead in [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand]] society, as studied by [[Bronislaw Malinowski]], 1922. It plays a key role in conception ideologies and explains and maintains the [[matrilineal]] descent system by substituting the role of male sperm ("fathers") with that of a spirit. The baloma is that spirit of a deceased lineage member which impregnates the women while bathing in the sea, perpetuating the matrilineage intragenerationally. The role of [[sexual intercourse]] is only indirectly related to conception within Trobriand mentality and seen as a way of opening the path for the baloma to enter the woman's womb.

The '''Bethel Regional High School shooting''' was a [[school shooting]] that occurred on February 19, 1997, when student Evan Ramsey shot and killed two people and wounded two others at [[Bethel Regional High School]] in [[Bethel, Alaska]]. Ramsey is serving two 99-year prison sentences and will be eligible for parole in 2066 when he is 85.

==Prior events==
Reports say in the two weeks prior to the incident, more than 15 students knew of Ramsey's intention to commit a school shooting, and two actually assisted him.&lt;ref name="would die"/&gt; One student named James Randall taught him how to load and fire a [[shotgun]], and another named Matthew Charles told him of the infamy that would come.&lt;ref name="rage"/&gt; Reports say that several students brought cameras to school on the day of the shooting, and that many students were watching the shooting from a library balcony overlooking the student commons area.&lt;ref name="plans"&gt;[http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/ntac/chicago_sun/evan16.htm School shooters usually tell friends their plans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103000215/http://www.ustreas.gov/usss/ntac/chicago_sun/evan16.htm |date=January 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shooting==
On February 19, 1997, Ramsey armed himself with a [[Mossberg 500]] [[12-gauge]] [[shotgun]], and arrived at Bethel Regional High School by school bus. He approached the student commons area, brandishing the shotgun, and shot 15-year-old Josh Palacios in the abdomen, who later died after emergency surgery. He then shot and injured two other students. Reyne Athanas, an art teacher, entered the commons area after hearing the gunshots. Athanas said she tried and failed to convince Ramsey to surrender. He then entered the main lobby, where he shot principal Ron Edwards twice, killing him. Ramsey then retreated to the commons area, shooting once at police. Ramsey later placed the shotgun barrel under his chin, but then reportedly said, "I don't want to die," laid the shotgun on the ground, and surrendered without further incident.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Motives===
Ramsey was believed to be frequently [[bullying|bullied]] at school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktuu.com/Global/story.asp?S=6110911 Bethel remembers and reflects on school shooting anniversary]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="voices"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article |title=/0,8599,127231,00.html Young Voices from the Cell |publisher=Time.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ktuu.com/global/story.asp?s=6117416 Bethel works to prevent bullying] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516012309/http://ktuu.com/global/story.asp?s=6117416 |date=May 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friends, Ramsey complained of being harassed and teased by other students, even to the extent of only addressing him as "Screech", a character from the TV series ''[[Saved by the Bell]]''.&lt;ref name="voices"/&gt; In addition to being picked on by peers, however, Ramsey had a long history of abuse. His mother lived with a series of violent men who abused Ramsey and his brothers. He also was physically and sexually abused by an older boy in one of the foster homes he was placed.&lt;ref&gt;Langman, Peter. ''Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters''.

Evan Ramsey (born February 8, 1981) was identified as the gunman. When he was five years old, his father was imprisoned after a police standoff and his mother became an alcoholic. Ramsey and his family soon after were forced to relocate to the [[Anchorage]] area after their house was set on fire. When he was seven, the Anchorage Department of Youth and Family Services removed Ramsey and his two brothers from his mother's custody and placed them in foster care. He was soon separated from his older brother, John, and lived in eleven different foster homes between 1988 and 1991.&lt;ref name="rage"/&gt; Ramsey and his younger brother were allegedly [[child abuse|abused]] by several foster parents. His younger brother, William, claimed that their foster brothers would pay other children to beat Evan for their amusement.

Ramsey was adopted with his brother at age 10, and settled in [[Bethel, Alaska]] with their foster mother. Ramsey has suffered from [[clinical depression|depression]] since early childhood, and attempted suicide when he was 10 years old.&lt;ref name="rage"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/08/17/60II/main58625.shtml Rage: a look at a teen killer] (March 7, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
Ramsey was not the first in his family to bring a firearm into a public place. In October 1986, his father, Don Ramsey, went to the ''[[Anchorage Times]]'' newspaper office armed with an [[Armalite AR-18]] rifle, a [[revolver]], and more than 210 rounds of ammunition. While inside the building, Don Ramsey began taking hostages and was involved in a brief standoff with police until he surrendered. His motive for doing this was because he was angered that the ''Times'' refused to publish a political letter he had written. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison, and was paroled just several weeks before his son Evan perpetrated the school shooting.&lt;ref name="rage"/&gt; Also, a week before Evan's attack, his older brother was arrested for armed robbery.&lt;ref&gt;Langman, Peter. ''Why Kids Kill: Inside the Minds of School Shooters''. Palgrave Macmillan, 2009. Page 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following his arrest, Ramsey claimed he did not understand his actions would kill anyone.&lt;ref name="would die"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5040342&amp;page=1 |title=School shooter: "I didn't realize they would die" |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2008-06-11 |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; His trial was delayed as prosecutors discussed whether Ramsey should be tried as a juvenile or as an adult. Prosecutors decided to try Ramsey as an adult in Anchorage. On Dec. 2, 1998, Ramsey was found guilty of two counts of [[first-degree murder]], three counts of first-degree [[attempted murder]], and fifteen counts of third-degree assault. Judge Mark Isaac Wood sentenced him to 210 years in prison; on [[appeal]], however, his sentence was reduced to two 99-year prison sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.state.ak.us/pdf/press/ramsey_resentencing_062104.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Ramsey Resentencing 062104_1.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is imprisoned at the [[Spring Creek Correctional Center]] in [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]], and will be eligible for parole in 2066, when he will be 85 years old.

On February 15, 2006, Ramsey participated in an interview with [[Anderson Cooper]] titled ''In the Mind of a Killer'', in which his father Don Ramsey blamed the video game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' for the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://salsa.net/peace/videoviolence.html |title=Video games cause school shootings |publisher=Salsa.net |date= |accessdate=2013-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223223710/http://salsa.net/peace/videoviolence.html |archivedate=2012-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His crime was also profiled on the [[Court TV]] series ''Anatomy of a Crime''. Ramsey's actions were also covered in the program ''Kids Who Kill'' which also featured interviews with Ramsey.

The US carries out 46% of global research and development (R&amp;D) in life sciences, making it the world leader.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=United States of America. In: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=Stewart|first=Shannon|last2=Springs|first2=Stacy|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal expenditure on biomedical research ==
Life sciences accounted for 51% of federal research expenditure in 2011.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
[[File:R&amp;D budget by US agency, 1994–2014.svg|thumb|Research budget by US agency, 1994-2014. Source: Figure 5.4 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from the American Association for the Advancement of Science]]
The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) are considered the government's flagship biomedical research funding organization. Between 2004 and 2014, NIH funding remained relatively flat and was not increased to keep pace with [[inflation]].  The NIH budget peaked at circa $35 billion per year from 2003 to 2005 and was around $30 billion in 2015.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Government efforts to increase allocations to research between 2013 and 2016 were often thwarted by the congressional austerity drive, with Congress withholding approval of the federal government's budget several times. Over this period, the executive’s priorities were taken forward largely thanks to collaboration between the government, industry and the non-profit sector. This was particularly true for the health sector which, like climate change, was a priority for the [[Obama administration]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Towards more targeted therapies ==
A key policy objective of the Obama administration was to develop more targeted therapies while reducing the time and cost of drug development. Developing a new drug takes well over a decade and has a failure rate of more than 95%. The most expensive failures happen in late phase clinical trials. It is thus vital to pinpoint the right biological targets (genes, proteins and other molecules) early in the process, so as to design more rational drugs and better tailored therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[21st Century Cures Act]] was signed into law on 13 December 2016, a year after the release of the [[UNESCO Science Report]]. The report had predicted that, ‘were the bill to pass into law, it would alter the way in which clinical trials are conducted by allowing new and adaptive trial designs that factor in personalized parameters, such as biomarkers and genetics. This provision has proven controversial, with doctors cautioning that overreliance on biomarkers as a measure of efficacy can be misleading, as they may not always reflect improved patient outcomes'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another government scheme hopes to increase the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients, while reducing the time and cost of developing these. At the launch of the Accelerating Medicines Partnership in February 2014, NIH director Francis S. Collins stated that 'Currently, we are investing too much money and time in avenues that don't pan out, while patients and their families wait'. Over the five years to 2019, this public−private partnership is developing up to five pilot projects for three common but difficult-to-treat diseases: Alzheimer’s disease, type 2 (adult onset) diabetes and the autoimmune disorders of rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Proportional allocation of federal R&amp;D spending in the USA by discipline, 1994–2011.svg|thumb|Proportional allocation of federal research funding in the US by discipline, 1994-2011 (%). Source: Figure 5.5 from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030, based on data from American Association for Advancement of Science]]
The partnership involves the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), as well as 10 major biopharmaceutical companies and several non-profit organizations like the Alzheimer's Association. The industrial partners are [[AbbVie Inc.|Abbvie]] (US), [[Biogen]] (US), [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] (US), [[GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd|GlaxoSmithKline]] (UK), [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] (US), Lilly (US), [[Merck &amp; Co.|Merck]] (US), [[Pfizer]] (US), [[Sanofi]] (France) and [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]] (Japan).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Laboratories share samples, such as blood or brain tissue from deceased patients, to identify biomarkers. They also participate in NIH clinical trials. One critical component is that industry partners have agreed to make the data and analyses arising from the partnership accessible to the broad biomedical community. They will not use any discoveries to develop their own drug until these findings have been made public.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2013, the government announced another public−private partnership, this time to implement its [[BRAIN Initiative|Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologie]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s (BRAIN) Initiative. The goal of this project is to leverage genetic, optical and imaging technologies to map individual neurons and complex circuits in the brain, eventually leading to a more complete understanding of this organ’s structure and function. By 2015, the BRAIN Initiative had ‘obtained commitments of over US$ 300 million in resources from federal agencies ([[National Institutes of Health]], [[Food and Drug Administration]], National Science Foundation, etc.), industry (National Photonics Initiative, [[General Electric]], [[Google]], GlaxoSmithKline, etc.) and philanthropy (foundations and universities)’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Precision Medicine Initiative]] has been another government priority. Defined as delivering the right treatment to the right patient at the right time, precision medicine tailors treatments to patients based on their unique physiology, biochemistry and genetics. In his 2016 budget request, the president asked for US$215 million to be shared by the NIH, [[National Cancer Institute]] and FDA to fund the Precision Medicine Initiative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Research spending by biopharmaceutical companies ==

In 2013, US pharmaceutical companies spent $40 billion on R&amp;D inside the US and nearly another $11 billion on R&amp;D abroad.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 2005 and 2010, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies increased their investment in precision medicine by roughly 75% and a further increase of 53% is projected by 2015. Between 12% and 50% of the products in their drug development pipelines are related to personalized medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The federal government and most of the 50 states that make up the United States offer R&amp;D tax credits to particular industries and companies. Congress usually renews a tax credit every few years.  According to a survey by the ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' in 2012, companies do not factor in these credits when making décisions about investing in R&amp;D, since they cannot rely on these credits being renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Tech CFOs don't really trust R&amp;D tax credit, survey says|last=Chasan|first=Emily|date=2012|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, six US biopharmaceutical companies figured in the global Top 50 for the volume of expenditure on R&amp;D. The following have figured in the Top 20 for at least ten years: Intel, Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer and IBM. Google was included for the first time in 2013 and Amazon in 2014, which is why the online store does not figure in the Top 50 for 2014.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in venture capital investment ==
The National Venture Capital Association has reported that, in 2014, venture capital investment in the life sciences was at its highest level since 2008: in biotechnology, $6.0 billion was invested in 470 deals and, in life sciences overall, $8.6 billion in 789 deals (including biotechnology and medical devices). Two-thirds (68%) of the investment in biotechnology went to first-time/early-stage development deals and the remainder to the expansion stage of development (14%), seed-stage companies (11%) and late-stage companies (7%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, it was the software industry which invested in the greatest number of deals overall: 1 799, for an investment of $19.8 billion. Second came internet-specific companies, garnering US$11.9 billion in investment through 1 005 deals. Many of these companies are based in the State of California, which alone concentrates 28% of US research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Total investment in venture capital amounted to US$48.3 billion in 2014, for 4 356 deals. This represented ‘an increase of 61% in dollars and a 4% increase in deals over the prior year,’ reported the National Venture Capital Association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates that venture capital investment in the United States had fully recovered by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science, Technology and Innovation Outlook|last=|first=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|year=2014|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, a number of pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers to relocate their headquarters overseas to gain a tax advantage, including Medtronic and Endo International. Pfizer's own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca aborted in 2014 after Pfizer admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in prescription drug prices ==
One policy concern for the [[Obama administration]] has been the steep rise in the price of prescription drugs, in a country where these prices are largely unregulated. From January 2008 to December 2014, the price of commonly used branded drugs increased by a little over 127%, even as the price of commonly prescribed generic drugs decreased by almost 63%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2014, spending on prescription drugs hit $374 billion. This increase in spending was fuelled by the costly new drugs on the market for treating hepatitis C ($11 billion), rather than by the millions of newly insured Americans under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] of 2010 ($1 billion). About 31% of this spending went on specialty drug therapies to treat inflammatory conditions, multiple sclerosis, oncology, hepatitis C and HIV, etc., and 6.4% on traditional therapies to treat diabetes, high cholesterol, pain, high blood pressure and heart disease, asthma, depression and so on’.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fuelling the 'astronomic' rise in consumer prices for prescription drugs has been a new trend in the US, the acquisition of pharmaceuticals through licensing, purchase, a merger or acquisition. In the first half of 2014, the value of mergers and acquisitions by pharmaceutical companies totalled US$317.4 billion and, in the first quarter of 2015, the drug industry accounted for a little more than 45% of all US mergers and acquisitions. Several pharmaceutical companies have made strategic mergers in recent years to relocate their headquarters overseas to order to gain a tax advantage. Pfizer’s own attempt to take over the British pharmaceutical company [[AstraZeneca|Astrazeneca]] aborted in 2014, after [[Pfizer]] admitted plans to cut research spending in the combined company.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Bringing down the cost to consumers ==
The [[Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act)|Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act]] was signed into law in March 2010 to encourage the development of generic drug competition as a cost containment measure for high-priced pharmaceuticals. Part of the government’s signatory [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], it has created a pathway for fast-track licensure for biological products that are shown to be ‘biosimilar’ to, or ‘interchangeable’ with, an approved biological product. One inspiration for the act was that the patents for many biologic drugs will expire in the next decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Although the act was passed in 2010, the first biosimilar was only approved in the US by the FDA in 2015: Zarxio, made by [[Sandoz Laboratories|Sandoz]]. Zarxio is a biosimilar of the cancer drug Neupogen, which boosts the patient’s white blood cells to ward off infection. In September 2015, a US court ruled that the Neupogen brand manufacturer Amgen could not block Zarxio from being sold in the US. Neupogen costs about US$3 000 per chemotherapy cycle; Zarxio hit the US market on 3 September 2015 at a 15% discount.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Europe, the same drug had been approved as early as 2008 and has been safely marketed there ever since. The lag in development of an approval pathway in the US has been criticized for impeding access to biological therapies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The true cost savings from the use of biosimilars is difficult to assess. A 2014 study by the [[Rand Institute]] estimates a range of US$13–66 billion in savings over 2014–2024, depending upon the level of competition and FDA regulatory approval patterns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike generics, biosimilars cannot be approved on the basis of minimal and inexpensive tests to prove bioequivalence. Since biological drugs are complex, heterogeneous products derived from living cells, they can only be shown to be highly similar to the appropriate reference product and therefore require demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety and efficacy. The extent to which clinical trials are required will largely determine the cost of development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Orphan drugs ==
Orphan diseases affect fewer than 200 000 Americans each year. Since the [[Orphan Drug Act of 1983|Orphan Drug Act]] of 1983, over 400 drugs and biologic products for rare diseases have been designated by the Food and Drug Administration (as of 2015), 260 alone in 2013. In 2014, sales of the top 10 [[Orphan drug|orphan drugs]] in the US amounted to US$18.32 billion; by 2020, orphan drugs sales worldwide are projected to account for 19% (US$ 28.16 billion) of the total US$ 176 billion in prescription drug spending.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, orphan drugs cost about 19.1 times more than non-orphan drugs (on an annual basis) in 2014, at an average annual cost per patient of US$ 137 782. Some are concerned that the incentives given to pharmaceutical companies to develop orphan drugs by the FDA’s orphan drug products programme is taking the companies’ attention away from developing drugs that will benefit more of the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Medical devices ==
There are more than 6500 medical device companies in the US, more than 80% of which have fewer than 50 employees. According to the [[United States Department of Commerce|US Department of Commerce]], the market size of the medical device industry in the US is expected to reach US$ 133 billion by 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Observers foresee the further development and emergence of wearable health monitoring devices, telediagnosis and telemonitoring, robotics, biosensors, three-dimensional (3D) printing, new ''in vitro'' diagnostic tests and mobile apps that enable users to monitor their health and related behaviour better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Trends in pharmaceutical exports and patents ==
[[File:High-tech exports from the USA as a world share, 2008–2013.svg|thumb|High-tech exports from the United States of America as a world share, 2008-2013, data from Comtrade database, taken from UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 5.10]]
Until 2010, the United States of America was a net exporter of pharmaceuticals. Since 2011, it has become a net importer of these goods. The United States has lost its world leadership for high-tech goods. Even computing and communications equipment is now assembled in China and other emerging economies, with high-tech value-added components being produced elsewhere.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The United States is a post-industrial country. Imports of high-tech products far exceed exports. However, the United States' technologically skilled workforce produces a large volume of patents and can still profit from the license or sale of these patents. Within the United States' scientific industries active in research, 9.1% of products and services are concerned with the licensing of intellectual property rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

When it comes to trade in intellectual property, the United States remains unrivalled. Income from royalties and licensing amounted to $129.2 billion in 2013, the highest in the world. Japan comes a distant second, with receipts of $31.6 billion in 2013. The United States' payments for use of intellectual property amounted to $39.0 billion in 2013, exceeded only by Ireland ($46.4 billion).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Robert Gaston Fuller''' (October 22, 1942 – July 18, 1966) was an American [[Rock and roll|rock]] singer, songwriter, and guitarist best known for "[[Let Her Dance]]" and "[[I Fought the Law]]", recorded with his group [[The Bobby Fuller Four]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Baytown, Texas]], Fuller had a maternal older half brother, Jack, and a younger brother, [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy]]. Fuller moved as a small child to [[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], where he remained until 1956, when he and his family moved to [[El Paso, Texas]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdvoZRLEs7EC&amp;pg=PA146|author=Poore, Billy|title=Rockabilly: A Forty-Year Journey|location=Milwaukee|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|date=1998|page=146|isbn=0-7935-9142-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father got a job at [[El Paso Natural Gas]] at that time.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt; It was the same year that [[Elvis Presley]] became popular, and Bobby Fuller became mesmerized by the new rock and roll star. Fuller soon adopted the style of fellow Texan [[Buddy Holly]], fronting a four-man combo and often using original material.

==Career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}
During the early 1960s, he played in clubs and bars in El Paso, and he recorded on [[independent record label]]s in [[Texas]] with a constantly changing line-up. The only constant band members were Fuller and his younger brother, Randy Fuller (born on January 29, 1944, in [[Hobbs, New Mexico]]) on bass. Most of these independent releases (except two songs recorded at the studio of [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico|Clovis]]), and an excursion to Yucca Records, also in [[New Mexico]], were recorded in the Fullers' own home studio, with Fuller acting as the producer. He even built a primitive [[echo chamber]] in the back yard. The quality of the recordings, using a couple of microphones and a mixing board purchased from a local radio station, was so impressive that he offered the use of his "studio" to local acts for free so he could hone his production skills.

Fuller moved to [[Los Angeles]] in 1964 with his band '''The Bobby Fuller Four,''' and was signed to Mustang Records by producer [[Bob Keane]], who was noted for discovering [[Ritchie Valens]] and producing many [[surf music]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehmer|first=Larry |title=The Day The Music Died: The Last Tour Of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Richie Valens|publisher=Music Sales Group|year=2004|pages=212, 213|isbn=0-8256-7287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the group consisted of Fuller and his brother Randy on vocals/guitar and bass respectively, [[Jim Reese (musician)|Jim Reese]] on guitar and [[DeWayne Quirico]] on drums; this was the lineup that recorded "I Fought The Law". (There are actually two versions of "I Fought The Law" by Fuller: the original hit was released as a [[Single (music)|45-rpm single]], and the re-recording was issued on an album. The arrangements are identical but the vocals by Fuller are slightly different.)

At a time when the [[British Invasion]] and [[folk rock]] were the dominant genres in rock, Fuller stuck to Buddy Holly's style of classic [[rock and roll]] with [[Chicano Rock|Tex Mex]] flourishes. His recordings, both [[Cover version|covers]] and originals, also reveal the influences of [[Eddie Cochran]], [[The Beatles]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Little Richard]], and [[The Everly Brothers]], as well as [[Surf music|surf guitar]]. Less well known was Fuller's ability to emulate the [[Reverberation|reverb]]-laden surf guitar of [[Dick Dale]] and [[The Ventures]]. His first [[Top 40]] hit was the self-penned "[[Let Her Dance]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Corcoran|first=Michael Joseph|title=All Over the Map: True Heroes of Texas Music|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2005|page=147|isbn=0-292-70976-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second hit, "I Fought the Law", peaked at #9 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 on March 12–19, 1966. The song was originally written and recorded by [[Sonny Curtis]], who became a member of Buddy Holly's former group [[The Crickets]] after Holly's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lehmer|first=Larry |title=The Day The Music Died: The Last Tour Of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Richie Valens|publisher=Music Sales Group|year=2004|page=213|isbn=0-8256-7287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's third Top 40 single was a cover of Holly's "Love's Made a Fool of You."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits|publisher=Billboard Books|year=2004|page=246|isbn=0-8230-7499-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Within months of "I Fought the Law" becoming a top 10 hit, Fuller was found dead in an automobile parked outside his [[Hollywood]] apartment. The Los Angeles deputy medical examiner, Jerry Nelson, performed the autopsy. According to [[Dean Kuipers]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmnYK4rTBA4C&amp;pg=PA41-IA1 |title=SPIN |page=41 |website=Books.google.com.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The report states that Bobby's face, chest, and side were covered in "[[petechia|petechial hemorrhages]]" probably caused by gasoline vapors and the summer heat. He found no bruises, no broken bones, no cuts. No evidence of beating."  Kuipers further explains that boxes for "accident" and "suicide" were checked, but next to the boxes were question marks.  Despite the official cause of death, some commentators believe Fuller was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lztkuvi7E7YC&amp;pg=PA30 |title=Take a Walk on the Dark Side: Rock and Roll Myths, Legends, and Curses |author=R.

Erik Greene, a relative of [[Sam Cooke]], has cited similarities in the deaths of Cooke and Fuller. Fuller bandmate Jim Reese suspected that [[Charles Manson]] played a role in Fuller's death, but never provided credible evidence. A sensationalist crime website has speculated that the Los Angeles Police Department may have been involved because of Fuller's connection to a Mafia-related woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/15.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324133741/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/sam_cooke/15.html |archivedate=March 24, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller was buried at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in the [[Hollywood Hills]] of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53iA5w5sR8wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tombstone+tourist|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|author=Scott Stanton|page=Front cover|website=Books.google.com.au|accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was profiled in a segment of ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]''.&lt;ref name="unsolved"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3GUYwlE4ps|title=Unsolved Mysteries with Dennis Farina, Season 6 Episode 2|location=[''sic'', actually Season 14, according to Wikipedia article "[[List of Unsolved Mysteries episodes]]"]|publisher=[[Spike TV]]|date=August 17, 2009|accessdate=October 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His death was explored in the May 11, 2015 episode of the [[NPR]] program ''All Things Considered.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Cohen|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/11/405955609/new-book-explores-bobby-fullers-mysterious-death|title=New Book Explores Bobby Fuller's Mysterious Death|publisher=NPR.org|date=2015-05-11|accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program references the book ''I Fought the Law: The Life and Strange Death of Bobby Fuller'', by [[Miriam Linna]], with contributions by Randy Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fought-The-Law-Strange-Fuller/dp/1940157110|title=I Fought The Law: The Life and Strange Death of Bobby Fuller|author1=Miriam Linna|author2=Randell Fuller|isbn=9781940157115|website=Amazon.com|accessdate=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometime after the ''[[Unsolved Mysteries]]'' segment in question initially aired, the cause of Fuller's death was officially changed from "suicide" to "accident."&lt;ref name="unsolved"/&gt;

[[Air Chief Marshal]] '''Sir Charles Stuart Burnett''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KCB|CBE|DSO}} (3 April 1882 – 9 April 1945) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Air Force]] during the first half of the 20th century. He was Air Officer Commanding [[RAF Iraq Command|Iraq Command]] during the early 1930s. During the [[Second World War]], he served as [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]].

==Early life==
Charles Burnett was born in [[Browns Valley, Minnesota]], United States on 3 April 1882. He was the second son of John Alexander Burnett and Charlotte Susan Burnett. John Burnett was originally from the Scottish village of [[Kemnay]] in [[Aberdeenshire]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite web | last =Jordan | first =David | title =Burnett, Sir Charles Stuart | work =Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32188 | accessdate = 2007-11-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnett was educated at [[Bedford School]] in England. His younger brother was [[Robert Burnett]] who was later knighted and rose to the rank of [[Admiral (Royal Navy)|admiral]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Early career==
In 1899, Burnett enlisted as a private in the [[Imperial Yeomanry]] in order to fight in the [[Second Boer War]]. Burnett claimed to be 18 when he was in fact only 17.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; He was discharged in 1901 in order that he might take a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] and he was [[London Gazette|gazetted]] as a [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Highland Light Infantry]] in October 1901.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"&gt;{{cite web | last =Barrass | first =Malcolm | title =Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Burnett | work =Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation | url =http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Burnett_C.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett was then attached to the Imperial Yeomanry for the next three years.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27434|page=3253|date=16 May 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; He temporarily held the rank of lieutenant from 26 April 1902&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27432|page=3091|date=9 May 1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 7 February 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27523|pages=844–847|date=10 February 1903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August 1904, Burnett was seconded to the [[West African Frontier Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=27712|page=5843|date=9 September 1904}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next five years Burnett saw action in [[Northern Nigeria]], contracted [[blackwater fever]], was promoted to [[Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)|lieutenant]] and was twice [[mentioned in despatches]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28036|page=4518|date=2 July 1907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnett resigned his commission in September 1909&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=28301|page=7851|date=26 October 1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then entered business as a part-owner of a shop in [[Portuguese Guinea]].&lt;ref name="ADB"&gt;{{cite web | last =O'Neill | first =Robert | title =Burnett, Sir Charles Stuart | work =Australian Dictionary of Biography | url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130350b.htm | accessdate = 2007-11-03}}
&lt;/ref&gt; He did not meet with particular success as a businessman and by 1911 was employed by the British diplomatic service as the assistant [[Resident (title)|resident]] in [[Ilorin]], Nigeria.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

==First World War==
With the outbreak of hostilities in 1914, Burnett rejoined the [[British Army]]. After [[List of pilots awarded an Aviator's Certificate by the Royal Aero Club in 1914|qualifying as a pilot in November 1914]],&lt;ref&gt;Burnett was awarded Aviator's Certificate no. 985 on 24 November 1914&lt;/ref&gt; he was commissioned as a lieutenant on 4 December 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29042|supp=y|page=582|date=15 January 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett married Sybil Pack-Beresford just six days before his first posting as a [[Royal Flying Corps]] wing adjutant, which brought a temporary promotion to [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29014|supp=y|page=10904|date=18 December 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1915, Burnett was posted as a flight commander on [[No. XVII Squadron RAF|No. 17 Squadron]] where he flew [[Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2|BE2c]] from [[Gosport]] and then Egypt.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt; He became a substantive captain on 1 October 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29444|supp=y|page=831|date=18 January 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 April 1916, Burnett was promoted to temporary [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] and appointed Officer Commanding of [[No. 36 Squadron RAF|No. 36 Squadron]], which was stationed in [[Cramlington]]. In October the same year Burnett was sent to the Western Front as Officer Commanding [[No. 12 Squadron RAF|No. 12 Squadron]]. During his tour as Officer Commanding No. 12 Squadron, Burnett was once again mentioned in despatches.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;

With a promotion to temporary lieutenant colonel on 8 October 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30354|supp=y|page=11092|date=26 October 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett was granted command of the Flying Corps' [[Fifth Wing RFC|Fifth Wing]]&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt; which was operating in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. Following his wing's contribution to the British victory in the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)|Battle of Jerusalem]] in December 1917, Burnett was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30624|supp=y|page=4410|date=9 April 1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also awarded the Egyptian [[Order of the Nile]], Third Class,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31647|supp=y|page=14002|date=18 November 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1919 [[King's Birthday Honours]] he was made a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in recognition of his wartime service in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31378|supp=y|page=7026|date=30 May 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-war period==
By the close of the war, Burnett had transferred to the newly formed [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the next few years of his military career were to involve many changes of post. In 1919, Burnett was promoted to the temporary rank of [[Brigadier general (United Kingdom)|brigadier general]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31486|page=9871|date=1 August 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; and appointed (again temporarily) as [[General Officer Commanding]] the RAF's [[RAF Palestine Brigade|Palestine Brigade]]. Later the same year, he accepted the offer of a permanent commission in the RAF with the rank of [[Wing commander (rank)|wing commander]].

In April 1920, Burnett was given command of the RAF's [[Mesopotamian Wing RAF|Mesopotamian Wing]] and when the wing was upgraded to a [[group (air force)|group]], he worked as a [[staff officer]] at the group's HQ. From February to October 1921, Burnett was a [[wikt:supernumerary|supernumerary]], first at the HQ Middle East Area and then at [[No. 7 Group RAF|No. 7 Group]] where he was sent pending his next posting. It was during this time that Burnett was promoted to [[group captain]], although for some of the period he was on the half-pay list.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32391|page=5646|date=15 July 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnett took up command of [[No. 29 Group RAF|No. 29 Group]] in October 1921 but this was a short-lived appointment. In April 1922, Burnett was posted as station commander of [[RAF Leuchars]] which was a training base at that time. Once again Burnett did not spend long in post. By December 1922, he was a supernumerary once more, this time at the RAF Depot.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt; From 1923-early 1927, Burnett served as the Deputy Director of Operations and Intelligence&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt; at the Air Ministry.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=32803|page=1823|date=6 March 1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33243|page=584|date=28 January 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was made a [[Companion of the Bath]] (CB) in the [[1927 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33235|supp=y|page=3|date=31 December 1926}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett was then posted as the [[Commandant]] of the [[Central Flying School]] where he served until January 1929.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;

Having just been promoted to [[air commodore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33453|page=71|date=1 January 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burnett's next tour saw him return to Iraq as the Senior Air Staff Officer at the HQ of [[RAF Iraq Command|Iraq Command]] where he served for the next two years. In early 1931, he returned to the United Kingdom and he was appointed to the double-hatted position of [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] and Director of Operations and Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33688|page=932|date=10 February 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Burnett was promoted [[air vice-marshal]] the following July and he remained in post for a little under a year and a half.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33731|page=4250|date=30 June 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=33913|supp=y|page=1180|date=21 February 1933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1932, Burnett returned to Iraq once more, this time as the [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[RAF Iraq Command|Iraq Command]] which placed him in charge of all British forces in Iraq. During his time in command Burnett was involved in the suppression of several tribal incursions near [[Kuwait]] and during one such occasion Burnett was wounded.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Burnett returned to Great Britain at the start of 1935 to take up command of the RAF's [[RAF Inland Area|Inland Area]]. At the start of 1936, whilst Burnett was Air Officer Commanding Inland Area, he was promoted to [[air marshal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34237|page=8407|date=31 December 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the New Year Honours list.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34238|supp=y|page=4|date=31 December 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year the RAF's [[Command (military formation)|command]] structure underwent a major reorganization. One of the changes was the redesignation of Inland Area as [[RAF Training Command|Training Command]] and Burnett became the command's first [[Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]]. The next three years placed great demands upon Burnett and his command; as the threat from the German ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' increased, Training Command played a key role in the expansion of the RAF.&lt;ref name="air_of_auth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

In July 1939, just prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], Burnett was appointed an additional [[Inspector-General of the RAF]]&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34641|supp=y|page=4452|date=30 June 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in August he was a member of British military mission to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

==Second World War==
===RAAF Chief of the Air Staff===
Burnett continued in his role as Inspector-General of the RAF until 1940 when he was appointed [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. Burnett's appointment to the senior post in the RAAF was not without controversy. Apart from the fact that by 1940 Burnett was due for retirement and his health was not at its best, the choice of a British officer over an Australian one caused open resentment in many quarters of the RAAF.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; The Australian prime minister, [[Robert Menzies]], had decided that a British officer should head the RAAF, believing that Australian officers lacked the necessary experience.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odgers, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.60&lt;/ref&gt; After discussions between the British and Australian governments, Burnett was selected and given an acting promotion to [[air chief marshal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=34778|supp=y|page=464|date=23 January 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; a rank he subsequently retained.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

The vexed question of Australia's role in the [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan|Empire Air Training Scheme]] (EATS) had led to the resignation of Air Vice-Marshal [[Stanley Goble]], the previous substantive RAAF Chief of the Air Staff. Unlike Goble and several other senior RAAF commanders, Burnett believed that his most important task was to implement EATS to the full and thereby increase Australia's ability to provide aircrew to the RAF.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Under Burnett the RAAF expanded from a strength of 3,489 men just prior to the outbreak of war to 79,074 in May 1942. Of the approximately 80,000 personnel in the RAAF when Burnett was replaced, 42 per cent were EATS personnel.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;

Burnett also strove to increase the number of aircraft in the RAAF, although in this regard he was less successful than he was with increasing aircrew numbers. Under Burnett, RAAF units were placed in forward positions and priority was given to the aerial protection of Australian sea lanes.&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt; He also took a key role in the establishments of the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF) and RAAF health services, the latter having previously been provided by the [[Australian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Helson, ''"10 Years at the Top"'', p.42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to United Kingdom and death===
[[File:Jones-Bostock-Burnett AWM 012249.jpg|thumb|right|Burnett (right) with his replacement as RAAF [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|CAS]], [[Air vice marshal|AVM]] George Jones (left), and AVM William Bostock (centre), May 1942]]
From October 1941, Burnett had a strained working relationship with [[Arthur Drakeford]], the [[Australian Labor Party]]'s minister for air who had just then been appointed. Burnett and Drakeford frequently clashed and when in early 1942 Burnett proposed sweeping organizational changes, including the abolition of the [[Air Board (Australia)|Australian Air Board]], a breaking point was reached.  It had also been widely argued that Burnett's focus on the European theatre resulted in the RAAF lacking sufficient defensive strength and by 1942 the threat of invasion by Japan was growing. Burnett was replaced in May 1942 by an Australian, Air Vice Marshal [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]], who succeeded to the position despite Burnett's lobbying for his deputy, Air Vice Marshal [[William Bostock]], to take over.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ADB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.116–119&lt;/ref&gt;

Burnett retired from the RAF shortly after his return to Britain, but in 1943 he worked full-time in the RAF's cadet organisation, the [[Air Training Corps]], as the commandant of the ATC's Central Command.

'''''Dance of Death''''' is the thirteenth studio album by English [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Iron Maiden]], released first in Japan on 2 September and then 8 September 2003 in the rest of the world excluding North America (where it was released a day later). The album was recorded on magnetic (analogue) tape.&lt;ref name="dotr"/&gt;

Their second studio release since the return of vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the album features the band's first-ever fully acoustic track, "Journeyman", as well as "New Frontier", their only song co-written by drummer [[Nicko McBrain]]. As with ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]'', its predecessor in 2000, the record was produced by [[Kevin Shirley]], who has worked with Iron Maiden on all subsequent releases.&lt;!-- as of when? --&gt;

==Background==
The band first confirmed that they would be working on a follow-up to 2000's ''Brave New World'' with producer [[Kevin Shirley]] on 27 November 2002, announced alongside a small set of European tour dates for the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-announce-european-dates/ |title=Iron Maiden announce 2003 European dates |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=28 November 2002 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 2003, Shirley confirmed via his website that the band would begin recording that month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/producer-iron-maiden-to-begin-recording-this-month/ |title=Iron Maiden To Begin Recording This Month |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=6 January 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the announcement that the basic tracks had been completed on 5 February&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-complete-basic-tracks-for-new-cd/ |title=Iron Maiden Complete Basic Tracks for New CD |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=5 February 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the release was to be mixed in April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-to-begin-mixing-in-april/ |title=Iron Maiden to Begin Mixing in April |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=21 February 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May, the band announced that the album, recorded at [[Sarm West Studios]], would be entitled ''Dance of Death'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-new-album-details-unveiled/ |title=Iron Maiden: New Album Details Unveiled |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=1 June 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the release date was issued on 17 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/iron-maiden-to-tour-europe-in-the-fall/ |title=Iron Maiden Announce European Tour and Release Date |accessdate=31 December 2011 |date=29 June 2003 |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band undertook the [[Dance of Death World Tour]] in support of the album, which included many theatrical elements inspired by the record's songs. During "Dance of Death", Bruce Dickinson would wear theatrical masks and a cape while moving around the stage; at the end he would dress as the [[Grim Reaper]] for the final chorus.&lt;ref name="Wall380"/&gt; During "Paschendale", Dickinson would wear a traditional British Infantryman trench coat and helmet (although he revealed in the ''Death on the Road'' documentary that it was actually Hungarian),&lt;ref name="dotr"&gt;{{cite video |date=6 February 2006 |title=[[Death on the Road]] |chapter=Documentary |medium=DVD |publisher=[[EMI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as worn during World War I, and the set would be decorated with barbed wire.&lt;ref name="Wall380"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=380 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour led to a live album and DVD, entitled ''[[Death on the Road]]'', released in 2005 and 2006.

The [[computer generated imagery|computer-generated]] cover art was provided by David Patchett,&lt;ref name= "patchett"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Iron Maiden  |authorlink1=Iron Maiden| title = [[From Fear to Eternity (album)|From Fear to Eternity]] Booklet | chapter = Album List: ''Dance of Death'' | publisher = [[EMI]]| date = 6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who allegedly asked for his name to be removed from the album's credits after the band decided to use an unfinished version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Porter |first=Tom |title=Iron Maiden: a gruesome history of graphic artwork |url=http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/iron-maiden-a-gruesome-history-of-graphic-artwork-248809/61 |publisher=[[MusicRadar]] |accessdate=2 March 2013 |date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was received negatively.&lt;ref name= "SputnikMusic"/&gt; Dickinson later called the cover "embarrassing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1006818916|title=What does this button do? : Bruce Dickinson : an autobiography.|last=1958-|first=Dickinson, Bruce,|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780008172435|location=London|pages=301|oclc=1006818916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released as a [[DVD-Audio]] disc in 2004, including 5.1 mixes of each song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironmaiden.com/iron-maiden-release-special-souvenir-ep.html |title=Iron Maiden release special souvenir EP | date=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Songs==
[[File:Nicko McBrain 30nov2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] made his song writing debut on ''Dance of Death''.]]
''Dance of Death'' is the only Iron Maiden album to date in which drummer [[Nicko McBrain]] has a songwriting credit, having co-written "New Frontier".&lt;ref name="Wall374"/&gt; As a born-again Christian, the track expresses his concerns with human cloning, stating, "I personally believe that God created man and it's only God's right to create a human being because only He can give you a soul. When man attempts to make man then it's a monster in a test tube."&lt;ref name="Wall374"/&gt; This also makes it the only Iron Maiden album to date in which every member of the band receives a songwriting credit.

"Montségur" was based on the fall of the [[Catharism|Cathar]] stronghold [[Montségur|of the same name]], which fell in the aftermath of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] in 1244.&lt;ref name="Wall373"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=373 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dickinson, who wrote the song's lyrics, states, "There is so much great stuff and so many great stories throughout history that you can make parallels with the modern day – particularly when history repeats itself as often as it does – that it makes for some very colourful subject matter."&lt;ref name="Wall373"/&gt;

"Paschendale" is about the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] which took place during the [[World War I|First World War]]. It was written by [[Adrian Smith]], who usually contributes to the band's shorter, more commercial-sounding songs, but decided to write what he describes as "a traditional Maiden epic".&lt;ref name="Wall375"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=375 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features strong [[progressive rock]] elements, including its length, detailed structure, and multiple tempo changes throughout the song. Dickinson comments, "the beauty of 'Paschendale' isn't in the epic-ness of the song – although you have to admit it is a powerful and stirring body of music – but the detail."&lt;ref name="Wall375"/&gt; In live performances, Dickinson introduces the song with a passage from [[Wilfred Owen]]'s "[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]".&lt;ref name="Wall380"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Iain|title=From Achilles to Alexander: The Classical World and the World of Metal|journal=Heavy Metal Music in Britain|date=March 2009|page=118|editor1-first=Gerd|editor1-last=Bayer|location=London|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Iron Maiden Newcastle, July 23rd 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Iron Maiden performing "Dance of Death" in 2011]]

According to guitarist [[Janick Gers]], the album's title track was inspired by the final scene of [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', at the end of which "these figures on the horizon start doing a little jig, which is the dance of death".&lt;ref name="Wall373" /&gt; Gers wrote most of the music and explained the concept to [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], who wrote the lyrics and most of the melodies.&lt;ref name="Wall374"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=374 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Face in the Sand" is based on the media coverage surrounding the [[Iraq War]], taking place as the album was being recorded.&lt;ref name="Wall376"/&gt; Dickinson explains, "I remember thinking about the desert sands as an image and how it moves and shifts with time. Specifically what I was thinking was that whatever empires you tend to build – whether they are British, American, Iraqi or whatever, they'll all crumble and fade away into something else. So, to my mind at least, the best thing you can hope for, if you were to leave anything behind, is just an imprint in the sand."&lt;ref name="Wall376"/&gt; The song is notable for being the first and only Iron Maiden track in which McBrain uses a [[Double bass drumming#Double bass drum|double bass pedal]].&lt;ref name="Wall375" /&gt;

The final track, "Journeyman", is Iron Maiden's first and only fully [[acoustic music|acoustic]] song. According to Dickinson on the ''Death on the Road'' live album, it is about "the whole process of writing and being a musician",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=6 February 2006 |title=[[Death on the Road]] |chapter=Journeyman |medium=DVD |publisher=[[EMI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Mick Wall]] describes it as "a wistful tale of ''[[carpe diem]]''".&lt;ref name="Wall376"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wall, Mick |title=Iron Maiden: Run to the Hills, the Authorised Biography | edition = 3rd |publisher=Sanctuary Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-86074-542-3 |page=376 |authorlink=Mick Wall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, "after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music it just seemed right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field."&lt;ref name="Wall376"/&gt; The original version appears on the ''[[No More Lies (EP)|No More Lies]]'' EP.

Reviews for the album were generally positive with ''[[Kerrang!]]'' describing it as "stupendous stuff and concrete proof that Maiden are as electrifying and important as they have been in a long time".&lt;ref name= "Kerrang!"/&gt; [[Sputnikmusic]] were also positive about the album, giving special mention to "Paschendale", described as "quite easily the ultimate Maiden masterpiece".&lt;ref name= "SputnikMusic"/&gt; Although deeming the first three songs "refreshing yet unremarkable", [[AllMusic]] describes ''Dance of Death'' as "a triumphant return to form for these heavy metal legends."&lt;ref name= "AM"/&gt;

Although criticising the album for its length and for not "matching the quality" of its predecessor, ''Brave New World'', [[PopMatters]] praised the band for being able to "still easily outclass most of the younger nu-metal bands today".&lt;ref name= "PopMatters"/&gt;

'''Eduardo Nicanor Frei Montalva''' ({{IPA-es|eˈðwaɾðo fɾei̯ monˈtalβa}}; January 16, 1911 &amp;ndash; January 22, 1982) was a Chilean political leader. In his long political career, he was Minister of Public Works, president of his Christian Democratic Party, senator, President of the Senate, and the 28th [[president of Chile]] from 1964 to 1970. His eldest son, [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], also became president of [[Chile]] (1994–2000).

Frei's [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democratic Party]] supported the Armed Forces intervention to remove his successor [[Salvador Allende]] from office in 1973, after the Chamber of Deputies, on August 22, 1973, accused Allende of violating the Constitution and called for his overthrow. He was later a vocal opponent of the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|Augusto Pinochet regime]].

== Early life ==
Eduardo Frei Montalva was born in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]] on January 16, 1911, the son of Eduard Frei Schlinz, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born ethnic [[Germany|German]] from [[Austria]], and Victoria Montalva Martínez. In 1914, his family moved to [[:es:Lontué|Lontué]], where his father had been hired as an accountant at a winery. In addition, his other two siblings, Arturo and Irene, were born. He attended the Escuela Pública de Lontué (Public School of Lontué).

In 1919 the family returned to Santiago and Eduardo, as a young man, entered the boarding school Seminario Conciliar de Santiago where he remained until 1922. In 1923, he entered Instituto de Humanidades Luis Campino, where he graduated in 1928, at the age of 17.

As an 18-year-old, he entered [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|Universidad Católica]] School of Law in 1929. For two years, he had been visiting María, the sister of his friend, Alfredo Ruiz-Tagle. He attended high school and went on to study law, graduating as a lawyer in 1933. He married María Ruiz-Tagle with whom he had 7 children. His eldest son, [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]], was President of Chile from 1994 to 2000.

== Political career ==
He began his political career in the [[Conservative Party (Chile)|Conservative Party]], but was among a group of young men who founded their own party in 1938: the '''Falange Nacional'''. He was minister of Public Works in 1945, and in 1949, Frei was elected [[Chilean Senate|senator]] for Atacama and Coquimbo. The same year he published “Historia de los Partidos Políticos Chilenos” (“History of Chilean Political Parties”) in collaboration with Albert Edwards Vives. In 1950, he traveled to New York as a UN delegate. In 1952, at 41 years of age, Frei Montalva announced his first candidacy in the presidential elections.

The 1952 election was won by [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]]. Later, President Ibañez requested Frei to organize an executive committee. However, this never came to be. In 1954, the UN appointed him President of the Commission in charge of elaborating the report of the Conference of Chancellors held in Rio de Janeiro. Some of its members were: [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]], former President of Colombia, and [[Raúl Prebisch]] director of [[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|ECLAC]]. The report served as a basis for subsequent studies on economic development and the integration of Latin America. In 1956 he was elected Senator in Santiago by first majority.

On July 27, 1957, the Falange Nacional became the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile]], and he became the undisputed leader. Frei Montalva was offered once more the candidacy for president of the Republic in the 1958 elections. [[Jorge Alessandri|Jorge Alessandri Rodríguez]] was elected president while Eduardo Frei Montalva took only third place.

During these years he published three more books: “Sentido y Forma de una Política” (“Meaning and Shape of Politics”), “La Verdad Tiene Su Hora” (“Truth Has Its Time”), y “Pensamiento y Acción” (“Thought and Action”). In 1960, he lectured at conference “The Mission of Universities in Latin America” in Montevideo; a widely promoted conference at that time. In 1961, he was elected President of the First World Christian Democratic Party Congress, held in Santiago, Chile. The congress was attended by delegations from throughout Latin America, European, North American, and African countries. That year he was invited as special guest to a seminar on the problems of Developing Nations, held at Oxford University. The seminar was attended by delegates from all over the world.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Between 1960-62, he lectured at Columbia University on problems in Latin America. In 1962, he gave a conference at Notre Dame University on the development and the integration of Latin American countries. He ran for president again in 1964. Declassified documents show that from 1962 through 1964, the [[CIA]] spent a total of $2.6 million to finance his presidential campaign and spent $3 million in anti-Allende propaganda "to scare voters away from Allende's FRAP coalition". The CIA considered its role in the victory of Frei a great success.&lt;ref name=UsFrei&gt;{{cite web|title=Chile 1964: CIA Covert Support in Frei Election Detailed|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/news/20040925/index.htm|website=The National Security Archive|accessdate=June 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1969congress&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum for the 303 Committee:Final Report: March 1969 Chilean Congressional Election|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76v21/d3|website=U.S. Department of State Office of the Historian|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

That year he was elected with his ''"Revolución en Libertad"'' ("Revolution in Liberty") slogan by a large margin (56%), defeating [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist]] candidate [[Salvador Allende]] who only received 39% of the vote, but who subsequently won the [[1970 Chilean presidential election]].

==Administration==
{{further|Presidential Republic|Chilean university reform|Chilean nationalization of copper|Chilean land reform}}
[[File:Fotografia Eduardo Frei Montalva.jpg|thumb|upright|Presidente Eduardo Frei Montalva (1964–1970)]]
Frei's administration began many reforms in Chilean society. "Promoción Popular" (Social Promotion), "[[Chilean land reform|Reforma Agraria]]" (Agrarian Reform), "[[Chilean university reform|Reforma Educacional]]" (Education Reform), and "Juntas de Vecinos" (Neighborhood Associations) were some of his main projects. He also took measures to [[Chilean pharmaceutical policy|rationalize drug supply]]. On September 4, 1964, having one of the highest turnouts in Chilean history, Frei Montalva was elected President of the Republic of Chile. He took office two months later, on November 4.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

The Frei presidency did much to tackle poverty, as characterised by the growing share of wages as a proportion of GNP. By the end of the Frei presidency, the wage and salaried sector received close to 51% of GNP, compared with 42% at the end of the Alessandri presidency. This positive redistribution of wealth was encouraged by government policies, particularly in the rural sector, where wages rose by 40% in real terms. Between 1964-70, total enrollment in education increased by 46%, while around 250,000 houses were built, mostly for the poor.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alan Angell, "Chile since 1958," in ''Latin America Since 1930: Spanish South America'', ed. Leslie Bethell, vol 8 in ''Cambridge History of Latin America (New York: Cambridge University Press), 1991;  DOI:10.1017/CHOL9780521266529.007&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Frei's administration also introduced a wealth tax and carried out a property tax reassessment in order to make the taxation system more progressive. Taxes as a percentage of GNP increased 12.8% in 1964 to 21.2% in 1970. The social reforms introduced by Frei's government led to a huge increase in public expenditure, which rose as a proportion of GNP from 35.7% in 1965 to 46.9% in 1970. Expenditures on education, agriculture, and housing rose went up considerably, with spending on housing increasing by 70% in real terms in 1965 alone.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; 

During Frei's six years in office, an average of 40,000 housing units were constructed each year, and a total of 100,000 lots were assigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Collins, Joseph|author2=Lear, John|title=Chile's Free-market Miracle: A Second Look|date=1995|publisher=Food First|isbn=978-0935028638|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oT0SzNkKKLsC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=Chile%27s+Free+Market+Miracle+During+the+emergency+program+of+1971&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P90uVfyoFoataZ2ngOgM&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Chile's%20Free%20Market%20Miracle%20During%20the%20emergency%20program%20of%201971&amp;f=false|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investments in primary care clinics and hospitals were also carried out, with 20 clinics and 16 hospitals built between 1965 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pribble|first1=Jennifer E.|title=Protecting the Poor: Welfare Politics in Latin America's Free Market Era|date=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0549535881|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7NXleUwTa7EC&amp;dq=chile+popular+unity+social+security&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=May 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, he started a presidential tour through France, the United Kingdom, Federal Republic of Germany, Italy and the Vatican. During this time, he also visited countries in Latin America such as: Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela; places where he delivered important speeches on international issues.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

On his return, he initiated important plans involving housing, education, reforestation, land reform, health, and the nationalization of copper. The Comisión Nacional de Cultura (National Culture Commission), the Consejería Nacional de la Promoción Popular and the Juntas de Vecinos (“Neighborhood Committees”) were also created.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

One area of reform given high priority by the Frei Administration was the fostering of networks of local, self-help organisations (especially among the “unorganised” residents of the shantytowns),  which was placed under a national supervisory council. As a result of the government's actions, mothers' centres, sports associations, youth clubs, residents’ committees, and parents' groups proliferated, with an estimated 20,000 units of this type in existence by 1970, according to government figures. Half of these new units were mothers' centres, with an estimated membership of 45,000 women, and the government claimed to have distributed 70,000 sewing machines to these centres. According to Frei, these measures had given “a new form of life and hope” to hundreds of thousands of people.&lt;ref name="Chile 1994"&gt;''A History of Chile, 1808–1994'', by Simon Collier and William F. Sater&lt;!-- publisher, ISSN/ISBN, year, page(s) needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:La Silla Comparison.jpg|thumb|On 25 March 1969, the [[ESO]] site at [[La Silla]] was finally formally inaugurated by President Eduardo Frei Montalva.]]
Improvements were also made in areas such as housing, education and medical care. Between 1964-70, around 260,000 houses were constructed (around a third by the state housing corporation CORVI) and about 200,000 housing solutions were claimed (referring to the provision of sites for self-help housing projects). The number of hospitals (and beds) doubled under the PDC, and spending on education as a proportion of public expenditure rose from one-seventh to one-fifth. Around 3,000 new schools were built throughout the country, and by 1970 95% of children in the relevant age group were covered by primary education.&lt;ref name="Chile 1994"/&gt; Expenditure on scholarships and school loans was doubled, and school enrollment was raised from 1.8 million to 2.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGuire|first1=James W.|title=Wealth, Health, and Democracy in East Asia and Latin America|date=March 15, 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1139486224|page=100|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWDtYBxVAUkC&amp;dq=Allende+primary+schools&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Expenditure on education doubled, the number of years of basic education was increased from six to eight, and a two-shift school-day was introduced that doubled the capacity of the country’s system. Frei's initiatives in education led to increased rates of enrollment in both primary and secondary education, with primary school coverage reaching 90% in the majority of rural and urban areas by 1970, while secondary school coverage reached 49% in 1970, compared with 18% at the start of the Sixties.&lt;ref&gt;Pribble (2008), pg. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

A new law establishing work-accident and occupational disease insurance was signed into law in January 1968, providing for compulsory coverage of all salaried employees and wage earners, including apprentices and domestic servants. In March that year, a piece of legislation creating government-sponsored health insurance for public and private salaried employees and their dependents was signed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v31n9/v31n9p26.pdf#nameddest=article |title=Statute |website=www.ssa.gov |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Basic health services were expanded with the training of community health workers, the building of rural health clinics, and the shifting of financial and personnel resources from hospitals to community health centres. These efforts contributed to a steep decline in infant mortality in Chile during the Sixties and Seventies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Haggard, Stephan|author2=Kaufman, Robert R.|title=Development, Democracy, and Welfare States: Latin America, East Asia, and Eastern Europe|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9hNpt49NHQcC&amp;dq=Eduardo+frei+1964+social+security+coverage&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much attention was also given to improve social and economic conditions in the countryside. Both rural unionisation and agrarian reform were accelerated, with the government starting to expropriate estates in a serious way. Family allowance for farmers was doubled,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Garforth, Michael|author2=Mayers, James|title=Plantations, Privatization, Poverty and Power: Changing Ownership and Management of State Forests|date=2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1136559655|page=142|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqU4dbvIx5QC&amp;dq=salvador+allende+family+allowances&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; the agricultural minimum wage was raised to the same level as its urban equivalent, and an agrarian reform law signed by Frei in July 1967 made all farms of more than eighty “basic” hectares liable to expropriation. The Frei Administration had thus made a major start to land reform, a policy continued by the Allende Government.&lt;ref name="Chile 1994"/&gt; 

The agrarian reform carried out by the Frei Government organized the reformed sector according to a temporary system established in the law, whereby the expropriated estates became asentamientos. This was a legal form in which the farm operated as a joint enterprise between the state and the peasants who had lived in the former latifundia (extensive agricultural estates), with the state providing the credits, land, and technical assistance, and the peasants their labor. After an indeterminate period, the land would be made available for subdivision into small private plots, if the peasants wished.&lt;ref&gt;Politics and Ideology in Allende’s Chile by Ricardo Israel Zipper&lt;/ref&gt; According to one study, the percentage of the population living below the poverty line steadily fell; from 39% in 1965 to 17% in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Victims of Time, Warriors for Change: Chilean Women in a Global, Neoliberal Society by Evelyn A.

During his administration 8 workers were killed in [[El Salvador mine]]&lt;ref&gt;Uriel Hancock, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdOYTXmSs8kC Historia de Chile], page 133&lt;/ref&gt; and 11 squatters in the [[Massacre of Puerto Montt]]. His Minister of the Interior, [[Edmundo Pérez Zujovic]] was politically blamed for the deaths. On 21 October 1969 the [[Tacnazo insurrection]], occurred—a brief non-violent demonstration of the Tacna artillery regiment in Santiago, led by General [[Roberto Viaux]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} 

In 1966, the Andean Group, officially created through its Declaration, signed in January 1965. However, the group culminated with the famous speech delivered by Frei Montalva in [[Plaza Bolívar, Bogota]]. The same year the pacts on Chilean copper were signed.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In January 1967 the National Congress refused his constitutional permission to travel to the United States where he had been invited by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In April 1967, he participated in the Meeting of Presidents from American countries, carried out in [[Montevideo, Uruguay]].{{cn|date=May 2018}} 

In 1970, he was awarded with the Doctor Honoris Causa title by the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. On November 4, he left office, handing over the Presidency to [[Salvador Allende]].{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Support of the coup d'etat against Allende==
After [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]'s 1970 victory, Frei became convinced of what he called a "totalitarian project" to impose a Communist tyranny. In 1971, he gave conferences at universities in Dayton, Ohio, Boston, and the Council of the Americas in New York, denouncing in all of them the actions of the Allende government that were violating the Constitution and the laws of Chile.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the March 1973 parliamentary elections he was elected Senator for Santiago by a first majority. He was afterwards elected President of the Senate and became the leader of the opposition to [[Salvador Allende|Allende]]. On July 6, 1973, he met with the executive directors of the industrialists’ association (SOFOFA). They told Frei that the country was disintegrating and that if urgent measures were not taken, Chile would fall under a bloody Cuban-style Marxist dictatorship. Frei responded: "There is nothing that can be done by myself, by the Congress, or by any civilian. Unfortunately, this problem can only be fixed with guns." Instead of going to the Congress, we should go to the regiments. "I fully share your apprehensions, and I advise you to state them plainly to commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces, hopefully today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piñera|first1=José|accessdate=May 23, 2018|title=The Rivera Minutes|url=http://www.josepinera.org/RevChilena/chile_actarivera_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 1973, during the coup d’etát President [[Salvador Allende]] died, most likely by committing suicide, in the presidential palace, La Moneda, as the Armed Forces seized power. His [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democratic Party]] supported the Armed Forces intervention to remove [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] from office in 1973, after the Chamber of Deputies, on August 22, 1973, accused Allende of violating the Constitution.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In November 1973 Frei wrote a historic letter to [[Mariano Rumor]], President of the International Christian Democrats, endorsing the Armed Forces intervention and denouncing what he alleged was an attempt by Allende to impose a Communist dictatorship in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/archivos2/pdfs/MC0023241.pdf Letter to Mariano Rumor, 8 November, 1973], also at [http://es.wikisource.org/wiki/Carta_de_Eduardo_Frei_Montalva_a_Mariano_Rumor%2C_Presidente_de_la_Uni%C3%B3n_Mundial_de_la_Democracia_Cristiana wikisource] (Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1973-77, Frei Montalva was invited to different countries and participated in conferences, such as the Atlantic Conference in 1976. In 1975 he published his book “El Mandato de la Historia y las Exigencias del Porvenir” (“The Mandate of History and Demands of the Future“), and in 1977 his quintessential book “América Latina: Opción y Esperanza” (“Latin America: Option and Hope”) which has been translated into several languages.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the period between 1977-82, he was invited to participate in the Brandt Commission, led by Willy Brandt. As a member, he attended meetings held in [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Mali]], [[United States]], [[Malaysia]], [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], and [[Great Britain]]. As a Brandt Commission delegate he engaged with important executives from IDB, OAS, and ECLAC.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In 1980, he participated in the Meeting of Former Democrat Presidents of Latin America held in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1981, he was invited to the Club of Rome International Conference on the “Alternatives for Humanity: Latin America Mission” also held in Caracas. His last book “El Mensaje Humanista” (“The Humanist Message”) was published.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

Later, Frei became an opponent of [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]'s military government.&lt;ref name=Forero&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/08/AR2009120804389.html|title=In Chile, case resurrects ghosts of bloody Pinochet dictatorship: Judge implicates strongman in 1982 death of ex-president|last=Forero|first=Juan|work=The Washington Post|date=9 December 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed the extension of Pinochet's presidency in 1981, leading a rally against it.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Death==
{{Main|Death of Eduardo Frei Montalva}}
In 1981 Frei was suffering from [[Gastroesophageal reflux disease|chronic acid reflux]], stemming from a [[Hiatus hernia|hiatal hernia]], an unpleasant but not life-threatening condition. He was [[Surgery|operated]] on for it, but died in Santiago on January 22, 1982, six days after turning 71. His death at the time was attributed to [[septicaemia]] stemming from surgery. He was buried in the [[Cementerio General de Santiago]].

It was later alleged that Frei had been poisoned by the [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]], the intelligence service of the military government, with a toxin produced by biochemist [[Eugenio Berrios]]. After researchers from the [[University of Ghent]], Belgium were reported to have found [[mustard gas]] in Frei's body, the former president's family filed a lawsuit, which was pending {{As of|2009|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6289209.stm Ex-Chilean leader 'was murdered'], [[BBC]], January 23,  2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Frei's personal doctor, Patricio Rojas, who was also his Minister of the Interior, denied the accusations. ''El Mercurio'' columnist Hermógenes Pérez de Arce disputes even the existence of the Belgian report, citing the denial by the University's chief of communications, Tom de Smedt, that an investigation had been done in that university. Tissue samples sent to FBI labs and to the labs at the University of Ghent showed no evidence of toxic substances.  A Chilean doctor reportedly found residues of sulfonic salts which can be the result of the decomposition of mustard gas but can also be the result of the decomposition of a corpse.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In December 2009 six persons were arrested for their roles in the alleged assassination.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/6755282/Six-arrested-over-assassination-of-former-Chilean-president.html|title=Six arrested over assassination of former Chilean president|date=December 7, 2009|work=Telegraph Online|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Judge Alejandro Madrid based his decision on a report that determined that low doses of [[Thallium poisoning|thallium]] and mustard gas were administered to Frei over an extended period while he was hospitalized at the Santa María Clinic in Santiago, and that these toxic substances had the effect of decreasing Frei's immune system, making him too weak to survive his surgery.&lt;ref name=Mostrador&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmostrador.cl/noticias/pais/2009/12/07/con-bajas-dosis-de-talio-y-gas-mostaza-durante-varios-meses-asesinaron-a-frei|title=Detalles del auto de procesamiento contra médicos que lo operaron: "Con bajas dosis de Talio y gas mostaza durante varios meses asesinaron a Frei"|work=El Mostrador|date=9 December 2009|accessdate=10 December 2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The report was widely criticized and by the surgical team on El Mercurio and La Segundo, newspapers owned by the Edwards family, which had brokered the coup and maintains strong ties to the CIA and to Pinochet's government.&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasegunda.com/ediciononline/politica/detalle/index.asp?idnoticia=527775|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226020411/http://www.lasegunda.com/ediciononline/politica/detalle/index.asp?idnoticia=527775|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 26, 2009|title=Caso Frei Montalva: Enrique Paris sostiene que ''hubo un grave error en las muestras procesadas en Chile''|date=22 December 2009|work=La Segunda|location=Santiago, Chile|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mercurio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.elmercurio.com/columnasycartas/2010/01/13/caso-frei-montalva-ii-4.asp|title=Caso Frei Montalva.

The case was re-opened in 2010 after a failed attempt to disqualify Judge Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2011/02/10/wikileaks-us-believes-former-chilean-leader-death-to-remain-a-mystery|title=WikiLeaks: US believes former Chilean leader death “to remain a mystery”|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In April 2013, the body of poet [[Pablo Neruda]], who died in 1973 in the same hospital one day before departing for exile, was exhumed amid suspicions of foul play in his death.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

'''''Fin Fin on Teo the Magic Planet''''' is a 1996 [[computer game]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based computers made by [[Fujitsu]] about a creature that is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of a [[bird]] and a [[dolphin]] which the user could communicate with via a [[webcam]] which came with the game, the SmartSensor. Fin Fin was produced by [[Makoto Tezuka]].

Fin Fin responds to the player's tone of voice and volume of the voice - one reviewer describing Fin Fin as a 'virtual [[mood ring]]'.  30,000 copies were sold in the first year in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|date=October 1997|title=Finding companionship in a digital age|pages=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fin Fin is much like the popular [[Tamagotchi]], but for a [[Personal Computer|PC]]. If he is not fed or paid enough attention, he would sing a sad whistling song or sometimes fly away.

There are different versions of Fin Fin and each version has a limited number of worlds available. There was a 3-world version, a 4-world version, a 5-world version, and a 6-world version (which has all the worlds).

==Plot==
The game's main goal is to win Finfin's friendship. There are many ways to communicate with Finfin. The first way is to press the 1 to 5 keys, which make a sound that attracts Finfin. The second way is to use a special microphone called the Smartsensor and a whistle that come with the game. In the 3, 4 and 5 world versions, the player can record their own voice using the Finfin sound recorder that comes with the game and a microphone. Their voice then plays back when they press the 6 to 0 keys.

There was also a separate sensor unit that informed Fin Fin whether the player was sitting in front of the screen. The sensor didn't work in the German versions because of a faulty installation routine.

==Characters==
'''Finfin''' - Finfin is the main character of the game. He is half dolphin and half bird. The player can watch him sing, fly, swim, play, 'talk' and interact with him in different ways in different locations.

'''Finnina''' - Finfin's wife. She can be seen in the Secret Inlet, Rem River Bank, and the Nest (which is only available in the 6-world version).

'''Finfin Junior''' - Finfin's kid. He can only be seen in the 6-world version, at the Nest, when Finnina lays an egg and it hatches. He flies away from the Nest after a month.

'''Various flora and fauna''' - There are various animals and plants in the Planet TEO. Some plants only appear at night, ans some only at day. Some animals are friendly to Finfin, while others want to eat him (but they never can).

==Weather==
The game includes natural weather, from sunny days to cloudy days, rain or even thunderstorms. However, snowfall does not occur in the game because the areas in the game are close to the equator and so the temperatures are constantly in the warm to mild range. In addition to the weather, there are also annual events such as shooting stars and lunar eclipses, and natural weather phenomena such as rainbows or northern lights. Some could happen on a specific day (for example, on August 30, a double lunar eclipse would occur in the sky at a certain time) or on many days in a year.

==Places==
There are six places to visit in the game. The 3-world version was released in Germany, and then the 4-world version was released in Germany. The 5-world version was only released in the USA and the 6-world version was exclusive to Japan and China. However, one can download the 6-world version at EMGE's website below.

=== Amile Forest ===

This place is available in all versions. This is the most famous and important place of the game. It is quite high and there is a wide view over the surrounding forests to the "Ermes" mountain. In the foreground, there is a straightened branch. A "Yaika" tree, twisted in itself, with hanging leaves (similar to a [[willow]] or a [[birch]]), can be seen behind the branch. A little further on the right, there are two palm-like trees.

The Amile Forest is FinFin's favourite place to be. Here he plays, eats and sleeps, and here one can observe him very well as he flies and practices his flying tricks, or sings. Here, the player can offer a "Lemo" berry by pressing the spacebar, which he accepts or rejects depending on whether he's hungry or not.

=== Lemo Valley ===

This place is available in the 5-world version and above. Here grow the colorful "Lemo" berries that FinFin often eats. The valley is surrounded by mountains, on which firs grow. The "Lemo" bushes, which always form new flowers and berries, grow in the middle of the valley. In the foreground is a hill with lots of plants, flowers that make music and two deciduous trees.

FinFin visits the valley to satisfy his hunger for berries. Here one can observe the way he circles the bushes several times and looks for ripe berries. If he finds one, he plucks it while hovering around the bush to eat afterwards. The player can also beat the neuro-drum by pressing the spacebar. If FinFin is not present, some plants start to play. After a while, animals appear at the concert. As soon as FinFin appears, the plants stop the music and the animals disappear one by one.

=== Tsubu Woods ===

This place is available in all versions. It is located on a small woodland, surrounded by tall trees. The trees look like coniferous trees, which bear golden-brown nuts, which can be seen sparkling in the wilderness on some nights. The shrubs, bushes and ferns on the clearing resemble jungle plants. On the floor of the clearing lies a hollow tree trunk and a large quantity of nuts or their shells.

FinFin visits the forest to satisfy his hunger for "Tsubu" nuts. Here one can observe him shaking the nuts from the trees by flying through the treetops. Then he eats the nuts lying on the ground.

=== Secret Inlet ===

This place is available in all versions. It is a small side course of the Remse river, which runs in the jungle and ends there. Here you can see two opposite broader banks, surrounded by dense banks. Between the plants are laubless trees, whose branches point in a different direction after each visit. There is a tree at the back with a hole in the trunk, forming a small cave.

FinFin comes to this bay to relax. Therefore, the player is recommended not to disturb him. However, the player can watch FinFin while swimming, playing and catching fish. If the player is lucky, FinFin's wife will also appear at this location for a brief moment.

=== Rem(se) River Bank ===

This place is available in the 4-world version and above. In the foreground is a cave inside the water. In the background of the upper part of the place, one can see the opposite plant-rich bank.

This place is the only one that shows the underwater world of TEO, and only here can the player watch FinFin diving and hunting for fish. FinFin's wife rarely comes to this place. If both are present, the player can watch the two doing a short underwater dance.

=== Nest ===

This place is only available in the 6-world version. At the left part of the foreground is a bush of many different plants. In the center is the nest of FinFin and Finnina, which can be in one of three stages: construction, final or decayed. In the background is a narrow waterfall that ends in a small river. The place is surrounded by a forest of tall trees.

In this place, the player can observe the rearing of Finfin Junior by FinFin and his wife Finnina. By pressing the spacebar, a loud FinFin call will sound, which can cause various things. It is supposed to scare away an enemy named Gminfly (flying orca), if the latter has approached the nest too much. When the "call" is exercised, a certain plant is always frightened in the foreground, blooming in a jerky manner and changing its color. Over time, it calms down again and takes its old form. If the player presses it while FinFin is in the foreground, he will start to cry.

==Spinoffs==

'''Animated Storybook: To Teo and Back with Jack'''

]]
The '''Galves–Löcherbach model''' is a [[mathematical model|model]] with intrinsic [[stochasticity]] for [[Biological neural network|biological neural nets]], in which the probability of a future spike depends on the evolution of the complete system since the last spike.&lt;ref&gt;A. Galves, E. Löcherbach, "Infinite Systems of Interacting Chains with Memory of Variable Length — A Stochastic Model for Biological Neural Nets". Journal of Statistical Physics, vol. 151, n. 5, pp. 896–921, Jun. 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This model of [[Biological neuron model|spiking neuron]]s was developed by mathematicians [[Antonio Galves]] and [[Eva Löcherbach]]. In the first article on the model, in 2013, they called it a model of a "system with interacting stochastic chains with memory of variable length."

== History ==

Some inspirations of the Galves–Löcherbach model are the [[Frank Spitzer]]'s [[interacting particle system]] and [[Jorma Rissanen]]'s notion of [[stochastic chain with memory of variable length]]. Another work that influenced this model was [[Bruno Cessac]]'s study on the [[Biological neuron model#Leaky integrate-and-fire|leaky integrate-and-fire model]], who himself was influenced by [[Hédi Soula]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Cessac, "A discrete time neural network model with spiking neurons: II: Dynamics with noise". Journal of Mathematical Biology, Vol. 62, nº 6, pg 863–900. Jun. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Galves and Löcherbach referred to the process that Cessac described as "a version in a finite dimension" of their own probabilistic model.

Prior integrate-and-fire models with stochastic characteristics relied on including a noise to simulate stochasticity.&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Plesser, W. Gerstner. "Noise in Integrate-and-Fire Neurons: From Stochastic Input to Escape Rates". Neural Computation. Feb 2000, Vol. 12, No. 2, Pg 367–384&lt;/ref&gt; The Galves–Löcherbach model distinguishes itself because it is inherently stochastic, incorporating probabilistic measures directly in the calculation of spikes. It is also a model that may be applied relatively easily, from a computational standpoint, with a good ratio between cost and efficiency. It remains a non-Markovian model, since the probability of a given neuronal spike depends on the accumulated activity of the system since the last spike.

Contributions to the model were made, considering the [[hydrodynamic]] limit of the interacting neuronal system,&lt;ref&gt;A. De Masi, A. Galves, E. Löcherbach, E. Presutti, "Hydrodynamic limit for interacting neurons". Journal of Statistical Physics, 158(4), 866–902, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the long-range behavior and aspects pertaining to the process in the sense of predicting and classifying behaviors according to a fonction of parameters,&lt;ref&gt;A. Duarte, G. Ost, "A model for neural activity in the absence of external stimuli", arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.6086 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Fournier, E. Löcherbach, "On a toy model of interacting neurons", arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.3263 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; and the generalization of the model to the continuous time.&lt;ref&gt;K. Yaginuma, "A stochastic system with infinite interacting components to model the time evolution of the membrane potentials of a population of neurons", arXiv preprint arXiv:1505.00045 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galves–Löcherbach model was a cornerstone to the [[NeuroMat|Research, Innocation and Dissemination Center for Neuromathematics]].&lt;ref name="mentecerebro"&gt;[http://neuromat.numec.prp.usp.br/sites/default/files/neuromatematica-junho2014.pdf "Modelos matemáticos do cérebro", Fernanda Teixeira Ribeiro, ''Mente e Cérebro'', Jun. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal definition ==

The model considers a countable set of neurons &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; and models its evolution in discrete-time periods &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; with a stochastic chain &lt;math&gt;(X_t)_{t\in\mathbb{Z}}&lt;/math&gt;, considering values in &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^{I}&lt;/math&gt;. More precisely, for each neuron &lt;math&gt;i\in I&lt;/math&gt; and time period &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, we define &lt;math&gt;X_t(i)=1&lt;/math&gt; if neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; spikes in period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and  conversely &lt;math&gt;X_t(i)=0&lt;/math&gt;. The configuration of the set of neurons, in the time period &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, is therefore defined as &lt;math&gt;X_t=(X_t(i),i\in I)&lt;/math&gt;.  For each time period &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, we define a [[sigma-algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_t=\sigma(X_s(j),j\in I, s\leq t)&lt;/math&gt;, representing the history of the evolution of the activity of this set of neurons until the relevant time period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The dynamics of the activity of this set of neurons is defined as follows. Once the history &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_{t-1}&lt;/math&gt; is given, neurons spike or not in the next time period &lt;math&gt;
t

&lt;/math&gt; independently from one another, that is, for each finite subset &lt;math&gt;F\subset I&lt;/math&gt; and any configuration &lt;math&gt;a_i\in\{0,1\}, i\in F,&lt;/math&gt; we have

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt; &lt;math&gt;
\mathop{\mathrm{Prob}}(X_{t}(i)=a_i,i\in I|\mathcal{F}_{t-1})=\prod_{i\in I} \mathop{\mathrm{Prob}}(X_{t}(i)=a_i|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}).

&lt;/math&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

Furthermore, the probability that a given neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; spikes in a time period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, according to the probabilistic model, is described by the formula

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathop{\mathrm{Prob}}(X_{t}(i) = 1|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}) = \phi_i \Biggl( \sum_{j\in I} W_{j \rightarrow i} \sum_{s=L_{t}^i}^{t-1}g_j(t-s)X_s(j),t-L_{t}^i \Biggl), &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W_{j \rightarrow i}&lt;/math&gt; is [[synaptic weight]] that expresses the increase of [[membrane potential]] of neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; because of neuron &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;'s spike, &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; is a function that models the leak of potential and &lt;math&gt;L_t^i&lt;/math&gt; is the most recent period of neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'s spike before the given time period &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, considering the formula

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;L_t^i =\text{sup}\{s&lt;t:X_s(i)=1\}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

At time &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; before &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, neuron &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; spikes, restoring the membrane potential to its initial value.

'''Handsome Dan''' is a [[bulldog]] who serves as the [[mascot]] of [[Yale University]]'s sports teams. In addition to a person wearing a [[costume]], the position is filled by an actual bulldog, the honor (and the title "Handsome Dan") being transferred to another upon death or retirement. 

==Handsome Dan I==
1889–1897 (retired to England).&lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan was selected based on his ability to tolerate bands and children, negative reaction to the color [[crimson]] and to [[tigers]] (the symbols of rival schools [[Harvard]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] respectively), bought by Yale student Andrew Barbey Graves &lt;ref name=Tale&gt;{{Citation | last  = Schiff | first = Judith | title = A tale of two bulldogs | journal = Yale Alumni Magazine | issue = Nov/Dec | year = 2014 | url = https://yalealumnimagazine.com/articles/3974-handsome-dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;, who cleaned up the dog and named him “Handsome Dan.” Soon, Dan followed Graves everywhere around campus, including sporting events.&lt;ref name = "MascotAudition"&gt;{{cite web | title = Mascot Audition: Dog Day Afternoon | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/players/05/03/bulldog0509/ | work = [[Sports Illustrated]] | first = Ben | last = Reiter | date = 2005-05-03 | accessdate = 2007-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanI"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/dani.html | title = Handsome Dan I: 1889–1898 | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020431/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/dani.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students quickly adopted Dan as the Yale mascot. After Graves graduated and returned to England, Dan stayed on campus with his master’s brother, William Leon Graves&lt;ref name=Tale/&gt;. Before football and baseball games would begin, Handsome Dan founded a tradition and a dynasty by being led across the field. One newspaper reported: "He was a big white bulldog, with one of the greatest faces a dog of that breed (English) ever carried". This was not an exaggeration, as Handsome Dan was one of the finest specimens of his breed in America, and went on to win first prize at the [[Westminster Dog Show]] and at least thirty other first prize ribbons in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name="Tim Cohane pp. 72-73"&gt;“The Yale Football Story” by Tim Cohane. pp. 72–73. 1951&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Hartford Courant]], "In personal appearance, he seemed like a cross between an alligator and a horned frog, and he was called handsome by the metaphysicians under the law of compensation. The title came to him, he never sought it. He was always taken to games on a leash, and the Harvard football team for years owed its continued existence to the fact that the rope held."&lt;ref name ="HandsomeDanI"/&gt; The Philadelphia Press reported that "a favorite trick was to tell him to 'Speak to Harvard.' He would bark ferociously and work himself into physical contortions of rage never before dreamed of by a dog&lt;ref name=Tale/&gt;. Dan was peculiar to himself in one thing – he would never associate with anyone but students. Dan implanted himself more firmly in the hearts of Yale students than any mascot had ever done before."&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanI"/&gt; Handsome Dan crossed the Atlantic to join his old master in 1897 and died in 1898. Graves had Dan [[taxidermy|stuffed]] and returned him to be displayed at Yale in the old gymnasium. When it was torn down, Dan I was sent to the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History|Peabody Museum]] for reconstruction. Handsome Dan I now is in a sealed glass case in one of the trophy rooms of Yale's [[Payne Whitney Gymnasium]], where, according to Stanton Ford, "he is the perpetual guardian of the treasures which attest to generations of Yale athletic glory." Andrew Graves died of [[tuberculosis]] on February 18, 1948, in Westbury, Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;"New York Times" Obituary Feb 19, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handsome Dan II==
1933–1937 (died of a broken leg).&lt;br&gt;
After a 35-year interval, Handsome Dan II was purchased with pennies donated by the freshman class, and given to [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Ducky Pond]].&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanII"&gt;{{cite web | title = Handsome Dan II: 1933–1937 | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danii.html | accessdate = 2007-06-08 | work = Yale Bulldogs |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020434/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danii.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Handsome Dan II was [[kidnap]]ped by Harvard students the day before the 1934 [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|Harvard-Yale football game]], and Yale students were alarmed at photographs of him happily seated at the foot of the statue of [[John Harvard (clergyman)|John Harvard]] in [[Harvard Yard]], having a snack.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanII"/&gt;  He died of a leg fracture received from a jump. (Handsome Dan II now is in a sealed glass case in the Yale University Visitor's centre on Elm Street.)

==Handsome Dan III==
1937–1938 (retired due to emotional instability).&lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan III was a huge white dog who unfortunately exhibited morbid [[Agoraphobia|fear of crowds]] and had to be retired.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIII"&gt;{{cite web | work = Yale Bulldogs | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/daniii.html | title = Handsome Dan III: 1937–1938 | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020440/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/daniii.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handsome Dan IV==
1938–1940 (retired due to injury).&lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan IV had his spine fractured by a car early in his term of office, leaving his hind legs paralyzed.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIV"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/daniv.html | title = Handsome Dan IV: 1938 | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020445/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/daniv.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until he eventually died in 1940, a bulldog named Bull served in his place, becoming Handsome Dan V.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIV"/&gt;

==Handsome Dan V==
1940–1947 (died of old age).&lt;br&gt;
"Bull", brought in his youth to watch football practices by his owner, high school student Bob Day who lived near the [[Yale Bowl]],&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanV"&gt;{{cite web | title = Handsome Dan V: 1940–1947 | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danv.html | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025032208/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danv.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ascended to office when Handsome Dan IV died.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIV"/&gt; A great success, he loved public appearances and the adulation of crowds, was a familiar figure around the [[locker room]]s, and joined the team on a trip to [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanV"/&gt;

==Handsome Dan VI==
1947–1949 (died mysteriously at age 2).&lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan VI was eight weeks old when he took the role, but died at age two.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanVI"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danvi.html | title = Handsome Dan VI: 1947–1949 | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025032213/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danvi.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was reported that he died from fear of [[fireworks]] at the Yale-Harvard game, or of shame from seeing the Yale team lose to both Princeton and Harvard in the same year.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanVI"/&gt;

==Handsome Dan VII==
1949–1952 (retired due to emotional instability).&lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan VII was donated to football coach [[Herman Hickman]] at age 3 but he proved to have a bad temper, which suited him better in his next position as a watchdog on a [[Florida]] estate.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanVII"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danvii.html | title = Handsome Dan VII: 1949–1952 | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025032218/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danvii.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handsome Dan VIII==
1952 (retired due to emotional instability).&lt;br&gt;
Up to this point, Handsome Dans had lived at the [[Yale Boathouse]] and were cared for in a somewhat haphazard fashion. 
Handsome Dan VIII, however, was owned by assistant football manager [[Tom Shutt]],&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanVIII"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danviii.html | title = Handsome Dan VIII: 1952 only | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020657/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danviii.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; ushering in a new era of family membership for the office-holder. Nevertheless, he had to retire after only two games due to intense discomfort with public appearances.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanVIII"/&gt;

==Handsome Dan IX==
1953–1959 (died of acute [[kidney disease]]).&lt;br&gt;
Notable for falling off the dock at the [[Yale Boathouse]] and nearly drowning&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIX"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danix.html | title = Handsome Dan IX: 1953–1959 | work = Yale Bulldogs | accessdate = 2007-06-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071025020450/http://yalebulldogs.cstv.com/trads/danix.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (confirming the hypothesis that bulldogs cannot swim, due to the peculiarities of their physiques); some contemporary news reports say that he had to be [[resuscitate]]d after having had his head embedded in the mud.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIX"/&gt; He also appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine in November, 1956. "Danny" was born September 11, 1953 and owned by John E. Sanders, Assistant Professor of Geology, after an earlier custody by physical education instructor, Alfred E. Scholz and Varsity Crew Coach Jim Rothschmidt.&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIX"/&gt; He made his mascot debut at the age of six weeks and an [[autopsy]] at his death revealed that he succumbed to acute [[nephrotic syndrome]].&lt;ref name = "HandsomeDanIX"/&gt;

==Handsome Dan X==
1959–1969 (retired due to old age).&lt;br&gt;
"Woodie" ''aka'' "Boodnick", also owned by John E. Sanders, marked a return to the high standards seen in Handsome Dan V. An impressive 74 pounds, a beloved family pet as well as winner of the best bulldog title at the [[Cape Cod Kennel Club]] [[conformation dog show]], he was instrumental in leading Yale's football team to its 9 and 0 season in 1960.  He spent several years commuting to New Haven, CT, from Dobbs Ferry, NY, prior to his retirement. His registered AKC kennel name was "Bayside Woodnought." He was sired by Ch. Bonny Boy of Fearnought out of Woodside's Christie Lou, and was a grandson of the famed Kippax Fearnought, the celebrated English import, who went Best in Show in 1955 at Westminster. He died in 1971 of natural causes.

==Handsome Dan XI==
1969–1974 (retired due to [[arthritis]]).&lt;br&gt;
"Oliver", owned by Yale College master [[John Hersey]], loved football but had a tendency to doze in the sun during games. He was frequently sighted on [[Martha's Vineyard]] during the tourist season.

==Handsome Dan XII==
1975–1984.&lt;br&gt;
"Bingo", owned by history professor [[Rollin G. Osterweis]], was described by her owner as "pugnacious and stubborn, but lovable." Bingo also had the distinction of being the only female Handsome Dan. Bingo was stolen by four Princeton undergrads posing as Yale cheerleaders. They took Bingo to a friend's apartment in New York City on the run from authorities. The mastermind behind the canine-caper was Rod Shepard. The group of students took Bingo back to her owner and held a press conference for her return.

==Handsome Dan XIII==
1984–1995; 1996 (retired due to old age.)&lt;br&gt;
"Maurice", owned by [[Chris Getman]], was perhaps the most noteworthy of the Handsome Dans. He served in office longer than any other Handsome Dan; he was the only holder of the office to come out of retirement to serve again, due to the death of his successor; and he appeared in [[Sports Illustrated]], in 1989. His patience with the tedium of posing for professional [[photographer]]s also served him well as he posed for [[game program]]s, [[brochure]]s, and the 1991 Yale [[Christmas card]], wearing a [[wreath]] and [[Santa Claus]] hat. He also appeared at [[swim meet]]s, wearing a [[bathing suit]]. His love of Yale was evident in many ways: he would sing along with the Yale [[fight song]] (at least the "bow wow wow" part); he would "play dead" when asked whether he would rather die or join Harvard; and he lost his normally docile nature around mascots of opposing teams, launching assaults on the Princeton tiger mascot and the [[Brown University]] bear mascot. (There was also an unfortunate incident involving a policeman on horseback which resulted in his being ejected from the Harvard-Yale game, and [[Halloween]]s were somewhat touchy.) He died in 1997, just before turning 14.

==Handsome Dan XIV==
1995–1996 (died of heart attack).&lt;br&gt;
"Whizzer" ''aka'' "Hetherbull", also owned by Chris Getman, was donated by Yale alumnus and bulldog breeder [[Bob Hetherington]] and was a descendant of 52 time [[Conformation show|best-in-show]] winner [[Hetherbull Arrogant Frigott]]; unfortunately, he possessed a [[temperament]] so [[hyperexcitable]] that he died in office from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]], and was succeeded by his predecessor and housemate.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Handsome Dan XV==
1996–2005 (unknown death).&lt;br&gt;
"Louis", also donated by Bob Hetherington and owned by Chris Getman, was named after three people named Louis, including football coach [[Carm Cozza|Carm Louis Cozza]]. He died in office in January 2005 of a possible heart attack.&lt;ref name = "MascotAudition"/&gt;

==Handsome Dan XVI==
2005–2006 (retired).&lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan XVI was chosen on 26 April 2005.  Magnificent Mugsy Rangoon, a Bulldog from [[Hamden, Connecticut]], was picked by a five-person panel for his gregarious personality, large size (69 pounds),&lt;ref name = "MascotAudition"/&gt; good health, and his ability to deal with the raucous [[Yale Precision Marching Band]]. 
At the auditions, Mugsy gained great favor by focusing on a crimson blanket (representing Harvard) versus the stuffed-toy tiger (representing [[Princeton University]]).&lt;ref name = "MascotAudition"/&gt; "We beat Princeton three of four years," said Jeff Mroz, Yale's quarterback. "We want to beat Harvard."&lt;ref name = "MascotAudition"/&gt;

Mugsy is owned by Bob Sansone, a [[North Haven, Connecticut|North Haven]] middle school teacher.&lt;ref name = "MascotAudition"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yalebulldogs.collegesports.com/genrel/042605aaa.html | title = It's Mugsy! Bulldogs Pick New Handsome Dan | work = Yale Bulldogs | date = 2005-04-26 | accessdate = 2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his first [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|Harvard-Yale Game]] in 2005, Handsome Dan XVI was briefly stolen by a pair of Harvard undergraduates, in response to a Yale student stealing the Harvard flag and running across the field back to the Yale side with it. The two lured him into the Harvard [[student section]] of the [[Yale Bowl]] as he chewed a toy depicting a Harvard football player. Yale University Police recovered him, unharmed but without his Yale sweater, a few minutes later.

Handsome Dans traditionally reign for a lifetime, but Mugsy is still living with owner Bob Sansone in Hamden.

==Handsome Dan XVII==
2006–2016 (died of heart attack).&lt;br&gt;
A new bulldog named Sherman quietly assumed the mascot position as Handsome Dan XVII in late winter 2006.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/22483|title=Handsome Dan term no longer lasts a lifetime|last=Kim|first=Ruth|date=November 16, 2007|website=Yale Daily News|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118085010/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/22483|archive-date=November 18, 2007|access-date=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bred by Diane Judy of Johnson City, Tenn., Handsome Dan XVII, a 50-pound bulldog, was the half brother of Rambo, owned by former Yale football captain Rory Hennessey.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His home name was "Sherman", after the [[M4 Sherman|tank]] and Connecticut icon Roger Sherman. He took over as Handsome Dan XVII with great enthusiasm. He was photographed with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] and Sir [[Paul McCartney]]. He was very athletic, retrieved with vigor and raised thousands of dollars for charity.

He died on August 11, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/Yale-Mascot-Handsome-Dan-XVII-Has-Died-Yale-Athletics--390169131.html|title=Yale Mascot, Handsome Dan XVII, Has Died: Yale Athletics|last=|first=|date=August 15, 2016|website=NBC Connecticut|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handsome Dan XVIII ==
2016–present &lt;br&gt;
Handsome Dan XVIII was chosen in November 2016. He was born September 23, 2016 and came from a breeder in Maine. The new keeper of the mascot, called Walter at home, is [http://www.yalebulldogs.com/information/directory/bios/discepolo_kevin?tmpl=/information/directory/bio-template Kevin Discepolo] (Yale ’09), a former lacrosse player who is now Yale’s assistant athletic director of facilities, operations and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.yale.edu/2016/11/17/meet-handsome-dan-xviii|title=Meet Handsome Dan XVIII|website=Yale News|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on popular culture==
The [[Shake Shack]] location in New Haven, Connecticut, features a menu item named for Handsome Dan, called the Handsome Dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eater.com/2012/9/13/6546059/shake-shack-opens-at-yale-declares-e-burgerus-unum|title=Shake Shack Opens at Yale, Declares 'E Burgerus Unum'|last=Forbes|first=Paula|date=September 13, 2012|website=Eater|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Handsome Dog, which features beer-marinated deep-fried onions and two kinds of cheese, debuted at the New Haven location but can now be found at all other Shake Shack locations, albeit as the Dapper Dog.

The TV series ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', which is set in Connecticut, makes several references to the Handsome Dan Statue.

In the TV series Gossip Girl, Blair Waldorf is gifted a bulldog by her father in season 2, episode 16. The bulldog is named Handsome Dan in honor of Blair's aspirations to attend Yale following high school. Blair shortens his name to "Handsome". Blair's scheming results in her losing her acceptance to Yale, and she gives the bulldog away to a homeless man.

'''Jack Peterson''' is an American activist and former spokesperson for the  [[Incel]] community. 

==Biography==
Peterson's legal name is Kalerthon Demetro, but he prefers the pseudonym Jack Peterson.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/sympathy-for-the-incel|title=Sympathy for the ‘Incel’|author=Stadtmiller, Mandy|date=29 April 2018|work=[[The Daily Beast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Chicago]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="twitter"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jackpeterson08|title=Jack Peterson on Twitter|author=Peterson, Jack|date=May 2017|publisher=[[Twitter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite claiming to be incel, Peterson has stated that he has had a girlfriend in the past, yet claims it was not a productive relationship since he felt he was constantly abused, scolded and berated, and was physically attacked by her.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

Peterson first stumbled upon the [[manosphere]] at the age of 11 on 4chan.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; A psychiatrist has diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, but this has been disputed by other doctors&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;.   He is a high school dropout.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

==Career==
Peterson is a former staff member and chat room administrator of Incels.me, which is the largest incel website on the internet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/24/toronto-van-attack-facebook-post-may-link-suspect-with-incel-group|title=Toronto van attack: Facebook post may link suspect to misogynist 'incel' subculture|author=Wilson, Jason|date=2018-04-25|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a site he describes as more honest than other incel forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thespec.com/news-story/8576807-shadowy-online-subculture-in-spotlight-after-toronto-van-attack|title=Shadowy online subculture in spotlight after Toronto van attack|date=April 29, 2018|author=Yang, Jennifer|author2=Gillis, Wendy|work=[[The Hamilton Spectator]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He previously ran the "Incelcast", wherein he interviewed incels and discussed how they came to their position.&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thesun"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/6176427/incels-acid-attack-toronto-van-alek-minassian/|title=Revenge of the Losers |author=Hodge, Mark|date=30 Apr 2018|publisher=''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; His podcast also discussed the [[w:Hikikomori|hikikomori]] phenomenon in Japan and the likelihood of the same thing happening in the Western world.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; 

As part of their efforts to de-radicalize young male incels, he and others on his podcast offered several suggestions, including banning references to Elliot Rodger, permitting female incels to participate on predominantly male incel forums, banning misogynistic or hateful language by [[black piller]]s whom he views as a vocal minority,&lt;ref name="globe" /&gt; addressing the discriminatory nature of [[lookism]]&lt;ref name="mount" /&gt; and legalizing prostitution and [[assisted suicide]].&lt;ref name="vice" /&gt; 

He has been the subject of television and phone interviews with the media to discuss incel topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/04/28/shadowy-online-subculture-in-spotlight-after-toronto-van-attack.html|title=Shadowy online subculture in spotlight after Toronto van attack|work=The Star|author=Yang, Jennifer|author2=Gillis, Wendy|date=April 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grazia"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://graziadaily.co.uk/life/real-life/inside-the-murky-world-of-the-male-celibates/|title=Inside The Murky World Of The Male Celibates |author=Silverman, Anna|date=11 May 2018|publisher=[[Grazia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shift"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://omny.fm/shows/the-shift-with-drex/an-inceler-speaks-to-the-media|title=An Inceler speaks to the media |author=Wilcomes, Justin|date=27 Apr 2018|publisher=The Shift with Drex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/25/opinion/feminists-misogyny-patriarchy.html|title=What Feminists Can Do For Boys |author=Valenti, Jessica|date=25 Jul 2018|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson was the only incel to be featured on Canadian national television in the aftermath of the Toronto terrorist van attack.&lt;ref name="daily" /&gt;

He believes that involuntary celibacy is a social phenomenon rather than a movement and has described online communities as support groups for discussing depression and loneliness.&lt;ref name="mount"&gt;Mountford, J. B. "Topic Modeling The Red Pill." Social Sciences 7.3 (2018): 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson describes incels as commonly being males in their late teens who are shy.&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4169791/toronto-van-attack-incel/|title=‘There’s a lot of truth in this’: Incel spokesperson defends movement praised by Alek Minassian|website=Globalnews.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He has condemned the Toronto van attack and claimed that Alek Minassian is not representative of the incel community.&lt;ref name="vice"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/en_ca/article/evqwww/how-the-incel-community-is-reckoning-with-the-toronto-van-attack|author=Browne, Rachel|author2=Subramaniam, Vanmala|date=April 25, 2018|title=How the incel community is reckoning with the Toronto van attack|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peterson has compared the demonization of inceldom to the generalizations and subsequent xenophobic and [[Islamophobic]] sentiments faced by Muslims in the aftermath of Islamist violence.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

His demeanor has been described as [[pacifist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yooword.com/what-is-incel-examining-the-rebellion-praised-by-toronto-van-attack-suspect.html|publisher=Yoo News|title=What is incel? Examining the ‘rebellion’ praised by Toronto van attack suspect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Peterson announced on his YouTube channel that he left the Incel community voluntarily by requesting a permanent ban on the forum "Incels.me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=ng29REVIyTQ|title=Why I'm Leaving Incels|author=Peterson, Jack|date=May 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-44053828|title=BBC Trending: Inside the Dark World of ‘incels’|author=Griffin, Jonathan|date=12 May 2018|publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unmaking-of-an-incel_us_5b11a9aee4b0d5e89e1fb519?ncid=engmodushpmg00000006|title=The Unmaking Of An Incel|author=Jeltsen, Melissa|date=7 Jun 2018|publisher=[[HuffPost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/19/incels-why-jack-peterson-left-elliot-rodger|title='Not as ironic as I imagined': the incels spokesman on why he is renouncing them|author=Ling, Justin|date=18 Jun 2018|publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James R. O'Neill''' (born February 13, 1833, Ireland; died October 6, 1863, Baxter Springs, Kansas) was a [[war artist]] and correspondent for ''[[Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper]]'' during the [[American Civil War]].  He covered the [[Battle of Honey Springs]] in July 1863, and his sketch of the action was published to a nationwide audience.  Less than three months later, however, O'Neill was killed in the [[Battle of Baxter Springs]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in an unknown location in Ireland, James Richard O'Neill emigrated across the Atlantic with his family in infancy.  The Irish family at first lived in Quebec, but in 1843 emigrated again to [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]].  O'Neill spent his older childhood and early adulthood in Wisconsin, possibly helping out his father Charles O'Neill in the older man's duties as the Kenosha [[lighthouse keeper]].  In 1854 young O'Neill joined the [[Madison, Wisconsin]]-based [[Jack Langrishe|Langrishe &amp; Atwater]] company of traveling theatrical players.  With [[naïve art]] skills, he worked at first as the company's stage crewman, designing and building sets and scenery.  The company later expanded his role and he became a comic actor, specializing in Irish-dialect songs, dances, and stand-up comedy recitals.&lt;ref name="Civil War Wisconsin"/&gt;

In Madison in the late 1850s, O'Neill became a leading figure among his fellow young professionals.  Local press accounts show him as the informal leader of a mock-fraternal organization, known officially as the 'K.O.T.F.N.' [possibly standing for "Knights of the Fraternal No-names"] but whose members usually called themselves just "The Club."  The club won its longest press clippings on July 4, 1859, when they produced a [[charivari|street shivaree]] that poked satirical fun at the earnest [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] Madison celebrations of the time.  Club members dressed up in phony military uniforms, banged on pots and pans, and hauled out a fake [[cannon]] to fire mock salutes.  Indignant letters to the editor followed.&lt;ref name="Civil War Wisconsin"/&gt;

In late 1860 or early 1861, O'Neill moved to [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]] in the fast-growing new state of [[Kansas]], and attempted to become a full-time painter and artist.  Kansas had very few art painters at that time and O'Neill was offered commissions ranging from stage scenery to a devout depiction of the [[Assumption of the Virgin]].&lt;ref name="Langdon"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Langdon |first=Jessica |date=April 27, 2012 |title=Labor of love makes old painting new again |url=https://issuu.com/theleaven/docs/leaven_04-27-12/5 |magazine=The Leaven |location=Kansas City, Kansas |publisher=[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kansas City in Kansas|Archdiocese of Kansas City]] |access-date=March 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Leavenworth was a center of efforts by the U.S. Army to put down the emerging [[Confederate States of America]] and defeat supporters of slavery such as were to be found in large numbers in the neighboring slave state of Missouri.  O'Neill found himself [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]] soldiers and officers at the adjacent [[Fort Leavenworth]].  Through General [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|James H. Lane]], he developed ties in August 1861 with ''Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper'', a high-circulation illustrated paper of the 1860s and key media supporter of the Union cause.  ''Frank Leslie's'' had let it be known that they would sometimes accept sketches sent to them by [[freelance]] artists, such as O'Neill.&lt;ref name="Civil War Wisconsin"/&gt;

===American Civil War===
James O'Neill's new ties with ''Frank Leslie's'' made it possible for him to travel with Union units that were willing to have a newsman [[Embedded journalism|embedded]] with them.  As an artist with experience in the stylized depiction of landscape scenery, O'Neill was able to draw detailed portraits of the battle scenes he could see.  Sketch artists like O'Neill often romanticized what they saw in terms of placing all of the action within a single frame with [[forced perspective]], but the sketch artists for ''Leslie's'', ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', and other illustrated weeklies were careful to portray soldiers and officers accurately in terms of their uniforms, arms, and equipment.  Their sketches thus serve as valid American Civil War data, especially for humble objects and items of battlefield or fatigue wear that do not usually show up in the stiff, formal photographs of the time.  

In late July, an American column under General [[James G. Blunt]] thrust into [[Indian Territory]], with the goal of subduing Confederate strength within the Territory and recapturing the Confederate strongpoint at [[Fort Smith National Historic Site|Fort Smith]] in adjacent Arkansas.  On July 17, 1863, Confederate forces awaited the column at their encampment in Honey Springs.  Although the American column had only 3,000 men and the Southerners numbered 6,000, the Union army won the day.  O'Neill sketched a charge by a battalion of the [[6th Regiment Kansas Volunteer Cavalry|6th Kansas Cavalry]] during the latter stage of the battle.&lt;ref name="Steele and Cottrell"/&gt; After the affray, O'Neill sent his pen-and-ink sketch to ''Leslie's'' home office in [[New York City]], where the sketch was recut as a [[wood engraving]] for publication.  This was a time-consuming process; O'Neill's sketch was published in the weekly's August 29, 1863 issue, more than a month after the battle.  O'Neill also worked as a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]], sending news accounts of the [[Arkansas in the American Civil War|Arkansas campaigns]] to ''Leslie's'' for publication.&lt;ref name="Civil War Wisconsin"/&gt;          

O'Neill remained embedded with the Union [[Army of the Frontier|District of the Frontier]] under Blunt.  The Union operations had regained control of Fort Smith, and Blunt took steps to advance his headquarters from [[Fort Scott National Historic Site|Fort Scott]], in eastern Kansas, to the western Arkansas river port.  His headquarters column, moving southward, had reached [[Baxter Springs, Kansas]] when they were intercepted and ambushed on October 6, 1863 by [[Quantrill's Raiders]].  This somewhat irregular unit of Southern rangers, commanded by guerrilla warrior [[William Quantrill]], did not make a practice of taking prisoners.  Unarmed and ancillary personnel in Blunt's column were cut down.  Correspondent O'Neill was killed in action.&lt;ref name="Steele and Cottrell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Civil War Wisconsin"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4749">'''Ka-Mer''' is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] women's group that finds shelter for and offers legal aid to women who have been threatened by their relatives.

: ''We have to bring these killings out from the shadows and teach women about their rights. The laws have been changed, but the culture here will not change overnight.''&amp;nbsp;— Ayten Tekay, a caseworker for Ka-Mer in [[Diyarbakır]].&lt;ref name="Bilefsky 2006-07-12" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bilefsky 2006-07-16" /&gt;

The KA-MER organization was founded in 1997, by a Turkish elementary school teacher "who had become committed to the issue of Kurdish women's oppression through her and her husband's experiences with violence in the 1980s and 1990s”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gokalp|first1=Deniz|title=A gendered analysis of violence, justice and citizenship: Kurdish women facing war and displacement in Turkey|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|date=November–December 2010|volume=33|issue=6|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277539510001196|accessdate=4 May 2015|doi=10.1016/j.wsif.2010.09.005|pages=561–569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is located in the city of Diyarbakir, Turkey. Funding for KA-MER came from many feminist circles who had become tired of the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] and the supposed faux feminism that it promoted. 
KA-MER took a different approach to feminism in Turkey by turning away notional feminist issues and instead focusing on changing the Kurdish culture’s social, cultural, and political view of women. 
In the 1990s KA-MER grew alliances with Turkish and Kurdish feminist circles, which helped them, bring a greater awareness of the suicides and "''killings committed under the guise of 'honor'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's to blame?

There was, however, severe tension between KA-MER and the more politically aware feminist circles. These feminists believe KA-MER to be ignorant to the reality of the Kurdish struggle and more of a  “pragmatist, elite organization.” 
Today KA-MER is the one of the most prominent women organizations in Turkey, recognized by international human rights groups, and is continuing the fight against [[honor killings]] and other forms of violence against women.

==Early life==
Kishore Kumar was born in a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[family]] in [[Khandwa]], [[Central Provinces]] (now in [[Madhya Pradesh]]) as Abhas Kumar Ganguly.&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = The Indian Express | date = 13 October 2010 | url = http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/when-kishore-kumar-insisted-on-bullockcart-ride/696711/ |title=When Kishore Kumar insisted on the bullockcart ride | accessdate = 13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Kunjalal Ganguly (Gangopadhyay) was a lawyer and his mother, Gouri Devi came from a wealthy Bengali family. Kunjalal Gangopadhyaya was invited by the Kamavisadar Gokhale family of Khandwa to be their personal lawyer. Kishore was the youngest of four siblings, the older three being [[Ashok Kumar|Ashok]] (the eldest), Sati Devi, and [[Anoop Kumar|Anoop]].&lt;ref name="NabenduGhosh1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nabendu Ghosh|title=Ashok Kumar: His Life and Times|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dB1lAAAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Indus|isbn=978-81-7223-218-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kishore was still a child, his brother Ashok became a Bollywood actor. Later, Anoop also ventured into cinema with Ashok's help.&lt;ref name="Bose2006"&gt;{{cite book | author=Derek Bose|title=Everybody Wants a Hit: 10 Mantras of Success in Bollywood Cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wv_mmculJ8kC&amp;pg=PA38|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Jaico Publishing House|isbn=978-81-7992-558-4|pages=38–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Christian College, Indore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indore.nic.in/fact.htm "Facts about Indore"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609011750/http://indore.nic.in/fact.htm |date=9 June 2015 }}, "District Administration Indore", 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{Main|Kishore Kumar filmography|List of songs by Kishore Kumar}}

After Ashok Kumar became a star of Hindi films, the Ganguly family visited Mumbai regularly. Abhas Kumar changed his name to 'Kishore Kumar' and started his cinema career as a chorus singer at [[Bombay Talkies]], where his brother worked. Kumar's first film appearance was in ''Shikari'' (1946), in which his brother, Ashok played the lead role. Music director Khemchand Prakash gave Kumar a chance to sing "Marne Ki Duayen Kyon Mangu" for the film ''[[Ziddi (1948 film)|Ziddi]]'' (1948). After this, Kumar was offered many other assignments, but he was not very serious about a film career.&lt;ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987"&gt;[[Filmfare]] (1–15 November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he settled in Mumbai.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Kumar played the hero in the Bombay Talkies film ''Andolan'' (1951), directed by Phani Majumdar. Although he got some acting assignments with the help of his brother, he was more interested in becoming a singer. But Ashok wanted Kumar to be an actor like him.&lt;ref name="ToI_Avijit_unforgettable"&gt;{{cite news

It was only after the success of films such as ''Ladki'', ''Naukari'', ''Miss Malaysia'', ''Char Paise'' and ''Baap Re Baap'' that Kumar developed interest in acting seriously, which resulted in him having successful films as the lead hero between 1955 and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hindustantimes.com/music/the-legend-of-kishore-kumar-why-he-remains-relevant-even-today/story-yS95qQmejzEBIlpacKVexN.html The legend of Kishore Kumar: Why he remains relevant even today | music].

In initial days of his career, Kumar was deeply inspired by singer [[K. L. Saigal]] and imitated his style of singing in some of his early films. He had a great respect for [[poet]] and [[musician]] [[Rabindranath Tagore]] who influenced him in many ways.

He was an ardent admirer of Hollywood actor-singer [[Danny Kaye]]. He hung the portraits of all these three personalities at his ''Gaurikunj'' residence and would bow respectfully before them everyday as a rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Kishore Kumar|url=https://www.thebetterindia.com/71302/kishore-kumar-singer-actor/|publisher=''The Better India''|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his later career, Kumar was also heavily influenced by [[playback singer]] [[Ahmed Rushdi]] and his liking towards Rushdi was to the extent that he  paid him a tribute at [[Royal Albert Hall]] [[London]] by singing Rushdi's some of the songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legendary singer Ahmed Rushdi|url=http://arynews.tv/en/legendary-singer-ahmed-rushdis-31st-death-anniversary-today/|publisher=[[ARY News]]|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar used [[yodeling]] in many of his songs including ''Tum bin jaaon kahan'', ''Zindagi ik safar hai suhan'', ''Chala jata hoon'' etc to name a few and had become the essential feature of his singing which was inspired by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Tex Morton]].&lt;ref&gt;Pal, Sanchari.

Kumar starred in [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''Naukri'' (1954) and [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]]'s directorial debut ''[[Musafir (1957 film)|Musafir]]'' (1957). [[Salil Chowdhury]], the music director for ''Naukri'', was initially dismissive of Kumar as a singer when he found that Kumar had no formal training in music.&lt;ref name="raju_bharatan_repertoire"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2000/oct/13kumar.htm | title=Repertoire Unlimited: Remembering Kishore Kumar|author=Raju Bharatan | publisher=[[Rediff.com]] | accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after hearing his voice, Chowdhury gave him the song ''Chhota Sa Ghar Hoga'', which was supposed to be sung by [[Hemant Kumar]].

The commercially successful films of Kishore Kumar  included ''Ladki'' (1953), ''Naukari'' (1954), ''Baap Re Baap'' (1955), ''Paisa Hi Paisa'' (1956), ''New Delhi'' (1957), ''Naya Andaz'' (1956), ''Bhagam Bhaag'', ''Bhai Bhai'' (1958), ''[[Aasha (1957 film)|Aasha]]'' (1957), ''[[Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi]]'' (1958), ''Dilli Ka Thug'', ''Jaalsaaz'', ''Bombay Ka Chor'', ''Chacha Zindabad'', ''Manmauji'', ''Jhumroo'', ''[[Half Ticket]]'' (1962), ''Mr. X in Bombay'', ''Shreeman Funtoosh'', ''Ek Raaz'', ''[[Ganga Ki Lahren]]'', ''Hum Sab Ustaad Hai'' (1965), ''Haal E Dil'', ''Pyaar Kiye Jaa'' and ''[[Padosan]]'' (1968). As an actor, his best period was between 1954 and 1966. His onscreen pairing with actresses Mala Sinha, Vyjanthimala, Nutan, Madhubala and Kumkum gave the biggest hits in his career.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

''[[Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi]] ''(1958), his home production, had the three Ganguly brothers and [[Madhubala]] in main roles. Kumar played a car mechanic who has a romance with a city girl; (Madhubala) with a subplot involving the brothers.&lt;ref name="Derek2004"/&gt;{{rp|29}}

In the movie ''[[Half Ticket]]'', for one of the songs – "Aake Seedhi Lagi Dil Pe" – the music director [[Salil Chowdhary]] had a duet in mind and wanted Kishore Kumar and Lata Mangeshkar to sing the song. However, since Lata Mangeshkar was not in town and Salil Chowdhury had to record that song before she could return, Kishore Kumar solved the problem by singing both the male and female parts of the song himself. The duet is actually for Pran and Kishore Kumar on the screen dressed as a woman. It just turned out to be fine as he did admirably well singing both in male and female voices.

Music director S. D. Burman is credited with spotting Kumar's talent for singing. During the making of ''Mashaal'' (1950), Burman visited Ashok's house, where he heard Kumar imitating [[K. L. Saigal]]. He complimented him and told him that he should develop a style of his own, instead of copying Saigal.&lt;ref name="ToI_Avijit_unforgettable"/&gt; Kumar eventually developed his own style of singing, which featured [[yodeling]], which he had heard on the records of [[Tex Morton]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].&lt;ref name="Derek2004"&gt;{{cite book | author=Derek Bose | title=Kishore Kumar: method in madness | year=2004 | publisher=Rupa &amp; Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}}S. D. Burman kept making Kishore sing for Dev Anand from the 50s to the early 70s. S.D. Burman provided him the training and encouraged Kumar a lot, especially in the late 50s and early 60s, resulting in Kumar developing into a great singer in the future years. &lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/lata-mangeshkar-on-kishore-kumar-birth-anniversary-kishore-da-is-always-missed-4782106/ Lata Mangeshkar on Kishore Kumar’s birth anniversary: Kishore da is always missed].

In 1968, [[Rahul Dev Burman]] worked with Kishore Kumar on the soundtrack of the film ''[[Padosan]]'' (1968), in which Kumar sang "Mere Saamne Wali Khidki Mein" and "Kehna Hai."  ''Padosan'' was a comedy featuring Kishore as a dramatist-musician, [[Mehmood Ali|Mehmood]] as a [[Carnatic music]] and dance teacher, and [[Sunil Dutt]] as a simpleton named Bhola. Kishore's character was inspired by his uncle, Dhananjay Bannerjee, a classical singer.&lt;ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987"/&gt; The highlight of the film was a musical, comical duel between Kishore Kumar, Sunil Dutt and Mehmood: "Ek Chatur Nar Karke Singaar."

He suffered his first heart attack on 24 January 1981 in Kolkata in the noon hours and within a gap of another four hours, suffered his second heart attack. The first solo song sung by him, after recovery from his two attacks was "Mere Sang Sang Aya" from ''Rajput'' (1982) and the duet with Asha – "Mausam Bheega Bheega" from ''Gehra Zakhm''.

By September 1987, Kumar had decided to retire as he was unhappy with kind of songs and tunes being made by music directors and was planning to return to his birthplace Khandwa.&lt;ref name="Filmfare_Nov_1987"&gt;"Kishore Kumar – A Tribute". ''[[Filmfare]]'' magazine. November 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 1987{{mdash}}his brother Ashok's 76th birthday{{mdash}}he died of a heart attack in Mumbai at 4:45 pm. His body was taken to Khandwa for cremation. Kumar had recorded his last song, "Guru Guru"{{mdash}}a duet with [[Asha Bhosle]] for the film ''Waqt Ki Aawaz'' (1988) composed by [[Bappi Lahiri]] for Mithun Chakraborty and Sridevi{{mdash}}the day before he died.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} His song "Pal Bhar Ke Liye" from the film ''[[Johny Mera Naam]]'' (1970) was used in an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bangalore]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenindia.com/old/fullstory.php?content_id=15704 Foreign exchange!]. Rajeev Vijayakar. Screen Weekly. 4 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His songs have been featured in several films, including ''[[Such a Long Journey (film)|Such a Long Journey]]'' (1998) and ''[[Side Streets (1998 film)|Side Streets]]'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1800024525/cast Side Street (1998): Cast and Credits]{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony TV]] organised the television singing contest ''[[K For Kishore]]'' to search for a singer like Kishore Kumar.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Kishore Kumar's unreleased song was sold for Rs 15.6 lakh at the Osian's Cinefan Auction, New Delhi in 2012, the highest price bid for any Indian singer. The song was "Tum hi to woh ho", written by Kulwant Jani with music by Usha Khanna. This was for a film called "Khel Tamasha" by Rakesh Kumar, which never got made. The song was recorded just three days before his death in October 1987.

==Personal life==
[[File:Kishore kumar.png|thumb|Kumar with his family in 1953–54]]
Kishore Kumar married four times. His first wife was [[Bengali language|Bengali]]  singer and actress [[Ruma Guha Thakurta]] aka Ruma Ghosh. Their marriage lasted from 1950 to 1958.&lt;ref name="Shantanu2005"/&gt;{{rp|53}}  His second wife was actress [[Madhubala]], who had worked with him in many films including his home production ''[[Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi]]'' (1958) and ''Jhumroo'' (1961). When Kumar proposed to her, Madhubala was ill and was planning to go to London for treatment. She had a [[ventricular septal defect]] (hole in the heart), and he was still married to Ruma. After his divorce, the couple had a civil wedding in 1960 and Kishore Kumar [[converted to Islam]] and reportedly changed his name to Karim Abdul.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.firstpost.com/topics/kishore-kumar-54297.html|title=Kishore Kumar|publisher=First Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents refused to attend the ceremony. The couple also had a Hindu ceremony to please Kumar's parents, but Madhubala was never truly accepted as his wife. Within a month of their wedding, she moved back to her bungalow in Bandra because of tension in the Kumar household. They remained married, but under great strain for the remainder of Madhubala's life. Their marriage ended with Madhubala's death on 23 February 1969.&lt;ref name="Khatija1997"&gt;{{cite book | author=Khatija Akbar | title=Madhubala: Her Life, Her Films | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SRlAAAAMAAJ | date=1 January 1997 | publisher=UBS Publishers' Distributors | isbn=978-81-7476-153-8 | page = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kishore's third marriage was to [[Yogeeta Bali]], and lasted from 1976 to 4 August 1978. Kishore was married to [[Leena Chandavarkar]] from 1980 until his death. He had two sons, [[Amit Kumar]] with Ruma, and Sumit Kumar with Leena Chandavarkar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Outlook | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hukvAQAAIAAJ|year=2003 | publisher=Hathway Investments Pvt Ltd | page = 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar is said to have been paranoid about not being paid.&lt;ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987"/&gt; During recordings, he would sing only after his secretary confirmed that the producer had made the payment.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia_kuldip_prankster"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98oct04/book.htm#2|title=A melancholy but life-long prankster|author=Kuldip Dhiman
|publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]|date=4 October 1998|accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, when he discovered that his dues had not been fully paid, he appeared on set with makeup on only one side of his face. When the director questioned him, he replied "Aadha paisa to aadha make-up." (Half make-up for half payment).&lt;ref name="Filmfare_Nov1_1987"/&gt; On the sets of ''[[Bhai-Bhai (1956 film)|Bhai Bhai]]'', Kishore Kumar refused to act because the director M V Raman owed him {{INR}} 5,000. Ashok Kumar persuaded him to do the scene but when the shooting started, Kishore walked a few paces and said, ''Paanch Hazaar Rupaiya'' (five thousand rupees) and did a somersault. After he reached the end of the floor, he left the studio.&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"&gt;{{cite book| last = Valicha| first = Kishore| title = Kishore Kumar: The Definitive Biography| origyear = 1998| year = 1998| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn =0-670-88264-X|page=312
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, when producer R.C. Talwar did not pay his dues in spite of repeated reminders, Kumar arrived at Talwar's residence shouting "''Hey Talwar, de de mere aath hazaar''" ("Hey Talwar, give me my eight thousand") every morning until Talwar paid up.&lt;ref name="tribuneindia_kuldip_prankster"/&gt;

The film ''[[Anand (1971 film)|Anand]]'' (1971) was originally supposed to star Kishore and [[Mehmood Ali]] in the lead.&lt;ref name="hanif_mehmood_moods"&gt;{{cite book| last = Zaveri| first = Hanif| title = Mehmood, a Man of Many Moods| year = 2005| publisher = Popular Prakashan| isbn = 81-7991-213-2| page = 133| chapter = A Comedy King and Superstar
}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hrishikesh Mukherjee]], the director of the film, was asked to meet Kishore to discuss the project. However, when he went to Kumar's house he was driven away by the gatekeeper due to a misunderstanding. Kumar{{mdash}}himself a [[Bengali people|Bengali]]{{mdash}}had not been paid for a stage show organized by another Bengali man and had instructed his gatekeeper to drive away this "Bengali", if he ever visited the house. Consequently, Mehmood had to leave the film as well, and new actors ([[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Amitabh Bachchan]]) were signed up for the film.&lt;ref name="hanif_mehmood_moods"/&gt;

In spite of his "no money, no work" principle, sometimes Kumar recorded free even when the producers were willing to pay. Such films include those produced by [[Rajesh Khanna]] and [[Danny Denzongpa]].&lt;ref name="thehindu_kochi_yodeller"&gt;{{cite news

|work=Metro Plus Kochi|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=16 September 2004|accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, Kishore helped actor-turned-producer [[Bipin Gupta]] by giving him {{INR}} 20,000 for the film ''Dal Mein Kala'' (1964). When actor Arun Kumar Mukherjee{{mdash}}one of the first persons to appreciate Kishore's singing talent{{mdash}}died, Kumar regularly sent money to Mukherjee's family in Bhagalpur.&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/&gt;

Many journalists and writers have written about Kishore Kumar's seemingly eccentric behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2002/feb/18dinesh.htm|title=Kishore Kumar: The Master's Voice|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|access-date=|author=[[Dinesh Raheja]]|accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98oct09/art-trib.htm

|accessdate=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He placed a sign that said "Beware of Kishore" at the door of his [[Warden Road]] flat. Once, producer-director [[H. S. Rawail]], who owed him some money, visited his flat to pay the dues. Kumar took the money and when Rawail offered to shake hands with him, reportedly Kishore put Rawail's hand in his mouth, bit it and asked "Didn’t you see the sign?". Rawail laughed off the incident and left quickly.&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/&gt; According to another reported incident, once Kumar was due to record a song for producer-director [[G. P. Sippy]]. As Sippy approached his bungalow, he saw Kumar going out in his car. Sippy asked Kumar to stop his car but Kumar increased his speed. Sippy chased him to [[Madh Island]] where Kumar finally stopped his car near the ruined [[Madh Fort]]. When Sippy questioned his strange behavior, Kumar refused to recognize or talk to him and threatened to call the police. The next morning, Kumar reported for the recording session. An angry Sippy questioned him about his behaviour the previous day but Kumar said that Sippy must have dreamt the incident and said that he was in Khandwa on the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiafm.com/features/2007/02/01/2191/index.html |title=One evening with Kishore Kumar Khandwewala |publisher=India FM |date=1 February 2007 |accessdate=13 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224435/http://www.indiafm.com/features/2007/02/01/2191/index.html |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, a producer went to court to get a decree that Kumar must follow the director's orders. As a consequence, he obeyed the director to the letter. He refused to alight from his car until the director ordered him to do so. After filming a car scene in Mumbai, Kumar drove until he reached [[Khandala]] because the director forgot to say "Cut".&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/&gt; In the 1960s, a financier named Kalidas Batvabbal, who was disgusted with Kumar's alleged lack of cooperation during the shooting of ''[[Half Ticket]]'', reported to the income tax authorities, who raided his house. Later, Kumar invited Batvabbal to his home, asked him to enter a cupboard for a chat and locked him inside. He unlocked Batvabbal after two hours and told him, "Don't ever come to my house again".&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/&gt;

Kishore Kumar was a loner; in an interview with [[Pritish Nandy]] (1985) he said that he had no friends{{mdash}}he preferred talking to his trees instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = I screamed, pretended to be crazy: Kishore Kumar in 1985 | year = 1985 | url = https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/I-screamed-pretended-to-be-crazy-Kishore-Kumar-in-1985/articleshow/9527820.cms| accessdate = 23 August 2011 | publisher = [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]] (republished in ''The Times of India'') }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once, when a reporter made a comment about how lonely he must be, Kishore Kumar took her to his garden, named some of the trees there and introduced them to the reporter as his closest friends.&lt;ref name="kishore_definitive_bio"/&gt;

'''Oceanic yacht racing''' is one of the most dangerous sports in the world. It was particularly dangerous in the early days when oceanic racing was more like early mountain climbing in terms of sense of adventure and achievement. Modern safety and communication equipment has improved safety however like any sport in natural environment risk is always present. In many races, participants have changed from explorer to professional athlete. {{inc-transport}}

{{For|other men named Afranius|Afrania (gens)}}

'''Lucius Afranius''' was an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] comic poet, who lived at the beginning of the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Smith  | first = William  | author-link = William Smith (lexicographer)  | contribution = Afranius, Lucius (1)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 55  | place = Boston  | year = 1870  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0064.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Life==
Afranius' comedies described Roman scenes and manners (the genre called ''comoediae togatae'') and the subjects were mostly taken from the life of the lower classes (''comoediae tabernariae'').{{sfn|Chishlm|1911}}&lt;ref name="Manuwald2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gesine Manuwald|title=Roman Republican Theatre|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X-ug5st1b_8C&amp;pg=PA263|date=9 June 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49974-3|pages=263–}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were considered by some ancients to be frequently polluted with disgraceful amours, which, according to [[Quintilian]], were only a representation of the conduct of Afranius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Quintilian]], x. 1. § 100&lt;/ref&gt; He depicted, however, Roman life with such accuracy that he is classed with [[Menander]], from whom indeed he borrowed largely.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace]], ''[[Epode#Epodes of Horace|Epodes]]'' ii.1.57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Macrobius]], ''Saturnalia'' vi.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum'' i.3&lt;/ref&gt; He imitated the style of [[Gaius Titius]], and his language is praised by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'' 45&lt;/ref&gt; His comedies are spoken of in the highest terms by the ancient writers, and under the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] they not only continued to be read, but were even acted, of which an example occurs in the time of [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Velleius Paterculus|Vellius Paterculus]], i.17, ii.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius|Gellius]], xiii.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''[[Nero]]'' 11&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have been well known even at the latter end of the 4th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ausonius]], ''Epigr''. 71&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Quintilian's judgement==
The Spanish-Roman teacher of rhetoric [[Quintilian]] wrote of Afranius's plays:&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian 10.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Togātīs excellit Afrānius: utinam non inquināsset argūmenta puerōrum foedīs amōribus, mōrēs suōs fassus.''
:("Afranius excelled in Roman-style comedies: if only he hadn't polluted his plots with unseemly sexual affairs with boys, confessing his own habits.")

Such is the generally accepted interpretation of this sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Fontaine, Michael (2009) ''Funny Words in Plautine Comedy'' (Oxford), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.G.M. Brown, "Afranius, Lucius (1)", in ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'': "his plays included pederastic themes".&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative view is proposed by Welsh (2010),&lt;ref&gt;Welsh, Jarrett T. (2010). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40984742 "Quintilian's Judgement of Afranius"]. ''The Classical Quarterly'', New Series, Vol. 60, No. 1 (May 2010), pp. 118-126.)&lt;/ref&gt; who, noting that there is no trace of pederasty in any of the quoted fragments of Afranius, proposed to translate the sentence "if only he hadn't polluted his plots with disreputable love affairs (conducted) by boys", something which Quintilian perhaps thought unsuited to the moralising tone of Roman comedies.

'''Mahfuz''' (or '''Mohammed''') ({{lang-ar|محفوظ}}, [[Harari language|Harari]]: ማሕፉዝ) (died July 1517) was a [[Harari people|Harari]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hassen|first1=Mohammed|title=Review work Futuh al habasa|journal=International Journal of Ethiopian Studies|page=184|jstor=27828848}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emir]] of the city of [[Harar]], and later a Governor of [[Zeila]] in the [[Adal Sultanate]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bruce|Bruce, James]] ''Harar: The History of Ethiopia's Muslim City'', p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and reign==
Mahfuz led raids into the eastern provinces of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] for a number of years. He selected the season of [[Lent]] for his attacks, when the defenders were weakened by their [[fasting|fasts]]. He was eventually slain in battle during his final offensive, targeting the [[Amhara province|Amhara]], [[Shewa]], and [[Fatagar]] provinces south of the [[Awash River]].

Sources differ over the number of years Mahfuz raided Abyssinia. [[Francisco Álvares]] states that his raids began during the reign of [[Eskender]], and lasted 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Francisco (1961) ''The Prester John of the Indies'', translated by C.F. Beckingham and G.W.B. Huntingford. Cambridge: [[Hakluyt Society]], p. 412.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Beckingham and Huntingford note that the Ethiopian ''Paris Chronicle'', which draws on contemporary Ethiopian records, dates the beginning of these raids to the ascension of [[Dawit II]] (Lebna Dengel) in 1508.&lt;ref&gt;Their discussion of Mahfuz is taken from their Introduction to Alvarez, ''Prester John'', pp. 16f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon reaching majority, Emperor Lebna Dengel decided to forgo his observance of Lent and oppose the Imam in battle, despite the advice and wishes of his councilors and people. He sent spies out to determine Imam Mahfuz's plans for that year, and learning the Imam was in Fatagar led his army there. He found Imam Mahfuz with the sultan of Adal encamped on a plain that was surrounded by mountains. After first sending soldiers out to secure the passes, the Abyssinian Emperor closed upon Imam Mahfuz.

Although Imam Mahfuz managed to enable Sultan Muhammed to escape with but four horsemen, according to Alvarez, Imam Mafhuz knew he was trapped and sought to die with honor. He called to the Abyssinians a challenge to fight in single combat, and Gabra Endreyas, who had been a follower of Emperor Lebna Dengel's father, accepted and killed the Imam. Mahfuz's head was cut from his body and displayed publicly in the Emperor's court.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt; After defeating Mahfuz, [[Dawit II]] used appellation ''Wanag Segad'', which is a combination of [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] and [[Harari language|Harari]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gate|first1=Henry|title=Dictionary of African Biography|date=2 February 2012|publisher=OUP USA|page=482|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA482|isbn=0195382072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Mahfuz' daughter, [[Bati del Wambara]], married Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] of the [[Adal Sultanate]]. Ten years after Mahfuz's death, Al-Ghazi embarked on a [[Abyssinian–Adal war|Conquest of Abyssinia]] (''Futuh al-Habash'').&lt;ref&gt;Sihab ad-Din Ahmad, in his ''Futuh al-Habasa'' (translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst [Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003]) consistently uses the word "Jihad" to refer to Ahmad Gragn's conquest of Ethiopia.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mantis shrimps''', or '''stomatopods''', are marine [[crustacean]]s of the [[order (biology)|order]] '''Stomatopoda'''. Some species have specialised calcified "clubs" which can strike with great power, others have sharp forelimbs used to capture prey. They [[Phylogenetic tree|branched]] from other members of the class [[Malacostraca]] around 400 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Circular polarization vision in a stomatopod crustacean.|journal=Current Biology|volume=18|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.066 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantis shrimps typically grow to around {{convert|10|cm|abbr=off}} in length.

Varieties range from shades of brown to vivid colors, as there are more than 450 species of mantis shrimp. They are among the most important [[Predation|predators]] in many shallow, [[Tropics|tropical]], and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] marine [[habitat]]s. However, despite being common, they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Ross Piper]] |year=2007 |title=Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |isbn=0-313-33922-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In captivity, some larger species can break through [[aquarium]] glass.&lt;ref name=smasher_usatoday&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/columnist/aprilholladay/2006-01-09-shrimp_x.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 1, 2006 |title=Shrimp spring into shattering action |author=April Holladay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Around 400 species of mantis shrimp have currently been discovered worldwide; all living species are in the suborder '''Unipeltata'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Stomatopoda/6299 |title=Stomatopoda |work=[[Tree of Life Web Project]] |date=January 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aggressive and typically solitary sea creatures spend most of their time hiding in rock formations or burrowing intricate passageways in the sea bed. They rarely exit their homes except to feed and relocate, and can be active during the day, [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]], or active primarily at twilight, depending on the species. Unlike most crustaceans, they sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey. Although some live in temperate seas, most species live in tropical and [[subtropics|subtropical]] waters in the [[Indian Ocean|Indian]] and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans between eastern Africa and Hawaii.

==Claws==
[[File:Squilla mantis.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Squilla mantis]]'', showing the spearing appendages]]
[[File:Mantis shrimp from front.jpg|upright|thumb|Mantis shrimp from the front]]
The mantis shrimp's second pair of thoracic appendages has been adapted for powerful close-range combat with high modifications. The appendage differences divide mantis shrimp into two main types: those that hunt by impaling their prey with spear-like structures and those that smash prey with a powerful blow from a heavily mineralised appendage type club. A considerable amount of damage can be inflicted after impact with these robust, hammer-like claws. This club is further divided into three sub-regions: the impact region, the periodic region, and the striated region. Mantis shrimp are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the type of claw they possess:
*''Smashers'' possess a much more developed club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash their meals apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.
*''Spearers'', on the other hand, are armed with spiny appendages topped with barbed tips, used to stab and snag prey.

Both types strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their [[raptorial]] claws at the prey, and can inflict serious damage on victims significantly greater in size than themselves. In smashers, these two weapons are employed with blinding quickness, with an acceleration of 10,400&amp;nbsp;[[g-force|''g'']] (102,000&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or 335,000&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and speeds of {{convert|23|m/s|km/h mph|abbr=on|lk=on}} from a standing start.&lt;ref name="Patek et al"&gt;{{cite journal |author=S.

The impact can also produce [[sonoluminescence]] from the collapsing bubble. This will produce a very small amount of light within the collapsing bubble, although the light is too weak and short-lived to be detected without advanced scientific equipment. The light emission probably has no biological significance but is rather a side-effect of the rapid snapping motion. [[Alpheidae|Pistol shrimp]] produce this effect in a very similar manner.

Smashers use this ability to attack [[snail]]s, [[crab]]s, [[Mollusca|molluscs]], and rock [[oyster]]s, their blunt clubs enabling them to crack the shells of their prey into pieces. Spearers, on the other hand, prefer the meat of softer animals, like [[fish]], which their barbed claws can more easily slice and snag.

The appendages are being studied as a micro-scale analogue for new macro-scale material structures.&lt;ref name=20160601_SD&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Mantis_shrimp_inspires_next_generation_of_ultra_strong_materials_999.html Mantis shrimp inspires next generation of ultra-strong materials], SpaceDaily.com, 1 June 2016, accessed 3 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''N. bredini'', a species with a variety of habitats ranging from a depth of 5 to 10 metres (although it can be found up to 20 m below the surface), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance was not as pronounced as in ''N. wennerae'', a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity.

[[File:Mantis Shrimp Eyes.JPG|thumb|Closeup of a mantis shrimp showing the structure of the eyes]] 
Each [[compound eye]] is made up of up tens of thousands [[ommatidium|ommatidia]], clusters of photoreceptor cells.&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt; Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the ''midband''. The number of omatidial rows in the midband ranges from 2 to 6.&lt;ref name="PTRSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt; This divides the eye into three regions. This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye. In other words, each eye possesses trinocular vision and therefore [[depth perception]]. The upper and lower hemispheres are used primarily for recognition of form and motion, like the eyes of many other crustaceans.&lt;ref name="PTRSB"/&gt;

Mantis shrimp can perceive wavelengths of light ranging from [[Ultraviolet#Subtypes|deep ultraviolet]] (UVB) to [[far-red]] (300 to 720 [[nanometre]]s) and [[Polarization (waves)|polarized light]].&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorn|first1=Hanne H.|last2=How|first2=Martin J.|last3=Chiou|first3=Tsyr-Huei|last4=Marshall|first4=Nicholas Justin|title=A Different Form of Color Vision in Mantis Shrimp|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=January 24, 2014|volume=334|issue=6169|pages=411–413|doi=10.1126/science.1245824|bibcode=2014Sci...343..411T}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mantis shrimp in the superfamilies Gonodactyloidea, Lysiosquilloidea and Hemisquilloidea, the midband is made up of six omatodial rows.

There are 12 types of photoreceptor cells in rows 1 to 4, four of which detect ultraviolet light.&lt;ref name="PTRSB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Best eyes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Nicholas Justin|last2=Oberwinkler|first2=Johannes|title=Ultraviolet vision: the colourful world of the mantis shrimp|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|date=October 28, 1999|volume=401|pages=873–874|doi=10.1038/44751|pmid=10553902|issue=6756|bibcode=1999Natur.401..873M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490 to 550 nm.&lt;ref name=OP30&gt;{{cite journal |title=The molecular genetics and evolution of colour and polarization vision in stomatopod crustaceans.|journal=Ophthalmic Physiology|volume=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rows 5 to 6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment, the ninth class, and are specialised for polarization vision.

The species ''[[Gonodactylus smithii]]'' is the only organism known to simultaneously detect the four linear and two circular polarisation components required to measure all four [[Stokes parameters]], which yield a full description of polarisation.

This is achieved by rotational eye movements to maximise the polarisation contrast between the object in focus and its background. Since each eye moves independently from the other, it creates two separate streams of visual information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/mantis-shrimp-have-perfected-eye-roll-better-see-things-we-cant-even-imagine-480162|title=Mantis shrimp have perfected the eye roll to see things we can’t imagine|date=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The midband covers only about 5 to 10 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] of the visual field at any given instant, but, like most crustaceans, mantis shrimps' eyes are mounted on stalks. In mantis shrimps the movement of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven up to 70° in all possible axes of movement by eight eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups. By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes, and landscape which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemisphere of the eye. They can also track moving objects using large, rapid eye movements where the two eyes move independently. By combining different techniques, including movements in the same direction, the midband can cover a very wide range of the visual field.

The huge diversity seen in mantis shrimp photoreceptors likely comes from ancient gene duplication events.&lt;ref name=OP30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Complexity in the Visual Systems of Stomatopods: Insights from Transcriptomics.|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=53|doi=10.1093/icb/ict060}}&lt;/ref&gt; One interesting consequence of this duplication is the lack of correlation between opsin transcript number and physiologically expressed photoreceptors.&lt;ref name=OP30/&gt; One species may have 6 different opsin genes, but only express one spectrally distinct photoreceptor. Over the years, some mantis shrimp species have lost the ancestral phenotype, although some still maintain 16 distinct photoreceptors and 4 light filters. Species that live in a variety of photic environments have high selective pressure for photoreceptor diversity, and maintain ancestral phenotypes better than species that live in murky waters or are primarily nocturnal.&lt;ref name=OP30/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evolution of anatomical and physiological specialisation in the compound eyes of stomatopod crustaceans.|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|volume=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggested advantages of visual system===
[[File:Pseudosquilla.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Close-up of the trinocular vision of ''[[Pseudosquilla ciliata]]'']]
What advantage sensitivity to polarisation confers is unclear; however, polarisation vision is used by other animals for sexual signaling and secret communication that avoids the attention of predators. This mechanism could provide an evolutionary advantage; it only requires small changes to the cell in the eye and could be easily [[Natural selection|selected for]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2009/6591.html Bristol University: Mantis shrimps could show us the way to a better DVD, 25 October 2009].

The eyes of mantis shrimp may enable them to recognise different types of coral, prey species (which are often transparent or semi-transparent), or predators, such as [[barracuda]], which have shimmering scales. Alternatively, the manner in which mantis shrimp hunt (very rapid movements of the claws) may require very accurate ranging information, which would require accurate depth perception.

During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively [[fluoresce]], and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C. H. Mazel |author2=T. W. Cronin |author3=R. L. Caldwell |author4=N. J. Marshall |year=2004 |title=Fluorescent enhancement of signaling in a mantis shrimp |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=303 |issue=5654 |page=51 |doi=10.1126/science.1089803 |pmid=14615546}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females are only fertile during certain phases of the [[Tide|tidal cycle]]; the ability to perceive the [[lunar phase|phase of the moon]] may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore.

It has been suggested that the capacity to see UV light enables observation of otherwise hard-to-detect prey on coral reefs.&lt;ref name= "Science 6UV"/&gt;

Research also shows their visual experience of colours is not very different from humans'. The eyes are actually a mechanism that operates at the level of individual cones and makes the brain more efficient. This system allows visual information to be preprocessed by the eyes instead of the brain, which would otherwise have to be larger to deal with the stream of raw data and thus require more time and energy. While the eyes themselves are complex and not yet fully understood, the principle of the system appears to be simple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/mantis-shrimp-s-super-colour-vision-debunked-1.14578 Mantis shrimp's super colour vision debunked]. Nature.com (2014-01-23). Retrieved on 2015-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in function to the human eye but works in the opposite manner. In the human brain, the inferior temporal cortex has a huge amount of colour-specific neurons which process visual impulses from the eyes to create colourful experiences. The mantis shrimp instead uses the different types of photoreceptors in its eyes to perform the same function as the human brain neurons, resulting in a hardwired and more efficient system for an animal that requires rapid colour identification. Humans have fewer types of photoreceptors, but more colour-tuned neurons, while mantis shrimps appears to have fewer colour neurons and more classes of photoreceptors.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen L. Macknik (March 20, 2014) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140322121558/http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/2014/03/20/shrimp_v_human/ Parallels Between Mantis Shrimp and Human Color Vision].

An October 2014 publication by researchers from the [[University of Queensland]] stated that the compound eyes of mantis shrimp can detect cancer and the activity of [[neuron]]s, because they are sensitive to detecting polarised light that reflects differently from cancerous and healthy tissue. The study claims that this ability can be replicated through a camera through the use of aluminium nanowires to replicate polarisation-filtering microvilli on top of photodiodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2014|author1=T.

It allows the manipulation of light across the structure rather than through its depth, the typical way polarisers work. This allows the structure to be both small and microscopically thin, and still be able to produce big, bright, colourful polarised signals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2016/february/mantis-shrimp.html New type of optical material discovered in the secret language of the mantis shrimp].

==Behaviour==
[[File:MantisShrimpLyd.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of a mantis shrimp by [[Richard Lydekker]], 1896]]
Mantis shrimp are long-lived and exhibit complex behaviour, such as ritualised fighting. Some species use [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] patterns on their bodies for signalling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioural signals. They can learn and remember well, and are able to recognise individual neighbours with whom they frequently interact. They can recognise them by visual signs and even by individual smell. Many have developed complex social behaviour to defend their space from rivals.

In a lifetime, they can have as many as 20 or 30 breeding episodes. Depending on the species, the eggs can be laid and kept in a burrow, or they can be carried around under the female's tail until they hatch. Also depending on the species, male and female may come together only to mate, or they may bond in [[monogamous]] long-term relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sharing the job: monogamy and parental care |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/aquarius/monogamy.html |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the monogamous species, the mantis shrimp remain with the same partner for up to 20&amp;nbsp;years. They share the same burrow and may be able to coordinate their activities. Both sexes often take care of the eggs (biparental care). In ''[[Pullosquilla]]'' and some species in ''[[Nannosquilla]]'', the female will lay two clutches of eggs: one that the male tends and one that the female tends. In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them. After the eggs hatch, the offspring may spend up to three months as [[plankton]].

Although stomatopods typically display the standard types of movement seen in [[shrimp|true shrimp]] and [[lobster]]s, one species, ''[[Nannosquilla decemspinosa]]'', has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel. The species lives in shallow, sandy areas. At low tides, ''N. decemspinosa'' is often stranded by its short rear legs, which are sufficient for movement when the body is supported by water, but not on dry land. The mantis shrimp then performs a forward flip in an attempt to roll towards the next tide pool. ''N. decemspinosa'' has been observed to roll repeatedly for {{convert|2|m|ft}}, but specimens typically travel less than {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Caldwell, Roy L. |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=282 |pages=71–73 |year=1979 |title=A unique form of locomotion in a stomatopod&amp;nbsp;– backward somersaulting |doi=10.1038/282071a0 |issue=5734|bibcode= 1979Natur.282...71C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culinary uses==
[[File:Hai san Hau Loc05.JPG|thumb|left|Mantis shrimp caught at [[Hậu Lộc District|Hậu Lộc]], [[Thanh Hóa]], [[Vietnam]]]]
In [[Japanese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp species ''[[Oratosquilla oratoria]]'', called {{nihongo|''shako''|蝦蛄}}, is eaten boiled as a [[sushi]] topping and, occasionally, raw as [[sashimi]].

Mantis shrimp are abundant in the coastal regions of south [[Vietnam]], known in Vietnamese as ''tôm tít'', or ''tôm tech''. In regions such as Nha Trang, they are called "bàn chải", named for its resemblance to a scrub brush. The shrimp can be steamed, boiled, grilled or dried, used with [[black pepper|pepper]], salt and [[lime (fruit)|lime]], [[fish sauce]] and [[tamarind]], or [[fennel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinhduong.com.vn/story/tom-tit-ac-san-mien-song-nuoc |title=Tôm tít&amp;nbsp;– Đặc sản miền sông nước |date=October 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 8, 2011 |language=Vietnamese |publisher=Dinh dưỡng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cantonese cuisine]], the mantis shrimp is known as "pissing shrimp" ({{zh|c=瀨尿蝦|p=lài niào xiā|j=laaih niu hā}}) because of their tendency to shoot a jet of water when picked up. After cooking, their flesh is closer to that of [[lobster]]s than that of [[shrimp]], and like lobsters, their shells are quite hard and require some pressure to crack. Usually they are deep fried with garlic and chili peppers.

In the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] countries the mantis shrimp ''[[Squilla mantis]]'' is a common seafood, especially on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coasts ([[canocchia]]) and the [[Gulf of Cádiz]] (galera).

In the [[Philippines]], the mantis shrimp is known as tatampal, hipong-dapa, or alupihang-dagat, and is cooked and eaten like any other shrimp.

In [[Hawaii]], some mantis shrimp have grown unusually large in the very dirty water of the Grand [[Ala Wai Canal]] in [[Waikiki]]. The usual dangers associated with consuming seafood caught in contaminated waters still applies to mantis shrimp.&lt;ref name=Hawaii/&gt;

==Aquaria==
[[File:OdontodactylusScyllarus.jpg|thumb|A colourful stomatopod, the [[Odontodactylus scyllarus|peacock mantis shrimp]] (''[[Odontodactylus scyllarus]]''), seen in the [[Andaman Sea]] off [[Thailand]]]]
Some saltwater aquarists keep stomatopods in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reefkeeping.com/issues/2004-03/jf/feature/index.php A Load of Learnin' About Mantis Shrimps], by James Fatherree, in [http://www.reefkeeping.com/joomla/index.php/reefkeeping-blog ReefKeeping] online magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Odontodactylus scyllarus|peacock mantis]] is especially colourful and desired in the trade.

While some aquarists value mantis shrimp, others consider them harmful pests, because:

*They are voracious predators, eating other desirable inhabitants of the tank,
*Some of the largest species can break aquarium glass by striking it
*Some rock-burrowing species can do more damage to [[live rock]] than the fishkeeper would prefer

The live rock with mantis shrimp burrows are actually considered useful by some in the [[marine aquarium]] trade and are often collected. It is not uncommon for a piece of live rock to convey a live mantis shrimp into an aquarium. Once inside the tank, they may feed on fish and other inhabitants. They are notoriously difficult to catch when established in a well-stocked tank,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nick Dakin |year=2004 |title=The Marine Aquarium |publisher=London: Andromeda |isbn=1-902389-67-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there are accounts of them breaking glass tanks. While stomatopods do not eat coral, smashers can damage it if they try to make a home within it.&lt;ref name=smasher_usatoday/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5925">The '''Mars Gravity Biosatellite''' was a project initiated as a competition between universities in 2001 by the [[Mars Society]]. The aim was to build a spacecraft concept to study the effects of Mars-level gravity (~0.38g) on mammals. 

Presentations were given to [[Robert Zubrin]] ([[Mars Society]]), and the award for best design was given to The [[University of Washington]] (UW). The UW team continued to develop the concept until the end of the school year (June 2002), after which funding became an issue. The team from UW contacted members of the team that presented from MIT, and the two universities agreed to continue development together. Later [[University of Queensland]] – Australia (UQ) joined the team as well. The program ended in 2009.

==Program history and overview==
The Mars Gravity Biosatellite program began in 2001 as a [[Mars Society]] initiative called Translife that grew out of a discussion between [[Robert Zubrin]] and [[Elon Musk]].  It was intended to study the effects of the [[gravity of Mars]] (about one-third that of Earth) on [[mammals]], for which no data was available.  Over the next few years, the program grew both scope and vision, with staff and students from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] ([[Payload (air and space craft)|Payload]]), [[University of Washington|UW]] ([[Satellite bus|Spacecraft Bus]]) and [[University of Queensland|UQ]] ([[Atmospheric reentry|Reentry]]) collaboratively designing various parts of the mission concept.  With ongoing funding challenges, UW and UQ withdrew after several years and [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] stepped in to build on their design work.  The effort represented the most ambitious and complex student satellite project to date.

The mission concept was envisioned to carry 15 mice in low Earth orbit for five weeks. The satellite was designed to spin at approximately 32 rpm&lt;ref name="iac07"&gt;Korzun, Ashley M.; Wagner, Erika B.; et al. (2007). [http://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/1853/26717/1/IAC-07-A1.9.-A2.7.05.pdf Mars Gravity Biosatellite: Engineering, Science, and Education]. 58th [[International Astronautical Congress]].&lt;/ref&gt; to generate [[centrifugal force]] that they would experience as gravity on the surface of [[Mars]]. At the end of its mission, the satellite would reenter Earth's atmosphere and its cargo of mice would be retrieved. In 2007, a tentative launch date for the Mars Gravity Biosatellite had been set for 2010 or 2011, as the primary payload on a Falcon&amp;nbsp;1E or a Minotaur&amp;nbsp;IV launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;ref name="iac07"/&gt; 

In 2005, the involved universities received a $200,000 NASA advanced projects development grant to support the development of a full payload engineering model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/1625-nasa-grant-energizes-student-developed-mars-project.html NASA Grant Energizes Student-Developed Mars Project].  Leonard David, ''Space''. September 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the students of Mars Gravity developed a novel [[microfinancing]] platform called Your Name Into Space. This was meant to help finance the development of their spacecraft.  This initiative is designed to give individuals and corporations the opportunity to fly images of their choice into orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Name Into Space |url=http://www.yournameintospace.org/ |website=archive.org |accessdate=22 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221055613/http://www.yournameintospace.org/ |archivedate=February 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the program's end in 2009, the project had engaged over 600 undergraduate, graduate, and high school students in aerospace engineering, space life sciences, and program management. Over 20 conference presentations and papers were published, earning multiple student awards.&lt;ref name=closing&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mars Gravity Biosatellite Program Is Closing Down|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=31612|website=spaceref.com|accessdate=22 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24&amp;nbsp;June 2009, a status report was released declaring the end of this program, due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.&lt;ref name=closing /&gt;

==Science==
{{further|Effect of spaceflight on the human body|Space medicine}}
[[Gravity of Mars|Gravity on Mars]] is only about 38% as strong as it is on Earth, and the long-term effects of such reduced gravity are unknown. Astronauts who are weightless for long periods of time lose significant amounts of bone and muscle mass. It is unclear if the gravity on Mars is strong enough to avoid or minimize these health problems. The Mars Gravity Biosatellite was meant to provide data on how mammalian health is affected by long-term exposure to lower levels of gravity, focusing on bone loss, changes in bone structure, [[muscle atrophy]], and changes in the [[inner ear]]. The results from the five-week mission experiment would have been compared against a variety of Earth-based controls, including vivarium, hindlimb suspension, partial weight suspension, flight habitat effects, and short-radius centrifuge testing.&lt;ref name="iac07"/&gt;

'''Nanny''' is the name of a fictional [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character appears in [[X-Men]] and related titles.

==Publication history==
Nanny first appeared in ''X-Factor'' #30 (July 1988), and was created by [[Louise Simonson|Louise]] and [[Walt Simonson]].

==Fictional character biography==
Nanny was once a scientist employed by the [[Right (comics)|Right]] in the field of [[cyborg]] technology. When she discovered the Right's anti-mutant agenda, she attempted to stop them, but was sealed in one of her cyborg designs, an egg-shaped armored suit; she escaped their custody, but the ordeal left her borderline insane. At some later date, she rescued a young mutant named Peter, crafted a battle suit for him and christened him the [[Orphan-Maker]]. She also obtained (possibly self-manufactured) high-tech weaponry and a flying craft form Dr Tommy Wolf, a dwarf working for Hydra.

Nanny and her Orphan-Maker became a pair of would-be saviors of mutant children, with Nanny as the brains and guiding force and Orphan-Maker as the brawn. In her addled state, Nanny believes that parents of mutant children are evil, especially those who abandon their children, or at the very least too incompetent and ill-equipped to properly raise young mutants and protect them from danger and exploitation. She and Orphan-Maker travel the world, searching for young mutants to take care of, murdering their parents to sever any family connections, and using her minor telepathic powers to control them. Nanny dubbed these children her "Lost Boys and Girls", after the Lost Boys from the story of [[Peter Pan]]; as a result her psychosis, Nanny developed a near-obsession with children's tales and nursery rhymes, often quoting passages from them when she feels they are appropriate to the situation at hand.

Nanny’s first major child-snatching raid is at the State Home for Foundlings in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], secretly a facility where [[Mister Sinister]] keeps mutant children for observation and experimentation. Nanny and her crew sought to "liberate" several of the mutant children into her own custody, but were opposed by [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], there to retrieve the former's [[Cable (comics)|son]], who was being held there at the time. In the course of the battle, Marvel Girl discovers that two of Nanny's "lost" children are in fact her sister's children, who had been missing for some time. Thwarted by Cyclops and Marvel Girl, as well as demons in the service of [[N'astirh]] (there to acquire mutant children to use as sacrifices), Nanny flees with her Orphan-Maker and "Lost" children in tow; Marvel Girl is forced to let her niece and nephew go with Nanny to pursue the demons who had taken Nathan Christopher. This initial appearance of Nanny gives the heroes the impression that she and the Orphan-Maker are [[robot|robots]].{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

Later, Nanny and the Orphan-Maker attack the [[X-Men]] in their Australian outback-town headquarters in an effort to save them. Nanny seals [[Psylocke]], [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Dazzler]], and [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] in battle suits and mentally regresses them to childlike behavior. She confronts [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]], who is secretly living in the town, but evades capture. The tide of battle turns and Nanny and the Orphan-Maker flee in their ship. [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] pursues and is caught by the ship's appendages. After being freed from his battle suit, a confused Havok unleashes his plasma blast on the ship, seemingly killing Nanny, the Orphan-Maker, and Storm.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' 248&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Nanny deploys a decoy ship containing a [[Life Model Decoy]] that appears to be Storm's corpse.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Nanny then regresses Storm's body to that of a child.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Storm escapes, but with her memories of her adult life blurred and her childhood persona dominant.{{issue|date=January 2013}} With the aid of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]], Storm regains her adult memories and defeats Nanny and the Orphan-Maker, sending the cyborg duo and their ship crashing into a swamp.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Nanny reappears much later in ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]''. In the course of acquiring another child, the Orphan-Maker's armor begins to malfunction; Nanny determines that his (still unrevealed) mutant power is growing stronger, and she has to create new armor to contain it. She later sends the Orphan-Maker to protect a deformed child trapped in a schoolhouse by a mob believing him to be a mutant. This brings them into conflict with the Generation X team, who have the same goal. The heroes protect the mob and the boy's parents from the Orphan-Maker's violent methods. After the situation ends with an innocent death, Orphan-Maker escapes in a technologically advanced vehicle disguised as an ice-cream truck.{{Issue|date=April 2010}}

It was revealed in the ''[[Slingers (Marvel Comics)|Slingers]]'' series that Nanny and the Orphan-Maker were responsible for killing [[Ricochet (comics)#Ricochet (Johnny Gallo)|Ricochet]]'s mother.{{Issue|date=April 2010}} They battle with Wolverine after trying to orphan [[Trance (comics)|Trance]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]'' Killing Made Simple&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Nanny's mutant power is a type of low-level telepathy/mind control, which she enhances by projecting a chemical "pixie dust" at her victims. By unknown means, Nanny can regress the bodies of adult mutants to those of children. She can also mentally regress adults to a childlike mindset, or maintain that mindset in children despite their physically continuing to age.

Nanny is encased within a battle suit of her own design, an egg-shaped suit of armor that is capable of flight, teleportation, producing a repulsor field, and firing rockets, as well as possessing an inbuilt machine pistol.

[[File:Portrait Gandhi.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi|Mohandas Gandhi]], often considered a founder of the nonviolence movement, spread the concept of [[ahimsa]] through his movements and writings, which then inspired other nonviolent activists.]]

'''Nonviolence'''&lt;!-- Don't put back the ridiculous claim back that the English word comes from Sanskrit; it's not even a calque or loan translation. The influence of Indian philosophy on the West is denigrated by such unencyclopedic nonsense.--&gt; is the personal practice of being harmless to self and others under every condition.  It comes from the belief that hurting people, animals or the environment is unnecessary to achieve an outcome and refers to a general philosophy of abstention from violence. This may be based on moral, religious or spiritual principles, or it may be for purely strategic or pragmatic reasons.&lt;ref&gt;A clarification of this and related terms appears in [[Gene Sharp]], ''Sharp's Dictionary of Power and Struggle: Language of Civil Resistance in Conflicts'', Oxford University Press, New York, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence also has 'active' or 'activist' elements, in that believers generally accept the need for nonviolence as a means to achieve political and [[social change]]. Thus, for example, the Tolstoy and Gandhian non violence is a philosophy and strategy for social change that rejects the use of [[violence]], but at the same time sees [[nonviolent action]] (also called [[civil resistance]]) as an alternative to passive acceptance of oppression or armed struggle against it. In general, advocates of an activist philosophy of nonviolence use diverse methods in their campaigns for social change, including critical forms of education and persuasion, mass noncooperation, [[civil disobedience]], nonviolent [[direct action]], and social, political, cultural and economic forms of intervention.

The term "nonviolence" is often linked with or used as a synonym for peace, and despite being frequently equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Peter and Jack DuVall (2001) "A Force More Powerful: A Century of Non-Violent Conflict"(Palgrave Macmillan)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonviolence refers specifically to the absence of violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing.  Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, harmlessness and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, Introduction, in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009 [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s pp. 3 and 13-20.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
{{Expand-section|date=October 2017}}
Nonviolence or ''Ahimsa'' is one of the cardinal virtues&lt;ref name=evpc/&gt; and an important tenet of [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Buddhism]]. It is a multidimensional concept,&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K. R. Sundararajan and Bithika Mukerji Ed. (1997), Hindu spirituality: Postclassical and modern, {{ISBN|978-81-208-1937-5}}; see Chapter 20, pages 392–417&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by the premise that all living beings have the spark of the divine spiritual energy; therefore, to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. It has also been related to the notion that any violence has [[Karma|karmic]] consequences. While ancient scholars of Hinduism pioneered and over time perfected the principles of ''Ahimsa'', the concept reached an extraordinary status in the ethical philosophy of Jainism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0-12-373985-8}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701–849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chapple1990&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Nonviolence to animals, earth and self in Asian Traditions (see Chapter 1). State University of New York Press (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Parsvanatha]], the twenty-third ''[[tirthankara]]'' of Jainism, revived,  advocated for and preached the concept of nonviolence in around eighth-century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Parshvanatha |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Parshvanatha |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mahavira]], the twenty-fourth and the last ''tirthankara'' further strengthened the idea in sixth-century BC; which was believed to be founded by the first tirthankara [[Rishabhanatha|Rushabhdev]] over a million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Mahavira |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mahavira-Jaina-teacher |work=britannica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=SXgEfiNY46sC&amp;pg=PA271&amp;dq=Rushabhdev+million#v=onepage&amp;q=Rushabhdev%20million&amp;f=false | title=Thoughts from the Cosmic Field in the Life of a Thinking Insect &amp;#91;A Latter-Day Saint&amp;#93;| isbn=9781606938461| last1=Patel| first1=Haresh| date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms==
Advocates of nonviolent action believe cooperation and consent are the roots of civil or political power: all regimes, including bureaucratic institutions, financial institutions, and the armed segments of society (such as the military and police); depend on compliance from citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = Porter Sargent | year = 1973 | page = 12 | isbn = 978-0-87558-068-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a national level, the strategy of nonviolent action seeks to undermine the power of rulers by encouraging people to withdraw their consent and cooperation. The forms of nonviolence draw inspiration from both religious or ethical beliefs and political analysis. Religious or ethically based nonviolence is sometimes referred to as ''principled,'' ''philosophical,'' or ''ethical'' nonviolence, while nonviolence based on political analysis is often referred to as ''tactical,'' ''strategic,'' or ''pragmatic'' nonviolent action. Commonly, both of these dimensions may be present within the thinking of particular movements or individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nv2.htm Two Kinds of Nonviolent Resistance] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--[[Gene Sharp]], in his book ''The Politics of Non-violent Action,'' suggests that the absence of nonviolent action from mainstream historical study is because elite interests are not served by the dissemination of techniques for social struggle that rely on the collective power of a mobilized citizenry rather than on access to wealth or weaponry. This does not seem to fit in any of the established sections, but it is a good point. --&gt;

===Pragmatic===
The fundamental concept of ''pragmatic'' (''tactical'' or ''strategic'') nonviolent action is to create a social dynamic or political movement that can create a national or international dialogue which effects social change without necessarily winning over those who wish to maintain the status quo.&lt;ref name="CRMV"&gt;[http://www.crmvet.org/info/nvpower.htm Nonviolent Resistance &amp; Political Power] ~ Civil Rights Movement Veterans (U.S.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicolas Walter]] noted the idea that nonviolence might work "runs under the surface of Western political thought without ever quite disappearing".&lt;ref name="nw"&gt;Nicolas Walter, "Non-Violent Resistance:Men Against War". Reprinted
in Nicolas Walter, ''Damned Fools in Utopia'' edited by [[David Goodway]]. PM Press 2010.
{{ISBN|160486222X}} (pp. 37-78).&lt;/ref&gt; Walter noted [[Étienne de La Boétie]]'s ''[[Discourse on Voluntary Servitude]]'' (sixteenth century) and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|P.B. Shelley's]] ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'' (1819) contain arguments for resisting tyranny without using violence.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt; In 1838, [[William Lloyd Garrison]] helped
found the [[Non-Resistance Society|New England Non-Resistance Society]], a society devoted to achieving racial and gender equality through the rejection of all violent actions.&lt;ref name="nw" /&gt;

In modern industrial democracies, nonviolent action has been used extensively by political sectors without mainstream political power such as labor, peace, environment and women's movements. Lesser known is the role that nonviolent action has played and continues to play in undermining the power of repressive political regimes in the developing world and the former eastern bloc. Susan Ives emphasizes this point by quoting [[Walter Wink]]: {{Quotation|"In 1989, thirteen nations comprising 1,695,000,000 people experienced nonviolent revolutions that succeeded beyond anyone's wildest expectations ... If we add all the countries touched by major nonviolent actions in our century (the Philippines, South Africa ... the independence movement in India ...), the figure reaches 3,337,400,000, a staggering 65% of humanity! All this in the teeth of the assertion, endlessly repeated, that nonviolence doesn't work in the 'real' world."|Walter Wink|Christian theologian&lt;ref name=Ives2001/&gt;}}

As a technique for social struggle, nonviolent action has been described as "the politics of ordinary people", reflecting its historically mass-based use by populations throughout the world and history.

Movements most often associated with nonviolence are the [[Non-cooperation movement|non-cooperation campaign]] for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the [[United States]], and the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]].

Also of primary significance is the notion that just means are the most likely to lead to just ends. When Gandhi said that "the means may be likened to the seed, the end to a tree," he expressed the philosophical kernel of what some refer to as ''[[prefigurative politics]]''. Martin Luther King, a student of Gandhian nonviolent resistance, concurred with this tenet, concluding that "nonviolence demands that the means we use must be as pure as the ends we seek." Proponents of nonviolence reason that the actions taken in the present inevitably re-shape the social order in like form. They would argue, for instance, that it is fundamentally irrational to use violence to achieve a peaceful society.

People have come to use nonviolent methods of struggle from a wide range of perspectives and traditions. A landless peasant in Brazil may nonviolently occupy a parcel of land for purely practical motivations. If they do not, the family will starve. A Buddhist monk in Thailand may "ordain" trees in a threatened forest, drawing on the teachings of Buddha to resist its destruction. A waterside worker in England may go on strike in socialist and union political traditions. All the above are using nonviolent methods but from different standpoints. Likewise, secular political movements have utilized nonviolent methods, either as a tactical tool or as a strategic program on purely pragmatic and strategic levels, relying on their political effectiveness rather than a claim to any religious, moral or ethical worthiness.
[[File:Salt March.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Gandhi used the weapon of nonviolence against [[British Raj]]]]

Respect or love for opponents also has a pragmatic justification, in that the technique of separating the deeds from the doers allows for the possibility of the doers changing their behaviour, and perhaps their beliefs. Martin Luther King wrote, "Nonviolent resistance... avoids not only external physical violence but also internal violence of spirit. The nonviolent resister not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he also refuses to hate him."&lt;ref name="Jr.2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Luther King, Jr.|authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr.|title=Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnJ1NY5mbXEC&amp;pg=PT114|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-0070-0|page=114|date=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the notion of ''[[Satya]]'', or Truth, is central to the Gandhian conception of nonviolence. Gandhi saw Truth as something that is multifaceted and unable to be grasped in its entirety by any one individual. All carry pieces of the Truth, he believed, but all need the pieces of others’ truths in order to pursue the greater Truth. This led him to believe in the inherent worth of dialogue with opponents, in order to understand motivations. On a practical level, the willingness to listen to another's point of view is largely dependent on reciprocity. In order to be heard by one's opponents, one must also be prepared to listen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Nonviolence has obtained a level of institutional recognition and endorsement at the global level. On November 10, 1998, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly proclaimed the first decade of the 21st century and the third millennium, the years 2001 to 2010, as the International [[Decade for the Promotion of a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World]].

===Ethical===
For many, practicing nonviolence goes deeper than abstaining from violent behavior or words. It means overriding the impulse to be hateful and holding love for everyone, even those with whom one strongly disagrees. In this view, because violence is learned, it is necessary to unlearn violence by practicing love and compassion at every possible opportunity.  For some, the commitment to non-violence entails a belief in restorative or [[transformative justice]], an abolition of the death penalty and other harsh punishments.  This may involve the necessity of caring for those who are violent.

Nonviolence, for many, involves a respect and reverence for all [[Sentience#Animal rights and sentience|sentient]], and perhaps even [[Biocentrism (ethics)|non-sentient, beings]]. This might include [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionism]] against animals as property, the practice of not eating animal products or by-products ([[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]]), spiritual practices of [[Ahimsa|non-harm]] to all beings, and caring for the rights of all beings. [[Mohandas Gandhi]], [[James Bevel]], and other nonviolent proponents advocated vegetarianism as part of their nonviolent philosophy. [[Ahimsa#Buddhism|Buddhists extend this respect for life]] to [[animals]], [[plants]], and even [[minerals]], while [[Ahimsa#Jainism|Jainism]] extend this respect for [[life]] to [[animals]], [[plants]] and even small organisms such as [[insects]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/features/animal-vegetable-mineral-the-making-of-buddhist-texts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.uwec.edu/ivogeler/w111/articles/jainism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical Indian text of [[Tirukkuṛaḷ]] deals with the ethics of non-violence or non-harming through verses 311-320 in Chapter 32 of [[Aram (Kural book)|Book 1]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=2014-12-16 }} verses 311-320&lt;/ref&gt; further discussing [[compassion]] in Chapter 25 (verses 241-250), [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] in Chapter 26 (verses 251-260), and [[non-killing]] in Chapter 33 (verses 321-330).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

===Religious===
====Hinduism====

=====Ancient Vedic texts=====
Ahimsa as an ethical concept evolved in Vedic texts.&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walli, Koshelya: ''The Conception of Ahimsa in Indian Thought'', Varanasi 1974, p. 113–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest scripts, along with discussing ritual animal sacrifices, indirectly mention Ahimsa, but do not emphasise it. Over time, the Hindu scripts revise ritual practices and the concept of Ahimsa is increasingly refined and emphasised, ultimately Ahimsa becomes the highest virtue by the late Vedic era (about 500 BC). For example, hymn 10.22.25 in the Rig Veda uses the words [[Satya]] (truthfulness) and Ahimsa in a prayer to deity Indra;&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit: अस्मे ता त इन्द्र सन्तु '''सत्याहिंस'''न्तीरुपस्पृशः । विद्याम यासां भुजो धेनूनां न वज्रिवः ॥१३॥ [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.२२ Rigveda 10.22] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English: Unto Tähtinen (1964), Non-violence as an Ethical Principle, Turun Yliopisto, Finland, PhD Thesis, pages 23–25; {{oclc|4288274}};&lt;br&gt;For other occurrence of Ahimsa in Rigveda, see [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_५.६४ Rigveda 5.64.3], [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१.१४१ Rigveda 1.141.5];&lt;/ref&gt; later, the [[Yajurveda|Yajur Veda]] dated to be between 1000 BC and 600 BC, states, "may all beings look at me with a friendly eye, may I do likewise, and may we look at each other with the eyes of a friend".&lt;ref name=chapple1990/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html To do no harm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017133837/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-39.html |date=2013-10-17 }} Project Gutenberg, see translation for Yajurveda 36.18 VE;&lt;br&gt;For other occurrences of Ahimsa in Vedic literature, see [https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/150/mode/2up A Vedic Concordance] [[Maurice Bloomfield]], Harvard University Press, page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Ahimsa'' appears in the text [[Taittiriya Shakha]] of the [[Yajurveda]] (TS 5.2.8.7), where it refers to non-injury to the sacrificer himself.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; It occurs several times in the ''[[Shatapatha Brahmana]]'' in the sense of "non-injury".&lt;ref&gt;Shatapatha Brahmana 2.3.4.30; 2.5.1.14; 6.3.1.26; 6.3.1.39.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahimsa doctrine is a late Vedic era development in Brahmanical culture.&lt;ref name="houben 1999"&gt;Henk M. Bodewitz in Jan E. M. Houben, K. R. van Kooij, ed., ''Violence denied: violence, non-violence and the rationalisation of violence in "South Asian" cultural history.'' BRILL, 1999 page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to the idea of non-violence to animals ("pashu-Ahimsa"), apparently in a moral sense, is in the Kapisthala Katha Samhita of the Yajurveda (KapS 31.11), which may have been written in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowker states the word appears but is uncommon in the principal Upanishads.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowker, ''Problems of suffering in religions of the world.'' Cambridge University Press, 1975, page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Kaneda gives examples of the word ''Ahimsa'' in these Upanishads.&lt;ref name=kaneda2008&gt;Kaneda, T. (2008). Shanti, peacefulness of mind. C. Eppert &amp; H. Wang (Eds.), Cross cultural studies in curriculum: Eastern thought, educational insights, pages 171–192, {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5673-6}}, Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars&lt;ref name=arapura&gt;John Arapura in K.

Empathy for Pain in Vedic Ritual. Journal of the International College for Advanced Buddhist Studies, 12, 78&lt;/ref&gt; suggest ''Ahimsa'' as an ethical concept that started evolving in the Vedas, becoming an increasingly central concept in Upanishads.

The [[Chāndogya Upaniṣad]], dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest [[Upanishads]], has the earliest evidence for the [[Vedas|Vedic era]] use of the word ''Ahimsa'' in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against "all creatures" (''sarvabhuta'') and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of [[Reincarnation|rebirths]] (CU 8.15.1).&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 2–5; English translation: Schmidt p. 631.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars state that this 8th or 7th-century BCE mention may have been an influence of Jainism on Vedic Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;M.K Sridhar and Puruṣottama Bilimoria (2007), ''Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges,'' Editors: Puruṣottama Bilimoria, Joseph Prabhu, Renuka M. Sharma, Ashgate Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3301-3}}, page 315&lt;/ref&gt; Others scholar state that this relationship is speculative, and though Jainism is an ancient tradition the oldest traceable texts of Jainism tradition are from many centuries after the Vedic era ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D.

Chāndogya Upaniṣad also names Ahimsa, along with Satyavacanam (truthfulness), Arjavam (sincerity), [[Dāna|Danam]] (charity), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapo]] (penance/meditation), as one of five essential virtues (CU 3.17.4).&lt;ref name=arapura/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra Kumar (2008), Non-violence and Its Philosophy, {{ISBN|978-81-7933-159-0}}, see page 11–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sandilya [[Upanishad]] lists ten forbearances: '''Ahimsa''', Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha.&lt;ref&gt;Swami, P. (2000).

A Lecture on the Vedánta: Embracing the Text of the Vedánta-sára. Presbyterian mission press.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kaneda,&lt;ref name=kaneda2008/&gt; the term Ahimsa is an important spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. It implies the total avoidance of harming of any kind of living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.

=====The Epics=====
The [[Mahabharata]], one of the epics of Hinduism, has multiple mentions of the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' (अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः), which literally means: non-violence is the highest moral virtue. For example, [[Mahaprasthanika Parva]] has the verse:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/mbs/mbs13117.htm Mahabharata 13.117.37–38]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मस तथाहिंसा परॊ दमः।
अहिंसा परमं दानम अहिंसा परमस तपः।
अहिंसा परमॊ यज्ञस तथाहिस्मा परं बलम।
अहिंसा परमं मित्रम अहिंसा परमं सुखम।
अहिंसा परमं सत्यम अहिंसा परमं शरुतम॥
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The above passage from Mahabharata emphasises the cardinal importance of Ahimsa in Hinduism, and literally means: Ahimsa is the highest [[virtue]], Ahimsa is the highest self-control, Ahimsa is the greatest gift, Ahimsa is the best suffering, Ahimsa is the highest sacrifice, Ahimsa is the finest strength, Ahimsa is the greatest friend, Ahimsa is the greatest happiness, Ahimsa is the highest truth, and Ahimsa is the greatest teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In Perspectives on Nonviolence (pp. 168–177). Springer New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduismtoday.com/pdf_downloads/what_is_hinduism/Sec6/WIH_Sec6_Chapter45.pdf Ahimsa: To do no harm] Subramuniyaswami, What is Hinduism?, Chapter 45, Pages 359–361&lt;/ref&gt; Some other examples where the phrase ''Ahimsa Paramo Dharma'' are discussed include [[Adi Parva]], [[Vana Parva]] and [[Anushasana Parva]]. The [[Bhagavad Gita]], among other things, discusses the doubts and questions about appropriate response when one faces systematic violence or war. These verses develop the concepts of lawful violence in self-defence and the [[Just war theory|theories of just war]]. However, there is no consensus on this interpretation. Gandhi, for example, considers this debate about non-violence and lawful violence as a mere metaphor for the internal war within each human being, when he or she faces moral questions.&lt;ref name=fischer1954/&gt;

=====Self-defence, criminal law, and war=====
The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012&gt;Balkaran, R., &amp; Dorn, A. W. (2012). [http://www.sareligionuoft.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/JAAR-Article-Violence-in-the-Valmiki-Ramayana-Just-War-Criteria-in-an-Ancient-Indian-Epic-.pdf Violence in the Vālmı̄ki Rāmāyaṇa: Just War Criteria in an Ancient Indian Epic], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 80(3), 659–690.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996&gt;[[Klaus K.

Robinson (2003), Just War in Comparative Perspective, {{ISBN|0-7546-3587-2}}, Ashgate Publishing, see pages 114–125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coates, B. E. (2008). Modern India's Strategic Advantage to the United States: Her Twin Strengths in Himsa and Ahimsa. Comparative Strategy, 27(2), pages 133–147&lt;/ref&gt;

;War
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; War can only be started and stopped by a legitimate authority. Weapons used must be proportionate to the opponent and the aim of war, not indiscriminate tools of destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Subedi, S. P. (2003). The Concept in Hinduism of 'Just War'. Journal of Conflict and Security Law, 8(2), pages 339–361&lt;/ref&gt; All strategies and weapons used in the war must be to defeat the opponent, not designed to cause misery to the opponent; for example, use of arrows is allowed, but use of arrows smeared with painful poison is not allowed. Warriors must use judgment in the battlefield. Cruelty to the opponent during war is forbidden. Wounded, unarmed opponent warriors must not be attacked or killed, they must be brought to your realm and given medical treatment.&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; Children, women and civilians must not be injured. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.&lt;ref name=balkaran2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;

;Self-defence
In matters of self-defence, different interpretations of ancient Hindu texts have been offered. For example, Tähtinen suggests self-defence is appropriate, criminals are not protected by the rule of Ahimsa, and Hindu scriptures support the use of violence against an armed attacker.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 12.15.55; Manu Smriti 8.349–350; Matsya Purana 226.116.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternate theories of self-defence, inspired by Ahimsa, build principles similar to theories of just war. [[Aikido]], pioneered in Japan, illustrates one such principles of self-defence. [[Morihei Ueshiba]], the founder of Aikido, described his inspiration as Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportspa.com.ba/images/dec2011/full/rad8.pdf The Role of Teachers in Martial Arts] Nebojša Vasic, University of Zenica (2011); Sport SPA Vol. 8, Issue 2: 47–51; see page 46, 2nd column&lt;/ref&gt; According to this interpretation of Ahimsa in self-defence, one must not assume that the world is free of aggression. One must presume that some people will, out of ignorance, error or fear, attack other persons or intrude into their space, physically or verbally. The aim of self-defence, suggested Ueshiba, must be to neutralise the aggression of the attacker, and avoid the conflict. The best defence is one where the victim is protected, as well as the attacker is respected and not injured if possible. Under Ahimsa and Aikido, there are no enemies, and appropriate self-defence focuses on neutralising the immaturity, assumptions and aggressive strivings of the attacker.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060116174614/http://www.aiki-extensions.org/pubs/conflict-body_text.pdf SOCIAL CONFLICT, AGGRESSION, AND THE BODY IN EURO-AMERICAN AND ASIAN SOCIAL THOUGHT] Donald Levine, University of Chicago (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ueshiba, Kisshōmaru (2004), ''The Art of Aikido: Principles and Essential Techniques'', Kodansha International, {{ISBN|4-7700-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Criminal law
Tähtinen concludes that Hindus have no misgivings about death penalty; their position is that evil-doers who deserve death should be killed, and that a king in particular is obliged to punish criminals and should not hesitate to kill them, even if they happen to be his own brothers and sons.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 96, 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars&lt;ref name=klos1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=robinson2003/&gt; conclude that the scriptures of Hinduism suggest sentences for any crime must be fair, proportional and not cruel.

; Pacifism
There is no consensus on [[pacifism]] among modern Hindu scholars. The conflict between pacifistic interpretations of Ahimsa and the theories of [[just war]] prescribed by the Gita has been resolved by some scholars such as [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]], as being an allegory,&lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, Mohandas K., ''The Bhagavad Gita According to Gandhi'' Berkeley Hills Books, Berkeley 2000&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the battlefield is the soul and Arjuna, the war is within each human being, where man's higher impulses struggle against his own evil impulses.&lt;ref name=fischer1954&gt;Fischer, Louis: ''Gandhi: His Life and Message to the World'' Mentor, New York 1954, pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Non-human life=====
The Hindu precept of 'cause no injury' applies to animals and all life forms. This precept isn't found in the oldest verses of Vedas, but increasingly becomes one of the central ideas between 500 BC and 400 AD.&lt;ref name=chapple16&gt;Christopher Chapple (1993), Nonviolence to Animals, Earth, and Self in Asian Traditions, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|0-7914-1498-1}}, pages 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W Norman Brown (February 1964), [http://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1964_16/5-6-7/the_sanctity_of_the_cow_in_hinduism.pdf ''The sanctity of the cow in Hinduism''], The Economic Weekly, pages 245–255&lt;/ref&gt; In the oldest texts, numerous ritual sacrifices of animals, including cows and horses, are highlighted and hardly any mention is made of Ahimsa to non-human life.&lt;ref&gt;D.N. Jha (2002), ''The Myth of the Holy Cow'', {{ISBN|1-85984-676-9}}, Verso&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosen (2004), Holy Cow: The Hare Krishna Contribution to Vegetarianism and Animal Rights, {{ISBN|1-59056-066-3}}, pages 19–39&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindu scriptures, dated to between 5th century and 1st century BC, while discussing human diet, initially suggest ''kosher'' meat may be eaten, evolving it with the suggestion that only meat obtained through ritual sacrifice can be eaten, then that one should eat no meat because it hurts animals, with verses describing the noble life as one that lives on flowers, roots and fruits alone.&lt;ref name=chapple16/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Baudhayana]] Dharmasutra 2.4.7; 2.6.2; 2.11.15; 2.12.8; 3.1.13; 3.3.6; [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra 1.17.15; 1.17.19; 2.17.26–2.18.3; Vasistha Dharmasutra 14.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later texts of Hinduism declare Ahimsa one of the primary virtues, declare any killing or harming any life as against ''dharma'' (moral life). Finally, the discussion in Upanishads and Hindu Epics&lt;ref&gt;Manu Smriti 5.30, 5.32, 5.39 and 5.44; Mahabharata 3.199 (3.207), 3.199.5 (3.207.5), 3.199.19–29 (3.207.19), 3.199.23–24 (3.207.23–24), 13.116.15–18, 14.28; Ramayana 1-2-8:19&lt;/ref&gt; shifts to whether a human being can ever live his or her life without harming animal and plant life in some way; which and when plants or animal meat may be eaten, whether violence against animals causes human beings to become less compassionate, and if and how one may exert least harm to non-human life consistent with ahimsa precept, given the constraints of life and human needs.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 592–593.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 13.115.59–60; 13.116.15–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mahabharata permits hunting by warriors, but opposes it in the case of hermits who must be strictly non-violent. [[Sushruta Samhita]], a Hindu text written in the 3rd or 4th century, in Chapter XLVI suggests proper diet as a means of treating certain illnesses, and recommends various fishes and meats for different ailments and for pregnant women,&lt;ref&gt;Kaviraj Kunja Lal Bhishagratna (1907), An English Translation of the Sushruta Samhita, Volume I, Part 2; see Chapter starting on page 469; for discussion on meats and fishes, see page 480 and onwards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 46.89; Sharirasthana 3.25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Charaka Samhita]] describes meat as superior to all other kinds of food for convalescents.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrasthana 27.87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Across the texts of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to non-human life, but without a universal consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Mahabharata 3.199.11–12 (3.199 is 3.207 elsewhere); 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17; Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13–14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf pp. 572–577 (for the Manusmṛti) and pp. 585–597 (for the Mahabharata); Tähtinen pp. 34–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Mahabharata and the Manusmṛti (5.27–55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m12/m12b095.htm Mahabharata 12.260] (12.260 is 12.268 according to another count); 13.115–116; 14.28.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m03/m03207.htm Mahabharata 3.199] (3.199 is 3.207 according to another count).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the arguments proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards it entails before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, as well as to the karmic consequences of violence.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 39–43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsdorf p. 589–590; Schmidt pp. 634–635, 640–643; Tähtinen pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Hindu texts discuss Ahimsa and non-animal life. They discourage wanton destruction of nature including of wild and cultivated plants. Hermits ([[sannyasa|sannyasin]]s) were urged to live on a [[fruitarian]] diet so as to avoid the destruction of plants.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt pp. 637–639; Manusmriti 10.63, 11.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rod Preece, Animals and Nature: Cultural Myths, Cultural Realities, {{ISBN|978-0-7748-0725-8}}, University of British Columbia Press, pages 212–217&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars&lt;ref&gt;Chapple, C. (1990). Ecological Nonviolence and the Hindu Tradition. In ''Perspectives on Nonviolence'' (pages 168–177). Springer New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Horn, G. (2006). Hindu Traditions and Nature: Survey Article. Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology, 10(1), 5–39&lt;/ref&gt; claim the principles of ecological non-violence is innate in the Hindu tradition, and its conceptual fountain has been Ahimsa as their cardinal virtue.

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' written between 200 BC and 400 AD, and sometimes called the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Veda]], is one of the most cherished classics on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. Tirukkuṛaḷ dedicates Chapters 26, 32 and 33 of Book 1 to the virtue of Ahimsa, namely, [[vegetarianism]], [[non-violence|non-harming]], and [[non-killing]], respectively. ''Tirukkuṛaḷ'' says that Ahimsa applies to all life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf Tirukkuṛaḷ] Translated by Rev G.U. Pope, Rev W.H.

[[File:Ahimsa.svg|thumb|The hand with a wheel on the palm symbolizes the Jain Vow of Ahimsa. The word in the middle is "Ahimsa". The wheel represents the [[dharmacakra]] which stands for the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation through relentless pursuit of truth and non-violence.]]
In Jainism, the understanding and implementation of ''Ahimsā'' is more radical, scrupulous, and comprehensive than in any other religion.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw, pp. 154–160; Jindal, pp. 74–90; Tähtinen p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Killing any living being out of passions is considered ''hiṃsā'' (to injure) and abstaining from such an act is ''ahimsā'' (noninjury).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=34}} The vow of ahimsā is considered the foremost among the 'five vows of Jainism'. Other vows like truth (Satya) are meant for safeguarding the vow of ahimsā.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=33}} In the practice of Ahimsa, the requirements are less strict for the lay persons ([[sravakas]]) who have undertaken ''anuvrata'' (Smaller Vows) than for the [[Jain monasticism|Jain monastics]] who are bound by the [[Mahavrata]] "Great Vows".&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 158–159, 189–192; Laidlaw pp. 173–175, 179; ''Religious Vegetarianism'', ed. [[Kerry S. Walters]] and Lisa Portmess, Albany 2001, p. 43–46 (translation of the First Great Vow).&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ''{{IAST|ahimsā paramo dharmaḥ}}'' is often found inscribed on the walls of the [[Jain temple]]s.&lt;ref name=pauldundas160&gt;Dundas, Paul: ''The Jains'', second edition, London 2002, p. 160; Wiley, Kristi L.: ''Ahimsa and Compassion in Jainism'', in: ''Studies in Jaina History and Culture'', ed. Peter Flügel, London 2006, p. 438; Laidlaw pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; Like in Hinduism, the aim is to prevent the accumulation of harmful karma.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 26–30, 191–195.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Mahavira]] revived and reorganized the Jain faith in the 6th or 5th century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 24 suggests the 5th century; the traditional dating of Mahavira's death is 527 BCE.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already an established, strictly observed rule.&lt;ref&gt;Goyal, S.R.: ''A History of Indian Buddhism'', Meerut 1987, p. 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rishabhanatha]] (Ādinātha), the first Jain [[Tirthankara]], whom modern Western historians consider to be a historical figure, followed by [[Parshvanatha]] (Pārśvanātha)&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 19, 30; Tähtinen p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-third [[Tirthankara]] lived in about the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas p. 30 suggests the 8th or 7th century; the traditional chronology places him in the late 9th or early 8th century.&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the community to which Mahavira's parents belonged.&lt;ref&gt;[[Acaranga Sutra]] 2.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ahimsa was already part of the "Fourfold Restraint" (''Caujjama''), the vows taken by Parshva's followers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sthananga Sutra]] 266; Tähtinen p. 132; Goyal p. 83–84, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In the times of Mahavira and in the following centuries, Jains were at odds with both Buddhists and followers of the Vedic religion or Hindus, whom they accused of negligence and inconsistency in the implementation of Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas pp. 160, 234, 241; Wiley p. 448; Granoff, Phyllis: ''The Violence of Non-Violence: A Study of Some Jain Responses to Non-Jain Religious Practices'', in: ''Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies'' 15 (1992) pp. 1–43; Tähtinen pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Jain tradition either [[lacto vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] is mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain concept of Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It does not make any exception for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw pp. 166–167; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed for the sake of food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants.&lt;ref&gt;Lodha, R.M.: ''Conservation of Vegetation and Jain Philosophy'', in: ''Medieval Jainism: Culture and Environment'', New Delhi 1990, p. 137–141; Tähtinen p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Jains go out of their way so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal p. 89; Laidlaw pp. 54, 154–155, 180.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action.&lt;ref&gt;Sutrakrtangasutram 1.8.3; Uttaradhyayanasutra 10; Tattvarthasutra 7.8; Dundas pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it would amount to violence against the bees.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hemacandra]]: ''Yogashastra'' 3.37; Laidlaw pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects,&lt;ref&gt;Laidlaw p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Sangave, Vilas Adinath: ''Jaina Community. A Social Survey'', second edition, Bombay 1980, p. 259; Dundas p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, all life forms are said to deserve full protection from all kinds of injury, but Jains recognise a hierarchy of life. Mobile beings are given higher protection than immobile ones. For the mobile beings, they distinguish between one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed and five-sensed ones; a one-sensed animal has touch as its only sensory modality. The more senses a being has, the more they care about non-injuring it. Among the five-sensed beings, the precept of non-injury and non-violence to the rational ones (humans) is strongest in Jain Ahimsa.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89, 125–133 (detailed exposition of the classification system); Tähtinen pp. 17, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,&lt;ref&gt;''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas pp. 162–163; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.&lt;ref&gt;Jindal pp. 89–90; Laidlaw pp. 154–155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and "Just War" in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed. Tara Sethia, New Delhi 2004, p. 52–60; Tähtinen p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Jain communities accepted the use of military power for their defence, there were Jain monarchs, military commanders, and soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;Harisena, ''Brhatkathakosa'' 124 (10th century); Jindal pp. 90–91; Sangave p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

In Buddhist texts ''Ahimsa'' (or its [[Pāli]] cognate {{IAST|avihiṃsā}}) is part of the [[Five Precepts]] ({{IAST|Pañcasīla}}), the first of which has been to abstain from killing. This precept of Ahimsa is applicable to both the Buddhist layperson and the monk community.&lt;ref name="Williams2005p398"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Williams |title=Buddhism: Critical Concepts in Religious Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgrZnmKUKtgC |year=2005|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-33226-2 |page=398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bodhi Bhikkhu|title=Great Disciples of the Buddha: Their Lives, Their Works, Their Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=teUGAAAAYAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-128-4 |pages=387 with footnote 12}};&lt;br&gt;Sarao, p. 49; Goyal p. 143; Tähtinen p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamotte, Etienne 1988, p. 54-55"&gt;Lamotte, pp. 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahimsa precept is not a commandment and transgressions did not invite religious sanctions for layperson, but their power has been in the Buddhist belief in karmic consequences and their impact in afterlife during rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Killing, in Buddhist belief, could lead to rebirth in the hellish realm, and for a longer time in more severe conditions if the murder victim was a monk.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=187}} Saving animals from slaughter for meat, is believed to be a way to acquire merit for better rebirth. These moral precepts have been voluntarily self-enforced in lay Buddhist culture through the associated belief in karma and rebirth.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|pp=187–191}} The Buddhist texts not only recommended Ahimsa, but suggest avoiding trading goods that contribute to or are a result of violence:

{{Quote|
These five trades, O monks, should not be taken up by a lay follower: trading with weapons, trading in living beings, trading in meat, trading in intoxicants, trading in poison.
|Anguttara Nikaya V.177|Translated by Martine Batchelor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martine Batchelor|title=The Spirit of the Buddha|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fL3mykqlOJcC&amp;pg=PT59 |year=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-17500-4 |page=59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Unlike lay Buddhists, transgressions by monks do invite sanctions.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}} Full expulsion of a monk from ''sangha'' follows instances of killing, just like any other serious offense against the monastic ''nikaya'' code of conduct.{{sfn|McFarlane |2001|p=192}}

=====War=====
Violent ways of punishing criminals and prisoners of war was not explicitly condemned in Buddhism,&lt;ref&gt;Sarao p. 53; Tähtinen pp. 95, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; but peaceful ways of conflict resolution and punishment with the least amount of injury were encouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Tähtinen pp. 95, 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt A. Raaflaub, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMxgef2VJEwC&amp;pg=PA61 ''War and Peace in the Ancient World.''] Blackwell Publishing, 2007, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The early texts condemn the mental states that lead to violent behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonviolence is an overriding theme within the [[Pali Canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While the early texts condemn killing in the strongest terms, and portray the ideal king as a pacifist, such a king is nonetheless flanked by an army.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the Buddha's teaching on nonviolence was not interpreted or put into practice in an uncompromisingly pacifist or anti-military-service way by early Buddhists.&lt;ref name="Tessa Bartholomeusz 2002, page 41"/&gt; The early texts assume war to be a fact of life, and well-skilled warriors are viewed as necessary for defensive warfare.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In Pali texts, injunctions to abstain from violence and involvement with military affairs are directed at members of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]; later Mahayana texts, which often generalise monastic norms to laity, require this of lay people as well.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart McFarlane in Peter Harvey, ed., ''Buddhism.'' Continuum, 2001, pages 195–196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early texts do not contain just-war ideology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that a [[suttas|sutta]] in the ''Gamani Samyuttam'' rules out all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha if it is true that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 125–126. Full texts of the sutta:[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn42/sn42.003.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.&lt;ref&gt;Rune E.A. Johansson, ''The Dynamic Psychology of Early Buddhism.'' Curzon Press 1979, page 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Buddhists point to other early texts as justifying defensive war.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 40–53. Some examples are the ''Cakkavati Sihanada Sutta'', the ''Kosala Samyutta'', the ''Ratthapala Sutta'', and the ''Sinha Sutta''. See also page 125. See also Trevor Ling, ''Buddhism, Imperialism, and War.'' George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd, 1979, pages 136–137.&lt;/ref&gt; One example is the ''Kosala Samyutta'', in which King [[Pasenadi]], a righteous king favored by the Buddha, learns of an impending attack on his kingdom. He arms himself in defence, and leads his army into battle to protect his kingdom from attack. He lost this battle but won the war. King Pasenadi eventually defeated King [[Ajatasattu]] and captured him alive. He thought that, although this King of [[Magadha]] has transgressed against his kingdom, he had not transgressed against him personally, and Ajatasattu was still his nephew. He released Ajatasattu and did not harm him.&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Bhikkhu (trans.) (2000). ''The Connected Discourses of the Buddha: A New Translation of the Samyutta Nikaya''. Boston: Wisdom Publications. {{ISBN|0-86171-331-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his return, the Buddha said (among other things) that Pasenadi "is a friend of virtue, acquainted with virtue, intimate with virtue", while the opposite is said of the aggressor, King Ajatasattu.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 49, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Theravada commentaries, there are five requisite factors that must all be fulfilled for an act to be both an act of killing and to be karmically negative. These are: (1) the presence of a living being, human or animal; (2) the knowledge that the being is a living being; (3) the intent to kill; (4) the act of killing by some means; and (5) the resulting death.&lt;ref&gt;Hammalawa Saddhatissa, ''Buddhist Ethics.'' Wisdom Publications, 1997, pages 60, 159, see also Bartholomeusz page 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Buddhists have argued on this basis that the act of killing is complicated, and its ethicization is predicated upon intent.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that in defensive postures, for example, the primary intention of a soldier is not to kill, but to defend against aggression, and the act of killing in that situation would have minimal negative karmic repercussions.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomeusz, pp. 44, 121–122, 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar]], there is circumstantial evidence encouraging Ahimsa, from the Buddha's doctrine, ''"Love all, so that you may not wish to kill any."'' Gautama Buddha distinguished between a principle and a rule. He did not make Ahimsa a matter of rule, but suggested it as a matter of principle. This gives Buddhists freedom to act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/04_02.html#03_02 The Buddha and His Dhamma]. Columbia.edu.

==Methods==
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King]] speaking at the 1963 "[[March on Washington]]".]]
Nonviolent action generally comprises three categories: ''Acts of Protest and Persuasion'', ''Noncooperation'', and ''Nonviolent Intervention''.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[https://www.un.org/events/nonviolence/2008/background.shtml United Nations International Day of Non-Violence], United Nations, 2008. see [[International Day of Non-Violence]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acts of protest===

Nonviolent acts of protest and persuasion are symbolic actions performed by a group of people to show their support or disapproval of something. The goal of this kind of action is to bring public awareness to an issue, persuade or influence a particular group of people, or to facilitate future nonviolent action. The message can be directed toward the public, opponents, or people affected by the issue.  Methods of protest and persuasion include speeches, public communications, [[petition]]s, symbolic acts, art, [[Demonstration (people)|processions (marches), and other public assemblies]].&lt;ref name="sharp2005" &gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = Waging Nonviolent Struggle | publisher = Extending Horizon Books | year = 2005 | pages = 50–65 | isbn = 978-0-87558-162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noncooperation===

Noncooperation involves the purposeful withholding of cooperation or the unwillingness to initiate in cooperation with an opponent. The goal of noncooperation is to halt or hinder an industry, political system, or economic process. Methods of noncooperation include [[labour strike]]s, [[boycotts|economic boycotts]], [[civil disobedience]], [[sex strike]], [[Tax resistance|tax refusal]], and general disobedience.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

===Nonviolent intervention===

Compared with protest and noncooperation, nonviolent intervention is a more direct method of nonviolent action. Nonviolent intervention can be used defensively—for example to maintain an institution or independent initiative—or offensively- for example, to drastically forward a nonviolent struggle into the opponent's territory. Intervention is often more immediate and effective than the other two methods, but is also harder to maintain and more taxing to the participants involved.

[[Gene Sharp]], a political scientist who seeks to advance the worldwide study and use of strategic nonviolent action in conflict, has written extensively about the methods of nonviolent action.  In his book ''Waging Nonviolent Struggle'' he describes 198 methods of nonviolent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://peacemagazine.org/198.htm  | title = The Methods of Nonviolent Action | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | year = 1973 | publisher = Peace magazine | accessdate = 2008-11-07 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greece, [[Aristophanes]]' [[Lysistrata]] gives the fictional example of women withholding sexual favors from their husbands until war was abandoned. A modern work of fiction inspired by Gene Sharp and by Aristophanes is ''[[A Door into Ocean]]'' by [[Joan Slonczewski]], depicting an ocean world inhabited by women who use nonviolent means to repel armed space invaders. Other methods of nonviolent intervention include occupations ([[sit-in]]s), [[blockade]]s, fasting ([[hunger strikes]]), truck cavalcades, and dual sovereignty/parallel government.&lt;ref name="sharp2005" /&gt;

Tactics must be carefully chosen, taking into account political and cultural circumstances, and form part of a larger plan or strategy.

Successful [[Third Party Nonviolent Intervention|nonviolent cross-border intervention]] projects include the Guatemala Accompaniment Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nisgua.org/ Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peace Brigades International]] and [[Christian Peacemaker Teams]]. Developed in the early 1980s, and originally inspired by the Gandhian [[Shanti Sena]], the primary tools of these organisations have been nonviolent protective accompaniment, backed up by a global support network which can respond to threats, local and regional grassroots diplomatic and [[peacebuilding]] efforts, human rights observation and witnessing, and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PBI's principles | url=http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | website=Peace Brigades International | publisher=PBI General Assembly | origyear=1992 | year=2001 | accessdate=2009-05-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602190353/http://www.peacebrigades.org/about-pbi/how-we-work/ | archivedate=2010-06-02 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Christian Peace Maker Teams Mission Statement | url=http://www.cpt.org/about/mission | website=Christian Peacemaker Team | publisher=CPT founding conference | year=1986 | accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In extreme cases, most of these groups are also prepared to do interpositioning: placing themselves between parties who are engaged or threatening to engage in outright attacks in one or both directions.  Individual and large group cases of interpositioning, when called for, have been remarkably effective in dampening conflict and saving lives.

Another powerful tactic of nonviolent intervention invokes public scrutiny of the oppressors as a result of the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If the military or police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, the military or police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sharp | first = Gene | authorlink = Gene Sharp | title = The Politics of Nonviolent Action | publisher = P.

==Revolution==
Certain individuals ([[Barbara Deming]], [[Danilo Dolci]], [[Devere Allen]] etc.) and party groups (e.g. [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]], [[Pacifist Socialist Party]] or [[War Resisters League]]) have advocated [[nonviolent revolution]] as an alternative to violence as well as elitist reformism. This perspective is usually connected to militant [[anti-capitalism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Many leftist and socialist movements &lt;!-- which movements? --&gt; have hoped to mount a "peaceful revolution" by organising enough strikers to completely paralyse the state and corporate apparatus, allowing workers to re-organise society along radically different lines. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Some have argued that a relatively nonviolent revolution would require fraternisation with military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1555 Daniel Jakopovich: Revolution and the Party in Gramsci's Thought: A Modern Application.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Ernesto Che Guevara]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Frantz Fanon]] and [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] were fervent critics of nonviolence, arguing variously that nonviolence and pacifism are an attempt to impose the morals of the [[bourgeoisie]] upon the [[proletariat]], that violence is a necessary accompaniment to revolutionary change or that the right to self-defense is fundamental. Note, for example, the complaint of Malcolm X that "I believe it's a crime for anyone being brutalized to continue to accept that brutality without doing something to defend himself."&lt;ref&gt;X, Malcolm and Alex Haley:''"The Autobiography of Malcolm X"'', page 366. Grove Press, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] argued that the nonviolent resistance strategy of Gandhi could be effective in countries with "a free press and the right of assembly", which could make it possible "not merely to appeal to outside opinion, but to bring a mass movement into being, or even to make your intentions known to your adversary"; but he was skeptical of Gandhi's approach being effective in the opposite sort of circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George. ''Reflections on Gandhi'', Partisan Review, January 1949.  Found at http://www.orwell.ru/library/reviews/gandhi/english/e_gandhi on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinhold Niebuhr]] similarly affirmed Gandhi's approach while criticising aspects of it. He argued, "The advantage of non-violence as a method of expressing moral goodwill lies in the fact that it protects the agent against the resentments which violent conflict always creates in both parties to a conflict, and it proves this freedom of resentment and ill-will to the contending party in the dispute by enduring more suffering than it causes." However, Niebuhr also held, "The differences between violent and non-violent methods of coercion and resistance are not so absolute that it would be possible to regard violence as a morally impossible instrument of social change."&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, Reinhold. ''[[Moral Man and Immoral Society]]'', Charles Scribner's Sons. 1932. Chapter 9.  Found at http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/chernus/4800/MoralManAndImmoralSociety/Section6.htm on 21 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of repression of radical [[African American]] groups in the United States during the 1960s, [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] member [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] said of the nonviolent tactics of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The concept of nonviolence is a false ideal. It presupposes the existence of compassion and a sense of justice on the part of one's adversary. When this adversary has everything to lose and nothing to gain by exercising justice and compassion, his reaction can only be negative."&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, George. Soledad Brother: The Prison Letters of George Jackson. Lawrence Hill Books, 1994. {{ISBN|1-55652-230-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;Walters, Wendy W. At Home in Diaspora. U of Minnesota Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-8166-4491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malcolm X also clashed with civil rights leaders over the issue of nonviolence, arguing that violence should not be ruled out if no option remained.

In his book ''How Nonviolence Protects the State'', [[anarchist]] [[Peter Gelderloos]] criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded.&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"&gt;Gelderloos, Peter. ''How Nonviolence Protects the State''. Boston: [[South End Press]], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the [[Indian independence movement]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activists.&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"/&gt;{{rp|7–12}} He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect "oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'"&lt;ref name="Gelderloos"/&gt;{{rp|23}} On the other hand, anarchism also includes a section committed to nonviolence called [[anarcho-pacifism]].&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"&gt;[[George Woodcock]]. ''Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements'' (1962)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/e_publications/dd-trad8.html#anarch%20and%20violence "Resisting the Nation State, the pacifist and anarchist tradition" by Geoffrey Ostergaard]&lt;/ref&gt; The main early influences were the thought of [[Henry David Thoreau]]&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]] while later the ideas of [[Mohandas Gandhi]] gained importance.&lt;ref name="Anarchism 1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ppu.org.uk"/&gt; It developed "mostly in Holland, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the [[United States]], before and during the [[Second World War]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=George Woodcock|first=George|last=Woodstock|title=Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements|year=1962|quote=Finally, somewhat aside from the curve that runs from anarchist individualism to anarcho-syndicalism, we come to Tolstoyanism and to pacifist anarchism that appeared, mostly in the [[Netherlands]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and the United states, before and after the Second World War and which has continued since then in the deep in the anarchist involvement in the protests against nuclear armament.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The efficacy of nonviolence was also challenged by some anti-capitalist protesters advocating a "[[diversity of tactics]]" during street demonstrations across Europe and the US following [[1999 Seattle WTO protests|the anti-World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, Washington in 1999]]. American [[feminism|feminist]] writer [[D. A. Clarke]], in her essay "A Woman With A Sword," suggests that for nonviolence to be effective, it must be "practiced by those who could easily resort to force if they chose."

Nonviolence advocates see some truth in this argument: Gandhi himself said often that he could teach nonviolence to a violent person but not to a coward and that true nonviolence came from renouncing violence, not by not having any to renounce.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Advocates responding to criticisms of the efficacy of nonviolence point to the success of non-violent struggles even against the Nazi regimes in [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|Denmark]] and even in [[Rosenstrasse protest|Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nathan Stoltzfus]], ''Resistance of the Heart: Intermarriage and the Rosenstrasse Protest in Nazi Germany'', [[Rutgers University Press]] (March 2001) {{ISBN|0-8135-2909-3}} (paperback: 386 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan found that nonviolent revolutions are twice as effective as violent ones and lead to much greater degrees of democratic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Civil Resistance Works, The Strategic Logic of Nonviolent Conflict", New York: Columbia University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 study finds that "increasing levels of globalization are positively associated with the emergence of nonviolent campaigns, while negatively influencing the probability of violent campaigns. Integration into the world increases the popularity of peaceful alternatives to achieve political goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Globalization and contentious politics: A comparative analysis of nonviolent and violent campaigns|url = http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/01/21/0738894215623073|journal = Conflict Management and Peace Science|volume = 35|issue = 4|date = 2016-01-22|issn = 0738-8942|pages = 315-335|doi = 10.1177/0738894215623073|language = en|first = Süveyda|last = Karakaya}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Otto of Lippe''' was a son of [[Bernhard II, Lord of Lippe]]. He was [[Archdiocese of Utrecht (695–1580)|bishop of Utrecht]] as Otto II from 1216 to 1227. Several of his brothers also held high ecclesiastical offices in the Rhineland.

During the [[Fifth Crusade]], Otto visited [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].

In 1227, Otto was joined by his former enemy, count [[Floris IV, Count of Holland]], to suppress a rebellion by the people of [[Drenthe]], led by [[Rudolph van Coevorden]]. He died in the [[Battle of Ane]] (a town close to [[Hardenberg]]) on July 28, 1227.

'''Oxidative stress''' reflects an imbalance between the systemic manifestation of [[reactive oxygen species]] and a biological system's ability to readily [[Detoxification|detoxify]] the reactive intermediates or to repair the resulting damage.   Disturbances in the normal [[redox]] state of cells can cause toxic effects through the production of [[peroxide]]s and [[free radical]]s that damage all components of the cell, including [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[DNA]].  Oxidative stress from [[Cellular respiration|oxidative metabolism]] causes base damage, as well as [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|strand breaks in DNA]]. Base damage is mostly indirect and caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated, e.g. O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[superoxide]] radical), OH ([[hydroxyl]] radical) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrogen peroxide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chandra Kala |author2=Syed Salman Ali |author3=Abid Mohd |author4=Sweety Rajpoot |author5=Najam Ali Khan | year = 2015 | title = Protection Against FCA Induced Oxidative Stress Induced DNA Damage as a Model of Arthritis and In vitro Anti-arthritic Potential of Costus speciosus Rhizome Extract | url = | journal = International Journal of Pharmacognosy and Phytochemical Research | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 383–389 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, some reactive oxidative species act as cellular messengers in [[redox signaling]].   Thus, oxidative stress can cause disruptions in normal mechanisms of [[cellular signaling]].

==Chemical and biological effects==

Chemically, oxidative stress is associated with increased production of oxidizing species or a significant decrease in the effectiveness of [[antioxidant]] defenses, such as [[glutathione]].&lt;ref name="pmid11368918"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schafer FQ, Buettner GR |title=Redox environment of the cell as viewed through the redox state of the glutathione disulfide/glutathione couple |journal=Free Radic. Biol. Med. |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1191–212 |year=2001 |pmid=11368918 |doi=10.1016/S0891-5849(01)00480-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of oxidative stress depend upon the size of these changes, with a cell being able to overcome small perturbations and regain its original state. However, more severe oxidative stress can cause cell death, and even moderate oxidation can trigger [[apoptosis]], while more intense stresses may cause [[necrosis]].&lt;ref name="pmid2009322"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lennon SV, Martin SJ, Cotter TG |title=Dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in human tumour cell lines by widely diverging stimuli |journal=Cell Prolif. |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=203–14 |year=1991 |pmid=2009322 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.1991.tb01150.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of [[reactive oxygen species]] is a particularly destructive aspect of oxidative stress.  Such species include [[free radical]]s and [[peroxide]]s. Some of the less reactive of these species (such as [[superoxide]]) can be converted by [[redox|oxidoreduction reactions]] with [[transition metal]]s or other redox cycling compounds (including [[quinone]]s) into more aggressive radical species that can cause extensive cellular damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Valko M, Morris H, Cronin MT |title=Metals, toxicity and oxidative stress |journal=Curr. Med.

Biological effects of single-base damage by radiation or oxidation, such as [[8-Oxoguanine|8-oxoguanine]] and [[thymine glycol]], have been extensively studied. Recently the focus has shifted to some of the more complex lesions. Tandem DNA lesions are formed at substantial frequency by ionizing radiation and metal-catalyzed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reactions. Under anoxic conditions, the predominant double-base lesion is a species in which C8 of guanine is linked to the 5-methyl group of an adjacent 3'-thymine (G[8,5- Me]T).&lt;ref name="pmid18616294"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LC Colis |author2=P Raychaudhury |author3=AK Basu |title=Mutational specificity of gamma-radiation-induced guanine-thymine and thymine-guanine intrastrand cross-links in mammalian cells and translesion synthesis past the guanine-thymine lesion by human DNA polymerase eta |journal=Biochemistry | volume= 47 | issue=6| pages=8070–9| year= 2008 | pmid= 18616294| doi=10.1021/bi800529f | pmc=2646719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these oxygen-derived species are produced by normal [[cellular respiration|aerobic metabolism]].  Normal cellular defense mechanisms destroy most of these.  Repair of oxidative damages to DNA is frequent and ongoing, largely keeping up with newly induced damages.  In rat urine about 74,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell per day are excreted.&lt;ref name=Helbock&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Helbock HJ, Beckman KB, Shigenaga MK, Walter PB, Woodall AA, Yeo HC, Ames BN |title=DNA oxidation matters: the HPLC-electrochemical detection assay of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine and 8-oxo-guanine |journal=Proc.

There are about 24,000 oxidative DNA adducts per cell in young rats and 66,000 adducts per cell in old rats.&lt;ref name=Helbock /&gt;  Likewise, any damage to cells is constantly repaired. However, under the severe levels of oxidative stress that cause necrosis, the damage causes [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] depletion, preventing controlled apoptotic death and causing the cell to simply fall apart.&lt;ref name="pmid9801070"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lelli JL, Becks LL, Dabrowska MI, Hinshaw DB |title=ATP converts necrosis to apoptosis in oxidant-injured endothelial cells |journal=Free Radic.

[[Polyunsaturated fatty acids]], particularly [[arachidonic acid]] and [[linoleic acid]], are primary targets for free radical and singlet oxygen oxidations.  For example, in tissues and cells, the free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces [[racemic]] mixtures of 13-hydroxy-9''Z'',11''E''-octadecadienoic acid, 13-hydroxy-9''E'',11''E''-octadecadienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10''E'',12-''E''-octadecadienoic acid (9-EE-HODE), and 11-hydroxy-9''Z'',12-''Z''-octadecadienoic acid as well as [[4-Hydroxynonenal]] while singlet oxygen attacks linoleic acid to produce (presumed but not yet proven to be racemic mixtures of) 13-hydroxy-9''Z'',11''E''-octadecadienoic acid, 9-hydroxy-10''E'',12-''Z''-octadecadienoic acid, 10-hydroxy-8''E'',12''Z''-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9''Z''-13-''E''-octadecadienoic (see [[13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]] and [[9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal =Free Radic Biol Med|year= 2015 |volume=79|pages=164–75| doi= 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2014.12.004 |title=Singlet-oxygen-derived products from linoleate activate Nrf2 signaling in skin cells|authors=Akazawa-Ogawa Y, Shichiri M, Nishio K, Yoshida Y, Niki E, Hagihara Y |pmid=25499849}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="riahi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;J Oleo Sci. 2015;64(4):347-56. {{DOI|10.5650/jos.ess14281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar attacks on arachidonic acid produce a far larger set of products including various [[isoprostanes]], hydroperoxy- and hydroxy- eicosatetraenoates, and 4-hydroxyalkenals.&lt;ref name="riahi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Chromatogr B |year=2014 |volume=964|pages=65–78 |title=Non-enzymatic lipid oxidation products in biological systems: assessment of the metabolites from polyunsaturated fatty acids|vauthors=Vigor C, Bertrand-Michel J, Pinot E, Oger C, Vercauteren J, Le Faouder P, Galano JM, Lee JC, Durand T |pmid=24856297 |doi=10.1016/j.jchromb.2014.04.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While many of these products are used as markers of oxidative stress, the products derived from linoleic acid appear far more predominant than arachidonic acid products and therefore easier to identify and quantify in, for example, atheromatous plaques.&lt;ref&gt;Atherosclerosis. 2003 Mar;167(1):111-20&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain linoleic acid products have also been proposed to be markers for specific types of oxidative stress.

|-
|{{chem|H|2|O|2}}, [[hydrogen peroxide]]
|Two-electron reduction state, formed by dismutation of {{chem|•O|2|-}} or by direct reduction of {{chem|O|2}}. Lipid-soluble and thus able to diffuse across membranes.
|-
|•OH, [[hydroxyl radical]]
|Three-electron reduction state, formed by [[Fenton's reagent|Fenton reaction]] and decomposition of [[peroxynitrite]]. Extremely reactive, will attack most cellular components
|-
|ROOH, [[peroxide|organic hydroperoxide]]
|Formed by radical reactions with cellular components such as [[lipid]]s and [[nucleobase]]s.
|-
|RO•, alkoxy and ROO•, peroxy radicals

==Production and consumption of oxidants==
One source of reactive oxygen under normal conditions in humans is the leakage of activated oxygen from [[mitochondria]] during [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. However, ''[[E. coli]]'' mutants that lack an active electron transport chain produced as much hydrogen peroxide as wild-type cells, indicating that other enzymes contribute the bulk of oxidants in these organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Seaver LC, Imlay JA |title=Are respiratory enzymes the primary sources of intracellular hydrogen peroxide? |journal=J.

Other enzymes capable of producing superoxide are [[xanthine oxidase]], NADPH oxidases and [[cytochrome P450 oxidase|cytochromes P450]]. Hydrogen peroxide is produced by a wide variety of enzymes including several oxidases. Reactive oxygen species play important roles in cell signalling, a process termed [[redox signaling]]. Thus, to maintain proper cellular [[homeostasis]], a balance must be struck between reactive oxygen production and consumption.

The best studied cellular antioxidants are the enzymes [[superoxide dismutase]] (SOD), [[catalase]], and [[glutathione peroxidase]]. Less well studied (but probably just as important) enzymatic antioxidants are the peroxiredoxins and the recently discovered [[sulfiredoxin]]. Other enzymes that have antioxidant properties (though this is not their primary role) include paraoxonase, glutathione-S transferases, and aldehyde dehydrogenases.

The amino acid methionine is prone to oxidation, but oxidized methionine can be reversible. Oxidation of methionine is shown to inhibit the phosphorylation of adjacent Ser/Thr/Tyr sites in proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hardin | first1 = SC | last2 = Larue | first2 = CT | last3 = Oh | first3 = MH | last4 = Jain | first4 = V | last5 = Huber | first5 = SC | year = 2009 | title = Coupling oxidative signals to protein phosphorylation via methionine oxidation in Arabidopsis | journal = Biochem J | volume = 422 | issue = 2| pages = 305–312 | doi = 10.1042/BJ20090764 | pmid = 19527223 | pmc=2782308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gives a plausible mechanism for cells to couple oxidative stress signals with cellular mainstream signaling such as phosphorylation.

==Diseases==

Oxidative stress is suspected to be important in [[neurodegenerative disease]]s including [[Motor neuron disease|Lou Gehrig's disease]]  (aka MND or ALS), [[Parkinson's disease]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], Depression, [[autism]],&lt;ref name=Hollis2017&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hollis F, Kanellopoulos AK, Bagni C |title=Mitochondrial dysfunction in Autism Spectrum Disorder: clinical features and perspectives |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=45 |issue= |pages=178–187 |date=August 2017 |pmid=28628841 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2017.05.018 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/134/7/1914/293241|title=Oxidative damage in multiple sclerosis lesions|first1=Lukas|last1=Haider|first2=Marie T.|last2=Fischer|first3=Josa M.|last3=Frischer|first4=Jan|last4=Bauer|first5=Romana|last5=Höftberger|first6=Gergö|last6=Botond|first7=Harald|last7=Esterbauer|first8=Christoph J.|last8=Binder|first9=Joseph L.|last9=Witztum|first10=Hans|last10=Lassmann|date=1 July 2011|publisher=|journal=Brain|volume=134|issue=7|pages=1914–1924|accessdate=29 April 2018|via=brain.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/brain/awr128|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429005804/https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/134/7/1914/293241|archivedate=29 April 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nuclear transport, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration.  |vauthors=Patel VP, Chu CT |journal=Int J Clin Exp Pathol  |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=215–29 |year=2011 |pmid=21487518 |pmc=3071655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirect evidence via monitoring biomarkers such as reactive oxygen species, and reactive nitrogen species production, antioxidant defense indicates oxidative damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Involvement of oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease.  |vauthors=Nunomura A, Castellani RJ, Zhu X, Moreira PI, Perry G, Smith MA |journal=J Neuropathol Exp Neurol.  |volume=65 |issue=7 |pages=631–41 |year=2005 |pmid=16825950 |doi=10.1097/01.jnen.0000228136.58062.bf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Oxidative stress in schizophrenia |vauthors=Bošković M, Vovk T, Kores Plesničar B, Grabnar I |journal=Curr.

Oxidative stress is thought to be linked to certain [[cardiovascular disease]], since oxidation of [[LDL]] in the vascular [[endothelium]] is a precursor to [[Atheromatous plaque|plaque]] formation.  Oxidative stress also plays a role in the [[ischemic cascade]] due to oxygen [[reperfusion injury]] following [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].  This cascade includes both [[strokes]] and [[heart attacks]]. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in [[chronic fatigue syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nijs J, Meeus M, De Meirleir K | title = Chronic musculoskeletal pain in chronic fatigue syndrome: recent developments and therapeutic implications. | journal = Man Ther | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 187–91 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16781183 | doi= 10.1016/j.math.2006.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative stress also contributes to tissue injury following irradiation and [[hyperoxia]], as well as in diabetes.

Oxidative stress is likely to be involved in age-related development of cancer.  The reactive species produced in oxidative stress can cause direct damage to the DNA and are therefore [[mutagenic]], and it may also suppress [[apoptosis]] and promote proliferation, invasiveness and [[metastasis]].&lt;ref name="cancer"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Halliwell, Barry | title = Oxidative stress and cancer: have we moved forward? | journal = Biochem.

==Metal catalysts==
Metals such as [[iron]], [[copper]], [[chromium]], [[vanadium]], and [[cobalt]] are capable of [[redox]] cycling in which a single [[electron]] may be accepted or donated by the metal. This action [[catalysis|catalyzes]] production of reactive [[radical (chemistry)|radical]]s and [[reactive oxygen species]].&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;   The presence of such metals in biological systems in an uncomplexed form (not in a protein or other protective metal complex) can significantly increase the level of oxidative stress.  These metals are thought to induce  [[H.J.H. Fenton|Fenton]] reactions and the Haber-Weiss reaction, in which [[hydroxyl radical]] is generated from hydrogen peroxide.  The hydroxyl radical then can modify amino acids. For example, meta-[[tyrosine]] and ortho-[[tyrosine]] form by hydroxylation of [[phenylalanine]].  Other reactions include lipid peroxidation and oxidation of nucleobases.  Metal catalyzed oxidations also lead to irreversible modification of R (Arg), K (Lys), P (Pro) and T (Thr)  Excessive oxidative-damage leads to protein degradation or aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;Dalle-Donne, Isabella; Aldini, Giancarlo; Carini, Marina; Colombo, Roberto; Rossi, Ranieri; Milzani, Aldo "Protein carbonylation, cellular dysfunction, and disease progression" ''Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine'' 2006, volume 10, pp. 389-406. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00407.x}}.

The reaction of transition metals with proteins [[oxidation|oxidated]] by [[Reactive Oxygen Species]] or [[Reactive Nitrogen Species]] can yield reactive products that accumulate and contribute to aging and disease. For example, in [[Alzheimer's Disease|Alzheimer's]] patients, peroxidized lipids and proteins accumulate in lysosomes of the brain cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Devasagayam|first=TPA|author2=Tilac JC |author3=Boloor KK |author4=Sane Ketaki S |author5=Ghaskadbi Saroj S |author6=Lele RD |title=Free Radicals and Antioxidants in Human Health: Current Status and Future Prospects|journal=Journal of Association of Physicians of India|date=October 2004|volume=52|page=796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-metal redox catalysts==
Certain organic compounds in addition to metal redox catalysts can also produce reactive oxygen species. One of the most important classes of these are the [[quinone]]s. Quinones can redox cycle with their conjugate [[semiquinone]]s and [[hydroquinone]]s, in some cases catalyzing the production of superoxide from dioxygen or hydrogen peroxide from superoxide.

==Immune defense==
The immune system uses the lethal effects of oxidants by making production of oxidizing species a central part of its mechanism of killing pathogens; with activated [[phagocyte]]s producing both ROS and reactive nitrogen species. These include superoxide {{chem|(•O|2|-|)}}, nitric oxide (•NO) and their particularly reactive product, peroxynitrite (ONOO-).&lt;ref name="pmid10922044"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nathan C, Shiloh MU |title=Reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates in the relationship between mammalian hosts and microbial pathogens |journal=Proc.

==Male infertility==

[[Sperm]] [[DNA fragmentation]] appears to be an important factor in the [[cause (medicine)|aetiology]] of [[male infertility]], since men with high DNA fragmentation levels have significantly lower odds of conceiving.&lt;ref name="pmid24745838"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wright C, Milne S, Leeson H |title=Sperm DNA damage caused by oxidative stress: modifiable clinical, lifestyle and nutritional factors in male infertility |journal=Reprod.

==Origin of [[eukaryote]]s==

The [[great oxygenation event]] began with the biologically induced appearance of [[oxygen]]  in the earth’s atmosphere about 2.45 billion years ago.  The rise of oxygen levels due to [[cyanobacteria]]l [[photosynthesis]] in ancient microenvironments was probably highly toxic to the surrounding biota.  Under these conditions, the selective pressure of oxidative stress is thought to have driven the evolutionary transformation of an [[archaea]]l lineage into the first eukaryotes.&lt;ref name="pmid20731852"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gross J, Bhattacharya D |title=Uniting sex and eukaryote origins in an emerging oxygenic world |journal=Biol. Direct |volume=5 |issue= |pages=53 |date=August 2010 |pmid=20731852 |pmc=2933680 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-5-53 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oxidative stress might have acted in synergy with other environmental stresses (such as [[ultraviolet]] radiation and/or [[desiccation]]) to drive this selection.  Selective pressure for efficient repair of oxidative DNA damages may have promoted the evolution of eukaryotic sex involving such features as cell-[[cell fusion]]s, [[cytoskeleton]]-mediated [[chromosome]] movements and emergence of the [[nuclear membrane]].&lt;ref name="pmid20731852" /&gt;  Thus the evolution of [[meiosis|meiotic]] sex and eukaryogenesis may have been inseparable processes that evolved in large part to facilitate repair of oxidative DNA damages.&lt;ref name="pmid20731852" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C.

When the males have a diploid number of chromosomes they are termed ''parahaploids'' as the paternal genes are not expressed at all.&lt;ref name=Borsa1996/&gt; The paternal chromosomes are inactivated by heterochromatization in all the cells at an early embryonic stage. The adult cells have one set of inactive ''H chromosomes'' and one set of euchromatin ''E chromosomes''. These H chromosomes are eliminated from the sperm during or just before spermatogenesis. In a few other species all the cells in an adult are haploid due to elimination of the paternal chromosomes at an early developmental stage. This variant is called the ''diaspidid system'' after the [[scale insect]] clade ([[Diaspididae]]) where it was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = L. | last2 = Pen | first2 = I. | last3 = Shuker | first3 = D.

Genetically this system is equivalent both to [[haplodiploid]] [[arrhenotoky]] where the males are haploid and develop from unfertilized eggs and to certain cases of diploid arrhenotoky where the males get a diploid set chromosome set from their mother but inactivate and fail to pass on half of them.&lt;ref name=Normark2003&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Normark | first1 = B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2489">A '''meat slurry''', '''reconstituted meat''', or '''emulsified meat''' is a liquefied [[meat]] product that contains fewer fats, pigments and less [[myoglobin]] than unprocessed [[dark meat]]s. Meat [[slurry]] is more malleable than dark meats and eases the process of meat distribution as [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] may be used.

Meat slurry is not designed to sell for general consumption; rather, it is used as a meat supplement in food products for humans, such as [[chicken nuggets]], and food for domestic animals. [[Poultry]] is the most common meat slurry;{{fact|date=June 2016}} however, [[beef]] and [[pork]] are also used.

==Properties and production==
Dark meat from poultry's characteristics, its color, low plasticity and high fat content, are caused by [[myoglobin]], a pigmented chemical compound found in muscle tissue that undergoes frequent use. Because domestic [[poultry]] rarely fly, the flight muscles in the breast contain little [[myoglobin]] and appear white. Dark meat which is high in myoglobin is less useful in industry, especially [[fast food]], because it is difficult to mold into shapes. Processing dark meat into a slurry makes it more like white meat, easier to prepare.

The meat is first finely ground and mixed with water. The mixture is then used in a [[centrifuge]] or with an [[emulsifier]] to separate the fats and [[myoglobin]] from the muscle. The product is then allowed to settle into three layers: meat, excess water, and fat. The remaining liquefied meat is then [[Flash freezing|flash-frozen]] and packaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | title = Encyclopedia of Meat Sciences: Chemistry and Physics of Comminuted Products | author1 = Carrick Devine | author2 = M.

'''''Soultaker''''' is a 1990 American [[Fantasy film|fantasy]] [[horror film]] written by [[Vivian Schilling]] and directed by Michael Rissi. It stars [[Joe Estevez]] in the title role, alongside Vivian Schilling, Gregg Thomsen, Chuck Williams, [[Robert Z'Dar]], and [[David "Shark" Fralick]]. The film follows a group who try to flee from the 'Soultaker' when their souls are ejected from their bodies after a car accident.

The film received positive reviews from [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] and [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']], but received negative criticism for its story and special effects. It won the [[Saturn Award]] for "Best Genre Video Release" in 1992. A sequel was planned and actors such as [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] were named for the cast, but the sequel was never made and Schilling turned its premise into a novel. ''Soultaker'' was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of the comedy television series ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

==Plot ==
During a summer festival, The Angel of Death ([[Robert Z'Dar]]) instructs his "Soultaker" subordinate ([[Joe Estevez]]) to kill five people: Zack (Gregg Thomsen), Zack's friends Brad ([[David "Shark" Fralick]]) and Tommy (Chuck Williams), Brad's girlfriend Candice (Cinda Lou Freeman), and Zack's ex-girlfriend Natalie ([[Vivian Schilling]]). The Soultaker notices a striking resemblance between Natalie and his lover, whom he killed in his former life. After Natalie's friend leaves her behind, Zack offers her a ride home in Brad's car. Brad is high on cocaine and reluctant to drive Natalie; he drives at high speed before crashing to avoid hitting the Soultaker. Candice dies instantly while Natalie, Brad, Zack, and Tommy's souls leave their bodies. The Soultaker takes Candice's soul and informs the Angel of Death, who orders the Soultaker to recover the other souls. Thinking they survived the crash, the four return to the car, unaware their bodies were taken to a hospital. While investigating the car, the Soultaker reveals himself and claims Brad's soul; the others, helpless to stop him, flee.

The others run into a convenience store, where attempt to tell the cashier—who cannot see them—someone is after them. While inside, they see a news report surrounding the events of the crash. This confuses the trio, and Natalie accuses Zack of knowing Brad was on drugs. They leave the store and make a 911 call but the operator hangs up on them. The Soultaker appears and grabs Natalie to claim her soul but her resemblance to his past lover stays his hand. Zack rescues Natalie and they both flee, leaving Tommy behind. The Angel of Death reprimands his subordinate for failing to take Natalie. The Soultaker later takes Brad and Tommy's soul.

Zack and Natalie go to Natalie's house, where Zack and Natalie tell her mother Anna (Jean Reiner) about the Soultaker. Zack and Natalie reconcile while Anna goes to run a bath for Natalie. While Natalie bathes, her mother watches her behind the bathroom door. Zack is watching television when news of the crash is shown. Natalie's father Mayor Grant (David Fawcett) announces live that the life support systems of Natalie and Zack will be turned off at midnight. During the news broadcast, Natalie's mother appears onscreen; at the same time, the "mother" watching Natalie suddenly morphs into the Soultaker. He attempts to make a pact with her, offering her eternal life on condition that she stays by his side forever. Zack arrives and attempts to attack the Soultaker, but is overpowered. Natalie tries to shoots the Soultaker with no effect. Natalie tells the Soultaker she wants to be with Zack and the Soultaker throws Zack out of the window. Zack survives the fall.

Natalie and Zack escape and flee to the hospital, hoping to return to their bodies before midnight. Natalie is captured by the Soultaker on an elevator that leads to the afterlife; he claims he is an angel charged with collecting souls. He persuades Natalie there is nothing left for her in living realm, that Zack is already dead, and that she can be saved if she stays with him. While searching for Natalie, Zack encounters Brad, who has become a Soultaker. Brad tells him that people who kill someone—even by accident—must pay for it with service as a grim reaper. With Brad's help, Zack enters the afterlife and rescues Natalie. Brad gives Zack two empty soul rings to help Zack and Natalie return to their bodies.

They find Natalie's body and she places herself in the ring but remains comatose. Zack discovers that a pendant she was wearing acted as a barrier between her soul and her body. He pulls her soul from her body to reattempt the process when the Soultaker reappears. After a chase around the hospital, Zack is cornered on the roof and escapes by leaping off. The Soultaker is confronted by the Angel of Death, who informs him that it is past midnight and that the Soultaker has failed. The Soultaker pleads with the Angel but is imprisoned into a soul ring by his master. Zack returns to his body and saves Natalie's life; he later visits her when she is discharged from the hospital.

==Production==
''Soultaker'' was written by [[Vivian Schilling]]. Inspiration for the film came in discussions between  Schilling and [[Action International Pictures]] producer Eric Parkinson. Schilling based her script on a real-life car-accident event that happened to her and a friend.&lt;ref name="Femme"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|date=Winter 1992-1993|title=Vivian Schilling|pages=40–45|last=Thonen|first=John|volume=1|issue=5|url=https://archive.org/stream/Femme_Fatales_v01n03#page/n41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The script was written in the span of four months.&lt;ref name="Fangoria"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Fangoria]]|last=McDonagh|first=Maitland|issue=102|page=29|title=Baring Her Soul|date=May 1991|url=https://archive.org/stream/Fangoria_102_1991_Nagus_Joined_Poster_Fix_incl_c2c#page/n25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Joe Estevez]] starred as the titular "Soultaker";  Originally he was asked to play the Mayor, Grant McMillan.{{sfn|Paulson|Watson|2012}} As well as writing the script for the film, Vivian Schilling played the female lead Natalie McMillan. Schilling had previously acted in [[Fred Olen Ray]]'s ''[[Prison Ship]]'' and a nurse in the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]''.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt;

''Soultaker'' was shot in [[Mobile, Alabama]], in five weeks with a budget of $250,000.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-30/entertainment/ca-414_1_michael-rissi-film|title=O.C.

''Soultaker'' was his first main feature; he had previously directed the 1987 short film ''Snake Eyes'', which became part of the anthology movie ''Terror Eyes'', which Eric Parkinson and Vivian Schilling were also involved with.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Originally reluctant to direct, Rissi decided to join after being interested in directing a film involving [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]]s. Rissi's contributions to the film resulted in it being released as "A Michael Rissi Film" for both the promotional material and film credits.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;

Problems mounted during production. In an interview with ''[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]'', Vivian Schilling noted that almost a third of the script had to be re-written because of time and money constraints.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Schilling later wrote an article for the magazine about a scene not written by her but added by investors and the film crew, in which she was asked to appear naked. Despite claims it would increase sales for the film, Schilling avoided appearing nude in the scene.&lt;ref name="Femme3"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|date=Fall 1994|title=Vivian Schilling: Exposing Myself On Film|last=Schilling|first=Vivian|author-link=Vivian Schilling|pages=61–62|volume=3|issue=2|url=https://archive.org/stream/Femme_Fatales_v03n02#page/n61}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of the car-crash scene, the car could not be started, causing the loss of a half-day's production.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;

==Release==
''Soultaker'' was distributed by Action International Pictures. Originally planned to be released [[straight to video]], it received a limited theatrical release; eight prints of it were distributed in the United States on October 26, 1990.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/90925/Soultaker/misc-notes.html|title=Soultaker - Miscellaneous Notes|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=September 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vivian Schilling said the movie was successful in theaters but flopped in her hometown, [[Witchita, Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; ''Soultaker'' was released on [[VHS]] on January 24, 1991.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TCM"/&gt; It was also released on [[DVD]] by Imagine Entertainment in 1999 and [[Hannover House]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmovie.com/movie/soultaker-v45738/releases|title=Soultaker (1990) - Releases|publisher=[[Allmovie]]|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Critical reception for ''Soultaker'' has been mostly negative, with criticism directed at the film's story, and special effects.
''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Mark Chalon Smith unfavorably compared ''Soultaker'' to 1968's ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'', both of which were made with a small budget. Smith said having a small budget "doesn't necessarily mean a movie can't be fun and scary" but ''Soultaker'' was not fun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-01-30/entertainment/ca-413_1_soultaker-movie-fun|title=O.

[[Michael Dare]] of [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] directed praise towards the film in his review, calling it a "good looking, low-budget fantasy thriller", though he noted the film cast's [[overacting]] and its transformation into "several layers of advanced silliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Dare|first=Michael|date=November 24, 1990|page=52|title=Book Space For `Grim' Stories &amp; Other `Tall' Tales}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s Larry Cohn spoke positively about ''Soultaker'', comparing its portrayal of the afterlife to be more consistent than the film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media]]|last=Cohn|first=Larry|title=Soultaker|date=November 5, 1990|volume=341|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'']] also called the film a "[[micro-budget]] variation on ''Ghost'', criticizing the special effects and Michael Rissi's direction, but praising Vivian Schilling for her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/film/soultaker|title=Soultaker, directed by Michael Rissi|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the film later won the "Best Genre Video Release" award during the [[18th Saturn Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1991/1991sat.htm|title=1991 18th Saturn Awards|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017175735/http://theenvelope.latimes.com/extras/lostmind/year/1991/1991sat.htm|archivedate=October 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Sequel===
A sequel was planned for the movie; it went through name changes from "Dark Angel" to "Dark World". Producers planned to cast [[James Earl Jones]] and [[Faye Dunaway]] in one iteration of the production, and [[Donald Sutherland]] was also in talks.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Robert Z'Dar commented that [[William Shatner]] was interested in playing the boss of Z'Dar's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Gorezone|publisher=[[Fangoria]]|title=Behind the Bloody Badge: Maniac Cop|last=Barsky|first=Larry|issue=18|date=Summer 1991|page=12|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gorezone_018_Summer_1991_with_Posters_HQS_c2c#page/n11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Tibor Takács (director)|Tibor Takács]] was due to direct the project and production was planned for January 1993 in Canada.&lt;ref name="Femme"/&gt; Eventually, the concept of the unmade script was turned a novel; Schilling said she "embellished the premise" and added new characters to the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Femme Fatales (magazine)|Femme Fatales]]|date=Winter 1992-1993|title=Vivian Schilling|pages=40–45|last=Thonen|first=John|volume=1|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Mystery Science Theater 3000''===
''Soultaker'' was featured in the tenth-season premiere episode of ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' (''MST3K''), a comedy television series in which the character [[Mike Nelson (character)|Mike Nelson]] and his two robot friends [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]] are forced to watch 'bad films' as part of an ongoing scientific experiment. The episode was broadcast on the [[Sci-Fi Channel]] on April 11, 1999. The episode also saw the guest appearances of series creator and original host of ''MST3K'' [[Joel Hodgson]] as [[Joel Robinson]] and [[Frank Conniff]] as [[TV's Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Cinefantastique]]|title=Mystery Science Theatre: Season Ten on the Satellite of Love launches after news of show's demise|date=May 1999|last=Cziraky|first=Dan|page=6|volume=31|number=5|url=https://the-eye.eu/public/Books/Cinefantastique/Cinefantastique%20Vol%2031%20No%205%20%28May%201999%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/old-new-hosts-launch-mst-3000-season-article-1.824636|title=Old &amp; New Hosts Launch 'MST 3000' Season|last=Bianculli|first=David|publisher=[[New York Daily News]]|date=April 9, 1999|accessdate=August 6, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805223558/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/old-new-hosts-launch-mst-3000-season-article-1.824636|archivedate=August 5, 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jokes comparing Vivian Schilling to [[Tonya Harding]] were made.

==Local campaigns==
===Canada===
Stop Murder Music (Canada) is an independent branch of the organization in [[Canada]], founded by Akim Adé Larcher, after learning at a local [[West Indian]] store about a Canadian Tour by Elephant Man.  Larcher, a Canadian/Saint Lucian, brought together over 20 organizations from the African and Caribbean communities in Canada to form the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mygsa.ca/SMMC |title=Stop Murder Music (Canada) (SMMC) &amp;#124; Egale Canada's |publisher=Mygsa.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Despite not causing any artists to be denied entry visas, the campaign was able to get concert venues cancelled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Krishna Rau / Toronto / Thursday, October 11, 2007 |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?AFF_TYPE=3&amp;STORY_ID=3703&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=1 |title=Koolhaus cancels concerts amid queer outrage |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2007-10-11 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also get iTunes to remove some tracks by Buju Banton, Elephant Man and TOK that they deemed contrary to their standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Jenna Wakani photo) |url=http://www.xtra.ca/public/viewstory.aspx?STORY_ID=4593&amp;PUB_TEMPLATE_ID=2 |title=iTunes Canada pulls anti-gay dancehall songs |publisher=Xtra.ca |date=2008-04-07 |accessdate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and [[OutRage!]] campaigned on behalf of the stop murder music campaign, including petitioning the [[United Kingdom]] [[Home Secretary]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Reggae star barred from Britain. |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104071246/http://petertatchell.net/pop_music/sizzla.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-01-04 |title=Sizzla Denied Visa |publisher=Peter Tatchell |date= |accessdate=2012-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for and against==
Tatchell has called for laws against homophobic music and the Campaign participated in protests outside concerts. The Campaign has especially objected to lyrics which they allege to support violence, including allegedly murder, towards gay men. Dennis Carney, chair of the Black Gay Men's Advisory Group, argued in 2004 that the [[MOBO Awards]] had a responsibility to exclude anti-gay artists because, "homophobic lyrics in music normalise hatred towards black gay men."&lt;ref&gt;Graver, Mark (2004). [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/13190.php "Why homophobic lyrics in reggae music are a health issue for black gay men"], ''MedicalNewsToday.com''. Article Date: 10 Sep 2004 - 9:00 PDT.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The UK International Development Minister [[Gareth Thomas (English politician)|Gareth Thomas]] argued in a speech that, "A number of artists [such as Sizzla and Buju Banton] are effectively contributing to the spread of HIV by producing reggae and rap songs actually encouraging discrimination against those who have AIDS and encouraging violence against minority groups such as men who have sex with men...Yes, we believe in free speech, but nobody in a democracy should be able to incite violence against minorities."&lt;ref&gt;(22 November 2004). [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/4031847.stm "HIV warning over reggae lyrics"], ''BBC News''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boseley, Sarah (22 November 2004). [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/nov/22/health.aids "Reggae stars 'fuel spread of HIV'"], ''Guardian.co.uk''.&lt;/ref&gt; He cited John King and the [[Mighty Gabby]] as examples of musicians who are positive role models against violence and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Gareth Thomas.

=== Criticism ===
Tatchell and the Stop Murder Music campaign have been criticized by The Black Music Council, a British organisation formed in 2004 in response to the campaign by the president of Blacker Dread Records, [[Blacker Dread]], in order, "to protect the rights of the eight artistes placed on the OutRage! hit list".&lt;ref name="Roache"&gt;Alicia Roache, Staff Reporter.

'''TI-polaron''' (translation-invariant [[polaron]]) – elementary [[quasiparticle]] in solid state. The ground state of TI-polaron is a delocalized state of electron-phonon system: the probabilities of [[Electron|electron's]] occurrence at any point of a space are similar. Both the electron density and the amplitudes of [[phonon]] modes (renormalized by an interaction with the electron) are delocalized. The concept of a ''polaron potential well'' (formed by local phonons) in which the electron is localized, i.e. self-trapped state is lacking. Accordingly, the induced polarization charge of the translation-invariant polaron is equal to zero.

The ground state energy of the translation-invariant polaron is lower than that of Pekar polaron and is E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.125720 α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;ref&gt;V.D. Lakhno. Pekar's ansatz and the strong coupling problem in polaron theory. Phys. Usp., 2015, Vol.58, P.295–308. DOI: 10.3367/UFNr.0185.201503d.0317&lt;/ref&gt; (for Pekar polaron E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = -0.10851128 α&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where α is electron-phonon coupling.

TI-polarons can create bound TI-bipolaron states, which play an important role in the theory of superconductivity.&lt;ref&gt;V.D. Lakhno. Superconducting properties of 3D low-density TI-bipolaron gas. preprint, 2015,  arXiv:1507.08510.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Timothy Dexter''' (January 22, 1747 – October 26, 1806) was an American businessman noted for his writing and [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentricity]].

==Biography==
Dexter was born in [[Malden, Massachusetts]]. He had little schooling and worked as a [[farm laborer]] at the age of 8.&lt;ref name="Nicholas p.147-151"&gt;Margaret Nicholas, ''The World's Greatest Cranks and Crackpots'', {{ISBN|0-7064-1713-5}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;147–151.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 16, he became an [[apprentice]] to a leather-dresser.&lt;ref name="rdstrange"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Reader's Digest Book of Strange Stories, Amazing Facts |year=1975 |publisher=Reader's Digest Association |page=501}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1769, he moved to [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]]. He married Elizabeth Frothingham, a rich widow, and bought a mansion.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Some of his social contemporaries considered him unintelligent.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Many of them gave him bad business advice to discredit him and make him lose his fortune.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

At the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], he bought large amounts of depreciated [[Early American currency#Continental currency|Continental currency]] that was worthless at the time. After the war was over, the U.S. government made good on the dollars.{{dubious|date=September 2015}} By the time trade connections resumed, he had amassed a fortune.{{dubious|date=September 2015}} He built two ships and began an export business to the [[West Indies]] and to Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Because he was largely uneducated, his business sense was considered peculiar. He was inspired to send warming pans (used to heat sheets in the cold New England winters) for sale to the West Indies, a tropical area. His captain sold them as ladles for the local molasses industry and made a good profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/lord-timothy-dexter-newburyport-massachusetts-wealthy-111411.html?cat=38 |title=Lord Timothy Dexter of Newburyport, Massachusetts: Wealthy by Mistake? |author=Jim Stillman |agency=Yahoo!

People jokingly told him to "[[Coals to Newcastle|ship coal to Newcastle]]". He did so during a miners' strike at the time, and his cargo was sold at a premium.&lt;ref name="knapp"&gt;{{cite book | last = Knapp | first = Samuel L. | title = Life of Lord Timothy Dexter: Embracing sketches of the eccentric characters that composed his associates, including "Dexter's Pickle for the knowing ones" | publisher = J.E.

His ships arrived there in time to sell the gloves to Portuguese boats on their way to China.&lt;ref name="knapp"/&gt;

He exported Bibles to the [[East Indies]] and stray [[cat]]s to Caribbean islands and again made a profit; eastern missionaries were in need of the Bibles and the Caribbean welcomed a solution to rat infestation.&lt;ref name="Nicholas p.147-151"/&gt; He also hoarded [[whalebone]] by mistake, but ended up selling them profitably as a support material for [[corset]]s.&lt;ref name="Nicholas p.147-151"/&gt;

Members of the [[New England]] high society rarely socialized with him. Dexter decided to buy a huge house in [[Newburyport]] from Nathaniel Tracy, a local socialite, and tried to emulate them.&lt;ref name="Nicholas p.147-151"/&gt; His relationships with his wife, daughter, and son also suffered. This became evident when he started telling visitors that his wife had died (despite the fact that she was still alive) and that the woman who frequented the building was simply her ghost.&lt;ref name="Nicholas p.147-151"/&gt; In one notable episode, Dexter faked his own death to see how people would react. About 3,000 people attended Dexter's mock [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]. Dexter did not see his wife cry, and after he revealed the hoax, he [[caning|caned]] her for not grieving his death sufficiently.&lt;ref&gt;^ Todd, William Cleaves ''Timothy Dexter''. Boston, Massachusetts: David Clapp &amp; Son, 1886: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dexter also bought an estate in [[Chester, New Hampshire]]. He decorated his house in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]] with [[minaret]]s, a golden eagle on the top of the [[cupola]], a [[mausoleum]] for himself and a garden of 40 wooden statues of famous men, including [[George Washington]], [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and himself. It had the inscription, "I am the first in the East, the first in the West, and the greatest philosopher in the Western World".

==Writing==
At age 50, Dexter authored ''A Pickle for the Knowing Ones or Plain Truth in a Homespun Dress'', in which he complained about [[politician]]s, the [[clergy]], and his wife. The book contained 8,847 words and 33,864 letters, but without punctuation and seemingly random capitalization. Dexter initially handed his book out for free, but it became popular and was reprinted eight times.&lt;ref name="rdstrange"/&gt; In the second edition, Dexter added an extra page which consisted of 13 lines of punctuation marks with the instructions that readers could distribute them as they pleased.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Randy F. ''The Almanac of American Letters''. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: p. 207. {{ISBN|0-86576-008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Timothy Dexter House, Newburyport, MA.jpg|thumb|''"Lord" Timothy Dexter House'', Newburyport, Massachusetts.]]
Dexter's Newburyport house became a [[hotel]].&lt;ref name="Nicholas p.147-151"/&gt; Storms ruined most of his statues; the only identified survivor was that of William Pitt. His book remains his primary legacy to this day.

'''Tom Butler''' was an American pioneer professional track cyclist. He won the national sprint title in 1898 and finished second at the [[1899 UCI Track Cycling World Championships]]. His elder brothers [[Nat Butler|Nat]] and Frank were also professional cyclists; the brothers often competed together, working as a team against other riders. This was also the case at the 1899 World Championships, where Nat finished fourth.&lt;ref name=ca/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritchie1996"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8688">'''Tusko''' is a popular name given to [[elephant]]s in captivity. Several notable elephants have been given this [[moniker]].

==The Meanest Elephant==

Formerly known as "Ned", this Tusko was a giant circus [[elephant]] captured at age 6 in Siam (now [[Thailand]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=5270 HistoryLink Tusko the elephant rampages through Sedro-Woolley on May 15, 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; He stood just five feet high when he was unloaded from a sailing ship at [[New York harbor]] in 1898.

By 1922, he was touted as "The Meanest Elephant"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pdxhistory.com/html/lotus_isle.html Image of "Ten-ton, 12-foot Tusko the Elephant with his owner, Al Painter"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as "the largest elephant ever in captivity", though at 10-feet-2-inches tall (3.1 meters), he was seven inches shorter than [[Jumbo]].  Nonetheless, Tusko was a ton heavier than Jumbo and the largest elephant in [[North America]] since Jumbo. The [[tusks]] which earned him his name were about seven feet long (213 centimeters).

No other [[circus]] wanted Tusko and he spent some time in an exhibition road show, accompanied by his keeper and lifelong devotee, young George "Slim" Lewis. Tusko ended his days in the [[Woodland Park Zoo|Seattle Zoo]], dying of a [[Thrombosis|blood clot]] on June 10, 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Death Takes Tusko, Big Elephant That Lived Stormy Life |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/474766192.html?dids=474766192:474766192&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+11,+1933&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=DEATH+TAKES+TUSKO,+BIG+ELEPHANT+THAT+LIVED+STORMY+LIFE&amp;pqatl=google |quote=Tusko one of the largest and most publicized elephants In captivity survived hundreds of death threats and other perils brought on by his temper ament only ... |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=June 11, 1933 |accessdate=2010-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The elephant on LSD==

"Tusko" was also the name of a male [[Indian elephant]] at the [[Oklahoma City]] [[Zoo]]. On August 3, 1962,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ufl.edu/~steh/PSB3002/LSDelephant.pdf "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide: Its Effects on a Male Asiatic Elephant"], by Louis Jolyon West, Chester M. Pierce, and Warren D. Thomas, ''Science'' Magazine, December 7, 1962, pp1100-1102&lt;/ref&gt; researchers from the [[University of Oklahoma]] injected (human use involves oral ingestion) 297&amp;nbsp;mg of [[LSD]] (lysergic acid diethylamide) to him, which is over 1,000 times the dose typical of human recreational use. Within five minutes he collapsed to the ground and one hour and forty minutes later he died. It is believed that the LSD was the cause of his death, although some speculate that the drugs the researchers used in an attempt to revive him may have contributed to his death.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/research/story/0,9865,770756,00.html

==Portland, Oregon Zoo==

An Asian elephant by the name "Tusko" resided at the [[Oregon Zoo]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] from 2005 until December 2015. It is believed he was born in the wilds of [[Thailand]] around 1970, and was about 45 years old by the time of his death.

Tusko arrived at the Oregon Zoo in June 2005 on a breeding loan.  He had successfully sired three calves in the past; two while living in Canada and one in California.  Tusko had also successfully mated with Rose-Tu, the youngest elephant in the herd at the time.  On August 23, 2008, she delivered her first offspring, a male named Samudra and nicknamed Sam. Sam is also the first third-generation elephant born in the United States. Zoo officials have stated that they were very lucky to find a bull like Tusko.  He was a good match for the herd, providing genetic diversity as well as great social skills, experience with calves, a gentle nature with the females and positive role model for Samudra.&lt;ref name="FAQ" /&gt;

Rose-Tu and Tusko again mated successfully in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; and her second calf, a female named Lily, was born on November 30, 2012.  A controversy was sparked when the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' reported&lt;ref name="Berens"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; that the new baby would become the property of [[Perris, California|Perris]]-based Have Trunk Will Travel, a company which offers elephant rides at fairs, zoos and weddings.&lt;ref name="Berens" /&gt;  Zoo officials explained that although the breeding contract states that the zoo owns the first, third and fifth of Tusko's offspring, while the California company owns the second, fourth and sixth baby elephant,&lt;ref name="Craig"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; there are no plans to ship the elephant to California. The plan has always been for Rose-Tu and her baby to stay together their whole lives as they would in the wild;&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; however, the legal details of the arrangement cannot be negotiated before the elephant is one month old. Eventually, the Oregon Zoo foundation did a fundraiser to purchase both Lily and Tusko for $400,000, giving the zoo legal ownership of both.

There were plans for Tusko to also mate with the zoo's other two females, Shine and Chendra, although they never materialized. Tusko underwent two surgeries to have his tusks removed due to risk of chronic infection. He was blind in his right eye.

In June 2014, the elephant tested positive for [[tuberculosis]]. An 18-month treatment began that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregonzoo.org/news/2014/06/zoo-re-test-elephant-tusko-after-inconclusive-tb-results|title=Zoo to re-test elephant Tusko after inconclusive TB results|publisher=Oregon Zoo|date=June 3, 2014|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://katu.com/news/local/tusko-becomes-third-elephant-at-oregon-zoo-to-contract-tuberculosis|title=Tusko becomes third elephant at Oregon Zoo to contract tuberculosis|author=The Associated Press|publisher=KATU News – On Your Side|date=June 10, 2014|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late December 2015, a decades-old right-rear foot injury flared up, forcing Tusko to use his other three legs and his trunk to bear weight. His right-front foot then became infected and swollen, and Tusko had difficulty standing and walking. He was euthanized on December 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/12/oregon_zoos_tusko_dies_after_s.html&lt;/ref&gt; Zoo officials said they did not know exactly how the injury occurred, however that it had happened while he was a circus elephant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/animal/tusko-the-elephant-euthanized-at-oregon-zoo/7342621|title=Tusko the elephant euthanized at Oregon Zoo|author=Blackman, Teresa|publisher=KGW News|date=December 22, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/2015/12/22/oregon-zoo-elephant-tusko-euthanized/77764862/|title=Oregon Zoo elephant Tusko euthanized|author=Statesman Journal staff|publisher=Statesman Journal|date=December 22, 2015|accessdate=December 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{USS|Amberjack|SS-219}} was a [[Gato class submarine|''Gato''-class]] [[submarine]], the first [[United States Navy]] ship named for the [[amberjack]], a vigorous sport fish found in the western Atlantic from [[New England]] to [[Brazil]].

Her keel was laid by the [[Electric Boat]] Company of [[Groton, Connecticut]], on 15 May 1941. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 6 March 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Randall Jacobs), and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 19 June 1942, [[Lieutenant Commander]] John A. Bole, Jr. in command.

==Service history==
[[File:SS-219 pre launch.jpg|left|thumb|The Amberjack (SS-219) in bunting at her launching at the Electric Boat Co., Groton, CT., 6 March 1942.]]
After shakedown training in waters off [[New London, Connecticut]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]], ''Amberjack'' got underway on 20 July, bound for the Pacific. She transited the [[Panama Canal]] in mid-August and reached [[Pearl Harbor]] on 20 August. Following training exercises, ''Amberjack'' got underway for her first war patrol on 3 September. Two days later, she touched at [[Johnston Island]] to refuel and, later that day, resumed her voyage to her patrol area between the northeast coast of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], [[Solomon Islands]].

On 15 September, ''Amberjack'' was patrolling off [[Kavieng, New Ireland]]. Three days later, she made contact with a large [[Japan]]ese transport escorted by a [[destroyer]], and fired a spread of four [[torpedo]]es at the vessels, but none hit. While patrolling in [[Bougainville Strait]] on 19 September, the submarine launched two torpedoes at an enemy freighter. The first hit under the target's bridge, and the second broke her keel in two. ''Amberjack'' was credited with having sunk ''Shirogane Maru''.

''Amberjack'' made her next contact with Japanese shipping on 25 September, spotting a large [[cruiser]] escorted by a [[destroyer]]. However, before the submarine could get into position for an attack, the destroyer headed toward her and forced her to go deep. Several [[depth charge]]s were dropped on the submarine, but they inflicted no damage. During the next few days, ''Amberjack'' reconnoitered [[Tau]], [[Kilinailau]], [[Greenwich Island]], and [[Banaba Island|Ocean Island]].

The submarine spotted a Japanese [[cruiser]] on the morning of 30 September and launched four [[torpedo]]es from her bow tubes. None hit, so she fired another two forward tubes shortly thereafter. These also went wide of the mark, and the cruiser escaped damage. One week later, the submarine was patrolling off [[Kavieng]] when she spotted smoke on the horizon. After a Japanese cargo ship sailed into view, ''Amberjack'' launched two torpedoes. One missed forward and the other hit the target's hull forward. The enemy ship was still able to continue under her own power and ''Amberjack'' took up pursuit. About one hour later, both sides opened fire with their deck guns but neither was within range of the other and they broke off fire. After two more hours of the chase, the submarine fired a slow speed torpedo which hit its target five minutes later. The cargo vessel, later identified as ''Senkai Maru'', swung left and seemed to stop. Its bow swung up in the air, the ship took a vertical position, and sank from sight shortly thereafter. Lifeboats carrying the cargo ship's survivors were later spotted as the submarine headed for [[Kavieng]].

While patrolling off [[Kavieng Harbor]] on 10 October, ''Amberjack'' spotted Japanese ships in the harbor and launched four torpedoes into the anchorage. One damaged a freighter and another damaged ''Tonan Maru II'', (19,262 tons) which was being used to ferry airplanes. The vessel sank in shallow water, but was later salvaged, towed to Japan for repairs, and was returned to service. On 16 October, the submarine headed for [[Espiritu Santo]] for repairs to her ballast tanks and arrived there on 19 October. While undergoing repairs, she was assigned the task of hauling aviation gas, bombs, and personnel to [[Guadalcanal]]. While en route to the Solomons, her destination was changed to [[Tulagi]]. She arrived there on 25 October and unloaded her embarked troops and cargo under the cover of darkness. The next day, she set course for [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]], [[Australia]], and reached that port on 30 October.

After a refit alongside {{USS|Griffin|AS-13|2}} and a series of training exercises, ''Amberjack'' began her second war patrol on 21 November. On the morning of 27 November, the submarine encountered two enemy [[destroyer]]s which were probably carrying supplies for Japanese forces on [[Guadalcanal]]. While launching four torpedoes from her stern tubes, the submarine heard the screws of a third ship crossing ahead of her bow. None of the torpedoes hit their target, and the submarine began to take action to avoid [[depth charge]]s. Approximately two hours later, all sounds had faded away, and the submarine rose to the surface to look for signs of damage. She spotted nothing so she assumed a new station at the southern end of the eastern entrance to [[Shortland Harbor]].

On 29 November, while on patrol ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) east of the [[Treasury Islands]], ''Amberjack'' spotted a surfaced Japanese submarine. Before she could set up an attack, however, the enemy vessel rapidly drew away. She again saw a Japanese submarine on 3 December proceeding toward the entrance to Shortland harbor and sent four torpedoes toward the fleeing enemy, but all failed to hit. During the next one and one-half weeks, she made numerous ship contacts, but carried out no attacks. On 15 December, the submarine sighted a convoy consisting of four or five ships on a course for [[Rabaul]] and launched two torpedoes at a large freighter, one at a small tanker, and one more at a small freighter. However, she apparently inflicted no damage on any of the targets.

Her next contact occurred on 20 December. While patrolling submerged, ''Amberjack'' began hearing a series of explosions which drew closer and closer. She surfaced and saw two Japanese [[destroyer escort]]s, which soon thereafter began raining depth charges on the submarine. Within the space of one minute, six exploded close aboard, shook the vessel considerably, and caused numerous broken light bulbs forward. Some fittings mounted on the overhead were broken off, and several valves were sprung open. However, the submarine suffered no crippling damage and moved on to continue her patrol off the northeast coast of [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]].

She spotted another Japanese ship on 3 January 1943, a destroyer which apparently was waiting to rendezvous with a convoy from the Palau Islands. The submarine was unable to attack the ship and, two days later, set a course for [[Brisbane, Queensland]]. She reached that port on 11 January and safely concluded her patrol.

Following this patrol, the submarine's period of refit was cut to 12 days due to the urgent need for submarines to patrol enemy infested waters. She got underway on 24 January but was forced to return to Brisbane for repair of minor leaks which developed during a deep dive. Again departing Brisbane on 26 January, ''Amberjack'' started her third war patrol in the Solomons area. On 29 January she was directed to pass close to [[Tetipari Island]] and then proceed to the northwest and patrol the approaches to [[Shortland Basin]]. Orders were radioed on 1 February for her to move north and patrol the western approaches to [[Buka Passage]]. Having complied with these orders, ''Amberjack'' made her first miles southeast of [[Treasury Island]] on 1 February, and of sinking a two-masted [[schooner]] by gunfire {{convert|20|mi|km}} from [[Buka Island|Buka]] the afternoon of 3 February 1943. At this time she was ordered to move south along the Buka-Shortland traffic lane and patrol east of [[Vella Lavella Island]].

In a second radio transmission on 4 February, ''Amberjack'' reported having sunk a 5,000&amp;nbsp;ton freighter laden with explosives in a two-hour night surface attack that date in which five torpedoes were fired. During this engagement, an officer was slightly wounded in the hand by machine gun fire. Chief Pharmacist's Mate Arthur C. Beeman, went to the bridge to assist the officer and was killed by machine gun fire.&lt;ref&gt;https://navy.togetherweserved.com/usn/servlet/tws.webapp.WebApp?cmd=ShadowBoxProfile&amp;type=Person&amp;ID=505910&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February, ''Amberjack'' was ordered to move to the west side of [[Ganongga Island]] and on 10 February, she was directed to keep south of latitude 7°30'S and to cover the traffic routes from [[Rabaul]] and [[Buka Island]] to [[Shortland Basin]]. On 13 February, ''Amberjack'' was assigned the entire Rabaul-Buka-Shortland Sea area and told to hunt for traffic.

The last radio transmission received from ''Amberjack'' was made on 14 February. She related having been forced down the night before by two [[destroyer]]s, and that she had recovered from the water and taken prisoner an enemy aviator on 13 February. She was ordered north of latitude 6°30'S, and told to keep hunting for [[Rabaul]] traffic.

All further messages to ''Amberjack'' remained unanswered, and when, by 10 March, she had failed to make her routine report estimating the time of her arrival at base, she was ordered to do so. No reply was received, and she was reported as presumed lost on 22 March 1943.

Reports received from the enemy after the war record an attack which probably sank ''Amberjack''. On 16 February 1943, ''Hiyodori'' and ''[[submarine chaser|Sub Chaser]] Number 18'' attacked a U.S. submarine with nine [[depth charge]]s at about {{coord|5|05|S|152|37|E|display=inline,title}}. An escorting patrol plane had previously attacked the submarine. A large amount of heavy oil and "parts of the hull" came to the surface. This attack is believed to have sunk ''Amberjack''. However, no final conclusions can be drawn, since {{USS|Grampus|SS-207|2}} was lost in the same area at about the same time. From the evidence available, it is considered most likely that the attack of 16 February sank ''Amberjack'', but if she did survive this attack, any one of the attacks and sightings thought to have been made on ''Grampus'' might have been made on ''Amberjack''.

==Awards==
''Amberjack'' won three [[battle star]]s for her [[World War II]] service, and was credited with sinking three ships, for a total of 28,600 tons while damaging two more ships for 14,000 tons damaged.

==Legacy==
The enlisted men's recreation center at Submarine Base, [[Pearl Harbor]], is named for Chief Pharmacist's Mate Arthur C. Beeman, who was killed in the gun battle of 4 February 1943.

'''Untouchability''', in its literal sense, is the practice of [[Social rejection|ostracising]] a minority group by segregating them from the mainstream by social custom or legal mandate. The term is most commonly associated with treatment of the [[Dalit]] communities in the [[Indian subcontinent]] who were considered "polluting", but the term has also been loosely used to refer to other groups, such as the [[Cagots]] in Europe, and the [[Al-Akhdam]] in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|title=The last untouchable in Europe|publisher=|date=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the groups characterized as untouchable were those whose occupations and habits of life involved ritually polluting activities, such as fishermen, [[Manual_scavenging|manual scavengers]], sweepers and washermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Untouchable - Encyclopaedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/untouchable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Untouchability has been outlawed in India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, "untouchability" has not been legally defined.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The origin of untouchability and its historicity are still debated, but it is believed to have existed at least as far back as 400 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches, Volume 7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vYhDAAAAYAAJ|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Bhimrao Ramji|last2=Moon|first2=Vasant|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of a sample of households in India concludes that "Notwithstanding the likelihood of under-reporting of the practice of untouchability, 70 percent of the population reported not indulging in this practice. This is an encouraging sign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Continuing Practice of Untouchability in India: Patterns and Mitigating Influences |journal=India Human Development Survey |url=https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[B. R. Ambedkar]], a social reformer and politician who came from a social group that was considered untouchable, theorized that untouchability originated because of the deliberate policy of the upper-caste [[Brahmins|Brahmanas]]. According to him, the Brahmanas despised the people who gave up the [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in favour of [[Buddhism]]. Later scholars such as Vivekanand Jha have successfully refuted this theory.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=218}}

Nripendra Kumar Dutt, a professor of history, theorized that the concept of untouchability originated from the "[[outcast (person)|pariah]]"-like treatment accorded to the [[adivasi|aboriginies]] of India by the early [[Dravidian people|Dravidians]], and that the concept was borrowed by the [[Indo-Aryans]] from the Dravidians. Scholars such as [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]] have rejected this theory, arguing that there is no evidence that Dravidians practised untouchability before coming into contact with the Indo-Aryans.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=218}}

Austrian ethnologist [[Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf]] theorized that untouchability originated as [[class stratification]] in urban areas of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. According to this theory, the poorer workers involved in 'unclean' occupations such as [[street sweeper|sweeping]] or [[leather work]] were historically segregated and banished outside the city limits. Over time, personal cleanliness came to be identified "purity", and the concept of untouchability eventually spread to rural areas as well. After the decline of the Indus Valley towns, these untouchables probably spread to other parts of India.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=219}} Scholars such as [[Suvira Jaiswal]] reject this theory, arguing that it lacks evidence, and does not explain why the concept of untouchability is more pronounced in rural areas.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|pp=219-220}}

American scholar [[George L. Hart]], based on his interpretation of [[Old Tamil language|Old Tamil]] texts such as ''[[Purananuru]]'', traced the origin of untouchability to ancient [[Tamilakam|Tamil]] society. According to him, in this society, certain occupational groups were thought to be involved in controlling the malevolent supernatural forces; as an example, Hart mentions the [[Paraiyar]]s, who played drums during battles and solemn events such as births and deaths. People from these occupational groups came to be avoided by others, who believed that they were "dangerous and had the power to pollute the others".{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=220}} Jaiswal dismisses the evidence produced by Hart as "extremely weak" and contradictory. Jaiswal points out that the authors of the ancient Tamil texts included several Brahmanas (a fact accepted by Hart); thus, the society described in these texts was already under Brahmanical influence, and could have borrowed the concept of untouchability from them.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|pp=221-222}}

British anthropologist [[John Henry Hutton]] traced the origin of untouchability to the taboo on accepting food cooked by a person from a different caste. This taboo presumably originated because of cleanliness concerns, and ultimately, led to other prejudices such as the taboo on marrying outside one's caste. Jaiswal argues that this theory cannot explain how various social groups were isolated as untouchable or accorded a social rank.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=223}} Jaiswal also notes that several passages from the ancient Vedic texts indicate that there was no taboo against accepting food from people belonging to a different [[varna in Hinduism|varna]] or [[Rigvedic tribes|tribe]]. For example, some [[Śrauta#Śrauta Sutras|Shrauta Sutras]] mandate that a performer of the Vishvajit [[yajna|sacrifice]] must live with the [[Nishada]]s (a tribe regarded as untouchable in later period) for three days, in their village, and eat their food.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=224}}

Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal, R. S. Sharma, and Vivekanand Jha characterize untouchability as a relatively later development after the establishment of the varna and caste system.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|pp=225-227}} Jha notes that the earliest Vedic text ''[[Rigveda]]'' makes no mention of untouchability, and even the later Vedic texts, which revile certain groups such as the [[Chandala]]s, do not suggest that untouchability existed in the contemporary society. According to Jha, in the later period, several groups began to be characterized as untouchable, a development which reached its peak during 600-1200 CE. Sharma theorizes that institution of untouchability arose when the aboriginal tribes with "low material culture" and "uncertain means of livelihood" came to be regarded as impure by the privileged classes who despised manual labour, and regarded associated impurity with "certain material objects".{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=226}} According to Jaiswal, when the members of aboriginal groups were assimilated into the Brahmanical society, the privileged among them may have tried to assert their higher status by disassociating themselves from their lower-status counterparts, who were gradually branded as untouchables.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=227}}

Untouchability is believed to have been first mentioned in ''[[Dharmashastra]]''. According to the text, untouchables were not considered a part of the [[varna]] system because of their grievous sins, barbaric or unethical acts such as murder, harassment etc. Therefore, they were not treated like the [[savarna]]s ([[Brahmin]]s, [[Kshatriya]]s,[[ Vaishya]]s and [[Shudra]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/DharmasutrasTheLawCodesOfAncientIndiaPatrickOlivelleOUP/Dharmasutras%20The%20Law%20Codes%20of%20Ancient%20India%20%20Patrick%20Olivelle%20OUP_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Dharmasutras The Law Codes Of Ancient India Patrick Olivelle OUP"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2018}}

According to Sarah Pinto, an anthropologist, modern untouchability in India applies to people whose work relates to "meat, and bodily fluids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where There Is No Midwife: Birth and Loss in Rural India |first=Sarah |last=Pinto |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-85745-448-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5V-_NssEMSsC&amp;pg=PA47 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the name of untouchability,  Dalits have faced work and descent-based discrimination at the hands of the [[Sanskritisation|dominant castes]]. Based on the punishments prescribed in The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 the following practices could be understood to have been associated with Untouchability in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE UNTOUCHABILITY (OFFENCES) ACT, 1955 |url=http://theindianlawyer.in/statutesnbareacts/acts/u14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

==Government action in India==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
At the time of Indian independence, [[Dalit]] activists began calling for [[Reserved_political_positions_in_India|separate electorates]] for untouchables in India to allow fair representation. Officially labeled the Minorities Act, it would guarantee representation for [[Sikhs]], [[Muslims]], [[Christian]]s, and Untouchables in the newly formed Indian government. The Act was supported by British representatives such as [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. According to the textbook,''Religions in the Modern World'', B.R. Ambedkar, who was also a supporter of the Act, was considered to be the “untouchable leader” who made great efforts to eliminate caste system privileges that included participation in public festivals, access to temples, and wedding rituals. In 1932, Ambedkar proposed that the untouchables create a separate electorate that ultimately led [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] to fast until it was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David (2016). Woodhead, Linda; Partridge, Christopher; Kawanami, Hiroko, eds. Hinduism. New York: Routledge. p. 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

A separation within [[Hindu]] society was opposed by national leaders at the time such as Gandhi, although he took no exception to the demands of the other minorities. He began a [[hunger strike]] to protest this type of [[affirmative action]], citing that it would create an unhealthy divide within the religion. At the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]], he provided this explanation for his reasoning:&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't mind untouchables if they so desire, being converted to Islam or Christianity. I should tolerate that, but I cannot possibly tolerate what is in store for Hinduism if there are two divisions set forth in the villages. Those who speak of the political rights of the untouchables don't know their India, don't know how Indian society is today constituted and therefore I want to say with all the emphasis that I can command that if I was the only person to resist this thing that I would resist it with my life.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Ravinder. "Gandhi, Ambedkar and the Poona pact, 1932." ''South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies'' 8.1-2 (1985): 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gandhi achieved some success through his hunger strike. Dalit activists faced pressure from the Hindu population at large to end his protest at the risk of his ailing health. The two sides eventually came to a compromise where the number of guaranteed seats for Untouchables would be reduced, but not totally eliminated.

The 1950 national [[constitution of India]] legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for [[Reservation in India|positive discrimination]] in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]].

Despite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the [[Kherlanji massacre]].
