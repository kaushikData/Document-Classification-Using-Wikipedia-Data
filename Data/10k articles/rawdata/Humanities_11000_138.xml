'''Ahmed Kousay Altaie''' (22 July 1965 - 2008) was a [[United States Army]] soldier, who was captured in October 2006 in [[Baghdad]] and later executed by his captors.

==Early life and education==
Altaie was born in [[Iraqi Republic (1958–68)|Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/military/story/2012-02-27/iraq-us-soldier-shiite/53267618/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/02/27/us-soldier-killed-by-shiite-extremist-group/ | work=Fox News | title=Shiite extremist group returns remains of last US soldier missing in Iraq | date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/2012/02/27/147523337/remains-of-last-missing-us-soldier-return-from-iraq&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/oregonatwar/2012/02/now_we_know_who_kidnapped_staf.html | work=The Oregonian | title=Now we know who kidnapped Staff Sgt.

At the age of nine, he emigrated with his family from Iraq to the [[United Kingdom]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} He was of mixed [[Sunni]] and [[Shia]] parentage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Father of Missing U.S. Soldier Says Son Just Made a Mistake in Quest to Find His Calling|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/03/world/middleeast/03soldier.html?fta=y&amp;_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=3 November 2006|first=Paul|last=Von Zielbauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Altaie enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve]] in December 2004. He was mobilized in August 2005 and deployed to Iraq in November 2005. During his tenure in the [[United States Army]], Altaie served as a [[translator|linguist]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, John, "[http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/12/army-iraq-search-for-soldier-ahmed-kousay-altaie-still-ongoing-122711w/ Search for Iraq-born soldier still ongoing]", ''[[Military Times]]'', 27 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoner of war===
On 23 October 2006, Altaie left his military base in Iraq without authorization or the knowledge of his superiors. It is believed that he was in the [[Karrada]] neighborhood in central [[Baghdad]], Iraq to visit the family of his second wife, Israa Abdul-Satar, a student at [[al-Mustansiriya University]]. He was captured by armed men and forced into a waiting vehicle outside.

On 2 November 2006, a ransom demand for Altaie was relayed to his uncle Entifadh Qanbar, a former spokesman for the [[Iraqi National Congress]] and recently an official in the [[Iraqi Ministry of Defense]]. Qanbar made contact with an intermediary trusted by the kidnappers. In a secret location in Baghdad, the mediator met with members of the group who showed Qanbar a grainy video on a cell phone screen of a man they claimed was Altaie, beaten up and bloody, and demanded $250,000 from the soldier's family to secure his release.

Qanbar stated that he wouldn't talk about a price until he had seen for himself some proof that Altaie was still breathing. Qanbar suggested they have his nephew describe the inside of his home in Ann Arbor or that the kidnappers photograph the soldier holding a current newspaper by 4 November 2006 at 12:00pm.

The U.S. government said on 11 November 2006 that it was offering a US $50,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of Altaie's body.

On 14 February 2007, a proof of life video of Altaie was posted on a militant [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] website. A previously unknown group called the "Ahel al-Beit Brigades" claimed responsibility for Altaie's abduction. The eight second video showed Altaie reading from a paper but no audio was heard. He appeared thin but in good health. His uncle identified him as the man in the video.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|author1=Arwa Damon |author2=Yousif Bassel |author3=Jomana Karadsheh |author4=Mohammed Tawfeeq |title=Uncle: Abducted U.S. soldier appears in video|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/02/14/abducted.soldier/index.html|accessdate=24 December 2012|newspaper=CNN|date=14 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altaie was the last American serviceman to be accounted for in Iraq. He was captured when he was the rank of [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] and was promoted to [[Sergeant]], then [[Staff sergeant|Staff Sergeant]].

On 26 February 2012, U.S. military officers [[Casualty notification|knocked on the door]] of the family home in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], with news that Army Staff Sgt. Ahmed Altaie was confirmed dead. The remains of Altaie were turned over as part of an amnesty exchange agreement between the Iraqi government and the militant group [[Asaib Ahl al-Haq]]. Altaie's family believes he was killed at the end of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allam |first=Hannah |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/02/26/2661934/us-military-receives-remains-of.html |title=U.S. military receives remains of last soldier missing in Iraq&amp;nbsp;– World Wires |publisher=MiamiHerald.com |date= |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/military/story/2012-02-26/last-american-soldier-iraq/53257092/1/ Army IDs remains of last missing U.S. soldier in Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCATRE81Q11N20120227 | work=Reuters | title=Michigan burial for last U.S. soldier missing in Iraq | date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Michael M., "[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204653604577247372298544072 Last Missing Soldier In Iraq: Family Finally Learns Fate]", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', 27 February 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Altaie's first wife was Linda Racey of [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nation.time.com/2012/01/27/hunting-for-our-mias/ | work=Time | title=Hunting for Our MIAs | date=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/last-missing-soldier-in-iraq-returned-home-to-southeast-michigan |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116122909/http://www.wxyz.com/dpp/news/last-missing-soldier-in-iraq-returned-home-to-southeast-michigan |archivedate=16 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8776">'''Allography''', from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "other writing", has several meanings which all relate to how [[word]]s and [[sound]]s are [[writing|written]] down.

In [[graphemics]], the term ''allograph'' denotes any glyphs that are considered variants of a letter or other [[grapheme]], like a number or punctuation. An obvious example in English (and many other writing systems) is the distinction between [[Letter case|uppercase and lowercase]] letters. Allographs can vary vastly, without affecting the underlying identity of the grapheme. Even if the word "cat" is rendered as "cAt", it remains recognizable as the sequence of the three graphemes ‹c›, ‹a›, ‹t›.&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language, second edition, Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, if a group of individual glyphs (shapes that may or may not represent the same letter) are allographs (they do represent the same letter), they all represent a single grapheme (a single instance of the smallest unit of writing). 

Letters and other graphemes can also have huge variations that may be missed by many readers. The letter [[g]], for example, has two common forms ([[glyph]]s) in different [[typeface]]s, and an enormous variety in people's [[handwriting]]. A positional example of allography is the so-called [[long s]], a symbol which was once a widely used non-final allograph of the lowercase letter [[s]]. A grapheme variant can acquire a separate meaning in a specialized [[writing system]]. Several such variants have distinct [[code point]]s in [[Unicode]] and so ceased to be allographs for some applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sanjeev|date=2012-10-15|title=A Comparative Study of UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 of Unicode Code Point|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2161812|journal=The IUP Journal of Telecommunications|location=Rochester, NY|volume=IV|issue=2|pages=50-59|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fact that handwritten allographs differ so widely from person to person, and even from day to day with the same person, means that [[handwriting recognition]] software is enormously complicated.

===Chinese characters===
{{main|Variant Chinese character}}
In the [[Chinese character|Chinese script]], there exist several graphemes that have more than one written representation. Chinese typefaces often contain many variants of some graphemes. Different regional standards have adopted certain character variants. For instance:

:{| class=wikitable
!Standard!!Allograph

|[[Taiwan]]||lang="zh-tw" align="center"|[[wiktionary:戶|戶]]
|-
|[[China]]||lang="zh-cn" align="center"|[[wiktionary:户|户]]
|-
|[[Japan]]||lang="ja" align="center"|[[wiktionary:戸|戸]]
|}

==Orthography==
An allograph may also be a smaller fragment of writing, that is a [[grapheme|letter]] or a group of letters, which represents a particular sound. In the words ''cat'' and ''king'', the letters c and k are both allographs of the same sound. This relationship between a letter and a sound is not necessarily fixed, for example in a different word, such as ''city'', c is instead an allograph of an s sound.

Some words use groups of letters to represent a sound. In ''kick'' both k and ck are allographs of the sound that the c in ''cat'' represents. These associations are learned as part of learning to [[Reading (activity)|read]] and write a [[language]]. However, the development of [[Phonetics|phonetic associations]] is more difficult when deaf children are learning written languages. For example, without auditory knowledge of words, children are unable to associate graphemes with phonemes, or the sounds of letters or groups of letters. This lack of [http://reading.uoregon.edu/big_ideas/au/au_what.php alphabetic knowledge] correlates with delayed literacy in early learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Building the Alphabetic Principle in Young Children Who Are Deaf or Hard of Hearing|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=00428639&amp;AN=47880027&amp;h=hg8pc1BGUhlZalIazBiDFvAwEqHy0x4GeNrQf5SFXdrCTmqz06QKnJLwPvIa8ybIbAAE64tgaabf%2fU8W5bng4Q%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d00428639%26AN%3d47880027|journal=Volta Review|volume=109|issue=2/3|pages=87-119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| Complicated allographs may surprise or baffle language learners, just as those in place names can continue to confuse people who are unfamiliar with a particular location, even when they are native speakers of the language. One notorious allograph in the English language is ''[[Ough (orthography)|ough]]'', which may easily represent more than 10 different sounds, depending on the word in which it is used.
|}

Allographs have found use in [[humor]] and [[pun]]s; a famous example of allographic humour is that of spelling ''fish'' [[ghoti]].

The only reason that we accept all these varieties as representing the same sound or grapheme is that we have been taught to make these associations when learning to read the English language. That is to say, their meaning and correspondence is assigned ''arbitrarily'', by conventions adopted and observed by a particular language community. Many of these associations have to be unlearned if we study a second language whose writing system is based upon, or contains many elements similar to or shared by, our own alphabet or writing system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alco|first=Bonnie|date=2009–2010|title=An L2 Reader’s Word-Recognition Strategies: Transferred or Developed|url=|journal=The Catesol Journal|volume=21|pages=66-74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Very often, the letters one might be comfortable and familiar with are allographs of quite different sounds in the second language. For example, in written Spanish the grapheme ⟨v⟩ will often represent the [[phoneme]] /b/, whereas in English this does not occur.

'''Anne Whateley''' is the name given to a woman who is sometimes supposed to have been the intended wife of [[William Shakespeare]] before he married [[Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare)|Anne Hathaway]]. Most scholars believe that Whateley never existed, and that her name in a document concerning Shakespeare's marriage is merely a [[clerical error]]. However, several writers on Shakespeare have taken the view that she was a real rival to Hathaway for Shakespeare's hand. She has also appeared in imaginative literature on Shakespeare and in [[Shakespeare authorship question|Shakespeare authorship]] speculations. Shakespeare's biographer Russell A. Fraser describes her as "a ghost", "haunting the edges of Shakespeare's story".&lt;ref&gt;Russell Fraser, ''Shakespeare: A Life in Art'', Transaction Publishers, 2007, p.66.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been called "the first of the Shakespearean Dark Ladies".&lt;ref&gt;Ivor Brown and George Fearon, ''Amazing monument : a short history of the Shakespeare industry'', Heinemann, 1939, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Whateley's existence has been deduced from an entry in the Episcopal register at [[Worcester]] which states in Latin "Anno Domini 1582...Novembris...27 die eiusdem mensis. Item eodem die supradicto emanavit Licentia inter Wm Shaxpere et Annam Whateley de Temple Grafton." The entry states that a marriage licence has been issued to Shakespeare and Anne Whateley to marry in the village of [[Temple Grafton]]. The day afterwards, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], signed a [[surety]] of £40 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of "William Shagspere and Anne Hathwey".&lt;ref name = "sam"&gt;Samuel Schoenbaum, ''William Shakespeare: a compact documentary life'', Oxford University Press, 1977, pp.84-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. K. Chambers, ''William Shakespeare: A Study of the Facts and Problems'', Oxford University Press, 1989, pp.41-42. The marriage was registered in Worcester because William had killed someone important[[Anglican Diocese of Worcester]], which included southern Warwickshire.&lt;/ref&gt;

The entry in the register was discovered in the late nineteenth century by Reverend T.P. Wadley. Various explanations were offered. Initially it was assumed that Whateley was an alternative surname for Anne Hathaway herself. Wadley believed that it was probably an alias, used by Hathaway in order to keep the date of the marriage secret to obscure the fact that she was already pregnant. Another suggestion was that Anne Hathaway might legitimately have used the name, either because her father Richard Hathaway was in fact her step-father, her mother having previously been married to a man called Whateley, or because Anne herself may have previously been married to a man named Whateley.&lt;ref name = "gray"&gt;Joseph William Gray, ''Shakespeare's Marriage: His Departure from Stratford and Other Incidents in His Life'', Chapman and Hall, 1905, pp.13-18; 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; None of these suggestions gained support, since they contradicted other existing evidence.

[[File:Whateley note.JPG|thumb|left|The names of Shakespeare and Whateley in the note in the Episcopal register at Worcester]]
The Whateley note is discussed in [[Sidney Lee]]'s 1898 book ''A Life of William Shakespeare''. Lee argues that the "William Shakespeare" who is engaged to Whateley is probably a different person from the playwright, as there were "numerous William Shakespeares, who abounded in the diocese of Worcester".&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Lee, ''A life of William Shakespeare'', 1915 edition, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Joseph William Gray in ''Shakespeare's Marriage'' gave a detailed argument for clerical error due to the existence of lawsuits involving Whateleys that were being written up by the same scribe.&lt;ref name = "gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name = ing&gt;William Ingram, ''The business of playing: the beginnings of the adult professional theater in Elizabethan London'', Cornell University Press, 1992, p.24.&lt;/ref&gt; However in 1909 [[Frank Harris]] in his book ''The Man Shakespeare'' ignored Gray's argument and dismissed Lee's suggestion that there were two William Shakespeares as wildly implausible. He insisted that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two separate women.  He intended to marry Anne Whateley, but, when this became known, he was immediately forced by Anne Hathaway's family to marry their relative, since he had already made her pregnant. Harris believed that Shakespeare despised his wife, and that his forced marriage was the spur to his creative work:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If Shakespeare had married Anne Whately he might never have gone to London or written a play. Shakespeare's hatred of his wife and his regret for having married her were alike foolish. Our brains are seldom the wisest part of us. It was well that he made love to Anne Hathaway; well, too, that he was forced to marry her; well, finally, that he should desert her. I am sorry he treated her badly and left her unsupplied with money; that was needlessly cruel; but it is just the kindliest men who have these extraordinary lapses; Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Harris, ''The Man Shakespeare'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2007, (reprint) p.362. Harris's spelling "Whatley" with one "e" is followed by several other authors, sometimes with the "e" before the "l". However, "Whateley" is the most common form of the name.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some biographers, notably [[Ivor Brown]] and [[Anthony Burgess]], followed Harris' lead, portraying Whateley as Shakespeare's true love. Brown argued that she was the Dark Lady of the sonnets. In 1970 Burgess wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is reasonable to believe that Will wished to marry a girl named Anne Whateley. The name is common enough in the Midlands and is even attached to a four-star hotel in Horse Fair, Banbury. Her father may have been a friend of John Shakespeare's, he may have sold kidskin cheap, there are various reasons why the Shakespeares and the Whateleys, or their nubile children, might become friendly. Sent on skin-buying errands to Temple Grafton, Will could have fallen for a comely daughter, sweet as May and shy as a fawn. He was eighteen and highly susceptible. Knowing something about girls, he would know that this was the real thing. Something, perhaps, quite different from what he felt about Mistress Hathaway of Shottery. But why, attempting to marry Anne Whateley, had he put himself in the position of having to marry the other Anne? I suggest that, to use the crude but convenient properties of the old women's-magazine morality-stories, he was exercised by love for the one and lust for the other.&lt;ref name = "sam"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Burgess, ''Shakespeare'', London: Jonathan Cape, 1970, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Stanley Wells]] in the ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', most modern scholars take the same view as Gray, that the name Whateley was "almost certainly the result of clerical error".&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Wells, "Whateley, Anne". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p.185; p.518. See also Park Honan, ''Shakespeare: a life'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p.84.&lt;/ref&gt; It may have arisen because the clerk was also recording information about a tithe appeal by a vicar, which included a reference to a person named Whateley.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Levi, ''The Life and Times of William Shakespeare'', London: Macmillan, 1988, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a Whateley family in the area, no independent evidence has ever been found of the existence of an Anne Whateley in Temple Grafton or anywhere else nearby. As for Lee's claim that there were "numerous" other William Shakespeares in the diocese, later researchers have found no surviving records of any other William Shakespeares of marriageable age in the diocese of Worcester.&lt;ref name = ing/&gt;

==Authorship speculations==
{{main|Shakespeare authorship question}}
After Harris's initial argument a number of imaginative claims were made about Anne Whateley, most dramatically that she was the true author of Shakespeare's works. This argument was made by William Ross in his book ''The Story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere'' (1939),&lt;ref name = "quart"&gt;''Shakespeare Quarterly'', 1950-1, p.256&lt;/ref&gt; in which he asserted that Whateley was a nun who was his "lover and consort in their spiritual union". She was born in 1561, the daughter of the well-known seafarer [[Anthony Jenkinson]]. She was living a secluded life among the nuns of the [[Poor Clares|Order of St. Clare]] when she met Shakespeare. They fell in love, and Anne was about to leave the order to marry him when Hathaway revealed her pregnancy. Her authorship can be deduced from [[Shakespeare's sonnets|the sonnets]], which she wrote as gifts to Shakespeare. They describe the history of her spiritual relationship with him. Hathaway is the [[The Dark Lady|Dark Lady]] of the sonnets, while Shakespeare himself is the [[Fair Youth]]. Their intimate friendship continued after his marriage to Hathaway; its deepening spirituality is explored in the later sonnets. Eventually the friendship was broken up by Hathaway's jealousy, and Shakespeare left for London. She wrote ''[[A Lover's Complaint]]'', which was appended to the sonnets, to express Anne Hathaway's point of view.

Whateley wished to dedicate the sonnets to Shakespeare, but wrote the dedication to [[Mr W.H.]] instead of "W.S", so that the identity of her lost love should remain mysterious. "W.H" was preferred because it was the initials of both her own surname and Hathaway's, implying that Shakespeare was, in a sense, both their husbands: Mr W and Mr H. According to Ross, "the initials therefore represent all three, and no better selection was possible".&lt;ref name = "ross"&gt;William Ross,''The story of Anne Whateley and William Shaxpere as revealed by 'The sonnets to Mr. W.H.' and other Elizabethan poetry'', Holmes, 1939, p.122; p.207&lt;/ref&gt; She gave him the full collection when he left for London, which explains the dedication to the "well-wishing adventurer in setting forth". She later wrote ''[[The Phoenix and the Turtle]]'' to commemorate their spiritual union.

Ross emphasises that his discovery removes all suggestion of homoeroticism from the sonnets, and thus "the taint of perversion, so odious to all lovers of Shakespeare, has been dissipated". He has very little to say about the plays, but states that Whateley probably wrote Shakespeare's plays to help him make a living. Nevertheless he describes the playwriting as a "collaboration", though Shakespeare's role was probably "passive". Ross portrays Shakespeare himself as a talented writer, a worthy assistant to Whateley's "genius". After Anne's death he wrote "The Twenty-First and Last Book of the Ocean, to Cynthia", hitherto attributed to [[Walter Raleigh]].

Ross argues that the sonnets reveal that Whateley also knew [[Edmund Spenser]] and helped him to write ''[[The Shepherd's Calendar]]''. She was also the sole author of ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[Amoretti]]''. In the 1580s she met and helped [[Michael Drayton]] and [[Philip Sidney]], probably inspiring the sonnet revival of the period. The poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', usually attributed to [[Christopher Marlowe]], describes her relationship with Shakespeare. She also wrote Marlowe's plays. After her death in 1600 her unpublished works were published in the book ''Poetical Rhapsody'', attributed to "A.W."&lt;ref name = "ross"/&gt;

Ross's speculations were developed by his friend W.J. Fraser Hutcheson in his book ''Shakespeare's Other Anne'' (1950).&lt;ref name ="hut"&gt;W.J. Fraser Hutcheson, ''Shakespeare's Other Anne: a short account of the life and works of Anne Whateley or Beck, a Sister of the Order of St. Clare, who nearly married William Shakespeare in November 1582 A.D.'', William MacLellan, 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; He follows Ross's claim that Whateley's father was Jenkinson, adding that Whateley's real name was Elizabeth Anne Beck and that her mother was an Anne Beck who died in childbirth. She used the name Whateley because of the household in which she grew up. Falling in love with Shakespeare, she was broken-hearted when he married Hathaway. She fled to Italy, where she acquired the knowledge that would later be used in Shakespeare's Italian plays. Many of her works were published under the name "Ignotus".&lt;ref name = "quart"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="hut"/&gt; Hutcheson also claims to have identified a portrait of Whateley, the work of [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], the several copies of which attest to the esteem in which she was held. Hutcheson suggests that Whateley is portrayed as Rosalind and other female characters in Shakespeare's plays. While insisting that she inspired the plays, he does not explicitly assert that she wrote them.

Neither Ross nor Hutcheson provide documentary evidence to support their theories.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Boas, ''The Year's Work in English Studies'', Vol. XXXI, 1950, OUP, 1952, p.113; George L. McMichael, Edgar M. Glenn, ''Shakespeare and his rivals: a casebook on the authorship controversy'', Odyssey Press, 1962, p.145ff&lt;/ref&gt; Ross relies on his readings of the poems while Hutcheson finds coded messages in texts and images. The portrait he identifies as Whateley is generally believed to depict the courtier and poet Girolamo Casio.&lt;ref name = "pea"/&gt; It is  attributed to [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]], rather than Anguissola, and its likely depiction of Casio was accepted long before he wrote the book.&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Herbert Baily 
(ed), ''The Connoisseur'', 1908, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of other alternative authorship theories have also used Frank Harris' version of the Anne Whateley story, typically to portray Shakespeare as a duplicitous scapegrace, traits which are supposed to disqualify him as an author of great poetry.&lt;ref&gt;H. N. Gibson, ''The Shakespeare Claimants'', Routledge, 2005, pp.41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Frazer, who believed that [[William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby|The Earl of Derby]] wrote the canon, argued that Shakespeare actually married Whateley, not Hathaway.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Frazer, The Silent Shakespeare, Philadelphia, (1915), p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
Anne has also appeared in imaginative literature about Shakespeare, typically portrayed as Shakespeare's true love, in contrast to a less appealing Anne Hathaway. Anne appears in [[Hubert Osborne]]'s play ''The Good Men Do'' (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne Hathaway and Anne Whateley. Hathaway is depicted as viciously shrewish and spiteful, in contrast to her noble-minded former rival. Both women portray Shakespeare's life as an actor and playwright as morally degrading, Whateley insisting that he would have been saved from this shameful profession had he married her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/anthology/good_men_do.pdf ''The Good Men Do''.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivor Brown]] also published a play, ''William's Other Anne'' (1947) in which Shakespeare returns from London to meet Anne Whateley eight years after their broken engagement, just as Anne is about to marry a priggish schoolmaster. Shakespeare and Anne are reconciled, and Shakespeare saves his father from bankruptcy at the hands of Anne's vengeful mother.&lt;ref&gt;''Drama: the quarterly theatre review'', Issues 1-15, British Theatre Association, 1946, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; The play was broadcast on BBC television in 1953 starring [[Irene Worth]] as Anne and [[John Gregson]] as Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/9/53/179.full.pdf Thespis, Plays, Films, Television, ''English'', Summer 1953; 9: 179 - 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Whateley is mentioned in ''Late Mister Shakespeare'' (1998) by [[Robert Nye]], a novel in which an elderly actor who knew Shakespeare in his youth reconstructs the poet's life. He speculates about whether or not she actually existed. She also appears in Graeme Johnstone's novel ''The Playmakers'' (2005), in which she is portrayed as an innocent girl with a "sweet nature", "perfect figure, perfect teeth...perfectly shaped nose, clear blue eyes and creamy skin".&lt;ref&gt;Graeme Johnstone's novel ''The Playmakers'', 2005, BeWrite Books, 2005, pp.21-23.&lt;/ref&gt; She is devastated by the discovery that her beloved William has made Hathaway pregnant. She and William are soulmates who plan to work together to improve William's father's leather-making business. Anne hangs herself with a leather rope after the manipulative Hathaway forces Shakespeare to abandon her. The image of his lost love haunts Shakespeare throughout his life. He leaves for London to become a front man for [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s playwriting. He eventually finds a new love who is the mirror image of Whateley.

Laurie Lawlor's novel ''The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare'' (2006) depicts a teenage Shakespeare who seduces willing girls with his wit and charm. He is asked by his friend [[Richard Field (printer)|Richard Field]] to help him woo the beautiful and devout Anne Whateley, but falls in love with her himself. He tries to reform his ways to become worthy of her, but cannot resist his sexual urges, getting Hathaway pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;Laurie Lawlor, ''The Two Loves of Will Shakespeare'', Holiday House, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Karen Harper]]'s novel ''Mistress Shakespeare'' (2008) Anne Whateley is the central character. She is once more portrayed as Shakespeare's true love. She narrates the story of her life as the dusky-skinned daughter of a Stratford businessman and an Italian acrobat. She and Shakespeare are married in a "[[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfast]]" ceremony which is known only to them. In London she carries on a secret parallel marriage with him while Hathaway and her children stay in Stratford. She inspires many of his works and shares his feelings, triumphs and fears.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karenharperauthor.com/mistress_shakespeare.html Karen Harper's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Art history''' is the study of objects of art in their [[historical]] development and stylistic contexts; that is [[genre]], [[design]], [[:wikt:format|format]], and [[style (visual arts)|style]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=art%20history Art History]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}". WordNet Search - 3.0, princeton.edu&lt;/ref&gt; The study includes painting, sculpture, architecture, ceramics, furniture, and other decorative objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/alex-potts/what-history-art|title=What is the History of Art? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art history is the history of different groups of people and their culture represented throughout their artwork. Art historians compare different time periods in art history. Such as a comparison to Medieval Art to Renaissance Art. This history of cultures is shown in their art work in different forms. Art can be shown by attire, architecture, religion, sports. Or more visual pieces of art such as paintings, drawings, sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;www.arthistory.net&lt;/ref&gt;

As a term, art history (its product being [[history of art]]) encompasses several methods of studying the [[visual arts]]; in common usage referring to works of art and architecture. Aspects of the discipline overlap. As the art historian [[Ernst Gombrich]] once observed, "the field of art history [is] much like [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gaul]], divided in three parts inhabited by three different, though not necessarily hostile tribes: (i) the [[connoisseurship|connoisseurs]], (ii) the [[art criticism|critics]], and (iii) the academic art historians".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Gombrich (1996). ''The Essential Gombrich'', p. 7. London: Phaidon Press&lt;/ref&gt;

As a discipline, art history is distinguished from art criticism, which is concerned with establishing a relative artistic value upon individual works with respect to others of comparable style, or sanctioning an entire style or movement; and [[art theory]] or "[[philosophy of art]]", which is concerned with the fundamental nature of art. One branch of this area of study is [[aesthetics]], which includes investigating the enigma of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] and determining the essence of beauty. Technically, art history is not these things, because the art historian uses [[historical method]] to answer the questions: How did the artist come to create the work?, Who were the patrons?, Who were his or her teachers?, Who was the audience?, Who were his or her disciples?, What historical forces shaped the artist's oeuvre, and how did he or she and the creation, in turn, affect the course of artistic, political, and social events? It is, however, questionable whether many questions of this kind can be answered satisfactorily without also considering basic questions about the nature of art. The current disciplinary gap between art history and the philosophy of art (aesthetics) often hinders this inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Cf: 'Art History versus Aesthetics', ed. James Elkins (New York: Routledge, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art history is not only a [[biography|biographical]] endeavor. Art historians often root their studies in the scrutiny of individual objects. They thus attempt to answer in historically specific ways, questions such as: What are key features of this style?, What meaning did this object convey?, How does it function visually?, Did the artist meet their goals well?, What symbols are involved?, and Does it function discursively?

The historical backbone of the discipline is a celebratory chronology of beautiful creations commissioned by public or religious bodies or wealthy individuals in western Europe. Such a "[[Western canon|canon]]" remains prominent, as indicated by the selection of objects present in art history textbooks. Nonetheless, since the 20th century there has been an effort to re-define the discipline to be more inclusive of non-Western art, art made by women, and vernacular creativity.

==Definition==
Art history as we know it in the 21st century began in the 19th century but has precedents that date to the ancient world. Like the analysis of historical trends in politics, literature, and the sciences, the discipline benefits from the clarity and portability of the written word, but art historians also rely on [[formal analysis]], [[semiotics]], [[psychoanalysis]] and [[iconography]]. Advances in photographic reproduction and printing techniques after World War II increased the ability of reproductions of artworks. Such technologies have helped to advance the discipline in profound ways, as they have enabled easy comparisons of objects. The study of visual art thus described, can be a practice that involves understanding [[contextualism|context]], [[Formalism (art)|form]], and social significance.

==Methodologies==
Art historians employ a number of [[methodology|methods]] in their research into the [[ontology]] and history of objects.

Art historians often examine work in the context of its time. At best, this is done in a manner which respects its creator's motivations and imperatives; with consideration of the desires and prejudices of its patrons and sponsors; with a comparative analysis of themes and approaches of the creator's colleagues and teachers; and with consideration of iconography and [[symbol]]ism. In short, this approach examines the work of art in the context of the world within which it was created.

Art historians also often examine work through an analysis of form; that is, the creator's use of [[wikt:line|line]], [[shape]], [[color]], [[wikt:texture|texture]], and composition. This approach examines how the artist uses a [[two-dimensional]] picture plane or the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions]] of [[sculpture|sculptural]] or [[architecture|architectural]] space to create his or her art. The way these individual elements are employed results in [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[abstraction|non-representational]] art. Is the artist imitating an object or image found in nature? If so, it is representational. The closer the art hews to perfect imitation, the more the art is ''realistic''. Is the artist not imitating, but instead relying on symbolism, or in an important way striving to capture nature's essence, rather than copy it directly? If so the art is non-representational—also called [[abstract art|abstract]]. Realism and abstraction exist on a continuum. [[Impressionism]] is an example of a representational style that was not directly imitative, but strove to create an "impression" of nature. If the work is not representational and is an expression of the artist's feelings, longings and aspirations, or is a search for ideals of beauty and form, the work is non-representational or a work of [[expressionism]].

An [[iconography|iconographical]] analysis is one which focuses on particular design elements of an object. Through a close reading of such elements, it is possible to trace their lineage, and with it draw conclusions regarding the origins and trajectory of these [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s. In turn, it is possible to make any number of observations regarding the social, cultural, economic, and aesthetic values of those responsible for producing the object.

Many art historians use [[critical theory]] to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory is most often used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward. Critical theory in art history is often borrowed from [[literature|literary scholars]], and it involves the application of a non-artistic analytical framework to the study of art objects. [[Feminism|Feminist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Critical race theory|critical race]], [[Queer Theory|queer]], and [[Postcolonial theory|postcolonial]] theories are all well established in the discipline. As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take in the discipline has yet to be determined.

More recently, media and digital technology introduced possibilities of visual, spatial and experiential analyses. The relevant forms vary from movies, to interactive forms, including virtual environments, augmented environments, situated media, networked media, etc. The methods enabled by such techniques are in active development and promise to include qualitative approaches that can emphasize narrative, dramatic, emotional and ludic characteristics of history and art.&lt;ref&gt;Esche-Ramshorn, Christiane and Stanislav Roudavski (2012).

The earliest surviving writing on art that can be classified as art history are the passages in [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' (c. AD 77-79), concerning the development of [[Ancient Greek art|Greek sculpture and painting]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/holland/index.html First English Translation] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; From them it is possible to trace the ideas of [[Xenokrates of Sicyon]] (c. 280 BC), a Greek sculptor who was perhaps the first art historian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/xenocrates Dictionary of Art Historians] Retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's work, while mainly an [[encyclopaedia]] of the sciences, has thus been influential from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. (Passages about techniques used by the painter [[Apelles]] c. (332-329 BC), have been especially well-known.) Similar, though independent, developments occurred in the 6th century China, where a canon of worthy artists was established by writers in the scholar-official class. These writers, being necessarily proficient in calligraphy, were artists themselves. The artists are described in the ''[[Six principles of Chinese painting|Six Principles of Painting]]'' formulated by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=y0Pxz1L9I4EC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=The+Record+of+the+Classification+of+Old+Painters%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NOIDTggsRX&amp;sig=IiZrQ9RzW1ZVsDXKeNnXL5oI78o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=r79dS7HHIMHElAeVzs3RBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Record%20of%20the%20Classification%20of%20Old%20Painters%22&amp;f=false, The shorter Columbia anthology of traditional Chinese literature, By Victor H. Mair, p.51] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vasari and artists' biographies===
[[File:Giorgio Vasari Selbstporträt.jpg|thumb|Location|[[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Self-portrait]]'' c.1567]]
[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|[[Anton von Maron]], ''Portrait of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]],'' 1768]]
While personal reminiscences of art and artists have long been written and read (see [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] ''Commentarii,'' for the best early example),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnet.com/library/03/0319/t031930.asp Artnet artist biographies] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; it was Giorgio Vasari, the Tuscan painter, sculptor and author of the ''[[Lives of the Painters]]'', who wrote the first true ''history'' of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.org/~acd/vite/VasariLives.html website created by Adrienne DeAngelis, currently incomplete, intended to be unabridged, in English.] retrieved January 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized art's progression and development, which was a milestone in this field. His was a personal and a historical account, featuring biographies of individual Italian artists, many of whom were his contemporaries and personal acquaintances. The most renowned of these was [[Michelangelo]], and Vasari's account is enlightening, though biased{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} in places.

Vasari's ideas about art were enormously influential, and served as a model for many, including in the north of Europe [[Karel van Mander]]'s ''[[Schilder-boeck]]'' and [[Joachim von Sandrart]]'s ''Teutsche Akademie''.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Vasari's approach held sway until the 18th century, when criticism was leveled at his biographical account of history.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Winckelmann and art criticism===
Scholars such as [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] (1717–1768), criticised Vasari's "cult" of artistic personality, and they argued that the real emphasis in the study of art should be the views of the learned beholder and not the unique viewpoint of the charismatic artist. Winckelmann's writings thus were the beginnings of art criticism. His two most notable works that introduced the concept of art criticism were ''Gedanken über die Nachahmung der griechischen Werke in der Malerei und Bildhauerkunst'', published in 1755, shortly before he left for Rome ([[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]] published an English translation in 1765 under the title ''Reflections on the Painting and Sculpture of the Greeks''), and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Altertums'' (''History of Art in Antiquity''), published in 1764 (this is the first occurrence of the phrase ‘history of art’ in the title of a book)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chilvers|first=Ian|title=The Oxford dictionary of art|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=[Oxford]|isbn=0198604769|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Winckelmann critiqued the artistic excesses of [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]] forms, and was instrumental in reforming taste in favor of the more sober [[Neoclassicism]]. [[Jacob Burckhardt]] (1818–1897), one of the founders of art history, noted that Winckelmann was 'the first to distinguish between the periods of ancient art and to link the history of style with world history'. From Winckelmann until the mid-20th century, the field of art history was dominated by German-speaking academics. Winckelmann's work thus marked the entry of art history into the high-philosophical discourse of German culture.

Winckelmann was read avidly by [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], both of whom began to write on the history of art, and his account of the [[Laocoon]] occasioned a response by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]. The emergence of art as a major subject of philosophical speculation was solidified by the appearance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Judgment]]'' in 1790, and was furthered by [[Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel|Hegel]]'s ''Lectures on Aesthetics''. Hegel's philosophy served as the direct inspiration for [[Karl Schnaase]]'s work. Schnaase's ''Niederländische Briefe'' established the theoretical foundations for art history as an autonomous discipline, and his ''Geschichte der bildenden Künste'', one of the first historical surveys of the history of art from antiquity to the Renaissance, facilitated the teaching of art history in German-speaking universities. Schnaase's survey was published contemporaneously with a similar work by [[Franz Theodor Kugler]].

===Wölfflin and stylistic analysis===
:''See: [[Formal analysis]]''.
[[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), who studied under Burckhardt in Basel, is the "father" of modern art history. Wölfflin taught at the universities of Berlin, Basel, Munich, and Zurich. A number of students went on to distinguished careers in art history, including [[Jakob Rosenberg]] and [[Frida Schottmuller]]. He introduced a scientific approach to the history of art, focusing on three concepts. Firstly, he attempted to study art using psychology, particularly by applying the work of [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. He argued, among other things, that art and architecture are good if they resemble the human body. For example, houses were good if their [[facade|façades]] looked like faces. Secondly, he introduced the idea of studying art through comparison. By comparing individual paintings to each other, he was able to make distinctions of [[artistic|style]]. His book ''[[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]]'' developed this idea, and was the first to show how these stylistic periods differed from one another. In contrast to [[Giorgio Vasari]], Wölfflin was uninterested in the biographies of artists. In fact he proposed the creation of an "art history without names." Finally, he studied art based on ideas of [[nationhood]]. He was particularly interested in whether there was an inherently "Italian" and an inherently "[[Culture of Germany|German]]" style. This last interest was most fully articulated in his monograph on the German artist [[Albrecht Dürer]].

===Riegl, Wickhoff, and the Vienna School===
{{Main article|Vienna School of Art History}}
Contemporaneous with Wölfflin's career, a major school of art-historical thought developed at the [[University of Vienna]]. The first generation of the Vienna School was dominated by [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Franz Wickhoff]], both students of [[Moritz Thausing]], and was characterized by a tendency to reassess neglected or disparaged periods in the history of art. Riegl and Wickhoff both wrote extensively on the art of [[late antiquity]], which before them had been considered as a period of decline from the classical ideal. Riegl also contributed to the revaluation of the Baroque.

The next generation of professors at Vienna included [[Max Dvořák]], Julius von Schlosser, Hans Tietze, Karl Maria Swoboda, and [[Josef Strzygowski]]. A number of the most important twentieth-century art historians, including [[Ernst Gombrich]], received their degrees at Vienna at this time. The term "Second Vienna School" (or "New Vienna School") usually refers to the following generation of Viennese scholars, including [[Hans Sedlmayr]], Otto Pächt, and Guido Kaschnitz von Weinberg. These scholars began in the 1930s to return to the work of the first generation, particularly to Riegl and his concept of ''Kunstwollen'', and attempted to develop it into a full-blown art-historical methodology. Sedlmayr, in particular, rejected the minute study of iconography, patronage, and other approaches grounded in historical context, preferring instead to concentrate on the aesthetic qualities of a work of art. As a result, the Second Vienna School gained a reputation for unrestrained and irresponsible [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], and was furthermore colored by Sedlmayr's overt racism and membership in the Nazi party. This latter tendency was, however, by no means shared by all members of the school; Pächt, for example, was himself Jewish, and was forced to leave Vienna in the 1930s.

===Panofsky and iconography===
[[File:Aby Warburg.jpg|thumb| Photographer unknown, [[Aby Warburg]] c. 1900]]
Our 21st-century understanding of the symbolic content of art comes from a group of scholars who gathered in [[Hamburg]] in the 1920s. The most prominent among them were [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Aby Warburg]], and [[Fritz Saxl]]. Together they developed much of the vocabulary that continues to be used in the 21st century by art historians. "Iconography"—with roots meaning "symbols from writing" refers to subject matter of art derived from written sources—especially scripture and mythology. "Iconology" is a broader term that referred to all symbolism, whether derived from a specific text or not. Today art historians sometimes use these terms interchangeably.

Panofsky, in his early work, also developed the theories of Riegl, but became eventually more preoccupied with iconography, and in particular with the transmission of themes related to classical antiquity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In this respect his interests coincided with those of Warburg, the son of a wealthy family who had assembled an impressive library in Hamburg devoted to the study of the classical tradition in later art and culture. Under Saxl's auspices, this library was developed into a research institute, affiliated with the [[University of Hamburg]], where Panofsky taught.

Warburg died in 1929, and in the 1930s Saxl and Panofsky, both Jewish, were forced to leave Hamburg. Saxl settled in London, bringing Warburg's library with him and establishing the [[Warburg Institute]]. Panofsky settled in Princeton at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]]. In this respect they were part of an extraordinary influx of German art historians into the English-speaking academy in the 1930s. These scholars were largely responsible for establishing art history as a legitimate field of study in the English-speaking world, and the influence of Panofsky's methodology, in particular, determined the course of American art history for a generation.

===Freud and psychoanalysis===
Heinrich Wölfflin was not the only scholar to invoke psychological theories in the study of art. Psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote a book on the artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]], in which he used Leonardo's paintings to interrogate the artist's [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and sexual orientation. Freud inferred from his analysis that Leonardo was probably [[homosexual]].
[[File:Hall Freud Jung in front of Clark 1909.jpg|thumbnail|Group photo 1909 in front of [[Clark University]]. Front row: [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Granville Stanley Hall]], [[Carl Jung]]; back row: [[Abraham A. Brill]], [[Ernest Jones]], [[Sándor Ferenczi]]]]
Though the use of posthumous material to perform psychoanalysis is controversial among art historians, especially since the sexual mores of Leonardo's time and Freud's are different, it is often attempted. One of the best-known psychoanalytic scholars is Laurie Schneider Adams, who wrote a popular textbook, ''Art Across Time'', and a book ''Art and Psychoanalysis''.

An unsuspecting turn for the history of art criticism came in 1914 when Sigmund Freud published a psychoanalytical interpretation of Michelangelo’s Moses titled Der Moses des Michelangelo as one of the first psychology based analyses on a work of art.&lt;ref name=Freud&gt;Sigmund Freud. [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/burt/filmphilology/FreudMoses.pdf The Moses of MIchelangelo] The Standard Edition of the ''Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud''. Translated from the German under the general editorship of James Strachey in collaboration with Anna Freud, assisted by Alix Strachey and Alan Tyson. Volume XIII (1913-1914): Totem And Taboo and other Works. London. The Hogarth Press and The Institute Of Psycho-Analysis. 1st Edition, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud first published this work shortly after reading Vasari’s ''Lives''. For unknown purposes, Freud originally published the article anonymously.

===Jung and archetypes===
[[Carl Jung]] also applied psychoanalytic theory to art. [[Carl Jung|C.G. Jung]] was a [[Swiss]] [[psychiatrist]], an influential thinker, and founder of [[analytical psychology]]. Jung's approach to psychology emphasized understanding the [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] through exploring the worlds of [[dream]]s, art, [[mythology]], world [[religion]] and [[philosophy]]. Much of his life's work was spent exploring Eastern and Western philosophy, [[alchemy]], [[astrology]], [[sociology]], as well as [[literature]] and the arts. His most notable contributions include his concept of the psychological [[archetype]], the [[collective unconscious]], and his theory of [[synchronicity]]. Jung believed that many experiences perceived as [[coincidence]] were not merely due to [[randomness|chance]] but, instead, suggested the manifestation of parallel events or circumstances reflecting this governing dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Synchronicity'' in the final two pages of the Conclusion, Jung stated that not all coincidences are meaningful and further explained the creative causes of this phenomenon.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a [[collective unconscious]] and archetypal imagery were detectable in art. His ideas were particularly popular among American [[Abstract expressionist]]s in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jung defined the collective unconscious as akin to instincts in ''Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious''.&lt;/ref&gt; His work inspired the [[surrealist]] concept of drawing imagery from dreams and the unconscious.

Jung emphasized the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. [[Jackson Pollock]], for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized how powerful the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jackson Pollock]] An American Saga, Steven Naismith and Gregory White Smith, Clarkson N. Potter publ. copyright 1989,''Archetypes and Alchemy'' pp. 327-338. {{ISBN|0-517-56084-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legacy of psychoanalysis in art history has been profound, and extends beyond Freud and Jung. The prominent feminist art historian Griselda Pollock, for example, draws upon psychoanalysis both in her reading into contemporary art and in her rereading of modernist art. With [[Griselda Pollock]]'s reading of French feminist psychoanalysis and in particular the writings of [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Bracha L. Ettinger]], as with Rosalind Krauss readings of [[Jacques Lacan]] and [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and Catherine de Zegher's curatorial rereading of art, [[Feminist theory]] written in the fields of [[French feminism]] and Psychoanalysis has strongly informed the reframing of both men and women artists in art history.

===Marx and ideology===
During the mid-20th century, art historians embraced [[social history]] by using critical approaches. The goal was to show how art interacts with power structures in society. One critical approach that art historians{{who|date=November 2011}} used was Marxism. Marxist art history attempted to show how art was tied to specific classes, how images contain information about the economy, and how images can make the status quo seem natural ([[ideology]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marcel Duchamp and Dada Movement jump started the Anti-art style. Various artist did not want to create artwork that everyone was conforming to at the time. These two movements helped other artist to create pieces that were not viewed as traditional art. Some examples of styles that branched off the anti-art movement would be Neo-Dadaism, Surrealism, and Constructivism. These styles and artist did not want to surrender to traditional ways of art. This way of thinking provoked political movements such as the Russian Revolution and the communist ideals.&lt;ref&gt; Gayford, Martin (18 February 2017). "Exhibitions: Revolution - Russian Art 1917-1932". The Spectator. Retrieved 29 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artist Isaak Brodsky work of art 'Shock-worker from Dneprstroi' in 1932 shows his political involvement within art. This piece of art can be analysed to show the internal troubles Soviet Russia was experiencing at the time.
Perhaps the best-known Marxist was [[Clement Greenberg]], who came to prominence during the late 1930s with his essay "[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement Greenberg]], ''Art and Culture,'' Beacon Press, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; In the essay Greenberg claimed that the [[avant-garde]] arose in order to defend [[aesthetic]] standards from the decline of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] involved in [[consumerism|consumer society]], and seeing kitsch and art as opposites. Greenberg further claimed that [[avant-garde]] and [[Modernism|Modernist]] art was a means to resist the leveling of culture produced by [[capitalism|capitalist]] [[propaganda]]. Greenberg appropriated the German word '[[kitsch]]' to describe this consumerism, although its [[connotation]]s have since changed to a more affirmative notion of leftover materials of capitalist culture. Greenberg later{{when|date=November 2011}} became well known for examining the formal properties of modern art.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Meyer Schapiro]] is one of the best-remembered Marxist art historians of the mid-20th century. Although he wrote about numerous time periods and themes in art, he is best remembered for his commentary on sculpture from the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], at which time he saw evidence of [[capitalism]] emerging and [[feudalism]] declining.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[Arnold Hauser (art historian)|Arnold Hauser]] wrote the first Marxist survey of Western Art, entitled ''The Social History of Art''. He attempted to show how class consciousness was reflected in major art periods. The book was controversial when published during the 1950s since it makes generalizations about entire eras, a strategy now called "[[vulgar Marxism]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Marxist Art History was refined in the department of Art History at [[UCLA]] with scholars such as T.J. Clark, O.K. Werckmeister, David Kunzle, Theodor W. Adorno, and Max Horkheimer. [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.J. Clark]] was the first art historian writing from a Marxist perspective to abandon [[vulgar Marxism]]. He wrote Marxist art histories of several [[impressionist]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] artists, including [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Édouard Manet]]. These books focused closely on the political and economic climates in which the art was created.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Feminist art history===
[[Linda Nochlin]]'s essay "[[Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?]]" helped to ignite feminist art history during the 1970s and remains one of the most widely read essays about female artists. This was then followed by a 1972 [[College Art Association]] Panel, chaired by Nochlin, entitled "Eroticism and the Image of Woman in Nineteenth-Century Art". Within a decade, scores of papers, articles, and essays sustained a growing momentum, fueled by the [[Second-wave feminism|Second-wave feminist movement]], of critical discourse surrounding women's interactions with the arts as both artists and subjects.  In her pioneering essay, Nochlin applies a feminist critical framework to show systematic exclusion of women from art training, arguing that exclusion from practicing art as well as the canonical history of art was the consequence of cultural conditions which curtailed and restricted women from art producing fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nochlin|first1=Linda|title=Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?|journal=ARTnews|date=January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; The few who did succeed were treated as anomalies and did not provide a model for subsequent success. [[Griselda Pollock]] is another prominent feminist art historian, whose use of psychoanalytic theory is described above.

While feminist art history can focus on any time period and location, much attention has been given to the Modern era. Some of this scholarship centers on the [[feminist art movement]], which referred specifically to the experience of women. Often, feminist art history offers a critical "re-reading" of the Western art canon, such as Carol Duncan's re-interpretation of [[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon#Feminist interpretation|Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]].  Two pioneers of the field are [[Mary Garrard]] and [[Norma Broude]]. Their anthologies ''Feminism and Art History: Questioning the Litany'', ''The Expanding Discourse: Feminism and Art History'', and ''Reclaiming Feminist Agency: Feminist Art History After Postmodernism'' are substantial efforts to bring feminist perspectives into the discourse of art history.  The pair also co-founded the [[Feminist Art History Conference]].

===Barthes and semiotics===
As opposed to iconography which seeks to identify meaning, [[semiotics]] is concerned with how meaning is created. [[Roland Barthes]]’s connoted and denoted meanings are paramount to this examination. In any particular work of art, an interpretation depends on the identification of [[denoted meaning]]—the recognition of a visual sign, and the [[connoted meaning]]—the instant cultural associations that come with recognition. The main concern of the semiotic art historian is to come up with ways to navigate and interpret connoted meaning.&lt;ref&gt;All ideas in this paragraph reference A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 31."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotic art history seeks to uncover the codified meaning or meanings in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;"S. Bann, 'Meaning/Interpretation', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, Critical Terms for Art History 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 128."&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, [[Meyer Schapiro]] borrowed [[Saussure]]’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods (Manchester 2006) pp. 213."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Schapiro, to understand the meaning of frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a [[wikt:profile|profile]], or a [[Three-quarter profile|three-quarter view]]. Schapiro combined this method with the work of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. By seeing the ''Mona Lisa'', for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or ''Mona Lisa''. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations as much as it is to reveal new possibilities.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24"&gt;"A. Potts, 'Sign', in R.S. Nelson and R. Shiff, ''Critical Terms for Art History'' 2nd edn (Chicago 2003) pp. 24."&lt;/ref&gt;

Semiotics operates under the theory that an image can only be understood from the viewer’s perspective. The artist is supplanted by the viewer as the purveyor of meaning, even to the extent that an interpretation is still valid regardless of whether the creator had intended it.&lt;ref name="A. Potts, 2003 pp. 24" /&gt; [[Rosalind Krauss]] espoused this concept in her essay “In the Name of Picasso.” She denounced the artist’s monopoly on meaning and insisted that meaning can only be derived after the work has been removed from its historical and social context. [[Mieke Bal]] argued similarly that meaning does not even exist until the image is observed by the viewer. It is only after acknowledging this that meaning can become opened up to other possibilities such as feminism or psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;"M. Hatt and C. Klonk, ''Art History: A Critical Introduction to its Methods'' (Manchester 2006) pp. 205-208."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum studies and collecting===
Aspects of the subject which have come to the fore in recent decades include interest in the patronage and consumption of art, including the economics of the art market, the role of collectors, the intentions and aspirations of those commissioning works, and the reactions of contemporary and later viewers and owners. [[Museum studies]], including the history of museum collecting and display, is now a specialized field of study, as is the history of collecting.

===New materialism===
Scientific advances have made possible much more accurate investigation of the materials and techniques used to create works, especially [[infra-red]] and [[x-ray]] photographic techniques which have allowed many underdrawings of paintings to be seen again. Proper analysis of [[pigment]]s used in paint is now possible, which has upset many attributions. [[Dendrochronology]] for [[panel painting]]s and [[radio-carbon dating]] for old objects in organic materials have allowed scientific methods of dating objects to confirm or upset dates derived from stylistic analysis or documentary evidence. The development of good colour photography, now held digitally and available on the internet or by other means, has transformed the study of many types of art, especially those covering objects existing in large numbers which are widely dispersed among collections, such as [[illuminated manuscript]]s and [[Persian miniature]]s, and many types of archaeological artworks.

Concurrent to those technological advances, art historians have shown increasing interest in new theoretical approaches to the nature of artworks as objects. [[Thing theory]], [[actor–network theory]], and [[object-oriented ontology]] have played an increasing role in art historical literature.

===Nationalist art history===
The making of art, the academic history of art, and the history of art museums are closely intertwined with the rise of nationalism. Art created in the modern era, in fact, has often been an attempt to generate feelings of [[nationalism|national superiority]] or [[patriotism|love of one’s country]]. [[Russian art#Visual arts|Russian art]] is an especially good example of this, as the [[Russian avant-garde]] and later [[Soviet art]] were attempts to define that country’s identity.

Most art historians working today identify their specialty as the art of a particular culture and time period, and often such cultures are also nations. For example, someone might specialize in the 19th-century German or contemporary Chinese art history. A focus on nationhood has deep roots in the discipline. Indeed, [[Vasari]]'s [[Lives of the Artists]] is an attempt to show the superiority of Florentine artistic culture, and [[Heinrich Wölfflin]]'s writings (especially his monograph on [[Albrecht Dürer]]) attempt to distinguish Italian from German styles of art.

Many of the largest and most well-funded art museums of the world, such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington are state-owned. Most countries, indeed, have a [[national museum|national gallery]], with an explicit mission of preserving the cultural patrimony owned by the government—regardless of what cultures created the art—and an often implicit mission to bolster that country’s own [[cultural heritage]]. The National Gallery of Art thus showcases art made in the [[Visual arts of the United States|United States]], but also owns objects from across the world.

==Divisions by period==
The field of Art History is traditionally divided into specializations or concentrations based on eras and regions, with further sub-division based on media. Thus, someone might specialize in "19th-century German [[architecture]]" or in "16th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] sculpture." Sub-fields are often included under a specialization. For example, the Ancient [[Near East]], Greece, Rome, and Egypt are all typically considered special concentrations of [[Ancient art]]. In some cases, these specializations may be closely allied (as Greece and Rome, for example), while in others such alliances are far less natural (Indian art versus [[Korea]]n art, for example).

[[History of Art|Non-Western art]] is a relative newcomer to the Art Historical canon. Recent revisions of the semantic division between art and artifact have recast objects created in non-Western cultures in more aesthetic terms. Relative to those studying [[Ancient Rome]] or the [[Italian Renaissance]], scholars specializing in Africa, the [[Ancient Americas]] and Asia are a growing minority.

"Contemporary art history" refers to research into the period from the 1960s until today reflecting the break from the assumptions of [[modernism]] brought by artists of the [[neo-avant-garde]] and a continuity in contemporary art in terms of practice based on [[conceptualist]] and [[post-conceptualist]] practices.

==Professional organizations==
In the United States, the most important art history organization is the [[College Art Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegeart.org/ College Art Association]&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes an annual conference and publishes the ''[[Art Bulletin]]'' and ''[[Art Journal (CAA)|Art Journal]]''. Similar organizations exist in other parts of the world, as well as for specializations, such as [[architectural history]] and [[Renaissance]] art history. In the UK, for example, the [[Association of Art Historians]] is the premiere organization, and it publishes a journal titled ''[[Art History (journal)|Art History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aah.org.uk/ Association of Art Historians Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Krużlowa Wyżna, zespół kościoła par. p.w. Narodzenia NMP 2.jpg|thumb|Wooden church in Krużlowa Wyżna]]
The '''Beautiful Virgin Mary from Krużlowa''' is a [[Gothic art|Gothic]] [[sculpture]] made from [[Tilia|linden-tree timber]], found 1889 in the Catholic parish church in the [[Krużlowa Wyżna]] village ([[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]], [[Nowy Sącz County]], [[Grybów]] commune) by [[Władysław Łuszczkiewicz]] and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]. Since 1899 the sculpture is part of the [[National Museum, Kraków]] collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://culture.pl/pl/dzielo/madonna-z-kruzlowej Culture.pl]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture belongs to the so-called soft style of [[International Gothic]] art, and is an example of the “Beautiful Madonnas”. 

It was made on the beginning of the fifteenth century by an unknown artist.

The sculpture is 119 cm high and can be watched from three sides; the rear side is deeply hollowed to avoid the cracking of drying timber.

It shows Virgin Mary with naked [[Child Jesus|Baby Jesus]] holding an apple. The Virgin stands in [[Contrapposto|counterpose]], her clothes are rich pleated.

Probably was this sculpture assigned for one of [[Cracow]] churches, but in the seventeenth century it was replaced by newer baroque sculptures and carried to the village church of Krużlowa. The first written message was dated 1607, the next from 1766. The sculpture was first placed on the High Altar of the church, but later was moved to the entrance hall, and finally, because of threat of [[bark beetle]]s was removed to the church attic and forgotten.

The sculpture was found by the two artists in a very bad condition, coated with a three layers of oil paint, partially erased to the wooden ground. The sculpture was bought by the [[National Museum, Kraków]] and first exposed in the [[Sukiennice Museum]] at [[Kraków Cloth Hall]], since 1924 in the City Hall tower. 1940 the sculpture was requisitioned by the [[German-occupied Europe|German occupation forces]] and posed in the office of the Nazi governor [[Hans Frank]] on the [[Wawel castle]]. Since October 2007 the sculpture is part of the art collections of the [[Erazm Ciołek (bishop of Płock)|Erasmus Ciołek]] Bishop’s Palace, a part of the Kraków National Museum.

'''Bidia Dandaron''' (Vidyadhara, {{lang-ru|Бидия Дандарович Дандарон}}) (December 28, 1914, Soorkhoi, Kizhinga, [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]] — October 26, 1974, Vydrino, Buryatia) was a major Buddhist author and teacher in the USSR. He also worked in academic [[Tibetology]], contributed to the Tibetan-Russian Dictionary (1959) and made several translations from Tibetan into Russian. He is mostly remembered as a Buddhist teacher whose students in [[Russia]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]] continued both religious and scholarly work, and as an early Buddhist author who wrote on European philosophy, history, and science within a Buddhist framework. Among his students were [[Alexander Piatigorsky]] and [[Linnart Mäll]].

== Biography ==
Born to a Buryat Buddhist tantric practitioner named Dorji Badmaev, Bidia studied both secular and Buddhist subjects from an early age. Then, he was recognized as the [[tulku]] of Gyayag Rinpoche (Wilie: rGya yag rin po che), a Buddhist master of [[Gelug]] tradition from [[Kumbum Monastery]], who visited Buryatia several times and died not long before Bidia was born. Gyayag Rinpoche's tulku lineage starts from [[Vimalakirti]].

However the Buryat lamas under Tsydenov did not submit the boy to the Tibetan search party that had recognized Dandaron as a tulku, on the pretext of Buryat lamas being capable to educate, and being in need of, their own religious leader. Tibetans then returned to Kumbum and chose a local boy (Blo-bzang bstan-pa’i rgyal-mtshan, 1916–1990), who as Gyayag Rinpoche was later a sutra teacher of the [[10th Panchen Lama]], and the head of the search party for the 11th Panchen Lama, this search resulting in choosing [[Gyaincain Norbu]] as the Panchen Lama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.com.cn/ch-xizang/tibet/part2/title1.html china.com.cn]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Buryat religious and secular leader Lubsan-Sandan Tsydenov proclaimed Dandaron heir to his throne of Dharmaraja.

In 1934—1937 Dandaron studied in the Aircraft Device Construction Institute in [[Leningrad]], and attended the Eastern Faculty of Leningrad State University as an auditor, studying Tibetan language with Andrey Vostrikov.

As religion was suppressed by the Soviets, Dandaron was brought to court three times and spent a significant part of his life in prison camps. First, he was arrested in 1937 and released in 1943, then arrested again in 1948 but released with [[political rehabilitation]] in 1956. He actively wrote and taught on Buddhism while imprisoned, and some of his ardent followers started from camps. There, he also had a number of Russian philosophers and other scholars, as well as Buryat lamas, to exchange opinions and gain knowledge of European philosophy and history he widely refers to in his writings. Principally, [[Vasily Seseman]], a philosophy professor from Lithuania who was imprisoned from 1950 to 1956, became his friend and tutor in European philosophy, starting Danrdaron's appreciation of Kantian thought.

After 1956 his friends from the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Oriental Studies Institute]] in [[Leningrad]] made attempts to give him a job in the institute library, but were not allowed to. In 1957, Dandaron began working for the Buryat Institute of Social Sciences in Ulan-Ude. He wrote extensively on Tibetan studies and translated religious and historical literature of Tibet into Russian, publishing over 30 articles and other works. His religious works came to public as [[samizdat]].

In 1960 - early 1970s the community of his followers grew to several dozen people, mostly from St Petersburg, Moscow, Tartu and Vilnius. His principal community was in St Petersburg (then Leningrad) where in 1972 he was arrested and tried for the organization of a Buddhist sect. Some of his students were arrested as well, but never tried. Mostly they were released, while some were placed in mental health clinic. Dandaron got 5 years of labor camp where he continued to write about, teach and practice Buddhism. Having warned his neighbors, in the camp in Vydrino he experienced [[samadhi]] several times, stopping his heartbeat and breath at will for days. In 1974 he did not return from the samadhi.

[[File:Black Sash.jpg|thumb|Black Sash demonstration between 1955 and 1960]]
The '''Black Sash''' was a non-violent liberal white women's resistance organisation that was founded on 19 May 1955 in [[South Africa]] by Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza, and Helen Newton-Thompson.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/our-legacy/our-history |title=The Beginning of the Sash 1955-1956 |access-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426012713/http://www.blacksash.org.za/index.php/our-legacy/our-history |archive-date=2015-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The Black Sash was founded on 19 May 1955 by six middle-class women, Jean Sinclair, Ruth Foley, Elizabeth McLaren, Tertia Pybus, Jean Bosazza and Helen Newton-Thompson.&lt;ref name=Black/&gt; The organisation was founded as the ''Women’s Defence of the Constitution League'' but was eventually shortened by the press as the Black Sash due to the women's habit of wearing black sashes at their protest meetings.&lt;ref name="Villa"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spirit of Freedom: South African Leaders on Religion and Politics | publisher=University of California Press | author=Villa-Vicencio, Charles | year=1996 | isbn=978-0520200456}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} These black sashes symbolised the mourning for the South Africa Constitution.&lt;ref name=Villa/&gt;{{rp|79}} The founding members gathered for tea in Johannesburg before they decided to organise a movement against the Senate Act. They succeeded to hold a vigil of 2 000 women who marched from [[Joubert Park]] to the [[Johannesburg City Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.natalia.org.za/Files/Publications/Black%20Sash%20book.pdf|title=STANDING ON STREET CORNERS|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Black Sash initially campaigned against the removal of [[Coloured]] or mixed race voters from the voters' roll in the [[Cape Province]] by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government. As the [[apartheid]] system began to reach into every aspect of South African life, Black Sash members demonstrated against the [[Pass Laws]] and the introduction of other apartheid legislation. It would later open Advice Offices to provide information concerning their legal rights to non-white South African's affected by that legislation.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ynOFAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=black+sash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinoLnY0cveAhXLR30KHSXoCDo4FBDoAQg4MAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20sash&amp;f=false|title=Women, Ethnicity and Nationalism: The Politics of Transition|last=Miller|first=Robert E.|last2=Wilford|first2=Rick|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=9781134695492|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|61}} Its members "''used the relative safety of their privileged racial classification to speak out against the erosion of human rights in the country. Their striking black sashes were worn as a mark of mourning and to protest against the succession of unjust laws. But they were not only on the streets. Volunteers spent many hours in the national network of advice offices and in the monitoring of courts and pass offices.''" (Speech by Marcella Naidoo, National Director of the Black Sash, June 2005)

Between 1955 and 1994, the Black Sash provided widespread and visible proof of white resistance towards the apartheid system. Its members worked as volunteer advocates to families affected by apartheid laws; held regular street demonstrations; spoke at political meetings; brought cases of injustice to the attention of their Members of Parliament, and kept vigils outside Parliament and government offices. Many members were vilified within their local white communities, and it was not unusual for women wearing the black sash to be physically attacked by supporters of apartheid.

In the 1980s it was part of the National Land Committee assisting the non-white communities that were subject to forced land removals.&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt;{{rp|61}} It would also be involved on the Rural Women's Movement, supporting rural non-white women rights in regards to inheritance and land ownership.&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt;{{rp|61}} In 1983, the organisation called for the abolition of military conscription.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOHHNsobjPIC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=the+black+sash&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHrM7ZtqzYAhXJuxQKHadjDUkQ6AEIQTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20black%20sash&amp;f=false|title=Women in South African History: They Remove Boulders and Cross Rivers|last=Gasa|first=Nomboniso|date=2007|publisher=HSRC Press|year=|isbn=9780796921741|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==End of Apartheid==
The Black Sash's resistance movement came to an end in the early 1990s with the end of apartheid, the unbanning of the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and the release of [[Nelson Mandela]] from imprisonment. Its role was recognised by Nelson Mandela on his release and by subsequent political leaders. The organisation was reformed in 1995 as a non-racial humanitarian organisation, working to 'make human rights real for all living in South Africa'.

In May 2015, the organisation celebrated its 60th anniversary as it shifted its focus towards education, training, advocacy and community monitoring. The celebration of the Black Sash history was also marked by the launching of two books, namely ''Standing on Street Corners: a History of the Natal Midlands Region of the Black Sash'' and ''a'' biography by Annemarie Hendrikz''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2015-05-14-the-conscience-of-white-south-africa-celebrating-the-black-sash-60-years-later/#.WkS97t8oRhE|title=‘The conscience of white South Africa’: Celebrating the Black Sash, 60 years later {{!}} Daily Maverick|website=www.dailymaverick.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body culture studies''' describe and compare bodily practice in the larger context of [[culture]] and [[society]], i.e. in the tradition of [[anthropology]], [[history]] and [[sociology]]. As body culture studies analyse culture and society in terms of human bodily practices, they are sometimes viewed as a form of [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].
The significance of the body and of body culture (in German ''Körperkultur'', in Danish ''kropskultur'') was discovered since the early twentieth century by several historians and sociologists. During the 1980s, a particular school of body culture studies spread, in connection with – and critically related to – [[sport]]s studies. Body culture studies were especially established at Danish universities and academies and cooperated with Nordic, European and East Asian research networks.

Body culture studies include studies of [[dance]], play ([[play (activity)]]) and [[game]], outdoor activities, festivities and other forms of movement culture. The field of body culture studies is floating towards studies of medical cultures, of working habits, of [[gender]] and sexual cultures, of [[fashion]] and [[body decoration]], of popular [[festivity]] and more generally towards [[popular culture]] studies.

Body culture studies have shown useful by making the study of sport enter into broader historical and sociological discussion – from the level of subjectivity to civil society, state and market.

== Earlier studies in body and culture ==

Since early 20th century, sociologists and philosophers had discovered the significance of the body, especially [[Norbert Elias]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and some phenomenologists. Later, [[Michel Foucault]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and the Stuttgart [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] delivered important inspirations for the new body culture studies.

The sociologist Norbert Elias (1939) wrote the first sociology, which placed the body and bodily practice in its centre, describing the change of table manners, shame and violence from the Middle Ages to Early Modern court society as a process of civilisation. Later, Elias (1989) studied the culture of duel in Wilhelminian Prussia, throwing light on particular traits of the German [[sonderweg]]. Elias' figurational sociology of the body became productive especially in the field of sport studies (Elias/ Dunning 1986; [[Eric Dunning]] et al. 2004). His concept of the "process of civilisation" received, however, also critique from the side of comparative [[anthropology]] of bodily practices (Duerr 1988/2005).

The [[Frankfurt School]] of [[Critical Theory]] turned towards the body with [[Marxist]] and [[Freudian]] perspectives. [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (1947) described the Western "[[dialectics]] of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]" as including an underground history of the body. Body history lead from the living body to the dead body becoming a commodity under [[capitalism]]. A younger generation of the Frankfurt School launched the [[Neo-Marxist]] sports critique (Rigauer 1969) and developed alternative approaches to movement studies and movement culture (Lippe 1974; Moegling 1988). Historical studies about the body in industrial work (Rabinbach 1992), in transportation (Schivelbusch 1977), and in [[Fascist]] aesthetics ([[Theweleit]] 1977) as well as in the philosophy of [[space]] ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998/ 2004) had their roots in this critical approach.

Philosophical phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) paid attention to the body, too. [[Helmuth Plessner]] (1941) studied laughter and weeping as fundamental human expressions. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1945) placed the body in the centre of human existence, as a way of experiencing the world, challenging the traditional body-mind dualism of [[René Descartes]]. [[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) approached bodily existence via a phenomenology of the elements and of space, starting by "[[psychoanalysis]] of fire".

Based on phenomenological traditions, [[Michel Foucault]] (1975) studied the configurations of knowledge in the post-1800 society, launching the concept of modern panoptical control (→[[Panopticon]]). The body appeared as object of military discipline and of the panopticon as a mechanism of "the biopolitics of power". Foucault's approach became especially influential for studies in sport, space, and architecture (Vertinsky/ Bale 2004) as well as for studies in the discipline of [[gymnastic]] and sport ([[Vigarello]] 1978; Barreau/ Morne 1984; Vertinsky/ McKay 2004).

While Foucault's studies focused on top-down strategies of power, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] directed his attention more towards bottom-up processes of social-bodily practice. For analysing the class aspect of the body, Bourdieu (1966/67) developed the influential concept of habitus as an incorporated pattern becoming social practice by diverse forms of taste, distinction and display of the body. Some of Bourdieu's disciples applied these concepts to the study of sports and gymnastics (Defrance 1987).

In Germany, influences of phenomenology induced body culture studies in the historical field. The Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] focused from 1971 on [[gestures]] and laughter, [[martial arts]], sport and dance to analyze changes of society and differences between European and non-European cultures (Nitschke 1975, 1981, 1987, 1989, 2009; [[Henning Eichberg]] 1978).

These approaches met with tendencies of the late 1970s and 1980s, when [[humanities]] and [[sociology]] developed a new and broader interest in the body. Sociologists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists, scholars from sport studies and from medical studies met in talking about "the return of the body" or its "reappearance" (Kamper/ Wulf 1982). The new interest towards the body was soon followed up by the term "body culture" itself.

== The word and concept of "body culture" – alternative practice ==

The word "body culture" appeared for first time around 1900, but at that time signifying a certain form of physical practice. The so-called "life reform" (German ''[[Lebensreform]]'') aimed at the reform of clothing and of nurture and favoured new bodily activities, which constituted a new sector side by side with established gymnastics and sport. The main fields of this third sector of movement culture were [[nudism]], rhythmic-expressive gymnastics, [[yoga]] and [[body building]] (Wedemeyer-Kolwe 2004) as well as a new type of youth wandering. Though highly diverse, they found a comprehensive term in the German word ''Körperkultur'', in English [[physical culture]] (→[[physical education]]), in French ''culture physique'', and in Danish ''kropskultur''. Inspirations from the movement of body culture gave birth to early studies in the history of bodily positions and movements (Gaulhofer 1930; [[Marcel Mauss]] 1934).

In German Socialist workers' sport, the concept of ''Körperkultur'' had a prominent place. The concept also entered into Russian [[Socialism]] where ''fiskultura'' became an alternative to [[bourgeois]] sport, uniting the revolutionary fractions of more aesthetical ''[[Proletkult]]'' and more health-oriented "hygienism" (Riordan 1977). Later, [[Stalinism]] forced the contradictory terms under the formula "sport and body culture". This continued in the [[Soviet bloc]] after 1945.
When the 1968 [[student movement]] revived Marxism, the concept of body culture – ''Körperkultur'' in West Germany, "somatic culture" in America – re-entered into the sports-critical discourse, but received new analytical dimensions. ''Quel corps?'' (Which body?) was the title of a critical review of sports, edited by the French Marxist [[educationalist]] [[Jean-Marie Brohm]] in 1975-1997. In Germany, a series of books under the title ''Sport: Kultur, Veränderung'' (Sport: culture, change) marked the body cultural turn from 1981, with works of Rigauer, Elias, Eichberg and others.

== Body culture studies – a new critical school ==

In Denmark, a particular school of Body Culture Studies – ''kropskultur'' – developed since around 1980 in connection with the critique of sport (Korsgaard 1982; Eichberg 1998; Vestergård 2003; Nielsen 1993 and 2005). It had its background in Danish popular gymnastics and in alternative movement practices – outdoor activities, play and game, dance, [[meditation]]. In Finland, the concept ''ruumiinkulttuuri'' found a similar attention (Sironen 1995; Sparkes/ Silvennoinen 1999).

In international cooperation, "body anthropology" became the keyword for French, Danish and German philosophers, sociologists and educationalists who founded the ''Institut International d'Anthropologie Corporelle (IIAC)'' in 1987. They undertook case studies in traditional [[game]]s as well as in "scenes" of new urban body cultures (Barreau/ Morne 1984; Barreau/ Jaouen 1998; Dietrich 2001 and 2002).

Body culture studies found a particular interest in East Asian countries. In Japan, the sociologist Satoshi Shimizu from the University of Tsukuba established in 2002 a ''Centre for the Study of Body Culture'', publishing the review ''Gendai Sports Hyôron'' (Contemporary Sport Critique, in Japanese, since 1999). In Taiwan, Hsu I-hsiung from the National Taiwan Normal University founded in 2003 the ''Taiwan Body Culture Society'' (Taiwan shenti wenhua xiehui), publishing the reviews ''Sport Studies'' (in Chinese, since 2007) and ''Body Culture Journal'' (in Chinese, since 2005). And in Korea, Jong Young Lee from the University of Suwon published since 2004 the ''International Journal of Eastern Sport &amp; Physical Education'', focusing on body culture and traditional games.

These initiatives were connected with each other both by contents and by personal networks. In the English and American world, Allen Guttmann (1978, 1996, 2004), [[John Hoberman]] (1984), John Bale (1996, 2002, 2004), Susan Brownell (1995, 2008) and Patricia Vertinsky (2004) contributed by opening the history, sociology and geography of sports towards body culture studies.

While the concept of body culture earlier had denoted an alternative practice and was used in singular, it became now an analytical category describing body cultures in plural. The terms of physical culture (or [[physical education]]) and body culture separated – the first describing a practice, the second a subject of theoretical analysis.

== Questioning the "individual" body ==

Studies in body culture have shown that bodily existence is more than just "the body" as being an individual skin bag under control of an individual mind. Bodily practice happens between the different bodies. This questions current types of thinking "the [[individual]]": the [[epistemological]] [[individualism]] and the thesis of '[[Modern history#Late modern period|late-modern]] [[individualism|individualization]]'.

The methodological habit of counter-posing "the individual" and "the society" is largely disseminated in sociology. It was fundamentally criticized by [[Norbert Elias]] who underlined that there was no meaning in the separation between the individual as a sort of core of human existence and the society as a secondary environment around this core. Society was inside the human body. In contrast, the epistemological [[solipsism]] treated human existence as if the human being was alone in the world – and was only in a secondary process "socialized" ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998 vol. 1).

Another current assumption is the historical-sociological individualism. Sociologists as [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] have postulated that individualization during "high" or "late modernity" had replaced all earlier traditions – religion, nation, class – and left "the individual" alone with its body. The body, thus, got a central position as the only fix-point of "[[self-identity]]" left after the dissolution of the traditional norms. The individual chooses and makes its own body as a sort of "[[gesamtkunstwerk]] [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]".

Body-cultural studies have challenged this assumption ([[Henning Eichberg]] 2010: 58-79). They throw light on inter-bodily relations, within which the human individuality has a much more complex position.

== Social time ==

An important aspect of body culture is temporal. Modern society is characterized by the significance of speed and acceleration. Sport, giving priority to competitive running and racing, is central among the phenomena illustrating the specifically modern velocity (Eichberg 1978, Bale 2004). The historical change from the circulating stroll in aristocratic and early bourgeois culture to modern [[jogging]] as well as the changes from coach traffic via the railway (Schivelbusch 1977) to the sport race of automobiles (→[[auto racing]]) (Sachs 1984) produced new body-cultural configurations of social time.

On the basis of [[transportation]] and [[urbanism]], [[blitzkrieg]] and sports, the French architect and cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] (1977) launched the terms of "dromology" (i.e. science of racing) and "dromocracy" (power or dominance of velocity) to describe the knowledge and the politics of modern social acceleration. But the concept of social time embraces many more differentiations, which can be explored by comparing time-dynamic movements of different ethnic cultures (Hall 1984).

== Social space ==

Another important aspect of body culture is spatial. Bodily display and movement always create space – physical space as socio-psychical space and vice versa. Bodily activities have during history changed between indoor or outdoor milieus, between non-specialized environment, specialized facilities (→[[sports facilities]]) and bodily opposition against existing standardized facilities or what was called "sport scape". In movement, straight lines and the culture of the streamline were confronted by [[mazes]] and [[labyrinthine]] structures, by patterns of [[fractal]] geometry. All these patterns are not just spatial-practical arrangements, but they play together with societal orientations. Under this aspect, one has described the history of panoptical control (Foucault 1975; Vertinsky/ Bale 2004), the parcellation of the sportive space, and the hygienic purification of spaces (Augestad 2003). [[Proxemics]] (Hall 1966), the study of distance and space, has become a special field of body culture studies.

Body culture studies have also influenced the understanding of "nature". In the period around 1800, the "nature" of body culture – of outdoor life, [[naturism]] and green movements (→[[green politics]]) – became a world of liberation and opposition: "Back to nature!" In the course of modern industrial culture, this "other" nature became subjected to colonization and simulation, forming a "second nature". It even became a virtual world, which is simulating people's senses as a "third nature". The study of body culture contributed to a history of [[cultural ecology]] (Eichberg 1988).

Body cultural studies also contributed to a differentiation between what in everyday language often is confused as 'space' and 'place' whose dialectics were shown by the Chinese-American philosopher [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] (see Bale 2004). Space can be described by coordinates and by certain [[choreographies]]. Spatial structures can be standardized and transferred from place to place, which is the case with the standardized facilities of sports. Place, in contrast, is unique – it is only here or there. Locality is related to identity. People play in a certain place – and create the place by play and game. The place plays with the people, as a co-player.

== Body culture and politics ==
Body culture can also be considered political such as how the [[body shape]] and appearance as well as sports, dance, and other recreational activities manifest and influence social change driven by politics. This is best demonstrated by [[practice theory]], which explains that, since body techniques serve as the means by which existing social order is produced and maintained, it, therefore, become important sites for challenging and transforming the social order when change does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Training the Body for China: Sports in the Moral Order of the People's Republic|last=Brownell|first=Susan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0226076466|location=Chicago|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In power plays, for instance, the body is used in sporting events as a form of rhetoric, articulating political causes. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the body became an important part of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[geopolitics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Politics of Post-9/11 American Sport: Power, Pedagogy and the Popular|last=Silk|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415873413|location=New York|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the projection of American power. On the other hand, the body was also used to condemn elitist and spectator sport within a mass physical culture starting this period in America, which evokes participation, inclusion, and populism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body is an integral component in the [[Feminist political theory|feminist politics]]. It is maintained that in order for this feminist initiatives to be effective, it is imperative that women's bodies, along with their works, labor, and voice, are present for everyone to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Suleiman|first=Susan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=0674298713|location=Cambridge|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilisation, discipline, modernity ==

Studies of body culture enriched the analysis of historical change by conflicting terms. [[Norbert Elias]] (1986) studied sport in order to throw light on the ''civilizing process'' (→[[The Civilizing Process]]). In sports, he saw a line going from original violence to civilized interlacement and pacification. Though there were undertones of hope, Elias tried to avoid [[evolutionism]], which since the nineteenth century postulated a 'progressive' way from 'primitive' to 'civilized' patterns.

While the concept of civilization normally had hopeful undertones, ''[[discipline]]'' had more critical undertones. Cultures of bodily discipline became visible – following [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and the [[Frankfurt School]] – in [[Baroque dance]] (Lippe 1974), in aristocratic and bourgeois pedagogy of the spinal column during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Vigarello 1978), and in [[hygienic]] strategies, school sanitation and school gymnastics during the twentieth century (Augestad 2003). Military exercise (→[[military drill]]) in Early Modern times was the classic field for body cultural discipline (Gaulhofer 1930; Kleinschmidt 1989).

In the field of sports, a central point of body-cultural dispute has been the question whether sport had its roots in Ancient Greek competitions of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] type or whether it was fundamentally linked to modernity. While nineteenth century's Neo-Humanism, Classicism and [[Olympism]] assumed the ancient roots of sport, body cultural studies showed that the patterns central to modern sports – quantification, rationalisation, principle of achievement – could not be dated before the industrial culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). What was practiced before, were popular games, noble exercises, festivities of different character, children's games and competitions, but not sport in modern understanding. The emergence of modern sport was an eruptive innovation rather than a logical prolongation of earlier practices. As a revolution of body culture, this transformation contributed to a deeper understanding of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The so-called Eichberg-Mandell-Guttmann theory about the uniqueness of modern sport became, however, a matter of controversies and was opposed by other historians (Carter/Krüger 1990).

What came out of the controversies between the concepts of modernity, evolution, civilization, discipline and revolution was that "[[modernization]]" only can be thought as a non-lineal change with nuances and full of contradictions. This is how the history of sport (Nielsen 1993 and 2005) and of gymnastics (Defrance 1987; Vestergård Madsen 2003) as well as the history of [[running]] (Bale 2004) have been described in body-cultural terms.

One of the visible and at the same time deeper changes in relation to the modern body concerns the dress reform and the appearance of the naked body, especially in the years between 1900 and the 1920s. The change from noble pale skin to suntanned skin as a 'sportive' distinction was not only linked to sport, but had a strong impact on society as a whole. The change of appreciated body colour reversed the social-bodily distinctions between people and classes fundamentally, and nudism became a radical expression of this body-cultural change.

== Industrial body and production ==

Body culture studies have cast new light on the origins and conditions of the Industrial Revolution, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed people's everyday life in a fundamental way. The traditional common-sense explanations of [[industrialization]] by technology and economy as 'driving forces' have shown as insufficient. Economic interests and technological change had their basic conditions in human social-bodily practice. The history of sport and games in body cultural perspective showed that this practice was changing one or two generations, before the Industrial Revolution as a technological and economic transformation took place. What had been [[carnival]]-like festivities, [[tournaments]] and popular games before, became modern sport by a new focus on results, measuring and quantifying records (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). Under the aspect of the principle of achievement, there was no sport in ancient Egypt, in ancient Greece, among the [[Aztecs]] or [[Vikings]], and in European [[Middle Ages]], though there were games, competitions and festivities. Sport as a new type of body culture resulted from societal changes in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries.

The genesis of sport in connection with industrial [[productivity]] called to attention the historical-cultural relativity of "production" (→[[Manufacturing]]) itself. Studies in the history of "the human motor" and the "mortal engines" of sport showed reification (→[[reification (Marxism)]]) and technology as lines of historical dynamics (Rigauer 1969; Vigarello 1988; Rabinbach 1992; Hoberman 1992). Production became apparent not as a universal concept, but as something historically specific – and sport was its body-cultural ritual.

== Trialectics of body culture ==

Body culture as a field of contradictions demands a dialectical approach, but it is not dualistic in character. Body culture studies have revealed trialectical relations inside the world of sports (Eichberg 1998, 2010; Bale 1996, 2002 and 2004).

The hegemonic model of Western modern body culture is ''achievement sport'', translating movement into records. Sportive competition follows the logic of productivity by bodily strain and forms a ranking pyramid with elite sports placed at the top and the losers at the bottom. Through sportive movement, people display a theatre of production.

A contrasting model within modern body culture is delivered by ''mass sports''. In [[gymnastics]] and [[fitness training]], the body is disciplined by subjecting it to certain rules of "scientific", social geometrical or aesthetic order (Roubal 2007). By rhythmic repetition and formal homogenization, the individual bodies are integrated into a larger whole, which is recommended in terms of reproduction (→[[reproduction (economics)]]), as being healthy and educative. Through fitness sport, people absolve a ritual of reproductive correctness and integration.

A third model is present in ''popular festivity'', ''dance and play''. In carnival and folk sport, people meet people by festive movement. This type of gathering may give life to the top-down arrangements of both productive achievement sport and reproductive fitness sport, too. But the body experience of popular festivity, dance, play and game is a-productive in itself – it celebrates relation in movement.

Practices of sport in their diversity and their historical change, thus, clarify inner contradictions inside social life more generally – among these the contradictions between state, market and civil society. The trialectics of body culture throw light on the complexity of societal relations.

== Body cultures in plural ==

"Culture" in singular is an abstraction. The study of body culture is always a study of body cultures in plural. Body cultures show human life in variety and differences, assimilation and distinction, conflicts and contradictions. This demands a comparative approach to otherness, and this is the way several studies in body culture have gone.

Culture was studied as cultures already by the school of [[Cultural Relativism]] in American anthropology ([[American Anthropological Association]]) in the 1930s ([[Ruth Benedict]]). [[Postcolonial]] studies have taken this [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] perspective up again (Bale 1996 and 2004; Brownell 1995; Azoy 2003; Leseth 2004). The discourse in singular about "the body in our society" became problematic when confronted with body cultures in conflict and tension.

The plurality and diversity of body cultures is, however, not only a matter of outward relations. There are also body cultures in plural inside a given society. The study of different class habitus (→[[class culture]]), [[youth cultures]], gender cultures (→[[gender identity]]) etc. opened up for deeper insights into the differentiation of civil society.

== Configurational analysis ==

Body culture studies try to understand bodily practice as patterns revealing the inner tensions and contradictions of a given society. In order to analyze these connections, the study of body culture has turned attention to the configurations of movement in time and space, the energy of movement, its interpersonal relations and objectification (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]). Above this basis, people build a superstructure of institutions and ideas, organising and reflecting body culture in relation to collective actions and interests (Eichberg 1978; Dietrich 2001: 10-32; see keyword 2).

By elaborating the complex interplay between bodily practice and the superstructures of ideas and conscience, body cultures studies challenge the established history and sociology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2055">Like the other autonomous member churches of the [[Anglican Communion]], the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]] has its own system of [[canon law]]. Unlike the [[Canon law of the Church of England|system of canon law in the Church of England]], which continues to be drawn from the canon law of the [[Western church]], English ecclesiastical law did not remain in force in the Episcopal Church after the [[American Revolution]].{{sfn|Podmore|2008|p=127}} There are two parallel systems of canon law within the church operating on a national level, governed by the [[General Convention]], and on a diocesan level, with each diocesan convention empowered to create constitutions and canons. Diocesan constitutions do not require the approval of the General Convention. The Episcopal Church is notable among Anglican Churches for the extent to which the Constitution and Canons of the General Convention leave matters to regulation at the diocesan and parochial levels.{{sfn|Podmore|2008|p=134}}

'''Chiquirines''' is an ancient [[Pre-Columbian]] archaeological site, located in the modern-day [[Retalhuleu Department]], [[Guatemala]]. It is located near the major [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic Period]] site of [[Ujuxte]] and is considered to be a satellite of that city and contemporary with it.&lt;ref&gt;Love 1999, p.141. Poe n.d. A, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiquirines features a smaller copy of a complex at Ujuxte, consisting of seven mounds arranged around a central plaza upon a basal platform.&lt;ref&gt;Love 1999, p.141. Poe n.d. C.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest of these mounds had a stairway ascending the west side.&lt;ref&gt;Love 1999, p.141.&lt;/ref&gt; Broken fragments of sculpture have been found at Chiquirines.&lt;ref&gt;Love 1999, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiquirines was discovered during a regional survey undertaken during the 1993&amp;ndash;1994 field seasons at Ujuxte.&lt;ref&gt;Poe n.d. B.&lt;/ref&gt; The site is situated {{convert|5.3|km|mi}} to the northwest of Ujuxte.&lt;ref&gt;Poe n.d. A, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist Michael Love has mapped more than 40 mounds at Chiquirines.&lt;ref&gt;Poe n.d. A, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Ceramic finds at Chiquirines date to the same period as those at Ujuxte and confirm that the two sites were contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Poe n.d. D.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chiquirines'' is the pluralised Spanish name, of [[Nahuatl]] origin, of the [[cicada]] species ''Odopoea imbellis''.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández 2008, p.77.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive Madisonianism''' is the idea that [[divided government]] is better than one in which a single [[Political party|party]] controls both the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] branches.&lt;ref name=lbn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1070&amp;context=polisci_pubs|title=Split-Ticket Voting: the Effects of Cognitive Madisonianism|format=PDF|author=Michael S. Lewis-Beck, Richard Nadeau|publisher=[[University of Iowa]]|date=1 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A relatively large percentage of the [[populace]] of the [[United States|USA]] [over 20%] supposedly voted a [[Split-ticket voting|split ticket]] because of this belief between 1992-1996, according to "Split-Ticket Voting: The Effects of Cognitive Madisonianism" by Lewis-Beck and Nadeau.&lt;ref name=lbn/&gt;

In the USA, Cognitive Madisonianism is in keeping with [[Article One of the United States Constitution]], and the principle of [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution]]. It comes about from a belief that [[James Madison]], and the other [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], intended power within the institutions of government ([[Executive branch of the United States|executive]], [[Legislative branch of the United States federal government|legislature]] and the [[Judicial branch of the United States government|judiciary]]) to be separate and act as [[checks and balances]] against each other. Voters might vote in this way because they do not want any of the above institutions to exercise too much power individually, as this might lead to tyranny. Voting due to Cognitive Madisonianism has potential to create weak government and negatively impact on the administration of the country, because it creates split ticket voting, which in turn can create [[Gridlock (politics)|legislative gridlock]].

'''Criminal records in the United States''' contain records of arrests, criminal charges and the disposition of those charges. Criminal records are compiled and updated on local, state, and federal levels by government agencies, most often [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]]. Their primary purpose is to present a comprehensive criminal history for a specific individual. 

Criminal records may be used for many purposes, including for background checks for purposes of employment, [[security clearance]], [[adoption]], [[immigration|immigration to the United States]], and licensing. Criminal records may be useful for identifying [[suspect]]s within the course of a [[Criminal procedure|criminal investigation]]. They may be used for enhanced sentencing in [[Criminal Law|criminal]] [[prosecution]]s.

==Background investigations==
Criminal history information is generally available to the public, and criminal history information for a specific state can typically be obtained from the state agency that maintains the record. States normally charge a fee for a copy of a person's criminal history. Private individuals can typically obtain copies of their own records, but may need a release in order to obtain the record of another person.

In the United States, any person, including a [[private investigator]], criminal research or background check company, may go to a county courthouse and search an index of criminal records by name and date of birth or have a county clerk search for records on an individual. Such a search may produce information about criminal and non-criminal charges that do not otherwise appear on a state criminal history abstract.

For employment screening purposes, unless state law provides otherwise, criminal convictions may be reported to a potential employer within a 7-year time range from the date of conviction.

==State records==

State criminal histories are maintained by government agencies, most often by law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref name="records"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Identification Bureau Listing|url=https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/identity-history-summary-checks/state-identification-bureau-listing|website=Criminal Justice Information Services|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to statewide records, local police departments, sheriffs' offices, and specialty police agencies may maintain their own internal databases. Records are also maintained by state departments of correction, in relation to offenders who have been sentenced to prison or a similar disposition that falls under their jurisdiction. Law enforcement agencies often share criminal history information with other enforcement agencies, and criminal history information is normally also available to the public.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=MGL 6-172|url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleII/Chapter6/Section172|website=Massachusetts Legislature|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All states have official "statewide repositories" that contain criminal history information contributed by the various county and municipal courts within the state.&lt;ref name="records"/&gt; In some states, minor criminal offenses are not included in the statewide record, or are included only if voluntarily reported by the court in which a conviction occurs.

===Juvenile records===
Most states provide some level of protection to juvenile criminal proceedings, and records of adjudication that result from the prosecution of a minor. The extent to which juvenile records are protected varies significantly by state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juvenile Records: a National Review of State Laws on Confidentiality, Sealing and Expungement|url=https://juvenilerecords.jlc.org/juvenilerecords/documents/publications/national-review.pdf|website=Juvenile Law Center|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex offender registries===
{{main|Sex offender registry}}
[[Sex offender registries in the United States|Registered sex offenders]] have information about their crimes or misdemeanors readily available, and [[Department of Corrections|Department of Correctional Services]] in many states disseminate sex offender to the public, through media such as the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2007/09/11/no-easy-answers/sex-offender-laws-us|title=No Easy Answers - Sex Offender Laws in the US|last=|first=|date=11 September 2007|website=Human Rights Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Department of Justice maintains a national sex offender database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Sex Offender Public Website|url=https://www.nsopw.gov/|website=NSOPW|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states exclude [[juvenile (law)|juveniles]] from sex offender registries.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite news|last1=Pilger|first1=Lori|title=Court rules to keep teen off sex offender registry|url=http://beatricedailysun.com/news/local/state-and-regional/court-rules-to-keep-teen-off-sex-offender-registry/article_7c7514a1-8aa0-5c3f-b50a-bd85ac62210a.html|accessdate=8 March 2018|agency=Beatrice Daily Sun|date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adults may be able to petition for exclusion from the registry under state law.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Petition to Discontinue Sex Offener Registration|url=http://courts.mi.gov/Administration/SCAO/Forms/courtforms/mc406a.pdf|website=State of Michigan|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Texas===
In [[Texas]], the [[Texas Department of Public Safety|Department of Public Safety]] maintains the [[Computerized Criminal History System]] (CCH) and Texas Public Sex Offender Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TxDPS Crime Records Service|url=https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DpsWebsite/index.aspx|website=Texas Department of Public Safety|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria for inclusion in the CCH is outlined as being [[conviction]]s and [[deferred adjudication]]s that are "reported to the Department on an offense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal History Name Search|url=https://records.txdps.state.tx.us/DpsWebsite/CriminalHistory/|website=Texas Department of Public Safety|accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal records==

The federal government maintains extensive criminal histories and acts as a central repository for all agencies to report their own data.

===Department of Justice===

====National Crime Information Center====
The NCIC ([[National Crime Information Center]]) is a repository of criminal history information that has been reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ([[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]). The NCIC stores information regarding open [[arrest warrant]]s, arrests, stolen property, missing persons, and dispositions regarding [[felony|felonies]] and [[misdemeanor]]s. With a very few exceptions, the records compiled by the federal government within the NCIC are not made available to the private sector.

The FBI's compilation of an individual's criminal identification, arrest, conviction, and incarceration information is known as the [[Interstate Identification Index]], or "Triple-I" for short. This is basically the FBI's rap sheet (Record of Arrest and Prosecution). It contains information voluntarily reported by law enforcement agencies across the country, as well as information provided by other federal agencies. It contains information on felonies and misdemeanors, and may also contain municipal and traffic offenses if reported by the individual agencies.

Each individual who has an entry in the Interstate Identification Index has a unique "FBI number" that is used to identify a specific individual. It compensates for the fact that an individual may provide several false names, or [[aliases]], to a law enforcement agency when he or she is booked. An individual may also lie about his or her date of birth or social security number as well, making an independent, unique identification key necessary.

It is important to note that the information provided by the Interstate Information Index may come from the agency who "booked" the individual and not necessarily the agency who arrested the individual. Therefore, there may be discrepancies between the arrest date, location, and arresting agency listed in the database and the actual date, location, and agency who made the arrest. The Interstate Information Index may also contain incarceration information as well, listing each time an inmate is transferred from one correctional institution to another as a separate "arrest." The Interstate Information Index is only as accurate as the information reported to it by individual agencies, and frequently lacks comprehensive information on the dispositions of the various arrests it lists. It is best used as a guide on where to find more comprehensive information on the individual.

====National Instant Criminal Background Check System====
Mandated by the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], the [[National Instant Criminal Background Check System]] (NICS) is used by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to screen potential [[firearm]]s buyers. Citizens who are currently ineligible to own a firearm under current laws may have the opportunity to have their firearms rights restored. Eligibility largely depends on state laws.  In addition to searching the NCIC databases, NICS maintains its own index to search for additional disqualifiers from gun ownership. Private companies are not allowed access to this system for background checks.

====Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System====
The FBI maintains the largest biometric database in the world with the [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS). Criminal submissions from arrests and civil submissions from authorized background checks are stored in IAFIS. Currently, IAFIS has more than 47 million submissions in its repository.

====Combined DNA Index System====
The [[Combined DNA Index System]] (CODIS) stores DNA profiles for both convicted felons in the Offender Index as well as unidentified DNA found at crime scenes in the Forensic Index. CODIS was originally piloted in 1990 as a project among 14 states. Currently, all 50 states, [[Puerto Rico]] and the United States Government participate in CODIS.

===Department of Transportation===

====National Driver Register====
{{main article|National Driver Register}}
While not officially a criminal history repository, the National Driver Register (NDR), operated by the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], maintains information on drivers regarding suspended licenses. The NDR maintains a database of information posted by individual states as mandated by federal law. All drivers who have had their licenses suspended for any reason (including suspensions resulting from several successive minor traffic violations: [[Massachusetts]] suspends for three separate speeding tickets over a six-month period) have that information posted by state Registry of Motor Vehicles offices to the NDR.

Also, the NDR records information concerning [[conviction (law)|convictions]] of [[drunk driving|driving under the influence of alcohol]] or [[controlled substance]]s, failing to render aid at an accident involving death or injury, and knowingly making a false [[affidavit]] or committing [[perjury]] to officials about an activity governed by a [[law]] or [[regulation]] on the operation of a [[motor vehicle]]. Additionally, the NDR contains information on [[traffic violation]]s resulting from a fatal automobile accident.

====Secure Flight====
[[Secure Flight]], operated by the [[Transportation Security Administration]], screens United States airline passengers to see if they are on terrorism watch lists. Unlike the predecessors [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System]] (CAPPS) &amp; CAPPS II, Secure Flight does not scan passengers for outstanding warrants nor does Secure Flight use computer algorithms to search for links to flagged terrorists.

===Obtaining copies of Federal criminal records===
It is possible to obtain copies of criminal records maintained by Federal agencies under
the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and the [[Privacy Act of 1974|Privacy Act]]. In general, you may only obtain records concerning yourself, deceased individuals, or living individuals who have given you their permission to obtain their records.

==Interstate records==
Most states have a statewide agency that acts as a clearinghouse for all statewide arrest information. These so-called "state rap sheets" are usually much more detailed than the Interstate Identification Index; usually listing not only the arrest information, but the subsequent court action following that arrest.

===National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System===
The [[National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System]] (NLETS) is an interface to search each state's criminal and driver records as well as the License Plate Reader (LPR) records going back one year maintained by the [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP). Thus through NLETS, a [[law enforcement agency]] in one state could search for someone's criminal and driver records in another state. NLETS potentially serves as a better tool to search for minor misdemeanors and traffic violations that would not be in the NCIC.

==Expungement==
{{main article|Expungement in the United States}}

In the United States, criminal records may be [[expungement|expunged]], though laws vary by state. Many types of offenses may be expunged, ranging from parking fines to felonies. In general, once sealed or expunged, all records of an arrest and/or subsequent court case are removed from the public record, and the individual may legally deny or fail to acknowledge ever having been arrested for or charged with any crime which has been expunged.

However, when applicants for a state professional license or job that is considered a public office or high security (such as security guard, law enforcement, or related to national security) must confess if they have an expunged conviction or else be denied clearance by the DOJ. With few exceptions, there is no post-conviction relief available in the federal system other than a [[presidential pardon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How to Seal or Expunge a Criminal Record|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/criminal_record.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Posner was born into an upper-middle class academic family of [[History of Jews in Germany|Jewish heritage]]. After attending the [[University of Berlin]], he served the [[Imperial German Army]] in [[World War I]] on both the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]] fronts, suffering a severe injury in [[Poland]] on December 1915.&lt;ref name="Mommsen"&gt;Mommsen, Wolfgang A. ''Ernst Posner, Mittler zwischen deutschem und amerikanischem Archivwesen. Zu seinem 75. Geburtstag''. Der Archivar 20 (3), 1967, pp. 217-230.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he finished his dissertation at the University of Berlin.&lt;ref name=Ross1981/&gt;

== Career in Germany ==
Posner began his professional career working for the Prussian State Privy Archive in 1921.&lt;ref name="Eckert2012"/&gt; Although exempt from the 1933 civil service laws as a World War I veteran, Posner was fired from the Prussian State Archives in 1935 as a result of the [[Nuremberg Laws]], and interned in the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] in November 1938, after the [[Kristallnacht]].&lt;ref name="LehmannSheehan2002"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hartmut|last1=Lehmann|first2=James J.|last2=Sheehan|title=An Interrupted Past: German-Speaking Refugee Historians in the United States after 1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O5WNhrmBVY0C&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=30 July 2013|date=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-40326-X|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in the United States ==
In 1939, Posner and his wife Käthe managed to flee to the [[United States]] via [[Sweden]]. With help from archivist [[Solon Buck]], he began teaching archival administration at [[American University]] in 1940, and remained there for 21 years.&lt;ref name=Ross1981/&gt;  A 1943 lecture of Posner's (later published as "Public Records under Military Occupation") was among the first calls for plans to administer captured German records.&lt;ref name="Eckert2012"/&gt; In November 1944, Posner prepared a report on the German archival profession, including biographical sketches and estimates of political views, for 72 leading German archivists.&lt;ref name="Eckert2012"/&gt;{{rp|108}} For his role in the development of American archival theory and practice, he was sometimes called "the Dean of American archivists."&lt;ref name=Ross1981/&gt; From 1955 to 1956 Posner served as the 11th president of the [[Society of American Archivists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.archivists.org/history/leaders/presidents|title = Presidents: Society of American Archivists|date = 2014|accessdate = August 14, 2014|publisher = Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Posner returned to Europe, settling in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|20|652|653|Posner, Ernst Maximilian|Eckhart G. Franz|137541341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|religious behavior]] by the [[Neolithic religion|Neolithic period]] has been discussed in terms of [[Evolutionary psychology of religion|evolutionary psychology]], the [[origin of language]] and [[mythology]], cross-cultural comparison of the [[anthropology of religion]], as well as evidence for spirituality or cultic behavior in the [[Paleolithic religion|Upper Paleolithic]], and similarities in [[Chimpanzee spirituality|great ape behavior]].

==Nonhuman religious behaviour==
Humanity's closest living relatives are [[common chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/bonobos-join-chimps-closest-human-relatives/|title= Bonobos Join Chimps as Closest Human Relatives|first=Ann |last= Gibbons|date= Jun 13, 2012|access-date= July 19, 2018|language= en|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180620222146/http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2012/06/bonobos-join-chimps-closest-human-relatives/|archive-date= June 20, 2018|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 8802414|pmc = 2756412|author1=Ajit Varki|author2= Daniel H.

It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while non-human primates are not religious, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of religion. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for [[symbolic communication]], a sense of social norms, realization of "[[self]]" and a concept of continuity.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, Barbara (2007).

The use of burial rituals is thought to be evidence of religious activity, and there is no other evidence that religion existed in human culture before humans reached [[behavioral modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Douglas, Simon Lamb, Guerrero Angeles. Gavira, and Peter Frances. [[Prehistoric Life (book)|Prehistoric Life: the Definitive Visual History of Life on Earth]]. New York, N.Y.: DK Pub., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Other evidences have revealed that ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]'' have made cave art, which would be a way of symbolic thinking close to the religious one &lt;ref&gt;D.

== Relevant prerequisites for human religion ==

===Increased brain size===
In this set of theories, the religious mind is one consequence of a brain that is large enough to formulate religious and philosophical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Religious ideas can theoretically be traced to the evolution of brains large enough to make possible the kind of abstract thought necessary to formulate religious and philosophical ideas|authorlink=Paul R. Ehrlich|last=Ehrlich|first=Paul|title=Human Natures: Genes, Cultures, and the Human Prospect |isbn=978-1-55963-779-4|page=214|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mHFsScY8ewMC&amp;pg=PA214|year=2000|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[human evolution]], the hominid brain tripled in size, peaking 500,000 years ago. Much of the brain's expansion took place in the [[neocortex]]. The cerebral neocortex is presumed to be responsible for the neuronal computations underlying complex phenomena such as perception, thought, language, attention, episodic memory and voluntary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/141/1/11|title=How unique is the human neocortex?|first1=Zoltán|last1=Molnár|first2=Alex|last2=Pollen|date=1 January 2014|journal=Development|volume=141|issue=1|pages=11–16|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=dev.biologists.org|doi=10.1242/dev.101279|pmid=24346696}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Dunbar's number|Dunbar's theory]], the relative [[Neocortex#Neocortex ratio|neocortex size]] of any species correlates with the level of social complexity of the particular species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Processing power limits social group size: computational evidence for the cognitive costs of sociality|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1765/20131151|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2013-08-22|issn = 0962-8452|pmc = 3712454|pmid = 23804623|page = 20131151|volume = 280|issue = 1765|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2013.1151|first = T.|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = R. I. M.|last2 = Dunbar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neocortex size correlates with a number of social variables that include social group size and complexity of mating behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bondedness and sociality|journal = Behaviour|date = 2010-06-01|issn = 1568-539X|pages = 775–803|volume = 147|issue = 7|doi = 10.1163/000579510X501151|first = Robin I. M.|last = Dunbar|first2 = Susanne|last2 = Shultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In chimpanzees the neocortex occupies 50% of the brain, whereas in modern humans it occupies 80% of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/88783/9-brainy-facts-about-neocortex|title=9 Brainy Facts About the Neocortex|author=|date=17 November 2016|website=mentalfloss.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robin Dunbar]] argues that the critical event in the evolution of the neocortex took place at the [[speciation]] of [[Archaic humans|archaic homo sapiens]] about 500,000 years ago. His study indicates that only after the speciation event is the neocortex large enough to process complex social phenomena such as language and religion. The study is based on a [[regression analysis]] of neocortex size plotted against a number of social behaviors of living and extinct hominids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |title=THE SOCIAL BRAIN: Mind, Language, and Society in Evolutionary Perspective |last=Dunbar |first=Robin |authorlink=Robin Dunbar |year=2003 |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3ADunbar+intitle%3ATHE+SOCIAL+BRAIN%3A+Mind%2C+Language%2C+and+Society+in+Evolutionary+Perspective&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2003&amp;as_yhi=2003&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911214723/http://anthropology.tamu.edu/faculty/alvard/ANTH689%20Fall%202005/Week%2011/Dunbar%202003.pdf |archivedate=September 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that religion may have grown out of evolutionary changes which favored larger brains as a means of cementing group coherence among savannah hunters, after that larger brain enabled reflection on the inevitability of personal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Jay Gould|author2=Paul McGarr|author3=Steven Peter Russell Rose|title=The richness of life: the essential Stephen Jay Gould|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC|year=2007|publisher=W.

===Tool use===
[[Lewis Wolpert]] argues that causal beliefs that emerged from tool use played a major role in the evolution of belief. The manufacture of complex tools requires creating a mental image of an object which does not exist naturally before actually making the artifact. Furthermore, one must understand how the tool would be used, that requires an understanding of [[causality]].&lt;ref name="wolpert"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0|quote=with regard to hafted tools, One would have to understand that the two pieces serve different purposes, and imagine how the tool could be used,| author=Lewis Wolpert| year=2006| publisher=Norton| location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the level of sophistication of stone tools is a useful indicator of causal beliefs.&lt;ref name="wolpert2"&gt;{{cite book| title=Six impossible things before breakfast, The evolutionary origins of belief|authorlink=Lewis Wolpert|last=Wolpert|first=Lewis|isbn=978-0-393-06449-0| quote= Belief in cause and effect has had the most enormous effect on human evolution, both physical and cultural.

However, recent studies of other primates indicate that causality may not be a uniquely human trait. For example, chimpanzees have been known to escape from pens closed with multiple latches, which was previously thought could only have been figured out by humans who understood causality.  Chimpanzees are also known to mourn the dead, and notice things that have only aesthetic value, like sunsets, both of which may be considered to be components of religion or spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/nature/can-an-ape-learn-to-be-human-2332047.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Steve | last=Connor | title=Can an ape learn to be human? | date=August 5, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between the comprehension of causality by humans and chimpanzees is one of degree. The degree of comprehension in an animal depends upon the size of the prefrontal cortex: the greater the size of the prefrontal cortex the deeper the comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3190564 | pmid=22013351 | doi=10.4103/0973-1229.33001 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Neurobiology of spirituality | year=2008 | journal=Mens Sana Monogr | pages=63–80 | last1 = Mohandas | first1 = E}} {{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of language===
{{See also|Origin of language|Myth and religion}}
Religion requires a system of symbolic communication, such as language, to be transmitted from one individual to another. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "human religious thought and moral sense clearly rest on a cognitive-linguistic base".&lt;ref name="lieberman"/&gt; From this premise science writer [[Nicholas Wade]] states: 
:"Like most behaviors that are found in societies throughout the world, religion must have been present in the ancestral human population before the dispersal from Africa 50,000 years ago. Although religious rituals usually involve dance and music, they are also very verbal, since the sacred truths have to be stated. If so, religion, at least in its modern form, cannot pre-date the emergence of language. It has been argued earlier that language attained its modern state shortly before the exodus from Africa. If religion had to await the evolution of modern, articulate language, then it too would have emerged shortly before 50,000 years ago."&lt;ref name="wade"&gt;*"[[Nicholas Wade|Wade, Nicholas]] – ''Before The Dawn, Discovering the lost history of our ancestors''.  Penguin Books, London, 2006.  p. 8 p. 165" {{ISBN|1-59420-079-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another view distinguishes individual religious belief from collective religious belief. While the former does not require prior development of language, the latter does. The individual human brain has to explain a phenomenon in order to comprehend and relate to it. This activity predates by far the emergence of language and may have caused it. The theory is, belief in the supernatural emerges from hypotheses arbitrarily assumed by individuals to explain natural phenomena that cannot be explained otherwise. The resulting need to share individual hypotheses with others leads eventually to collective religious belief. A socially accepted hypothesis becomes dogmatic backed by social sanction.

===Morality and group living===
{{Main|Evolution of morality|Morality#Evolution}}
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality. Although morality awareness may be a unique human trait, many [[social animal]]s, such as primates, dolphins and whales, have been known to exhibit pre-moral sentiments. According to [[Michael Shermer]], the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:
{{quote|attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

De Waal contends that all social animals have had to restrain or alter their behavior for group living to be worthwhile. Pre-moral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, a lack of group cohesion could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of a group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place. Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of fairness. In a 2008 study, de Waal and colleagues put two capuchin monkeys side by side and gave them a simple task to complete: Giving a rock to the experimenter. They were given cucumbers as a reward for executing the task, and the monkeys obliged. But if one of the monkeys was given grapes, something interesting happened:
After receiving the first piece of cucumber, the capuchin monkey gave the experimenter a rock as expected. But upon seeing that the other monkey got grapes, the capuchin monkey threw away the next piece of cucumber that was given to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/19/health/chimpanzee-fairness-morality/index.html|title=Morality: It's not just for humans - CNN|first=By Elizabeth Landau,|last=CNN|date=|website=cnn.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Chimpanzees live in [[Fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter-gatherer societies, recent Paleolithic [[hominid]]s lived in bands of a few hundred individuals. As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of social control, conflict resolution and group solidarity. According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. Humans also apply a degree of judgment and reason not otherwise seen in the animal kingdom.

Psychologist Matt J. Rossano argues that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include [[supernatural]] agents. By including ever-watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The adaptive value of religion would have enhanced group survival.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/science/20moral.html Nicholas Wade. ''Scientist Finds the Beginnings of Morality in Primate Behavior''. New York Times.

Rossano is referring here to collective religious belief and the social sanction that institutionalized morality. According to Rossano's teaching, individual religious belief is thus initially epistemological, not ethical, in nature.

==Evolutionary psychology of religion==
{{Main|Evolutionary psychology of religion}}
Cognitive scientists underlined that religions may be explained as a result of the brain architecture that expressed in early [[Homo#list of species|''Homo'' genus]], through the [[Timeline of the evolutionary history of life|history of life]]. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to [[natural selection]] and has selective advantage, or that religion is an evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf Evolutionary Religious Studies (ERS): A Beginner's Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204211/http://evolution.binghamton.edu/religion/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/BeginnersGuide.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Jay Gould]], for example, believed that religion was an [[exaptation]] or a [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.&lt;ref name="henig"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html|title=Darwin's God|date=4 March 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf Toward an evolutionary psychology of religion and personality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/religion%20seminar%20papers/Kirkpatrick_1999.pdf |date=2008-09-10 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pinker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm|title=The evolutionary psychology of religion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509063432/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/articles/media/2004_10_29_religion.htm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |author=[[Steven Pinker]]|date=29 October 2004|website=harvard.edu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm (agent detection), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion.|year= 2004|journal= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713–30; discussion 730–70|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= |citeseerx= 10.1.1.687.8586}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of collective religious belief identified the agents as deities that standardized the explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1–11|volume = 0|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tamás|last = Dávid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that religion is genetically "hardwired" into the human condition. One controversial proposal, the [[God gene]] hypothesis, states that some variants of a specific gene, the [[Vesicular monoamine transporter 2|VMAT2]] gene, predispose to spirituality.&lt;ref name="kluger2004"&gt;{{cite news

Another view is based on the concept of the [[triune brain]]: the reptilian brain, the limbic system, and the neocortex, proposed by [[Paul D. MacLean]]. Collective religious belief draws upon the emotions of love, fear, and gregariousness and is deeply embedded in the limbic system through socio-biological conditioning and social sanction. Individual religious belief utilizes reason based in the neocortex and often varies from collective religion. The limbic system is much older in evolutionary terms than the neocortex and is, therefore, stronger than it much in the same way as the reptilian is stronger than both the limbic system and the neocortex.

Yet another view is that the behavior of people who participate in a religion makes them feel better and this improves their fitness, so that there is a genetic selection in favor of people who are willing to believe in religion.  Specifically, rituals, beliefs, and the social contact typical of religious groups may serve to calm the mind (for example by reducing ambiguity and the uncertainty due to complexity) and allow it to function better when under stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Lionel Tiger and Michael McGuire | title = God's Brain | publisher = Prometheus Books | date = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-61614-164-6}} see pages 202-204&lt;/ref&gt; This would allow religion to be used as a powerful survival mechanism, particularly in facilitating the evolution of [[War#Motivations|hierarchies]] of [[Killer ape theory|warriors]], which if true, may be why many modern religions tend to promote [[fertility]] and [[family|kinship]].

Still another view, proposed by F.H. Previc, is that human religion was a product of an increase in dopaminergic functions in the human brain and a general intellectual expansion beginning around 80 kya.&lt;ref&gt;Previc, F.H. (2009).

==Prehistoric evidence of religion==
{{See also|Paleolithic religion|Prehistoric religion}}

The exact time when humans first became [[religion|religious]] remains unknown, however research in evolutionary archaeology shows credible evidence of religious-cum-ritualistic behaviour from around the [[Middle Paleolithic]] era (45-200 [[tya (unit)|thousand years ago]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/784|title=On the Origin of Religion|first=Elizabeth|last=Culotta|date=6 November 2009|journal=Science|volume=326|issue=5954|pages=784–787|accessdate=20 March 2018|via=science.sciencemag.org|doi=10.1126/science.326_784|pmid=19892955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paleolithic burials===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Skhul burial.jpg|thumb|right|400px|90,000 year old double burial of Homo sapiens at [[Qafzeh]] cave in Israel]] --&gt;
The earliest evidence of religious thought is based on the ritual treatment of the dead. Most animals display only a casual interest in the dead of their own species.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8209 Elephants may pay homage to the dead]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritual burial thus represents a significant change in human behavior. Ritual burials represent an awareness of life and death and a possible belief in the [[afterlife]]. [[Philip Lieberman]] states "burials with grave goods clearly signify religious practices and concern for the dead that transcends daily life."&lt;ref name="lieberman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA162 | title=Uniquely Human|isbn=978-0-674-92183-2| year=1991|last=Lieberman| authorlink=Philip Lieberman |publisher= Harvard University Press |location= Cambridge, Mass.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest evidence for treatment of the dead comes from [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] in Spain. At this location the bones of 30 individuals believed to be ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' have been found in a pit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7Q3nOqkJQwoC&amp;pg=PA158 |title=How Symbols, Language, and Intelligence Evolved from Early Primates to Modern Human|authorlink=Stanley Greenspan|last=Greenspan|first=Stanley|isbn=978-0-306-81449-5|year=2006|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=Cambridge, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Neanderthals]] are also contenders for the first [[Hominidae|hominids]] to intentionally bury the dead. They may have placed corpses into shallow graves along with stone tools and animal bones. The presence of these [[grave goods]] may indicate an emotional connection with the deceased and possibly a belief in the afterlife. Neanderthal burial sites include [[Shanidar]] in Iraq and [[Krapina]] in Croatia and [[Kebara Cave]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|title= The Neanderthal dead:exploring mortuary variability in Middle Palaeolithic Eurasia|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910084648/http://www.waspress.co.uk/journals/beforefarming/journal_20021/abstracts/papers/20021_04_s.pdf|archivedate= 2008-09-10|df= }}{{clarify|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="evolving_graves"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1200/is_24_160/ai_81827792/pg_1|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|author=|date=|website=findarticles.com|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC article on the Neanderthals|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21606040|quote=Neanderthals buried their dead, and one burial at [[Shanidar]] in Iraq was accompanied by grave goods in the form of plants. All of the plants are used in recent times for medicinal purposes, and it seems likely that the Neanderthals also used them in this way and buried them with their dead for the same reason. Grave goods are an archaeological marker of belief in an afterlife, so Neanderthals may well have had some form of religious belief.}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known burial of modern humans is from a cave in Israel located at [[Qafzeh]]. Human remains have been dated to 100,000 years ago. Human skeletons were found stained with [[red ochre]]. A variety of grave goods were found at the burial site. The mandible of a wild boar was found placed in the arms of one of the skeletons.&lt;ref name="lieberman2"&gt;. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tS2MULo5rYC&amp;pg=PA163 Uniquely Human page 163]&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Lieberman states:
:"Burial rituals incorporating grave goods may have been invented by the anatomically modern hominids who emigrated from Africa to the Middle East roughly 100,000 years ago".&lt;ref name="lieberman2"/&gt;

Matt Rossano suggests that the period between 80,000–60,000 years before present, following the retreat of humans from the Levant to Africa, was a crucial period in the evolution of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.selu.edu/Academics/Faculty/mrossano/recentpubs/Springer%20chapter.pdf|title=The African Interregnum: The "Where," "When," and "Why" of the Evolution of Religion|year=2009|last=Rossano|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-00128-4_9|first1=Matt|pages=127–141|series=The Frontiers Collection|isbn=978-3-642-00127-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of symbolism===
The use of [[Religious symbolism|symbolism in religion]] is a universal established phenomenon. Archeologist [[Steven Mithen]] contends that it is common for religious practices to involve the creation of images and symbols to represent supernatural beings and ideas. Because supernatural beings violate the principles of the natural world, there will always be difficulty in communicating and sharing supernatural concepts with others. This problem can be overcome by anchoring these supernatural beings in material form through representational art. When translated into material form, supernatural concepts become easier to communicate and understand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BRyMgrYx3EUC&amp;pg=PA147 Symbolism and the Supernatural]{{unreliable source?|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the association of art and religion, evidence of symbolism in the fossil record is indicative of a mind capable of religious thoughts. Art and symbolism demonstrates a capacity for abstract thought and imagination necessary to construct religious ideas. Wentzel van Huyssteen states that the translation of the non-visible through symbolism enabled early human ancestors to hold beliefs in abstract terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Uniqueness and Symbolization|url=http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|quote=This 'coding of the non-visible' through abstract, symbolic thought, enabled also our early human ancestors to argue and hold beliefs in abstract terms. In fact, the concept of God itself follows from the ability to abstract and conceive of 'person'|access-date=2008-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527011227/http://www.metanexus.net/magazine/tabid/68/id/10167/Default.aspx|archive-date=2009-05-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest evidence of symbolic behavior is associated with [[Middle Stone Age]] sites in Africa. From at least 100,000 years ago, there is evidence of the use of pigments such as [[red ochre]]. Pigments are of little practical use to hunter gatherers, thus evidence of their use is interpreted as symbolic or for ritual purposes. Among extant hunter gatherer populations around the world, red ochre is still used extensively for ritual purposes. It has been argued that it is universal among human cultures for the color red to represent blood, sex, life and death.&lt;ref name="rossano"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of red ochre as a proxy for symbolism is often criticized as being too indirect. Some scientists, such as [[Richard Klein (paleoanthropologist)|Richard Klein]] and [[Steven Mithen]], only recognize unambiguous forms of art as representative of abstract ideas. Upper paleolithic cave art provides some of the most unambiguous evidence of religious thought from the paleolithic. Cave paintings at [[Chauvet Cave|Chauvet]] depict creatures that are half human and half animal.

Organised religion traces its roots to the [[neolithic revolution]] that began 11,000 years ago in the [[Near East]] but may have occurred independently in several other locations around the world. The invention of agriculture transformed many human societies from a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle to a [[sedentism|sedentary lifestyle]]. The consequences of the neolithic revolution included a population explosion and an acceleration in the pace of technological development. The transition from foraging bands to states and empires precipitated more specialized and developed forms of religion that reflected the new social and political environment. While bands and small tribes possess supernatural beliefs, these beliefs do not serve to justify a central authority, justify transfer of wealth or maintain peace between unrelated individuals.
Organized religion emerged as a means of providing social and economic stability through the following ways:
*Justifying the central authority, which in turn possessed the right to collect taxes in return for providing social and security services.
*Bands and tribes consist of small number of related individuals. However, states and nations are composed of many thousands of unrelated individuals. [[Jared Diamond]] argues that organized religion served to provide a bond between unrelated individuals who would otherwise be more prone to enmity. In his book ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' he argues that the leading cause of death among hunter-gatherer societies is murder.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;

The states born out of the Neolithic revolution, such as those of Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, were [[theocracies]] with chiefs, kings and emperors playing dual roles of political and spiritual leaders.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt; Anthropologists have found that virtually all state societies and chiefdoms from around the world have been found to justify political power through divine authority. This suggests that political authority co-opts collective religious belief to bolster itself.&lt;ref name="shermer"/&gt;

===Invention of writing===
{{See also|History of writing}}
Following the neolithic revolution, the pace of technological development (cultural evolution) intensified due to the invention of writing 5000 years ago. Symbols that became words later on made effective communication of ideas possible. Printing invented only over a thousand years ago increased the speed of communication exponentially and became the main spring of cultural evolution.
Writing is thought to have been first invented in either Sumeria or Ancient Egypt and was initially used for accounting. Soon after, writing was used to record myth. The first religious texts mark the beginning of [[History of religion|religious history]]. The [[Pyramid Texts]] from ancient Egypt are one of the oldest known religious texts in the world, dating to between 2400–2300 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=SieAmOiyGQMC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9 | title=An Introduction to Ancient Egyptian Literature|first= Wallis|last= Budge|authorlink = E.

In pre-literate societies, religious ideas were based on an [[oral tradition]], the contents of which were articulated by shamans and remained limited to the collective memories of the society's inhabitants. With the advent of writing, information that was not easy to remember could easily be stored in sacred texts that were maintained by a select group (clergy). Humans could store and process large amounts of information with writing that otherwise would have been forgotten. Writing therefore enabled religions to develop coherent and comprehensive doctrinal systems that remained independent of time and place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=bnnnAwMfeV0C&amp;pg=PA160#PPA160,M1|chapter=Holy Book:The Invention of writing and religious cognition|title=Magic, Miracles, and Religion: A Scientist's Perspective | first=Ilkka|last=Pyysiäinen|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7591-0663-5|publisher=AltMira Press|location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Writing also brought a measure of objectivity to human knowledge. Formulation of thoughts in words and the requirement for validation made mutual exchange of ideas and the sifting of generally acceptable from not acceptable ideas possible. The generally acceptable ideas became objective knowledge reflecting the continuously evolving framework of human awareness of reality that [[Karl Popper]] calls 'verisimilitude' – a stage on the human journey to truth.&lt;ref&gt;''Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach'', 1972, Rev. ed., 1979, {{ISBN|0-19-875024-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flint''' is a hard, [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[cryptocrystalline]] form of the mineral [[quartz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Quartz.shtml General Quartz Information] – Webmineral.com (page contains [[java applet]]s depicting 3d molecular structure)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quartzpage.de/flint.html Flint and Chert] – quartzpage.de&lt;/ref&gt; categorized as a variety of [[chert]]. It occurs chiefly as [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]]s and masses in sedimentary rocks, such as [[chalk]]s and [[limestone]]s.&lt;ref name=Flints&gt;[http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_320_Flint.htm ''The Flints from Portsdown Hill''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113154308/http://www.bbm.me.uk/Portsdown/PH_320_Flint.htm |date=13 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaaca.com/Learning_Center/flintvs.htm Flint vs Chert Authentic Artefacts Collectors Assn.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040817115706/http://www.theaaca.com/Learning_Center/flintvs.htm |date=17 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the nodule, flint is usually dark grey, black, green, white or brown in colour, and often has a glassy or waxy appearance. A thin layer on the outside of the nodules is usually different in colour, typically white and rough in texture. From a [[petrology|petrological]] point of view, "flint" refers specifically to the form of [[chert]] which occurs in chalk or marly limestone. Similarly, "common chert" (sometimes referred to simply as "chert") occurs in limestone.

==Origin==
The exact mode of formation of flint is not yet clear, but it is thought that it occurs as a result of chemical changes in compressed sedimentary rock formations, during the process of [[diagenesis]]. One [[hypothesis]] is that a gelatinous material fills cavities in the sediment, such as holes bored by [[crustaceans]] or [[molluscs]] and that this becomes [[silicification|silicified]]. This hypothesis certainly explains the complex shapes of flint nodules that are found. The source of dissolved silica in the porous media could be the [[spicules of silicious sponges]].&lt;ref name=Flints/&gt; Certain types of flint, such as that from the south coast of England, contain trapped fossilised marine flora. Pieces of coral and vegetation have been found preserved like [[amber]] inside the flint. Thin slices of the stone often reveal this effect.

Puzzling giant flint formations known as [[paramoudra]] and flint circles are found around Europe but especially in Norfolk, England on the beaches at [[Beeston Regis#Beeston Hill (Beeston Bump)|Beeston Bump]] and [[West Runton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.500.100.030x2 Museums.norfolk.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012025938/http://www.museums.norfolk.gov.uk/default.asp?Document=400.500.100.030x2 |date=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flint sometimes occurs in large [[flint fields]] in [[Jurassic]] or [[Cretaceous]] beds, for example, in Europe.

==Uses==

===Tools or cutting edges===
Flint was used in the manufacture of tools during the [[Stone Age]] as it splits into thin, sharp splinters called flakes or blades (depending on the shape) when struck by another hard object (such as a [[hammerstone]] made of another material). This process is referred to as [[knapping]].

In Europe, some of the best toolmaking flint has come from Belgium (Obourg, flint mines of [[Spiennes]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minesdespiennes.org/en.html Neolithic Flint Mines of Petit-Spiennes ''Official web site'']&lt;/ref&gt; the coastal chalks of the [[English Channel]], the [[Paris Basin]], [[Thy (district)|Thy]] in [[Jutland]] (flint mine at Hov), the Sennonian deposits of [[Rügen]], [[Grimes Graves]] in England, the Upper Cretaceous chalk formation of [[Dobruja]] and the lower [[Danube]] (Balkan flint), the Cenomanian chalky marl formation of the [[Moldavian Plateau]] (Miorcani flint) and the [[Jurassic]] deposits of the [[Kraków]] area and [[Krzemionki]] in Poland, as well as of the [[Lägern]] ([[silex]]) in the [[Jura Mountains]] of Switzerland. Flint mining is attested since the [[Palaeolithic]], but became more common since the [[Neolithic]] (Michelsberg culture, [[Funnelbeaker culture]]).

===To ignite fire or gunpowder===
[[File:Firesteels assorted.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Assorted reproduction [[firesteel]]s typical of Roman to Medieval period]]

When struck against steel, a flint edge produces sparks. The hard flint edge shaves off a particle of the steel that exposes iron, which reacts with [[oxygen]] from the atmosphere and can ignite the proper [[tinder]].&lt;ref name="angelfire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/firefromsteel/ |title=Fire from Steel – Custom forged fire steels from Roman through Fur Trade time periods |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the wide availability of steel, rocks of [[pyrite]] (FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) would be used along with the flint, in a similar (but more time-consuming) way. These methods are popular in woodcraft, bushcraft, and amongst people practising traditional fire-starting skills.&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bush|first1=Darren|work=Manly Skills, Self-Reliance, Survival |title=Traditional Firestarting Part I: How to Make Fire with Flint and Steel|url=http://www.artofmanliness.com/2011/01/05/traditional-firestarting-part-i-how-to-make-fire-with-flint-and-steel/|publisher=Art of Manliness|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Survival Cache"&gt;{{cite web|title=Do you have 5 Ways to Make Fire?|url=http://survivalcache.com/survival-fire-starters/|website=Survival Cache|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flintlocks====
A later, major use of flint and steel was in the [[flintlock mechanism]], used primarily in [[flintlock]] firearms, but also used on dedicated fire-starting tools. A piece of flint held in the jaws of a spring-loaded hammer, when released by a trigger, strikes a [[hinged]] piece of steel ("[[frizzen]]") at an angle, creating a shower of sparks and exposing a charge of priming powder. The sparks ignite the priming powder and that flame, in turn, ignites the main charge, propelling the ball, bullet, or shot through the barrel. While the military use of the flintlock declined after the adoption of the [[percussion cap]] from the 1840s onward, flintlock rifles and shotguns remain in use amongst recreational shooters.

====Comparison with ferrocerium====
Flint and steel used to strike sparks were superseded by [[ferrocerium]] (sometimes referred to as "flint", although not true flint, "[[mischmetal]]", "hot spark", "metal match", or "fire steel"). This man-made material, when scraped with any hard, sharp edge, produces sparks that are much hotter than obtained with natural flint and steel, allowing use of a wider range of tinders. Because it can produce sparks when wet and can start fires when used correctly, ferrocerium is commonly included in [[survival kit]]s. Ferrocerium is used in many cigarette lighters, where it is referred to as "flint".

===As a building material===
Flint, knapped or unknapped, has been used from antiquity (for example at the Late Roman fort of [[Burgh Castle Roman Site|Burgh Castle]] in Norfolk) up to the present day as a material for building stone walls, using lime mortar, and often combined with other available stone or brick rubble. It was most common in parts of southern England, where no good building stone was available locally, and brick-making not widespread until the later Middle Ages. It is especially associated with [[East Anglia]], but also used in chalky areas stretching through [[Hampshire]], Sussex, [[Surrey]] and [[Kent]] to [[Somerset]]. Flint was used in the construction of many churches, houses, and other buildings, for example the large stronghold of [[Framlingham Castle]]. Many different decorative effects have been achieved by using different types of knapping or arrangement and combinations with stone ([[flushwork]]), especially in the 15th and early 16th centuries.

===Ceramics===
Flint pebbles are used as the media in ball mills to grind glazes and other raw materials for the ceramics industry.&lt;ref&gt;"Thoroughly Modern Milling" J.D. Sawyer. ''American Ceramic Society Bulletin 86, No.6.'' 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The pebbles are hand-selected based on colour; those having a tint of red, indicating high iron content, are discarded. The remaining blue-grey stones have a low content of [[chromophoric]] oxides and so are less deleterious to the colour of the ceramic composition after firing.&lt;ref&gt;"Ceramics: Physical And Chemical Fundamentals" H. Salmang &amp; M. Francis. ''Butterworths.'' 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until recently flint was also an important raw material in clay-based [[ceramic]] bodies produced in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;"Notes on the Manufacturer of Earthenware" E.A.Sandeman. ''The Technical Press Ltd.'' 1921 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Changes &amp; Developments of Non-plastic Raw Materials", Sugden, A. ''International Ceramics'' Issue 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for use flint pebbles, frequently sourced from the coasts of South-East England or Western France, were [[calcination|calcined]] to around 1,000&amp;nbsp;°C. This heat process both removed organic impurities and induced certain physical reactions, including converting some of the silica to [[cristobalite]]. After calcination the flint pebbles were milled to a fine particle size.&lt;ref&gt;"Whitewares: Production, Testing And Quality Control." W.Ryan &amp; C.Radford. ''Pergamon Press.'' 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Use Of Flint In Ceramics'', Industrial Ceramics  No.885, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Silica". Oelef Heckroodt,''Ceramic Review'' No. 254, March/April 2012, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Calcination Of Flint. Part 2: Continuous Process In A Vertical-Shaft Kiln." M. Manackerman &amp; E.Davies. Research Paper 191. British Ceramic Research Association, 1952.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of flint has now been superseded by [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;"Changes &amp; Developments of Non-plastic Raw Materials", A.Sugden. ''International Ceramics'' Issue 2, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the historical use of flint, the word "flint" is used by some potters, especially in the US, to refer to siliceous materials that are not flint.&lt;ref&gt;''Ceramic Glazes.'' 3rd edition. Parmelee C. W. The Maple Press Company. 1973; ''Dictionary of Ceramics''. 3rd edition. A.Dodd. ''The Institute of Materials.'' 1994; ''The Potter's Dictionary of Materials and Techniques'', F.Hamer and J.Hamer, London, A &amp; C Black, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Flint And Silica. '' C.M.

===Jewellery===
Flint bracelets were known in Ancient Egypt, and several examples have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graves-Brown|first=Carolyn|title=AB29 Flint bracelet|url=http://www.egypt.swansea.ac.uk/index.php/collection/297-ab29.htm|publisher=Swansea University|accessdate=13 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029080451/http://www.egypt.swansea.ac.uk/index.php/collection/297-ab29.htm|archivedate=29 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Striped flint]] is today in use as a gemstone as well.

===Fragmentation===
While flint may be used in fire-lighting, it should not be exposed to excessive heat, as from a fire. Due to uneven expansion, flint may fracture, sometimes violently, during heating. This tendency to fracture is enhanced by the fact that most samples of flint contain impurities that may expand to a greater or lesser degree than the surrounding stone. This tendency to fracture is similar, but not identical, to the tendency of [[Thermal fracturing in glass|glass to shatter]] when exposed to heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/scoutnotebook/fires/cooking.html |title=Building a cooking fire |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525115954/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/scoutnotebook/fires/cooking.html |archive-date=May 25, 2009 |work=Scout Notebook |access-date=January 30, 2018 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat fragmentation, flint/chert may be heat-treated, being slowly brought up to a temperature of {{convert|150|to|260|C|F|sigfig=2}} for 24 hours, then slowly cooled to room temperature. This makes the material more homogeneous and thus more "[[wikt:knap|knappable]]" and produces tools with a cleaner, sharper cutting edge.

'''Ian Karkull''' is a fictional [[supervillain]] in some comic-book titles published by [[DC Comics]]. He first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #69 (August 1941) as a foe of the sorcerer [[Doctor Fate]]. He later became a recurring foe of the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the [[Justice Society of America]], beginning in ''All-Star Squadron Annual'' #3.

==Publication history==
Ian Karkull first appeared in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #69 and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Howard Sherman (comics)|Howard Sherman]].

==Fictional character biography==
In the late 1930s, Ian Karkull was a scientist and archaeologist working in the Sahara Desert with partner Everett Dahlen. The two sought the [[lost city]] of Ragnor, a mystic city rumored to possess great wealth and a knowledge of dark powers. Finding it, the two came upon a ruby of incredible size and value and immediately began to quarrel over it. Dahlen stunned Karkull with a savage blow and left him to die in the hidden city. Abandoned in the lost city for days, Karkull learned an undisclosed array of secrets and magics that he carried with him back to America when he was finally rescued by nomadic Arabs. 

Arriving in New York, Karkull built a machine based on what he had learned. With it, he could turn men into intangible shadows. His initial goals were twofold: to avenge himself on Everett Dahlen and build a cache of wealth to launch the next phase of his criminal career. His first goal was easily met, slaying Dahlen with the aide of a shadowy assassin. Karkull's plans were complicated however, when the murder attracted the attention of [[Doctor Fate]]. Fate pursued the shadow-men on their next outing at a local bank and confronted Karkull in his lair. To elude the mage, Karkull transformed himself into a shadow. The criminal had outsmarted himself however, since Dr. Fate then promptly destroyed the machine that would return him to human form. After lecturing Karkull on the penalties of an evil life, Fate left the shadow to his own devices.&lt;ref&gt;''More Fun Comics'' #69&lt;/ref&gt;

For an undetermined period, Karkull wandered the Earth, plotting his revenge. At some point he was contacted by the astral form of the arch-mage [[Wotan (comics)|Wotan]], another foe of Dr. Fate. Wotan educated Karkull on the magicks needed to free his body from the deep tomb in which Fate had trapped him. The two then relocated to a hidden city in the Arctic to gather their strength. Their plans came to the attention of Dr. Fate when they destroyed an expedition of [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] scientists who came too close to their lair. Tracking the villains across the frozen wasteland, Fate confronted his two foes only to be captured. His release was accomplished via a surprise assault by the Navy, led by the sole survivor of the doomed expedition. The men were no match for the powerful weaponry employed by Karkull and Wotan but distracted them long enough for the mage to escape. After ensuring the safety of the sailors, Fate turned his full wrath on the villains, reflecting their own device against them. Seeing them apparently destroyed, Fate left the Arctic city to burn to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;''More Fun Comics'' #70&lt;/ref&gt;

Karkull was last seen manipulating [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], to gain access to, and subsequently rule the shadow lands; the same story revealed that, during a World War II era confrontation between Karkull and the rest of the Justice Society,&lt;ref&gt;"All-Star Squadron" Annual #3&lt;/ref&gt; exposure to Karkull's shadow energies slowed down the aging processes of much of the JSA, accounting for their good physical health despite their chronological ages. Karkull had apparently been corrupting Obsidian for months, in an effort to get revenge on his enemies in the [[Justice Society]]. Obsidian then killed Karkull, using his energies to grow to massive size to combat [[Alan Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;''JSA'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* In the ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode ''The Hand of Fate'', it features a shadowy being called only '''Karkull''' (voiced by [[Ted Levine]]) as a powerful [[Cthulhu]]-like being accidentally freed when an unnamed petty thief robs a mystical artifact from a museum. Karkull possesses the body of the thief and begins transforming people into his demon slaves, eventually taking over and transforming the [[Daily Planet]] building into a magical portal into the underworld. When Karkull proved too much for Superman, he ends up gaining the assistance of [[Doctor Fate]] to fight him. Karkull is eventually defeated by Superman and Doctor Fate, driven from the petty thief's body and sealed into a clay tablet just as the Metropolis Police Department's Special Crimes Unit arrive.

'''Ian Saville''' (born 30 April 1953) is an [[England|English]] [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] whose act incorporates [[ventriloquism]] and [[comedy]]. His performance is distinctive primarily for the fact that it is geared towards a comic form of [[socialist]] [[propaganda]]. He says of his act, "whereas [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] is content with little tricks like making the [[Statue of Liberty]] disappear, I aim at the much more ambitious goal of making International Capitalism and exploitation disappear" although he has not yet succeeded.&lt;ref name=mfs&gt;Ian Saville - Short Biography, [http://www.redmagic.co.uk/ Magic For Socialism], Retrieved 2007-6-18&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Saville was born in the East End of [[London]], [[England]] to [[Jewish]]&lt;ref name=mfs/&gt; parents. He began conjuring at the age of 11.  He reached the semi-finals of the Butlins national talent contest.  Becoming interested in theatre, he studied Drama at the [[University of Exeter]]. He toured with the political theatre group Broadside, as well as working in community theatre.

In 1979, he started developing his "socialist magic" act.&lt;ref name=mfs/&gt;  He cites [[Bertolt Brecht]] as a major influence, and one of his shows features a ventriloquists' dummy of Brecht.  He has collaborated with left-wing folk singer [[Leon Rosselson]] in two shows.

Two of his standard "tricks" are "The Class Struggle Rope Trick" and "The vanish of the military-industrial complex".&lt;ref name=mfs/&gt;

In 1990, he received a PhD from [[City University, London]] for his thesis on political theatre in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s. He currently teaches part-time on theatre courses at [[Middlesex University]].&lt;ref name=mfs/&gt;

In August 2013, he visited the Edinburgh Festival Fringe with a free show about money - the [http://www.laughinghorsecomedy.co.uk/edinburgh/show.asp?ShowID=1786 Free Money Magic Show].

==Politics==
Saville's Edinburgh show in 2016 was [http://www.redmagic.co.uk Revolution in the Magic Square], an allegory on the rise of Jeremy Corbyn.

Ideophones are found in many of the world's [[language]]s, though they are claimed to be relatively uncommon in Western languages.&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In many languages, they are a major lexical class of the same order of magnitude as nouns and verbs:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; dictionaries of languages like Japanese, Korean, and Zulu list thousands of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.lib.kobe-u.ac.jp/handle_gakui/D1004724|title=A Grammar of Sound-Symbolic Words in Japanese: Theoretical Approaches to Iconic and Lexical Properties of Japanese Mimetics|last=Akita|first=Kimi|publisher=Kobe University|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word class of ideophones is sometimes called ''phonosemantic'' to indicate that it is not a grammatical word class in the traditional sense of the word (like '[[verb]]' or '[[noun]]'), but rather a lexical class based on the special relation between form and meaning exhibited by ideophones. In the discipline of [[linguistics]], ideophones have long been overlooked or treated as mysterious words,&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz and Kilian-Hatz 2001:2&lt;/ref&gt; though a recent surge of interest in [[sound symbolism]], [[iconicity]] and linguistic diversity has brought them renewed attention.&lt;ref&gt;Imai &amp; Kita 2014, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

An often-cited definition of the notion of ideophone is the following by [[Clement Martyn Doke]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Doke 1935 as cited in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|A vivid representation of an idea in sound. A word, often onomatopoeic, which describes a predicate, qualificative or adverb in respect to manner, color, sound, smell, action, state or intensity.}}

Ideophones evoke sensory events. A well known instance of ideophones are [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] words – words that imitate the sound (of the event) they refer to. Some ideophones may be derived from onomatopoeic notions. A case in point is the English ideophonic verb ''to tinkle'', which imitates a brief metallic sound. In many languages, however, ideophones go far beyond onomatopoeia in imitating many things beyond sound.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For instance, in [[Gbaya languages|Gbaya]],  ''kpuk '''a rap on the door' may be onomatopoeic, but other ideophones depict motion and visual scenes: ''loɓoto-loɓoto'' 'large animals plodding through mud', ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion', ''pɛɗɛŋ-pɛɗɛŋ'' 'razor sharp'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ideophones are often characterized as [[Iconicity|iconic]] or [[Sound symbolism|sound-symbolic]] words, meaning that there can be a resemblance between their form and their meaning. For instance, in West-African languages, voiced consonants and low tone in ideophones are often connected to large and heavy meanings, whereas voiceless consonants and high tones tend to relate to small and light things.&lt;ref&gt;Westermann 1927&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reduplication]] figures quite prominently in ideophones, often conveying a sense of repetition or plurality present in the evoked event.&lt;ref&gt;Watson in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The iconicity of ideophones is shown by the fact that people can guess the meanings of ideophones from various languages at a level above chance.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki et al. 2007, Dingemanse et al. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; However, not everything about the form of ideophones directly relates to their meaning; as conventionalized words, they contain arbitrary, language-specific phonemes just like other parts of the vocabulary.

===Grammar===
The grammatical function of ideophones varies by language. In some languages (e.g. [[Welayta language|Welayta]], [[Yir-Yoront language|Yir-Yiront]], [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Korean language|Korean]]), they form a separate word class, while in others, they occur across a number of different word classes (e.g. [[Mundang]], [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]]).&lt;ref&gt;Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this diversity, ideophones show a number of robust regularities across languages. One is that they are often marked in the same way as quoted speech and demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Samarin|first=William J.|year=1971|title=Survey of Bantu ideophones|url=|journal=African Language Studies|volume=12|pages=130–168|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ideophones can form a complete utterance on their own, as in English "ta-da!" or Japanese {{Nihongo||ジャーン|jaan|ta-da}}.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Diffloth 1972&lt;/ref&gt; However, ideophones also often occur within utterances, depicting a scene described by other elements of the utterance, as in Japanese ''Taro wa &lt;u&gt;sutasuta to&lt;/u&gt; haya-aruki o si-ta'' 'Taro walked hurriedly' (literally 'Taro did haste-walk ''sutasuta''&lt;nowiki/&gt;').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kita|first=Sotaro|year=1997|title=Two-dimensional semantic analysis of Japanese mimetics|url=|journal=Linguistics|volume=35|pages=379–415|via=|doi=10.1515/ling.1997.35.2.379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether they occur as part of other utterances or on their own, ideophones tend show a high degree of grammatical independence. They often occur at the edge of the utterance; they may be syntactically optional; and they tend to carry little inflectional or derivational morphology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other signs of their relative independence are that they are often produced with higher intonation and expressive lengthening, and set off from the rest of the utterance by a brief pause.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kunene in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their relative independence, ideophones are sometimes compared to [[interjection]]s: direct expressions of emotions like "Wow!" or "Ouch!". However, they are distinct in a number of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ameka|first=Felix K.|year=1992|title=Interjections: the universal yet neglected part of speech|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=18|pages=101–118|via=|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(92)90048-g}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas interjections usually occur on their own, ideophones more often modify other utterances, providing an illustration of a scene the utterance is about. Also, ideophones are more like illustrations ''of'' events than responses ''to'' events. An ideophone like Gbaya ''kiláŋ-kiláŋ'' 'in a zigzagging motion' displays a certain resemblance to the event (for instance, its irregular vowels and tones depicting the irregularity of the motion). An interjection like 'Wow!' indexes someone's response to an event but does not resemble that event itself.

===Registers===
Languages may differ in the context in which ideophones are used. In some languages, ideophones are primarily used in spoken language (e.g. [[narrative]] contexts) and are rarely encountered in written language.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Noss in Voeltz &amp; Kilian-Hatz 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages (e.g. [[Ewe language|Ewe]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]]), ideophones can be freely used in all [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]]. In general, however, ideophones tend to occur more extensively in spoken language because of their expressive or dramaturgic function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Examples==

===[[English language|English]]===

* ''boing''; the sound of a spring being released
* ''boom''; the sound of an explosion
* ''bang''; the sound of a gunshot
* ''[[bling-bling]]''; glitter, sparkle
* ''pitter-patter''; the sound of rain drops
* ''swish''; the sound of swift movement
* ''splish-splash''; the sound of water splashing
* ''ta-daa!''; the sound of a [[fanfare]]
* ''thud''; the sound of something heavy falling on the ground
* ''tick-tock''; the sound of time passing
* ''twinkle''; the glow of something sparkling or shiny

===[[Japanese language|Japanese]]===
{{main article|Japanese sound symbolism}}
The Japanese language has thousands of ideophones, often called ''mimetics''. The constructions are quite metrical 2-2, or 3-3, where [[Mora (linguistics)|morae]] play a role in the symmetry. The first consonant of the second item of the reduplication [[rendaku|may become voiced]] if phonological conditions allow. Japanese ideophones are used extensively in daily conversations as well as in the written language.

* ''doki doki'' ({{lang|ja|ドキドキ}}) &amp;mdash; heartbeat: excitement
* ''kira kira'' ({{lang|ja|キラキラ}}) &amp;mdash; glitter
* ''shiin'' ({{lang|ja|シーン}}) &amp;mdash; silence
* ''niko niko'' ({{lang|ja|ニコニコ}}) &amp;mdash; smile

'''Inclusive Democracy''' ('''ID''') is a project that aims for [[direct democracy]]; [[economic democracy]] in a [[stateless society|stateless]], moneyless and marketless economy; [[Workers' self-management|self-management]] (democracy in the social realm); and [[ecological democracy]].

The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy—as distinguished from the political project on which the ID movement is based—emerged from the work of [[Greece|Greek-born]] [[Political philosophy|political philosopher]], [[Socialist economics#Economic models and systems|economist]], [[activist]] and former [[academic]] [[Takis Fotopoulos]], in the book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'', and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal ''[[Democracy &amp; Nature]]'' and its successor ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', an [[electronic journal]] published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.altpress.org/mod/apc_directory/index.php?function=display&amp;id=169 "International Journal of Inclusive Democracy"] The Alternative Press Center&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the theoretical project of ID is a project emerging in Political Philosophy about social change (see e.g. [[Marxism]], [[Social ecology (theory)|Social Ecology project]], the [[Autonomy|autonomy project]], the Inclusive Democracy project, etc.). On the other hand, the political project of ID (as any political project for social emancipation) is a project emerging in the History of social struggle (e.g. along [[Socialism|socialist movement]], [[Autonomism|autonomist movement]], [[Direct democracy|classical (direct) democracy movement]], etc.).

According to [[Arran Gare]],  ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy'' "offers a powerful new interpretation of the history and destructive dynamics of the market and provides an inspiring new vision of the future in place of both [[neo-liberalism]] and existing forms of [[State socialism|socialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Arran Gare, [http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin:989/SOURCE1 "Beyond Social Democracy? Takis Fotopoulos' Vision of an Inclusive Democracy as a New Liberatory Project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706115814/http://researchbank.swinburne.edu.au/vital/access/services/Download/swin%3A989/SOURCE1 |date=2011-07-06 }} ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003), pp. 345–58&lt;/ref&gt; David Freeman argues that Fotopoulos' approach in that book "is not openly [[anarchism]], yet anarchism seems the formal category within which he works, given his commitment to direct democracy, municipalism and abolition of state, money and market economy".&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, David, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol1/vol1_no3_freeman.htm "Inclusive democracy and its prospects"] review of book ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy: The Crisis of the Growth Economy and the Need For a New Liberatory Project'', published in ''Thesis Eleven'' no. 69 (Sage Publications, May 2002), pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conception of Inclusive Democracy ==
Fotopoulos describes Inclusive Democracy as "a new conception of democracy, which, using as a starting point the classical definition of it, expresses democracy in terms of direct political democracy, economic democracy (beyond the confines of the market economy and state planning), as well as democracy in the social realm and [[ecological]] democracy. In short, inclusive democracy is a form of social organisation which re-integrates society with economy, polity and nature. The concept of inclusive democracy is derived from a synthesis of two major historical traditions, the [[Athenian democracy|classical democratic]] and the [[socialist]], although it also encompasses radical green, [[feminist]], and [[liberation movement]]s in the South".&lt;ref&gt;"Inclusive Democracy" entry in ''Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy'', ed. by R.J. Barry Jones, 2001, pp. 732–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

The starting point of the ID project is that the world, at the beginning of the new millennium, faces a [[multi-dimensional crisis]] (economic, ecological, social, cultural and political), which is shown to be caused by the concentration of power in the hands of various [[elites]]. This is interpreted to be the outcome of the establishment, in the last few centuries, of the system of [[market economy]] (in the [[Karl Polanyi|Polanyian]] sense),&lt;ref&gt;Karl Polanyi, ''The Great Transformation, the Political and Economic Origins of Our Time,'' (Beacon Press, 1944/1957), pp. 43–44, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Representative democracy]], and the related forms of [[hierarchical structure]]. Therefore, an inclusive democracy is seen not simply as a [[utopia]], but perhaps as the only way out of the crisis, based on the equal distribution of power at all levels.

In this conception of democracy, the public realm includes not just the political realm, as is usual the practice in the [[Classical republicanism|republican]] or [[Direct democracy|democratic project]] ([[Hannah Arendt]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Murray Bookchin]] et al.),&lt;ref&gt;Ingerid S. Straume, [https://www.academia.edu/994824/A_Common_World_Arendt_Castoriadis_and_Political_Creation "A Common World? Arendt, Castoriadis and Political Creation,"] ''European Journal of Social Theory,'' Vol. 15, No. 3 (August 2012), pp. 367–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, ''Urbanization without Cities'' (Monteal: Black Rose, 1992), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; but also the economic, 'social' and ecological realms. The political realm is the sphere of political decision-making, the area in which political power is exercised. The economic realm is the sphere of economic decision-making, the area in which economic power is exercised with respect to the broad economic choices that any [[scarcity]] society has to make. The social realm is the sphere of decision-making in the workplace, the education place and any other economic or cultural institution which is a constituent element of a democratic society. The public realm could be extended to include the "ecological realm", which may be defined as the sphere of the relations between society and nature. Therefore, the public realm, in contrast to the private realm, includes any area of human activity in which decisions can be made collectively and democratically.

According to these four realms, we may distinguish between four main constituent elements of an inclusive democracy: the political, the economic, 'democracy in the social realm' and the ecological. The first three elements form the institutional framework, which aims at the equal distribution of political, economic and social power respectively. In this sense, these elements define a system, which aims at the effective elimination of the domination of human being over human being. Similarly, ecological democracy is defined as the institutional framework, which aims to eliminate any human attempt to dominate the natural world, in other words, the system, which aims to reintegrate humans and nature.

== Institutional framework ==

===Political or direct democracy===
The necessary condition for the establishment of a political democracy involves the creation of appropriate institutions, which secure an equal distribution of political power among all citizens. All political decisions (including those relating to the formation and execution of laws) are taken by the citizen body collectively and without representation.The citizen body of a particular geographical area consists of all residents beyond a certain age of maturity and irrespective of their gender, race, ethnic or cultural identity. The age of maturity is to be defined by the citizen body itself.

The sufficient condition for the reproduction of a political democracy refers to the citizens' level of democratic consciousness and, as David Gabbard &amp; Karen Appleton point out, "the responsibility of cultivating the democratic consciousness requisite to this conception of citizenship falls to [[paideia]]"&lt;ref&gt;David Gabbard &amp; Karen Appleton, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol2/vol2_no1_gabbard_appleton.htm "The Democratic Paideia Project: Beginnings of an Emancipatory Paideia for Today"], ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy,'' Vol. 2, No. 1 (September 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; which involves not simply education but character development and a well-rounded knowledge and skills, i.e. the education of the individual as citizen, which alone can give substantive content to the public space. This is particularly so because democracy can only be grounded on the conscious choice of citizens for individual and collective autonomy. Thus it cannot be the outcome of any social, economic or natural "laws" or tendencies dialectically leading to it, let alone any divine or mystical dogmas and preconceptions. In this sense, neither representative democracy nor soviet democracy meet the conditions for political democracy, and are simply forms of political oligarchy, where political power is concentrated in the hands of various elites, i.e. professional politicians, and party bureaucrats respectively.

The basic unit of decision making in an inclusive democracy is the demotic assembly, i.e. the assembly of demos, the citizen body in a given geographical area which may encompass a town and the surrounding villages, or even neighbourhoods of large cities. This is very close to the concept of the 'urban village' proposed today by supporters of de-growth economics.&lt;ref&gt;Clement Homs, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol3/vol3_no1_Homs_urban_villages.htm "Localism and the city: the example of "urban villages"], ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy,'' Vol. 3, No. 1 (January 2007). Retrieved 21 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from local decisions, many important decisions are to be made at the regional or confederal level. This is why, as [[Serge Latouche]] observes, the aim of Inclusive Democracy "presupposes a confederation of demoi" made up of small, homogenous units of around 30,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;Serge Latouche, [http://mondediplo.com/2006/01/13degrowth?var_recherche=Serge+Latouche "How do we learn to want less? The globe downshifted"], ''Le Monde diplomatique'' (January 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an inclusive democracy today can only take the form of a confederal democracy that is based on a network of administrative councils whose members or delegates are elected from popular face-to-face democratic assemblies in the various demoi. Thus, their role is purely administrative and practical, not one of policy-making like that of representatives in representative democracy.

The citizen body is advised by experts but it is the citizen body which functions as the ultimate decision-taker . Authority can be delegated to a segment of the citizen body to carry out specific duties, for example to serve as members of popular courts, or of regional and confederal councils. Such delegation is made, in principle,  by lot, on a rotation basis, and is always recallable by the citizen body. Delegates to regional and confederal bodies should have specific mandates.

Finally, political or direct democracy implies a very different conception of citizenship than the usual liberal and socialist conceptions. In this conception, political activity is not a means to an end, but an end in itself so that one does not engage in political action simply to promote one's welfare but to realize the principles intrinsic to political life, such as freedom, equality and solidarity. This, in contrast to the liberal and social-democratic conceptions which adopt an 'instrumentalist' view of citizenship, i.e. a view which implies that citizenship entitles citizens with certain rights that they can exercise as means to the end of individual welfare.

===Economic democracy and the role of an artificial market===
The ID project introduced a very different conception from the usual one of [[economic democracy]]. According to the ID project, economic democracy is the authority of demos (community) in the economic sphere—which requires equal distribution of economic power. Therefore, all 'macro' economic decisions, namely, decisions concerning the running of the economy as a whole (overall level of production, consumption and investment, amounts of work and leisure implied, technologies to be used, etc.) are made by the citizen body collectively and without representation. However, "micro" economic decisions at the workplace or the household levels are made by the individual production or consumption unit through a proposed system of [[voucher]]s.

As with the case of direct democracy, economic democracy today is only feasible at the level of the confederated demoi. It involves the ownership and control of the means of production by the [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]. This is radically different from the two main forms of concentration of economic power : capitalist and 'socialist' [[Economic growth|growth]] economy. It is also different from the various types of collectivist capitalism, such as [[workers' control]] and milder versions suggested by post-Keynesian social democrats. The demos, therefore, becomes the authentic unit of economic life.

For economic democracy to be feasible, three preconditions must be satisfied: Demotic [[self-sufficiency|self-reliance]], demotic ownership of the means of production, and confederal allocation of resources.

*Demotic self-reliance is meant in terms of radical [[decentralisation]] and collective [[self-sufficiency]], in the sense of relying on the demos' resources rather than in the sense of  [[autarky]].
*Demotic ownership of productive resources is a kind of ownership which leads to the politicisation of the economy, the real synthesis of economy and polity. This is so because economic decision making is carried out by the entire community, through the demotic assemblies, where people make the fundamental macro-economic decisions which affect the whole community, as citizens, rather than as vocationally oriented groups (e.g. workers, as e.g. in [[Parecon]]).&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol9/takis_parecon.htm "Inclusive Democracy and Participatory Economics"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808143931/http://www.democracynature.org/dn/vol9/takis_parecon.htm |date=2011-08-08 }}, ''Democracy &amp; Nature'', Vol. 9, No. 3 (November 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, workers, apart from participating in the demotic decisions about the overall planning targets, would also participate (in the above broad sense of vocationally oriented groups) in their respective workplace assemblies, in a process of modifying/implementing the Democratic Plan and in running their own workplace.
*Confederal allocation of resources is required because, although self-reliance allows many decisions to be made at the community level, much remains to be decided at the regional/national/supra-national level. However, it is delegates (rather than representatives) with specific mandates from the demotic assemblies who are involved in a confederal demotic planning process which, in combination with the proposed system of vouchers, effects the allocation of resources in a confederal inclusive democracy.

A model of economic democracy, as an integral part of an inclusive democracy, is described in ''Towards An Inclusive Democracy'' (ch 6), the first book-length description of inclusive democracy. The main characteristic of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like Parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, money-less and market-less economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of:

*(a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens—which requires that basic macro-economic decisions have to be made democratically, and
*(b) securing freedom of choice—which requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume etc.).

Therefore, the system consists of two basic elements: 
*(1) democratic planning, which involves a feedback process between workplace assemblies, demotic assemblies and the confederal assembly, and
*(2) an [[artificial market]] using personal vouchers, which ensures [[freedom of choice]] but avoids the adverse effects of real markets. Although some have called this system "a form of money based on the [[labour theory of value]]",&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'' (Routledge, 1996), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not a money model since vouchers cannot be used as a general medium of exchange and store of wealth.

Another distinguishing feature of ID is its distinction between basic and non-basic needs. Remuneration is according to need for basic needs, and according to effort for non-basic needs. ID is based on the principle that meeting basic needs is a fundamental human right which is guaranteed to all who are in a physical condition to offer a minimal amount of work. By contrast,Fotopoulos argues, Parecon follows the  [[socialdemocratic]] rather than the [[anarcho-communist]] tradition and instead of proposing satisfaction according to need (as the ID project does) declares, first, that particular consumption needs such as health care or public parks will be free to all and, second, that as regards special needs, people will be able to make particular requests for need based consumption to be addressed case by case by others in the economy.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807014331/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism]'', [[Verso Books]], 2003, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, [[Michael Albert]] explicitly states that what he calls 'norm four', i.e. 'remuneration according to each person's need' should be applied only in exceptional cases of basic needs and not to all needs defined as such by the citizens'  assemblies, as the Inclusive Democracy project declares. Thus, as Albert stresses: "beyond economic justice, we have our compassion, to be applied via norm four where appropriate such as in cases of illness, catastrophe, incapacity and so on".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070807014331/http://www.zmag.org/books/pareconv/parefinal.htm Parecon: Life After Capitalism]'', Verso Books, 2003, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Artificial market ====
Proposed within Inclusive Democracy as a solution to the problem of maintaining freedom of choice for the consumer within a marketless and moneyless economy, an artificial market operates in much the same way as traditional markets, but uses [[labour voucher]]s or personal credit in place of traditional money. Because of the use of a labour voucher system in consumption of goods and services, an economy using an artificial market would have no actual flow of money and thus the only kind of market that could exist would be a market for commercial goods and services, eliminating capital markets and labour markets.

According to Takis Fotopoulos, an artificial market "secures real freedom of choice, without incurring the adverse effects associated with real markets".&lt;ref name="inclusivedemocracy.org"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project''], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of an artificial market was first proposed by the [[anarchist]] theorists [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]] with their respective systems of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]] and [[collectivist anarchism]]. who suggested replacing traditional currency with a system of "labour-cheques" while still retaining basic market relations for goods and services.

The artificial market however is rarely advocated as the only element for the allocation of goods and services by its proponents, as most also support a form of directly democratic planning for non-commercial goods and vital resources, and in some cases regulation of the artificial market through planning also. In the ID's system of allocation of resources, "the artificial market complements the envisaged direct democratic planning mechanism in the allocation of all goods and services on the basis of the crucial distinction introduced in this model between basic and nonbasic goods and services".&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol6/vol6_no2_takis_beyond_market_economy_and_statist_planning.htm “Beyond the Market Economy and Statist Planning: Towards Democratic Planning as part of a Confederal Inclusive Democracy,”] The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, Vol. 6, No. 2/3 (Spring/Summer 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Fotopoulos, "the allocation of economic resources is made first, on the basis of the citizens' collective decisions, as expressed through the community and confederal plans, and second, on the basis of the citizens' individual choices, as expressed through a voucher system".&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed system of the artificial market aims at: 
*(A) meeting the basic needs of all citizens, and
*(B) securing freedom of choice in a marketless, moneyless and stateless 'scarcity–society' which has not yet achieved universal autarky (self-sufficiency).&lt;ref name="inclusivedemocracy.org"/&gt;

The former requires that basic macro–economic decisions have to be taken democratically, whereas the latter requires the individual to take important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume, etc.). Both the macro–economic decisions and the individual citizens' decisions are envisaged as being implemented through a combination of democratic planning and an artificial market. But, while in the 'macro' decisions the emphasis will be on planning, the opposite will be true as regards the individual decisions, where the emphasis will be on the artificial market.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.democracynature.org/vol3/fotopoulos_outline.htm Outline of an Economic Model for an Inclusive Democracy], [[Democracy &amp; Nature]], Vol.3, No.3, (1997), pp. 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most artificial market proponents reject the traditional [[socialist]] adoption of the [[labour theory of value]] as they believe it cannot be used as the basis for allocating scarce resources. The reason given is that even if the labour theory of value can give a (partial) indication of availability of resources, it certainly cannot be used as a means to express consumers' preferences. Thus they feel that the labour theory of value cannot serve as the basis for an allocative system that aims at both meeting needs and, at the same time, securing consumer sovereignty and freedom of choice. Instead, the model proposed here is, in fact, a system of rationing, which is based on the revealed consumers' preferences on the one hand, and resource availability on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/fotopoulos/english/brbooks/brtid/IDBook.pdf ''Towards an Inclusive Democracy: the crisis of the growth economy and the need for a new liberatory project''], (London &amp; NY: Cassell, 1997), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of [[Participism]] and Parecon in particular reject markets in all forms in favour of democratic participatory planning. While Parecon also uses [[Labour voucher|personal credit]] in place of money, prices are set according to the direct requests of consumers in democratic "consumer councils" whose demands are relayed to economic [[Facilitation board (economics)|facilitation boards]] who determine and set final prices based on a combination of [[marginal utility]] and [[opportunity cost]]. On the other hand, as Fotopoulos argues, "no kind of economic organisation based on planning alone, however democratic and decentralized it is, can secure real self-management and freedom of choice."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best, Ed.,[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/pdf%20files/pdf%20vol5/Special%20Issue%20Winter%202009.pdf "Recent Theoretical Developments on the Inclusive Democracy Project" in "Global Capitalism and the Demise of the Left:Renewing Radicalism Through Inclusive Democracy,"] ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy'', Vol. 5, No. 1, special issue (winter 2009), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democracy in the social realm===
An inclusive democracy is inconceivable unless it extends to the broader social realm to embrace the workplace, the household, the educational institution and indeed any economic or cultural institution, which constitutes an element of this realm. The equal distribution of power in these institutions and [[Self-managed economy|self-management]] are secured through the creation of assemblies of the people involved in each place of work or education (workers' assemblies, student and teachers' assemblies respectively) who make all important decisions about the functioning of these places, within the framework of the decisions taken by citizens' demotic assemblies as regards the general aims of production, education and culture respectively. The assemblies are federated at the regional and confederal levels so that the confederal assemblies of workers, teachers, students and so on could be involved in a process of constant interaction with the citizens' confederal assemblies to define society's "general interest".

A crucial issue with respect to democracy in the social realm is democratisation of the [[household]]. One possible solution is the removal of the divide between the household and the public realm. Thus, some feminist writers, particularly eco-feminists, glorify the ''[[oikos]]'' and its values as a substitute for the ''[[polis]]'' and its politics. This can be understood as an attempt to dissolve the public into the private. At the other extreme, some [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] attempt to remove the public/private divide by dissolving all private space into a singular public, a socialised or fraternal state sphere. Another possible solution is, taking for granted that the household belongs to the private realm, to 'democratise' it in the sense that household relationships should take on the characteristics of democratic relationships, and that the household should take a form which is consistent with the freedom of all its members.

But for the ID project, the issue is not the dissolution of the private/public realm divide. The real issue is how, maintaining and enhancing the [[autonomy]] of the two realms, such institutional arrangements are adopted that introduce democracy at the household and the social realm in general (workplace, educational establishment etcetera) and at the same time enhance the institutional arrangements of political and economic democracy.  In this sense, an effective democracy is only conceivable if free time is equally distributed among all citizens, which requires ending the present hierarchical relations in the household, the workplace and elsewhere. Furthermore, democracy in the social realm, particularly in the household, requires institutional arrangements which recognise the character of the household as a need-satisfier and integrate the care and services that the household provides into the general scheme of needs satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Multidimensional-Crisis-ID-ch.15"&gt;Takis Fotopoulos, [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/ss/ss.htm ''The Multidimensional Crisis and Inclusive Democracy''], (English translation of a book under the same title published in Greek, Gordios, 2005), ch. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological democracy===
[[Steven Best]] writes,

&lt;blockquote&gt;in bold contrast to the limitations of the animal advocacy movement (AAM) and all other reformist causes, Takis Fotopoulos advances a broad view of human dynamics and social institutions, their impact on the earth, and the resulting consequences for society itself. Combining [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]], radical democracy, and ecological concerns in the concept of "ecological democracy," Fotopoulos defines this notion as "the institutional framework which aims at the elimination of any human attempt to dominate the natural world, in other words, as the system which aims to reintegrate humans and Nature. This implies transcending the present 'instrumentalist' view of Nature, in which Nature is seen as an instrument for [[Economic growth|growth]], within a process of endless concentration of power.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Best,[http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol2/vol2_no3_Best_rethinking_revolution.htm "Rethinking Revolution: Animal Liberation, Human Liberation, and the Future of the Left"], ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy,'' Vol. 2, No. 3 (June 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some critics of inclusive democracy ask what guarantees an inclusive democracy may offer in ensuring a better relationship of society to nature than the alternative systems of the market economy, or socialist statism. For example, David Pepper, an eco-socialist, pointed out "the 'required' ecological consensus among ecotopia's inhabitants might not be ensured merely by establishing an [[Athenian democracy]] where all are educated and rational".&lt;ref&gt;David Pepper, ''Modern Environmentalism'', p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt; However, ID supporters counter-argue that this criticism represents a clear misconception of what democracy is about because, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;if we see it as a process of social self-institution where there is no divinely or 'objectively' defined code of human conduct, such guarantees are by definition ruled out. Therefore, the replacement of the market economy by a new institutional framework of inclusive democracy constitutes only the necessary condition for a harmonious relation between the natural and social worlds. The sufficient condition refers to the citizens' level of ecological consciousness. Still, the radical change in the dominant social paradigm that would follow the institution of an inclusive democracy, combined with the decisive role that paedeia will play in an environmentally-friendly institutional framework, could reasonably be expected to lead to a radical change in the human attitude towards Nature.&lt;ref name="Multidimensional-Crisis-ID-ch.15"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Supporters also claim that ID's institutional framework offers the best hope for a better human relationship to nature than could ever be achieved in a market economy, or one based on socialist statism. The factors supporting this view refer to all three elements of an inclusive democracy: political, economic and social.

Political democracy presupposes a radical decentralisation (physical or administrative) within a confederal society, which, by itself, should enhance its environmentally friendly character. Furthermore, political democracy would create a public space, a fact which would significantly reduce the appeal of [[materialism]] by providing a new meaning of life to fill the existential void that the present consumer society creates. Economic democracy replaces the dynamics of the capitalist market economy leading to growth per se with a new social dynamic aiming at the satisfaction of [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|demos]]' needs. If the satisfaction of demotic needs does not depend, as at present, on the continuous expansion of production to cover the 'needs' that the market system itself creates and if society is reintegrated with the economy, then there is no reason why the present instrumentalist view of nature will continue conditioning human behaviour. Particularly so, since unlike socialist models which are 'centralist', the aim of production in an Inclusive Democracy is not economic growth, but the satisfaction of the basic needs of the community and those non-basic needs for which members of the community express a desire and are willing to work extra for. This implies a new definition of [[economic efficiency]], based not on narrow techno-economic criteria of input minimisation/output maximisation as in socialist models like Parecon, but on criteria securing full coverage of the democratically defined basic needs of all citizens as well as of the non-basic needs they decide to meet, even if this involves a certain amount of [[Economic inefficiency|inefficiency]] according to the orthodox economics criteria.

According to ID supporters, democracy in the social realm should be a decisive step in the creation of the sufficient condition for a harmonious nature-society relationship, as the phasing out of [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] relations in the household and hierarchical relations in general should create a new ethos of non-domination which would engulf both nature and society.

[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|Statue of John Henry outside the town of Talcott in Summers County, West Virginia]]

'''John Henry''' is an [[African American]] [[folk hero]].  He is said to have worked as a "steel-driving man"—a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock in constructing a railroad tunnel. According to legend, John Henry's prowess as a steel-driver was measured in a race against a [[Jackhammer#History|steam-powered rock drilling machine]], a race that he won only to die in victory with hammer in hand as his heart gave out from stress. The story of John Henry is told in a classic folk song, which exists in many versions, and has been the subject of numerous stories, plays, books, and novels.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/johnhenry/ |title=John Henry, Present at the Creation |author=Stephen Wade |publisher=NPR |date=September 2, 2002|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712012224/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/johnhenry/ |archivedate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt; Various locations, including Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia, Lewis Tunnel in Virginia, and Coosa Mountain Tunnel in Alabama, have been suggested as the site of the contest.

==History==
[[File:Big Bend Tunnel John Henry.jpg|thumb|350px|A sign by the C&amp;O Railway line near [[Talcott, West Virginia]].]]
The historical accuracy of many of the aspects of the John Henry legend are subject to debate.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt; Several locations have been put forth for the tunnel on which John Henry died.

===Big Bend Tunnel===
Guy B. Johnson, a Professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina, investigated the legend of John Henry in the late 1920s.  He concluded that John Henry was a real person who worked on and died at the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]]'s (C&amp;O Railway) Big Bend Tunnel.  The tunnel was built near [[Talcott, West Virginia]], from 1870 to 1872 (according to Johnson's dating), and named for the big bend in the [[Greenbrier River]] nearby.

Some versions of the song refer to the location of John Henry's death as "The Big Bend Tunnel on the C. &amp; O."  Johnson visited the area around 1929 and found several men who said that they were boys of 12 or 14 when the tunnel was begun and that they could remember seeing John Henry, a large, powerful man. Although most of these men had heard of but not seen the famous contest between John Henry and the steam drill, Johnson ultimately was able to find a man who said he had seen it.

{{quote|This man, known as Neal Miller, told me in plain words how he had come to the tunnel with his father at 17, how he carried water and drills for the steel drivers, how he saw John Henry every day, and, finally, all about the contest between John Henry and the steam drill.

"When the agent for the steam drill company brought the drill here," said Mr. Miller, "John Henry wanted to drive against it.  He took a lot of pride in his work and he hated to see a machine take the work of men like him.

"Well, they decided to hold a test to get an idea of how practical the steam drill was.  The test went on all day and part of the next day.

"John Henry won.  He wouldn't rest enough, and he overdid.  He took sick and died soon after that."

Mr. Miller described the steam drill in detail.  I made a sketch of it and later when I looked up pictures of the early steam drills, I found his description correct.  I asked people about Mr. Miller's reputation, and they all said, "If Neal Miller said anything happened, it happened."&lt;ref name="Johnson 22"&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Guy |title=First Hero of Negro Folk Lore |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/965679/guy_b_johnson_first_hero_of_negro/|newspaper=Modesto Bee and News-Herald|date=Feb 2, 1930|page=22|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = Sep 5, 2014 }} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Talcott holds a yearly festival named for Henry, and a statue and memorial plaque have been placed along [[West Virginia Route 3]] south of Talcott as it crosses over the Big Bend tunnel.&lt;ref name=Plummer&gt;[http://www.register-herald.com/local/x1617565480/Talcott-prepares-for-John-Henry-Days "Talcott prepares for John Henry Days"], Sarah Plummer, ''[[The Register-Herald]]'', June 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; (Coords {{Coord|37|38|56.31|N|80|46|03.60|W|format=dms|display=inline|type:landmark_region:US-WV}})

=== Lewis Tunnel ===
In the 2006 book ''Steel Drivin' Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend'', [[Scott Reynolds Nelson]], an associate professor of history at the [[College of William &amp; Mary]], contends that the John Henry of the ballad was based on a different real person, the 20-year-old New Jersey-born African-American [[Freedman|freeman]], John William Henry. Nelson speculates that Henry, like many African Americans might have come to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the Civil War. Arrested and tried for burglary, he was among the many convicts released by the warden to work as [[convict lease|leased labor]] on the C&amp;O Railway.&lt;ref name="Nelson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nelson, Scott Reynolds |title=Steel drivin' man: John Henry, the untold story of an American legend |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-19-530010-6 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}

According to Nelson, conditions at the Virginia prison were so terrible that the warden, an idealistic Quaker from Maine, believed the prisoners, many of whom had been arrested on trivial charges, would be better clothed and fed if they were released as laborers to private contractors. (He subsequently changed his mind about this and became an opponent of the convict labor system.) Nelson asserts that a steam drill race at the Big Bend Tunnel would have been impossible because railroad records do not indicate a steam drill being used there.&lt;ref name=Grimes&gt;Grimes, William. [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/books/18grim.html?ex=1168750800&amp;en=2c72dddaeac54265&amp;ei=5070 "Taking Swings at a Myth, With John Henry the Man"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Books section, October 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, Nelson argues that the contest must have taken place 40 miles away at the Lewis Tunnel, between Talcott and [[Millboro, Virginia]], where records indicate that prisoners did indeed work beside steam drills night and day.&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;Downes, Lawrence. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/books/review/Downes-t.html "John Henry Days"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', Books section, April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nelson also argues that the verses of the ballad about John Henry being buried near "the white house", "in sand", somewhere that locomotives roar, mean that Henry's body was buried in the cemetery behind the main building of the [[Virginia State Penitentiary]], which photos from that time indicate was painted white, and where numerous unmarked graves have been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/john_henry/nelson.html |title=John Henry - The Story - Lewis Tunnel |publisher=Ibiblio.org |date=2006-07-13 |accessdate=2010-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prison records for John William Henry stopped in 1873, suggesting that he was kept on the record books until it was clear that he was not coming back and had died. The evidence assembled by Nelson, though suggestive, is circumstantial; Nelson stresses that John Henry would have been representative of the many hundreds of convict laborers who were killed in unknown circumstances tunneling through the mountains or who died shortly afterwards of [[silicosis]] from dust created by the drills and blasting.

=== Coosa Mountain Tunnel ===
There is another tradition that John Henry's famous race took place not in Virginia or West Virginia, but rather near [[Leeds, Alabama]].  Professor Johnson in the late 1920s received letters saying that John Henry worked on the [[Alabama Great Southern Railroad|A.G.S. Railway]]'s Cruzee or Curzey Mountain Tunnel in 1882, and a third letter saying it was at Oak Mountain in 1887, but he discounted these reports after the A.G.S. told him that the railway had no such tunnel.&lt;ref name="Johnson 22"/&gt;  Retired chemistry professor and folklorist John Garst, of the [[University of Georgia]], has argued that the contest happened at the Coosa Mountain Tunnel or the Oak Mountain Tunnel of the [[Columbus and Western Railway]] (now part of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]) near Leeds on September 20, 1887.&lt;ref name="Garst 2002 92–129"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Garst | first = John | title = Chasing John Henry in Alabama and Mississippi: A Personal Memoir of Work in Progress | journal = Tributaries: Journal of the Alabama Folklife Association | volume = 5 | year = 2002 | pages = 92–129| url=http://www.ibiblio.org/john_henry/alabama.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on documentation that corresponds with the account of C. C. Spencer, who claimed in the 1920s to have witnessed the contest, Garst speculates that John Henry may have been a man named Henry who was born a [[slave]] to P.A.L. Dabney, the father of the chief engineer of that railroad, in 1850.&lt;ref name="Garst 2002 92–129"/&gt; Since 2007, the city of Leeds has honored John Henry's legend during an annual September festival, held on the third weekend in September, called the Leeds Downtown Folk Festival &amp; John Henry Celebration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.al.com/bargain-mom/2011/09/free_leeds_downtown_folk_festi.html "Free Leeds Downtown Folk Festival is Saturday &amp; Sunday"], Christie Dedman -- The Birmingham News The Birmingham News, September 15, 2011&lt;p&gt;[http://leedsfolkfestival.com/john-henry.php "John Henry in Leeds"], Leeds Folk Festival&lt;/ref&gt;

Garst and Nelson have debated the merits of their divergent research conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;Garst, John (November 27, 2006) "[http://hnn.us/articles/31137.html On the Trail of the Real John Henry]". ''History News Network'', [[George Mason University]], includes rebuttal by Scott Nelson&lt;/ref&gt; Other claims have been made over the years that place Henry and his contest in [[Kentucky]] or [[Jamaica]].&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

The tale of John Henry has been used as a symbol in many cultural movements, including [[labor movement]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singer A |title=Using Songs to Teach Labor History |journal=OAH Magazine of History |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=13–16 |date=Winter 1997 |doi= 10.1093/maghis/11.2.13|jstor=25163131}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name=Nikola-Lisa/&gt;

===Film===
====Live action====

The character was featured in ''[[Tall Tale (film)|Tall Tale: The Unbelievable Adventures of Pecos Bill]]'' (1995), portrayed by [[Roger Aaron Brown]].

In October 2018, it was announced that [[Dwayne Johnson]] will portray the character in an upcoming film exclusive to [[Netflix]] titled ''John Henry and the Statesmen''. The film is intended to be the first installment in a [[Shared universe#Universes in films|shared universe]] that centers around heroes of legend and folklore, from various ethnic groups and cultures. [[Jake Kasdan]] will direct the film, from a script written by [[Tom Wheeler (writer)|Tom Wheeler]]. The film is a co-production between Seven Bucks Productions, [[List of original films distributed by Netflix|Netflix Original Films]], and FlynnPictureCo. with Johnson, Kasdan, [[Beau Flynn]], Hiram Garcia, and Dany Garcia serving as co-producers. A teaser trailer was debuted with the announcement of the film stating that the release date was "coming soon".&lt;ref&gt;http://sevenbucks.com/news_and_press/594/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfswQcE_Z1M&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animation====

In 1973, Nick Bosustow and David Adams co-produced an 11-minute animated short, ''The Legend of John Henry'' for [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lenburg, Jeff |title=Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film and Television's Award-Winning and Legendary Animators |publisher=Applause Books |location=New York |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=1-55783-671-X|oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character later appeared in a [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] short film, ''John Henry'' (1999). Directed by [[Mark Henn]], plans for theatrical releases in 2000 and 2001 fell through after having a limited [[Academy Award]] qualifying run in Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="DisneyJohnHenry"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.orlandoweekly.com/orlando/a-black-hero-comes-up-short/Content?oid=2262183 | title=A black hero comes up short | work=Orlando Weekly | date=22 February 2001 | accessdate=3 November 2015 | author=Hill, Jim}}&lt;/ref&gt; a shorter version was released as the only new entry in direct-to-video release, ''[[Disney's American Legends]]'' (2002). It was eventually released in its original format as an [[interstitial program|interstitial]] on the [[Disney Channel]], and later as part of the home video compilation ''Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection'' in 2015.

===Television===

[[Danny Glover]] played the character in the series, ''[[Tall Tales &amp; Legends|Shelley Duvall's Tall Tales &amp; Legends]]'' from 1985-1987. [[Shelley Duvall|Duvall]] served as the series' creator, presenter, narrator, and executive producer. The show aired on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime Network]] as well as [[Disney Channel]], and received a [[Primetime Emmy Award]].

===Music===&lt;!-- linked from [[John Henry]] --&gt;

The story of John Henry is traditionally told through two types of songs: [[ballad]]s, commonly called "The Ballad of John Henry", and "[[Take This Hammer|hammer song]]s" (a type of [[work song]]), each with wide-ranging and varying lyrics.&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; Some songs, and some early folk historian research, conflate the songs about John Henry with those of [[John Hardy (song)|John Hardy]], a West Virginian outlaw.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; Ballads about John Henry's life typically contain four major components: a [[Precognition|premonition]] by John Henry as a child that steel-driving would lead to his death, the lead-up to and the results of the legendary race against the steam hammer, Henry's death and burial, and the reaction of his wife.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

The well-known narrative ballad of "John Henry" is usually sung in an upbeat tempo. Hammer songs associated with the "John Henry" ballad, however, are not. Sung more slowly and deliberately, often with a pulsating beat suggestive of swinging the hammer, these songs usually contain the lines "This old hammer killed John Henry / but it won't kill me." Nelson explains that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... &amp;nbsp;workers managed their labor by setting a "stint," or pace, for it. Men who violated the stint were shunned&amp;nbsp;... Here was a song that told you what happened to men who worked too fast: they died ugly deaths; their entrails fell on the ground. You sang the song slowly, you worked slowly, you guarded your life, or you died.&lt;ref name="Nelson" /&gt;{{rp|32}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some controversy among scholars over which came first, the ballad or the hammer songs. Some scholars have suggested that the "John Henry" ballad grew out of the hammer songs, while others believe that the two were always entirely separate.

&lt;!-- Please do not add musicians to this list unless you accompany them with a citation to a reliable source. --&gt;Songs featuring the story of John Henry have been recorded by many musical artists and bands of different ethnic backgrounds. Some of these include:

===Literature===

Henry is the subject of the [[1931 in literature|1931]] [[Roark Bradford]] novel ''[[John Henry (novel)|John Henry]]'', illustrated by noted woodcut artist [[J. J. Lankes]]. The novel was adapted into a [[Musical theatre|stage musical]] in 1940, starring [[Paul Robeson]] in the title role.&lt;ref name=Tracy/&gt; According to [[Steven Carl Tracy]], Bradford's works were influential in broadly popularizing the John Henry legend beyond railroad and mining communities and outside of African American oral histories.&lt;ref name="Tracy"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Tracy, Steven C. |author2=Bradford, Roark |title=John Henry: Roark Bradford's Novel and Play |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2011 |pages= |isbn=0-19-976650-9 |oclc= |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7hbFnHc_wcgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Bradford&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1933 article published in ''[[The Journal of Negro Education]]'', Bradford's John Henry was criticized for "making over a folk-hero into a clown."&lt;ref&gt;Sterling A. Brown. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2292236 "Negro Character as Seen by White Authors"], ''[[The Journal of Negro Education]]'', Vol. 2, No. 2 (Apr., 1933), pp. 179-203&lt;/ref&gt; A 1948 obituary for Bradford described ''John Henry'' as "a better piece of native folklore than Paul Bunyan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6gBQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jlUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6151,4066920&amp;dq=roark-bradford+john-henry&amp;hl=en "Bradford was one of Immortals"], Robert C. Ruark, ''[[The Evening Independent]]'', November 22, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ezra Jack Keats]]'s ''[[John Henry, an American Legend|John Henry: An American Legend]]'', published in 1965, is a notable [[picture book]] chronicling the history of John Henry and portraying him as the "personification of the [[medieval]] [[Everyman]] who struggles against insurmountable odds and wins."&lt;ref name="Nikola-Lisa"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Nikola-Lisa W |title=John Henry: Then and Now |journal=African American Review |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=51–56 |date=Spring 1998 |doi= |jstor=3042267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colson Whitehead]]'s 2001 novel ''[[John Henry Days]]'' uses the John Henry myth as story background. Whitehead fictionalized the John Henry Days festival in Talcott, West Virginia and the release of the John Henry postage stamp in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/05/13/reviews/010513.13franzt.html "Freeloading Man"], Jonathan Franzen, ''[[New York Times]]'', May 13, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DC Comics]] superhero [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]]'s civilian name, "John Henry Irons," is inspired by John Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Action Comics #4 (February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government property ===
In 1996, the [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States|U.S. Post Office]] issued a John Henry 32-cent [[postage stamp]]. It was part of a set honoring American folk heroes that included [[Paul Bunyan]], [[Pecos Bill]] and [[Casey at the Bat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/503453/NEW-STAMPS-TELL-TALL-TALES-OF-FOLK-HEROES.html NEW STAMPS TELL TALL TALES OF FOLK HEROES], ''[[Deseret News]]'', July 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Video games ===
John Henry was featured as a fictional character in the 2014 video game ''[[Wasteland 2]]''. The story is referenced by various [[NPCs]] throughout the game and is also available in full as a series of in game books which tell the story of the competition between John Henry and a contingent of robotic workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wasteland.gamepedia.com/The_Story_of_John_Henry|title=The Story of John Henry - Official Wasteland 3 Wiki|website=wasteland.gamepedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also appeared as a playable character in the 3DS game ''[[Code Name: S.T.E.A.M.]]''.

In the story of ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'' comics, he was the first [[Team Fortress 2#Defense|Heavy]] of the original BLU team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Non-player_characters#BLU_team_.28original.29|title=Non-playable characters - BLU Team (original)|website=wiki.teamfortress.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9693">{{Maya civilization}}
'''K’o''' is one of several [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] ceremonial center sites around and associated with the Classic Mayan city of [[Holmul]] located in modern-day [[Guatemala]]. Currently, the site boasts what may be the royal tomb of the earliest known Mayan ruler.&lt;ref&gt;John Tomasic and Steven Bozarth (2011), [https://kansas.academia.edu/JohnTomasic/Papers/1275495/ ''New Data from a Preclassic Tomb at K'o, Guatemala.''] Kansas.academia.edu p9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
The site is located 15 kilometers west of the [[Belize]] border and 80 kilometers south of the [[Mexican border]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of several sites within a 6&amp;nbsp;km radius of [[Holmul]] &lt;ref&gt;History of the Holmul Archaeological Project&lt;/ref&gt; and is southeast of [[Holmul]] across the [[Holmul River (Guatemala)|Holmul River]].&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli and Wahl 2012, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; The entire [[Holmul]] complex is located within Northeastern [[Guatemala]] in the central lowland [[Petén (department)|Peten]] region. The area receives an average of 80 in. (2000&amp;nbsp;mm) of rainfall annually and temperatures generally range from 70-95 F (25-35 C) similar to the neighboring southern lowlands.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; The site of K’o sits at about 200–250 meters above sea level on the edge of the highland plateau. This placement allows the site easy access to wetlands and water sources. In fact, K’o elevation places it above several aguadas (water sources for various sites in the area) that branch from the Holmul River.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli and Wahl 2012, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[Instituto de Antropología e Historia]] inspector Francisco Moro informed Boston University’s recently created [[Holmul Archeological Project]] of the existence of the K’o site in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade, both [[Vanderbilt University]] and then [[Boston University]] led [[The Holmul Archeological Project]] at Holmul and associated sites such as K’o. The Project mapped the sites, excavated artifacts, and salvaged damage done by looters.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Layout===
The K’o site core contains several large pyramid structures atop platforms arranged amongst the site’s plazas.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic and Bozarth 2011, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Settlement===
The [[Holmul]] region experienced 1900 years of uninterrupted human occupation from the Early Middle Preclassic to the Late Classic with several sites occupied at one time.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence provided by dated ceramics throughout the K’o site suggests occupation for 1500 years from the Late Middle Preclassic to the Terminal Classic Period.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic and Bozarth 2011, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of settlement, the central lowlands underwent a period of factionalization allowing various ceremonial sites like K’o to develop in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 322&lt;/ref&gt; Lowland Maya settlement patterns suggest non-nucleated settlement in the area, as opposed to earlier assumptions of nucleated development.&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli and Wahl, 2010 p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise===
Public architecture rose and peaked prominently during the Terminal Preclassic before gradually declining throughout the later periods. The ball court at K’o dates to the Terminal Preclassic. Different plazas also usually date to the Terminal Preclassic, though there is evidence for renovations, reconstruction, and construction of new plaza areas through the Early Classic.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
Long term political decline occurred at K’o throughout the Classic period. The exact cause of K’o’s decline remains unknown, though many archaeologists attribute the decline to the centralization of two major polities in the area, [[Holmul]] and [[Cival]].&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 322&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cival]] dominated the region politically throughout the Late Preclassic and archaeologists view [[Holmul]]’s growing political authority over the region throughout the Classic period as an undermining force of K’o elite authority.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2009 doctoral dissertation, John Tomasic analyzed the distribution and re-distribution of [[luxury goods]] ([[jade]] and [[Seashell|shell]] goods) by elites as well as the distribution of domestic goods ([[obsidian]] blades and grinding stones) obtained through non-elite market bartering. Tomasic found that throughout the site’s occupation, [[luxury goods]] used in [[elite]] economic reciprocal exchange gradually declined at the site over time which correlates with the ceremonial sites decline in power.  the marketplace goods which non-elite citizens traded for at the site remained largely unaffected throughout K’o’s decline, suggesting ruling elite did not have as much control over the market place as other Mayan archaeologists argue.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the decline of public construction and distribution of luxury goods suggest that the elite at the K’o site were no longer powerful enough to commission public architecture or trade luxury goods with other groups as they previously did in the Terminal Preclassic.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;  The site most likely maintained a close political relationship with the Holmul and related sites during the Classic period. Different scholars debate whether the site and its relationship with Holmul reflected a hierarchy of scale or a hierarchy of control, though others argue both.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic 2009, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jester God headdress (royal title)==
In 2008, archaeologists investigating a wealthy Mayan home at K’o dug into a tunnel that led to a [[chultun]] or storage area filled with eight different pieces of pottery dating back to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Middle Preclassic and Late Preclassic]]. Upon further investigation, archeologists realized the chultun was a tomb of a man ranging from 40–50 years old. The man lay facing south while his flexed arms lay with hands crossing.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic and Bozarth 2011, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Two vessels containing the skull and the mandible were placed alongside the body of the skeleton in the Mayan lip-to-lip tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore 2011, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologists also discovered an incense burner alongside the man which depicted a Jester God Headband or maize god with ''hun jewel'' (symbol of rulership).&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Mayan scholars associate the Jester God Headdress iconography with Mayan ruler status based on later artwork depicting a ruler or [[ajaw]] with the headdress. This discovery precedes what scholars believed to be the earliest Mayan ruler in 150 BC, as the tomb dates back to 350 BC, thus pushing the earliest known Mayan ruler back two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic and Bozarth 2011, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars interpret this find as a sign that the institutionalization of 'ajaw' occurred before Mayan rulership became associated with divine kingship. Another royal tomb found in a residential elite area at [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]] in 2005 also supports this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic and Bozarth 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Estrada-Belli 2011, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery sheds new light on the early Mayan ruler burial during the Late Preclassic. The residents of K’o buried this ruler beneath the elite residential area, which may have been a custom early on. It became customary for the later [[Mayan civilization]] rulers to be buried in a temple or a pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;Tomasic and Bozarth 2011, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Currently the Holmul Archaeological Project and archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli’s non-profit organization the Maya Archaeological Initiative employ four local [[park rangers]] to protect [[Holmul]] and the associated sites from further looting. Additionally, these rangers protect the site from natural erosion while making sure roofs, trails, and research facilities in the area remain intact for archaeologist use.&lt;ref&gt;Maya Archeological Initiative 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museo Larco''' (English: Larco Museum) or '''Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera''' is a privately owned museum of [[pre-Columbian]] art, located in the [[Pueblo Libre]] District of [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. The museum is housed in an 18th-century [[Viceroyalty of Peru|vice-royal]] building built over a 7th-century pre-Columbian [[pyramid]]. It showcases chronological galleries that provide a thorough overview of 4,000 years of Peruvian pre-Columbian history. It is well known for its gallery of pre-Columbian [[Huaco (pottery)#Erotic huacos|erotic pottery]].

==History==
[[File:Storage Gallery.jpg|thumb|right|Storage Gallery]]
In 1925, Rafael Larco Herrera acquired a collection of vases and other archaeological pieces from Alfredo Hoyle, who was his brother-in-law. There were approximately 600 ceramic pieces in all. The arrival of these objects ignited a collector's enthusiasm in his son, [[Rafael Larco Hoyle]]. Soon after, Larco Herrera left his son in charge of the collection and those pieces completed the first collection of what would become the Rafael Larco Herrera Museum.

During that same year, Larco Hoyle received some advice from his uncle, Victor Larco Herrera, a founder of the first museum in Lima. He urged Larco Hoyle to form a new museum in Lima, one that could guard all the archaeological relics that were continually being extracted by clandestine excavators.

Larco Hoyle agreed with his uncle and proceeded to create a museum that would carry on his father's legacy. Larco Hoyle purchased two large collections: 8,000 pieces from Roa and 6,000 pieces from Carranza. He also purchased several small collections in Chicama Valley, [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Virú Province|Virú]], and [[Chimbote]]. Within a year, the collection had grown significantly and display cases were installed in a small house on the Chiclín estate. On July 28, 1926, Independence Day, the museum opened to the public.

The Larco Museum now lends some of its collection to its daughter museum, the [[Museo de Arte Precolombino (Peru)|Museo de Arte Precolombino]] (Pre-Columbian Art Museum), located in [[Cusco]], Peru.

==Exhibitions==
===Permanent exhibits===
[[File:Moche earrings.jpg|thumb|[[Moche culture|Moche]] earrings]]
[[File:MOCHICA HEADRESS.jpg|thumb|right|Mochica Headdress from the Gold and Silver Gallery]]

The Museum has several permanent exhibitions. The Gold and Silver Gallery showcases the largest collection of jewelry used by many notable rulers of pre-Columbian Peru. It comprises a collection of crowns, earrings, nose ornaments, garments, masks and vases, finely wrought in gold and decorated with semi-precious stones. Ancient Peruvian cultures represented their daily lives in ceramics, and this gallery holds the world's largest collection of erotic ceramics.

The Cultures Gallery exhibits 10,000 years of Peruvian pre-Columbian history. This chronology-based gallery provides visitors with a comprehensive view of cultures that existed in pre-Columbian Peru through the extant indigenous art that has survived since the 16th century [[Spanish conquest of Peru|Spanish conquest]]. This hall is divided into four areas: North Coast, Center, South and cultures from the highlands. Showcases have been ordered according to cultural sequence:

* From the North Coast:  [[Cupisnique]], [[Vicus (Peru)|Vicus]], [[Moche (culture)|Mochica]] and [[Chimu]];
* From the Central Coast:  [[Lima culture|Lima]] and [[Chancay culture|Chancay]];
* From the South Coast: [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] and [[Chincha people|Chincha]];
* From the Highlands: [[Chavín culture|Chavín]], [[Tiahuanaco]], [[Huari culture|Huari]] and [[Inca society|Inca]].

Other galleries include the Lithic, Vault, Ceramics, Metals, Textiles and Storage in which visitors have the opportunity to view the Museum's entire collection of classified archaeological objects.

===International exhibits===
In addition to its permanent exhibits, the Larco Museum lends its collections to several museums and cultural centers around the world.

===Gallery of pre-Columbian Erotic Pottery===
[[File:Larco Museum Erotic Art V.jpg|thumb|upright|Pre-Columbian [[Huaco_(pottery)|Huaco Pottery]] depicting [[fellatio]].]]
This hall displays the selection of archaeological objects found by Rafael Larco Hoyle in the 1960s, as a result of his research on sexual representations in Peruvian pre-Columbian art, published in his book, "Checan" (1966).

==Other points of interest==
The Museum Gallery Shop has a wide variety of ceramic, metal and textile reproductions made by skilled craftsmen from all over Peru. The museum has formalized the reproduction techniques for these pre-Columbian artifacts and assesses each piece to ensure quality.

'''Lawtel''' is a subscription-based online [[legal research]] tool that provides subscribers with access to a range of legal information. Used primarily by solicitors, barristers and legal researchers, it covers cases and judgments, legislation, articles and press cuttings, and online precedents. 

One of the most popular Lawtel services is Daily Updates. Subscribers choose from 100 subject areas to receive the latest news pertinent to their practice area. 

Lawtel provides same day reporting for the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] and overnight coverage of selected cases from the higher courts.

== History ==

Lawtel was created in 1980 by a Liverpool solicitor, Graham Ross, and demonstrated at the second annual conference of the Society for Computers and Law, where he was a speaker. Subsequently that year he was joined by a retired  barrister, Gerald Impey. Together they set up a [[Manx law|Manx company]] 'Lawtel Limited', from which Ross resigned a year later. Impey stayed on in various roles until his death in November 1999. In 1994, Lawtel was acquired by [[Centaur Communications|Centaur Communications Ltd]]. 

In 2002, Lawtel was acquired by [[Sweet &amp; Maxwell]].  Lawtel continues to remain a separate service within the Sweet &amp; Maxwell portfolio, positioned as a companion service to [[Westlaw]]. Currently Lawtel has 90000 subscribers, ranging from sole practitioners to universities and corporations.

== Lawtel In Detail ==

The Lawtel service is divided up into sections: cases, legislation, articles and press, and specialist areas. 
Subscribers have access to around 60,000 case reports and the service is updated daily. Cases are reported from the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]], [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Civil), [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] (Criminal), [[High Court of Justice|High Court]], selected tribunals, [[Crown Court]], and the [[County Court]].

Lawtel allows subscribers to track the progress of a piece of legislation, and search for legislation that has already become law.

It offers a full text document delivery service for judgments dating back to 1980. Subscribers can read unofficial transcripts and track specific cases. It also delivers updates on legislation and cases to a subscriber’s inbox, via the Daily Updates service.

Lawtel also offers services for specific practice areas. These include: The Busy Solicitor’s Digest, EU, FirstPoint, Employment, Human Rights, Lawtel Litigator, Local Government, Kemp on Lawtel, and Personal Injury.

== The Impact of Lawtel on Legal Publishing in the UK ==

Laurence Eastham, Editor of the [http://www.scl.org Society of Computers and Law] journal C&amp;L, commented upon the sale of Lawtel to Sweet &amp; Maxwell that:

''"Lawtel undoubtedly made others improve, and move more rapidly than might otherwise have been natural to them. A large number of practising solicitors have been recruited to the need for updated online information by Lawtel... [i]n  short, they made a difference"'' C&amp;L August/September 2002, p.2

{{Dynamic list}}
This is a list of [[scandal]]s or controversies whose names include a "-gate" suffix, by analogy with the [[Watergate scandal]], as well as other incidents to which the suffix has (often facetiously) been applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://public.oed.com/blog/the-gate-suffix/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |chapter=-gate, suffix |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list also includes controversies that are widely referred to with a "-gate" suffix, but may be referred to by another more common name (such as the [[New Orleans Saints bounty scandal]]). Use of the "-gate" suffix has spread beyond U.S. English to many other countries and languages.

== Etymology, usage, and history of ''-gate'' ==

The [[suffix]] ''[[wikt:-gate|-gate]]'' derives from the Watergate scandal of the United States in the early 1970s, which resulted in the resignation of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;"-gate, comb. form." OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2015. Web. June 8, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal was named after the [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]; the complex itself was named after the "Water Gate" area where [[symphony orchestra]] concerts were staged on the [[Potomac River]] between 1935 and 1965.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPostAnswerManWaterGate&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html|title=Answer Man: A Gate to Summers Past|author=John Kelly|work=The Washington Post|date=December 13, 2004|accessdate=September 18, 2009|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5jsdEHs1g?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A60120-2004Dec12.html|archivedate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suffix is used to embellish a noun or name to suggest the existence of a [[Conspiracy (criminal)|far-reaching scandal]], particularly in [[politics]] and [[government]]. As a [[CBC News]] column noted in 2001, the term may "suggest unethical behaviour and a [[cover-up]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: A-I|last=Partridge|first=Eric|page=844|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-25937-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such usages have been criticised by commentators as [[cliché]]d and misleading;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-06-16/watergate-scandal-changed-political-landscape/55639974/1|title=Watergate scandal changed the political landscape forever|work=USA Today|date=June 16, 2012|accessdate=September 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Stanyer comments that "revelations are given the 'gate' suffix to add a thin veil of credibility, following 'Watergate', but most bear no resemblance to the painstaking investigation of that particular piece of presidential [[corruption]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanyer|first=James|title=Modern political communication: mediated politics in uncertain times|page=59|publisher=Polity|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-2797-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stanyer links the widespread use of ''-gate'' to what the sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] calls "scandal syndrome":

{{quote|[A] self-reproducing and self-reinforcing process, driven on by competitive and combative struggles in the media and political fields and giving rise to more and more scandals which increasingly become the focus of mediated forms of public debate, marginalizing or displacing other issues and producing on occasion a climate of political crisis which can debilitate or even paralyse a government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=John|authorlink=John Thompson (sociologist)|title=Political scandal: power and visibility in the media age|page=265|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2000|isbn=978-0-7456-2550-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The adoption of ''-gate'' to suggest the existence of a scandal was promoted by [[William Safire]], the conservative ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist and former Nixon administration speechwriter. As early as September 1974 he wrote of "Vietgate", a proposed [[Nixon pardon|pardon of the Watergate criminals]] and [[Vietnam War]] [[draft dodger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=Watergate in American memory: how we remember, forget, and reconstruct the past|page=151|publisher=Basic Books|year=1993|isbn=978-0-465-09083-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he coined numerous ''-gate'' terms, including ''Billygate, Briefingate, Contragate, Deavergate, Debategate, Doublebillingsgate'' (of which he later said "My best [-gate coinage] was the encapsulation of a minor ... scandal as doublebillingsgate"), ''Frankiegate, Franklingate, Genschergate, Housegate, Iraqgate, Koreagate, Lancegate, Maggiegate, Nannygate, Raidergate, Scalpgate, Travelgate, Troopergate'' and ''Whitewatergate''. The ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine suggested that his aim in doing so was "rehabilitating Nixon by relentlessly tarring his successors with the same rhetorical brush – diminished [[guilt by association]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Smoking Lexicon|last=Cohen|first=Noam|work=New York Magazine|page=13|date=February 5, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Safire himself later said to author [[Eric Alterman]] that he "may have been seeking to minimize the relative importance of the crimes committed by his former boss with this silliness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sound and fury: the making of the punditocracy|page=79|last=Alterman|first=Eric|year=1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8639-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage has spread into languages other than English; examples of ''-gate'' being used to refer to local political scandals have been reported from [[Argentina]], [[Germany]], [[South Korea]], [[Hungary]], [[Greece]] and the former [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joseph |first=Brian D. |editor-last1=Spencer |editor-first1=Andrew |editor-last2=Zwicky |editor-first2=Arnold M.|title=The handbook of morphology|page=361|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|chapter=Diachronic Morphology|year=2001|isbn=978-0-631-22694-9}} He cites:

*{{cite journal|last1=Schuhmacher|first1=W. W.|title=More on {{nbh}}Gate|journal=American Speech|date=1989|volume=64|issue=4|page=380|jstor=455733}} (for German)
* {{cite journal|last1=Kontra|first1=Miklós|title=Hungarians Turned Gateniks in 1990|journal=American Speech|date=1992|volume=67|issue=2|pages=216–222|jstor=455461|doi=10.2307/455461}} (for Hungarian)

The use of a suffix in this way is not new. ''-mandering'' has long been used as a suffix by a politician's name in analogy with [[Gerrymandering#Etymology|gerrymandering]] ([[Andrew Johnson#Congressman (1843–1853)|"Henry-mandering" was used in 1852]]). In recent years, the ''-gate'' suffix as a catch-all signifier for scandal has seen some competition from {{nowrap|''-ghazi'',}} as in "Ballghazi" instead of "[[Deflategate]]", or "Bridgeghazi" instead of "[[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|Bridgegate]]".  The use of ''-ghazi'' is a play on the [[investigation into the 2012 Benghazi attack]], which despite numerous official investigations into the possibility of government cover-ups, has resulted in no criminal charges or major repercussions for the individuals supposedly involved.  ''-ghazi'' may be seen as carrying an ironic or self-effacing connotation in its usage, implying that the event described has the appearance and media coverage of a scandal, but does not actually amount to much in a grander sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeflateGate ... or Ballghazi? Will the new scandal suffix have staying power|last=Farhi|first=Paul|work=The Washington Post|date=January 27, 2015|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/deflategate--or-ballghazi-will-the-new-scandal-suffix-have-staying-power/2015/01/27/db1c5eac-a571-11e4-a7c2-03d37af98440_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Driv3rgate]]
|2004
|Before the worldwide release of ''[[Driver 3]]'', Atari offered the magazines ''[[PSM3|PSM2]]'' and ''[[Xbox World]]'' early review copies of the game in exchange for positive review scores. This deal was taken by both of them, yet, due to the disappointing nature of the game when it was released, gamers took to forums to complain about the mysterious circumstances related to why both magazines gave positive scores for a heavily berated game. Many then figured out that Atari had paid both, and as a response the comments were systematically wiped by administrators, which gave way to suggestions of a cover up by the publishing house. This controversy would later be referred to as "DRIV3Rgate" and the affair gained a fairly large amount of coverage in the games press and on Internet forums. During this time, Atari hired a guerrilla team to, in desperation, repeatedly make new accounts and post positive threads and comments about the game in an attempt to reduce the controversy.

|Refers to the controversy following the November 2007 dismissal of [[Jeff Gerstmann]] from his position as Editorial Director of [[GameSpot]]. Gerstmann had awarded a ''Fair'' rating to the game ''[[Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men]]'' at a time when the game was being heavily advertised on GameSpot, which led to accusations from many games journalists of a lack of editorial integrity on the part of GameSpot, who denied that the review had been a part of the reasoning behind the dismissal. However, a subsequent interview with Gerstmann in 2012 countered this statement, with Gerstmann claiming that, although there was more to his firing than any single review, it would not be untrue to say that the Kane &amp; Lynch episode contributed to it.

|[[2013 horse meat scandal|Horsegate]] (also "Horsemeat-gate")
|2013
|A UK scandal in which it emerged that several large supermarket chains were selling meat containing horse or equine meat while claiming they were "100% beef." Further context to this is that, while horsemeat is mostly fine for human consumption and is eaten in countries throughout Europe and the rest of the world, it is rarely sold on the mainstream UK market and is considered somewhat culturally unacceptable to eat in British society.

[[File:Madonna della strada.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The original painting of ''Madonna Della Strada'', hanging in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome]]

'''''Madonna Della Strada''''' or '''''Santa Maria Della Strada''''' &amp;mdash; the [[Italian language|Italian]] for '''''Our Lady of the Wayside''''', or '''''Our Lady of the Good Road''''' &amp;mdash; is the name of an image of the [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]], enshrined at the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome, [[mother church]] of the [[Society of Jesus]] [[religious order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and is a variation on the Eastern ''basilissa'' (imperial) type of icon.&lt;ref name=Waldrop/&gt;

The ''Madonna Della Strada'' is the [[patron saint|patroness]] of the Society of Jesus. Its founder, [[Ignatius of Loyola]], was said to have been protected by the intercession of the Blessed Virgin Mary during battle in his service as a  soldier.&lt;ref&gt; John W. O'Malley, et all 1999 ''The Jesuits'' University of Toronto Press {{ISBN|978-0-8020-4287-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name goes back to a shrine established in Rome in the 5th century by the Astalli family, originally known as the ''Madonna degli Astalli'', at a crossroads along the ceremonial route of the popes.&lt;ref name=Waldrop&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/issue/720/art/object-devotion Waldrop S.J., Gregory. "Object of Devotion", ''America'', December 21, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13th-14th century fresco (a wall painting done on damp plaster) was originally painted on the wall of Saint Mary of the Way in Rome, the church of  the  Society of Jesus (Jesuits), given to Saint Ignatius by Pope Paul III in 1540.&lt;ref name=Pauca&gt;[http://paucaverba.blogspot.com/2013/05/the-madonna-della-strada.html Morris, Stephen P., "The Madonna della Strada", ''Pauca Verba'', May 12, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 1568, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese erected the [[Church of the Gesù|Gesù Church of Rome]], the mother church of the Jesuits, in place of the former church of Santa Maria della Strada. The fresco was moved there in 1575 to a side chapel where Jesuits pronounced their vows. Sometime in the 19th century, the image was transferred to canvas and affixed to a slate panel.&lt;ref name=Waldrop/&gt;

[[File:Il Gesù 002.JPG|thumb|220px|Altar of ''Madonna Della Strada'']]
The icon is  located between two altars, the first dedicated to [[Ignatius of Loyola]], the second, the main altar of the Church, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Louis A. Bonacci, "[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/s/santa-maria-della-strada.php Santa Maria della Strada]," ''All About Mary''. International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton&lt;/ref&gt;

The icon was restored in 2006, revealing at least two layers of previous paint, the original art being a fresco which had been detached from a wall and affixed to canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contemplatioadamorem.blogspot.com/2006/12/restored-image-of-madonna-della-strada.html "Restored image of the Madonna della Strada", Contemplatio ad amorem, December 04, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The Jesuits celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Way on May 24. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sjweb.info/resources/Calender_Liturgy/2012-18_Proper%20Calendar%20SI_ENG.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

There is a chapel dedicated to ''[[Madonna Della Strada Chapel|Madonna Della Strada]]'' at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luc.edu/mdsweddings/ "Madonna Della Strada weddings", Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Scranton]] in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scranton.edu/about/community-relations/religious-services.shtml "Campus Religious Services", University of Scranton, Scranton, Pennsylvania]&lt;/ref&gt; and at Zilber Hall, [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/magazine/recent.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1349125200 Bazan, Jessie.

'''''Margaritae''''' are collections of [[canon law]] and decretals.

[[Canon lawyer]]s of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries taught [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] by commenting on the ''[[Decretum of Gratian]]'' and on the various collections of the [[Decretals]]. The ''margaritae'' were developed as collections to aid memory. They arranged the more important propositions, denominated "résumés", and [[axiom]]s in alphabetical order or by subject matter, including [[mnemonic]] verse.{{sfn|Boudinhon|1910}} Many of these ''margaritae'' have been preserved, but not all of their authors are certainly known. Some of them have been printed with the ''Decretum'' or the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX]]''.{{sfn|Boudinhon|1910}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2602">The NFL's '''Quarterback Challenge''' was an annual competition of [[National Football League]] [[quarterbacks]], sponsored in part by [[DirecTV]], produced by NFL, PLAYERS INC and NFL QB Greats. The first NFL Quarterback Challenge took place in 1990. The event were previously sponsored by [[989 Sports]] and in 2005 by [[Electronic Arts]] EA Sports.

==In video games==
NFL-licensed ''NFL Quarterback Challenge'', created by ProAppSports and produced by Adisoft Studios is currently available on [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]] devices. An officially NFL-licensed Quarterback Challenge appeared in 2 other different console video games.  Both video game versions appeared in the same Quarterback Club series of games by [[Acclaim Entertainment]].  The Quarterback Challenge mode appeared in the first and last versions of the game series.  The first was in the original Quarterback Club game released in 1994 on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] and [[Sega Genesis]].  The second and final appearance of the challenge was in NFL QB Club 2002, published in 2001 for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]].  The first version was a sprite-based 2D game, while the later version was fully 3D.  Both of these games and all games in this series were developed by [[Iguana Entertainment]] in Austin, Texas. The 1994 SNES/Genesis version was produced by Russell Byrd.  The 2001 PS2/GameCube version was produced by Charles Normann.

==Discontinued==
On November 2007 NFL cancelled Quarterback Challenge. Cayman Islands Tourism confirmed on March 8, 2008 that NFL officially discontinued the competition indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caymanislands.ky/tour_guide/news_list_pub.aspx?newsid=2F4E94F1-E70C-432B-962A-BD48946DF0A1 NFL discontinues Quarterback Challenge]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1413">'''Neo-[[Benshi]]''' is the practice of producing live alternate voice-overs for movies.

The art form’s acknowledged starting point is in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and other East Asian nations during the silent film era. [[Benshi]] is a Japanese word referring to the oral "interpreter" who performed a live narrative accompaniment to silent movies, in lieu of showing intertitles with dialogue, etc. In Korean the practice is known as pyônsa. Currently, it is finding a resurgence among experimental poets in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles.

==Movietelling==
Movietelling is a reinstatement, or retelling, of the film narrator practice(s). Long time practitioner and one of the foremost scholars on the subject of live film narration, Walter Lew, coined this phrase with the intention of reviving and revamping what he considers to have been an international practice, finding its roots throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States. In January 2008, Walter Lew, along with several poets and video artists, began shadoWord productions, an organization dedicated to the practice, as well as the evolution, of Movietelling.

{{History of North Carolina}}
{{Confederate states in the American Civil War}}

[[North Carolina]] had joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] with some reluctance, mainly because neighbouring [[Virginia]] had done so, and it remained a divided state throughout the war, with the western mountain people retaining much Union sentiment. Yet it contributed more troops to the Confederacy than any other state (though it also raised Union regiments), and channelled many vital supplies through the major port of [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], in defiance of the [[Union blockade]].

Fighting occurred sporadically in the state from September 1861, when Union [[Major General]] [[Ambrose Burnside]] set about capturing key ports and cities, notably [[Battle of Roanoke Island|Roanoke Island]] and [[Battle of New Bern|New Bern]]. In 1864, the Confederates assumed the offensive, temporarily reconquering [[Battle_of_Plymouth_(1864)|Plymouth]], while the Union army launched several attempts to seize [[Fort Fisher]]. Troops from North Carolina played a major role in dozens of battles, including [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], where [[Tar Heels]] were prominent in [[Pickett's Charge]]. One of the last remaining major [[Confederate States Army|Confederate armies]], under [[Joseph E. Johnston]], surrendered near [[Bennett Place]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]], who spared North Carolina the destruction he had inflicted on her southern neighbour.

==Origins==
[[File:Pictorial envelope showing North Carolina's Seal being held by the Devil.jpg|thumb|[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] [[propaganda]] showing [[Seal of North Carolina|North Carolina's Seal]] being held by the Devil.]]
North Carolina was a picture of contrasts. In the Coastal Plain, it was a [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] state with a long history of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. However, there were no plantations and few slaves in the mountainous western part of the state. These differing perspectives show in the fraught [[United States presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]] and its aftermath. North Carolina's electoral votes went to Southern Democrat [[John C. Breckinridge]], an adamant supporter of slavery who hoped to extend the "peculiar institution" to the United States' western territories, rather than to the Constitutional Union candidate, [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], who carried much of the upper South.  Yet North Carolina (in marked contrast to most of the states that Breckinridge carried) was reluctant to secede from the Union when it became clear that Republican [[Abraham Lincoln]] had won the presidential election.  In fact, North Carolina did not [[secession|secede]] until May 20, 1861, after the fall of [[Fort Sumter]] and the secession of the Upper South's bellwether, [[Virginia]].

Some white North Carolinians, especially yeoman farmers who owned few or no slaves, felt ambivalently about the Confederacy; draft-dodging, desertion, and tax evasion were common during the Civil War years, especially in the Union-friendly western part of the state. North Carolinians, often in disagreement with the [[Aristocrat|aristocracy]] of eastern planters, raised about 25,000 troops from the western counties to fight and occupy territory in the mountain region of North Carolina and Tennessee, as well as the coastal plains of North Carolina, sometimes with troops from other states. Central and Eastern white North Carolinians were more enthusiastic about the Confederate cause; North Carolina contributed more troops to the Confederacy than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Inscoe and Gordon B. McKinney|title=The Heart of Confederate Appalachia: Western North Carolina in the Civil War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1ntU2N9ze0C&amp;pg=PA9|year=2003|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the policy of the Confederate populace was to [[embargo]] cotton shipments to Europe in hope of forcing them to recognize the Confederacy's independence to resume trade.  The plan failed, and furthermore the Union's [[Anaconda Plan|naval blockade of Southern ports]] drastically shrunk North Carolina's international commerce via shipping.  Internally, the Confederacy had far fewer railroads than the Union.  The breakdown of the Confederate transportation system took a heavy toll on North Carolina residents, as did the runaway inflation of the war years and food shortages in the cities.  In the spring of 1863, there were food riots in Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brooks D. Simpson|title=The Civil War: The Third Year Told by Those Who Lived It: (Library of America #234)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDy8zNh75V4C&amp;pg=PT193|year=2013|publisher=Library of America|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there was little military combat in the Western districts, the psychological tensions grew greater and greater. Historians John C. Inscoe and Gordon B. McKinney argue that in the western mountains:
:Differing ideologies turned into opposing loyalties, and those divisions eventually proved as disruptive as anything imposed by outside armies....As the mountains came to serve as refuges and hiding places for deserters, draft dodgers, escaped slaves, and escaped prisoners of war, the conflict became even more localized and internalized, and at the same time became far messier, less rational, and more mean-spirited, vindictive, and personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John C.

==Campaigns in North Carolina==
From September 1861 until July 1862, Union [[Major General]] [[Ambrose Burnside]], commander of the Department of North Carolina, formed the North Carolina Expeditionary Corps and set about capturing key ports and cities. His successes at [[Battle of Roanoke Island]] and [[Battle of New Bern]] helped cement Federal control of a part of coastal Carolina.

Fighting continued in North Carolina sporadically throughout the war. In 1864, the Confederates assumed the offensive in North Carolina, trying to recover some of the territory lost to Burnside's expedition. They [[Battle of New Bern (1864)|failed to retake New Bern]], but [[Battle_of_Plymouth_(1864)|reconquered Plymouth]] and held it for 6 months. Moreover, the Union army launched several attempts to seize [[Fort Fisher]]. In the war's closing days, a large Federal force under [[General Sherman]] marched into North Carolina, and in a series of movements that became known as the [[Carolinas Campaign]], occupied much of the state and defeated the Confederates in several key battles, including [[Battle of Averasborough|Averasborough]] and [[Battle of Bentonville|Bentonville]]. The surrender of General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s Confederate army at [[Bennett Place]] in April 1865 essentially ended the war in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]].

==Government and politics==
[[Henry Toole Clark]] served as the state's governor from July 1861 to September 1862. Clark founded a Confederate prison in North Carolina, set up European purchasing connections, and built a successful gunpowder mill. His successor [[Zebulon Vance]] further increased state assistance for the soldiers in the field. As the war went on, [[William Woods Holden]] became a quiet critic of the Confederate government, and a leader of the North Carolina peace movement. In 1864, he was the unsuccessful "peace candidate" against incumbent Governor Vance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

The '''''Portraits of Periodical Offering''''' ({{zh|s=职贡图|t=職貢圖|p=Zhígòngtú}}) was a series of official historical paintings (with illustration on each of the portrait) used in the [[China|Chinese]] dynasties. These paintings were official historical documents. The phrase roughly translated to "duty offering pictorial". Throughout Chinese history, kingdoms and tribes conquered by Chinese forces were required to send ambassadors to the imperial court of China periodically and pay tribute with valuable gifts (贡品 ''gongbin'').

Drawings and paintings with short descriptions were used to record the expression of these ambassadors and to a lesser extent to show the cultural aspects of these ethnic groups. These historical descriptions beside the portrait became the equivalent of documents of diplomatic relations with each country. The drawings were reproduced in [[woodblock printing]] after the 9th century and distributed among the bureaucracy in albums. The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Imperial Qing'' by Xie Sui (谢遂), completed in 1751, gives verbal descriptions of outlying tribes as far as the island of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Western Europe]].

The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang'' by the [[Emperor Yuan of Liang|Emperor Yuan of Liang Xiao Yi]], dated to the 6th century, is the earliest surviving of these specially significant paintings. The original of the work was lost, and the only surviving edition of this work was a copy from the 11th century, which is currently preserved at the [[National Museum of China]]. The work originally consisted of twenty five portraits of ambassadors from their respectively country, by the time of [[Song Dynasty]] some portraits were already missing, and the current version consist only about twelve of them.

The envoys from right to left: [[Uar]] ([[Hephthalites]]); [[Persia]]; [[Baekje]]; [[Qiuci]]; [[Wa (Japan)|Wo]] ([[Japan]]); [[Langkasuka]]; Dengzhi (邓至) ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) ethnic from [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture|Ngawa]]; Zhouguke (周古柯), Hebatan (呵跋檀), Humidan (胡密丹), Baiti (白題, of similar Hephthalite stocks), who dwell close to Hephthalite; Mo ([[Qiemo]]).

{{Wide image|Zhigongtu full.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang'' with descriptions on the back of each ambassador, 6th-century painting in the [[National Museum of China]].}}

Another notable painting of the series is the ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Tang'' by painter [[Yan Liben]], depicting foreign envoys with tribute bearers for the [[Tang Dynasty]] arriving at [[Chang'an]] in 631, during the reign of the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. The painting consists of 27 people from various states. The original work was lost, and the only surviving edition was a Song Dynasty copy, which is currently preserved at the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Envoys with Tribute Bearers|url=http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/b_01.htm|website=National Palace Museum|access-date=2015-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916193338/http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/b_01.htm|archive-date=2015-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Princeton University Art Museum''' ('''PUAM''') is the [[Princeton University]]'s gallery of art, located in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].  Founded in 1882, it now houses over 92,000 works of art that range from antiquity to the contemporary period.  The Princeton University Art Museum dedicates itself to supporting and enhancing the University's goals of teaching, research, and service in fields of art and culture, as well as to serving regional communities and visitors from around the world.  Its collections concentrate on the Mediterranean region, Western Europe, China, the United States, and Latin America.

The museum has a large collection of Greek and Roman antiquities, including ceramics, marbles, bronzes, and Roman mosaics from Princeton University's excavations in [[Antioch]]. Medieval Europe is represented by sculpture, metalwork, and stained glass. The collection of Western European paintings includes examples from the early [[Renaissance]] through the nineteenth century, and there is a growing collection of twentieth-century and contemporary art. Photographic holdings are a particular strength, numbering over 27,000 works from the invention of [[daguerreotype]] in 1839 to the present.  The museum is also noted for its Asian art gallery, which includes a wide collection of Chinese calligraphy, painting, ancient bronze works, jade carvings, as well as porcelain selections.  In addition to its collections, the museum mounts regular temporary exhibitions featuring works from its own holdings as well as loans made from public and private collections around the world.

Admission is free and the museum is open Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday, 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, Thursday, 10:00 am to 9:00 pm, and Sunday 12:00 to 5:00 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/fr/visit|website=Princeton University Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nassau Hall Museum (1886).png|thumb|left|The Faculty Room of [[Nassau Hall]] in 1886, when it served as home to the Art Museum]]

===Beginnings===

The first art work owned and displayed by the College of New Jersey (renamed Princeton University in 1896) was a full-length portrait of [[Jonathan Belcher]], the [[List of colonial governors of New Jersey|Governor of the province of New Jersey]] who had promoted the establishment of the College.  The portrait was a donation from Belcher himself, given shortly before the College moved in 1756 to the newly built [[Nassau Hall]].  It was joined by a portrait of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], who had issued the [[letters patent]] establishing the College.  The two portraits hung in the central prayer hall, and were displayed alongside various [[antiquities]] and objects of [[natural history]].  The two paintings were destroyed during the 1777 [[Battle of Princeton]] and further objects were lost in the 1802 Nassau Hall fire, but the College continued its commitment to collecting and teaching from works of art and historical note.{{sfn|Steward|p. ix}}

===Establishment===

The creation of the Art Museum in a more formal sense took place under the leadership of [[James McCosh]], who served as president of the College of New Jersey from 1868-1888.  The Scottish McCosh brought with him from Europe new progressive academic disciplines, including the history of art.  By 1882, McCosh charged [[William Cowper Prime]], a Princeton alumnus and founding trustee of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and [[George B. McClellan]], the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] general and then [[Governor of New Jersey]], with creating a curriculum in the subject.  They argued: "The foundation of any system of education in Historic Art must obviously be in object study. A museum of art objects is so necessary to the system that without it we are of [the] opinion it would be of small utility to introduce the proposed department.” The intention was to go beyond the fields of art and classics to include, “many other branches of the collegiate course.” They anticipated, “large future growth,” as the College could “look with confidence to her sons, in all parts of the world,” for future donations.{{sfn|Steward|p. ix}}

====Allan Marquand (1882-1922)====

The museum, and what is now the Department of Art and Archaeology, were formally created in 1882, with [[Allan Marquand]], of the Princeton Class of 1874, serving as the inaugural lecturer in the new department and director of the museum, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1922.  Marquand was previously instructor in Latin and logic at the College and was the son of [[Henry Gurdon Marquand]], a major benefactor of the College and one of the founders of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  The collections of the museum were initially held in Nassau Hall, along with the growing natural history collection of professor [[Arnold Henry Guyot]], part of which is still on display in Guyot Hall.  A new purpose-built fireproof [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] Museum was designed by [[A. Page Brown]] and completed in 1890 on the site of the current museum.

On completion of the building the museum received the Trumball-Prime collection of pottery and porcelain from William Prime and his wife.  Early additions included the purchase of a large collection of Cypriot pottery from the Metropolitan Museum in 1890, and purchases of [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]], Roman, and South Italian pottery.  Marquand established an endowment from his own resources to enable further purchases and it was significantly augmented by a donation from [[Edward Harkness]].{{sfn|Steward|p. x}}

===Growth===

====Frank Jewett Mather Jr. (1922-1946)====

[[File:1896, Degas, Bather (Standing Female Nude).jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Degas]], ''Bather (Standing Female Nude)'', 1917, Gift of Frank Jewett Mather Jr.]]

[[Frank Jewett Mather]] joined the faculty in 1910 and succeeded Marquand as museum director in 1922.  He was a collector of Medieval and Renaissance art but also led the university to large holdings of paintings and [[Printmaking|prints]], including the 1933 bequest of several thousand objects by [[Junius Spencer Morgan II]], of the Princeton Class of 1888.  In 1923, the first of many expansions of the Art Museum was completed with the addition of the [[Venetian Gothic]] McCormick Hall, designed by [[Ralph Adams Cram]] and donated by the family of [[Cyrus McCormick, Jr.]], Class of 1879 and [[Harold Fowler McCormick]], Class of 1895.  The new building enabled the older structure to be devoted solely to the museum, and led to the creation of a hall of casts on the ground floor.

As Marquand had before him, Mather augmented the museum's collections through the use of his personal fortune, with contributions ranging from [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] and [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] antiquities, to [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and what became one of the finest collections of [[Visual art of the United States|American drawings]] in the country.  Major gifts during the 1930s included a collection of more than 40 Italian paintings from Henry White Cannon, Jr., of the Class of 1910, and more than 500 [[snuff bottle]]s, still one of the finest such collections in the country, from Colonel James A. Blair, Class of 1903.  The decade also saw significant collections of [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] art added to support the courses of George Rowley, the first in those fields in an American university.  The [[World War II]] years ushered in the first classes in American art.

Notable exhibitions during Mather's tenure included one of works by [[Paul Cézanne]], borrowed from [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Philips]], and one of highlights from the [[Museum of Modern Art]].  Before his retirement in 1946, he oversaw a massive influx of [[Antioch mosaics]] from the [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological digs]] at [[Antioch-on-the-Orontes]] in which the University had played a leading part.  Some of the mosaics can be found today not only in the museum but also in various places in [[Firestone Library]].  He also welcomed the collection of [[Dan Fellows Platt]], a massive assortment of fine objects which arrived by van during the war.{{sfn|Steward|p. x-xii}}

[[File:Alfred Stieglitz (American - The Steerage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Stieglitz]], ''[[The Steerage]]'', 1907, the first photo added to the Museum's collection, gift of Frank Jewett Mather Jr.]]

====Ernest DeWald (1946-1960)====

Mather was succeeded by Ernest DeWald, a graduate school alumnus of the Class of 1946, one of the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|Monuments Men]] who had been charged with protecting the cultural heritage of Europe during the war.  A large number of Princetonians, both alumni and faculty, served with the Monuments program, leading the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]] to loan the museum ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' by [[Johannes Vermeer]] as a sign of gratitude.  DeWald was noted for his [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] work, personally cleaning paintings in his office on the top floor the museum.  For the University's bicentennial in 1946, he refurbished the galleries, including displaying a new collection of [[Hanging scroll|Chinese scrolls]] donated by Dr. Dubois Schanck Morris, Class of 1893.  Under DeWald's tenure, the museum's collection of Asian art greatly increased, aided by the guidance of Professor Wen C. Fong, Class of 1951, who would go on to be the founding director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Asian department.  In 1949, [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s 1907 ''[[The Steerage]]'' was the first of the museum's now considerable collection of photographs.{{sfn|Steward|p. xii-xiii}}

[[File:Princeton University blob.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henry Moore]], ''[[Oval with Points]]'', 1969-1970, part of the [[Putnam Collection of Sculpture, Princeton University|Putnam Collection]], often called "[[Richard Nixon|Nixon's]] Nose" by students&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rhinehart|first1=Raymond|title=Princeton University: The Campus Guide|date=2000|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1568982090|page=10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jw16hrKZffAC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=%22Nixon's+Nose%22+%22Oval+with+Points%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sluls566VS&amp;sig=0A2Owe-RYS7S2Qr4msUGlnJPPME&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwCWoVChMI89zfmInvxgIVgQg-Ch0aDgR6#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nixon's%20Nose%22%20%22Oval%20with%20Points%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

====Patrick Joseph Kelleher (1960-1973)====

Patrick Joseph Kelleher, Class of 1947 and another Monuments Man, succeeded DeWald as director in 1960.  He spearheaded the construction of a new home for the museum, made possible by the University's landmark $53 million [[Fundraising|capital campaign]].  In 1962 the collections were removed to enable the demolition of the A. Page Brown building and the northern wing of the Ralph Adams Cram structure to make way for the current, Steinmann and Cain designed, [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] building, completed in 1966.

Perhaps the most visible art on the campus is the [[Putnam Collection of Sculpture, Princeton University|Putnam Collection of Sculpture]].  The collection is the result of an anonymous million dollar 1968 donation in honor of Lieutenant John B. Putnam Jr.,  of the Princeton Class of 1945, who lost his life in a plane crash during World War II.  The collection was assembled in 1969 and 1970 by a committee led by Kelleher and including [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.]] and [[Thomas Hoving]].  It contains works by seventeen major twentieth century sculptors, including [[Alexander Calder]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Louise Nevelson]], [[Isamu Noguchi]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], and [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maynard|first1=William Barksdale|title=Princeton: America's Campus|date=2012|publisher=Penn State University Press|isbn=978-0271050867|pages=193–95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TGnOZrXjyzMC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=Putnam+collection+Princeton&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBGoVChMI0-Xr5eruxgIVgoI-Ch0KAAkt#v=onepage&amp;q=Putnam%20collection%20Princeton&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelleher's directorship also saw an increasing focus on photography as an important element of the museum's collections.  David Hunter McAlpin, Class of 1920, gave a major collection of photographs to the museum in 1971 as well as endowing a fund for further purchases and a professorship, the first endowed chair in the history of photography in the country.  That professorship was occupied by [[Peter Bunnell]], who would go on to succeed Kelleher as director in 1973.{{sfn|Steward|p. xiii-xiv}}



===Further expansion===
Peter Bunnell served as director until 1978, training a generation of leading scholars and curators of photography, and giving Princeton a preeminent place in the field with a collection in excess of 27,000 photographs, and significant archives of photographers including [[Clarence Hudson White]], [[Minor White]], and [[Ruth Bernhard]].  In 1980, Allen Rosenbaum became director, focusing on expanding the museums collection of [[Old Master]]s, notably [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] paintings in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] tradition.  In 1989, Rosenbaum oversaw another expansion of the museum's physical plant, the {{convert|27000|sqft}} [[Mitchell Wolfson, Jr.]], Class of 1963, Wing.  The new wing, designed by Mitchell/Giurgola, provided additional exhibition space, a conservation studio, as well as seminar and study-storage rooms for all areas of the museum's collection.

Under Susan M. Taylor's directorship in the first decade of the 21st century, the museum established its first endowed curatorships.  The current director, James Steward, has leadership over a collection of more than 92,000 objects, supplemented by notable collections on long-term loan, including the [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] works of the [[Henry Pearlman|Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation]], [[modern art]] from the [[Ileana Sonnabend|Sonnabend Collection]], and perhaps the finest collection of paintings by [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], on loan from Herbert Schorr, Graduate School Class of 1963, and his wife, Lenore.{{sfn|Steward|p. xv-xvii}}

In 2015 the museum was listed by [[Fodor's]] on its list of the top 15 best museums in the United States that is located in a small-town (Princeton, New Jersey).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=15 Best Small-Town Museums in the U.S.|url=http://www.fodors.com/news/photos/15-best-small-town-museums-in-the-us#!4-princeton-university-art-museum|website=Fodor's Travel|date=March 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==

===African art===

[[File:Ethiopian, Illuminated Manuscript, 18th century.jpg|thumb|[[Ethiopian]], ''[[Illuminated Manuscript]]'', 18th century{{sfn|Steward|p. 169}}]]
The collection of [[African art]] is designed to reveal the immense diversity of artistic work across the continent.  Objects are on display from west, central, and South Africa, ranging from royal regalia and objects of prestige, to sculptures marking rites of passage, to those intended to facilitate interaction with spiritual entities.

The first bequest to the Museum of African art was made in 1953 by Mrs. Donald B. Doyle, in honor of her husband.  That collection was accumulated before 1923 in what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and includes a distinctively shaped [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]] box and a rare double caryatid headrest from the [[Chokwe people]].  More recent gifts have been made by Perry E.H. Smith, including a Chokwe chair, and by H. Kelly Rollings, among whose gifts is an emblem of the Leopard Society, a notable example of an accumulative object from the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]] region.  A 1998 bequest of John B. Elliot includes many objects of daily use and adornment, as well as [[Akan people|Akan]] gold pieces, from a linguist's staff to a chief's bracelet.  In 2003, a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] stool was acquired, considered a sculptural masterpiece that served as the focus of devotion to the god [[Eshu|Esu]].

The African art collection is small in comparison to others in the museum, though it is an area of growing interest.{{sfn|Steward|p. 147}}

===American art===

[[File:Winslow Homer - At the Window - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Winslow Homer]], ''At the Window'', 1872{{sfn|Steward|p. 248}}]]
The University received its first pieces of American art in the 1750s, but only started collecting in earnest under the directorship of Frank Jewett Mather Jr. (1922-1946).  Few museums accorded significance to American art at the time, allowing Princeton to amass a collection that is among the finest of any academic museum.  The collection is particularly strong in painting and sculpture, greatly aided by the large number of portraits of figures affiliated with the University.  The museum is strong in the area of landscape painting, especially from the [[Hudson River School]].

The [[Elias Boudinot|Boudinot Collection]] of primarily 18th century fine and decorative art is on display at the nearby [[Morven (Princeton, New Jersey)|Morven Museum and Garden]], whose original owners, the [[Richard Stockton (Continental Congressman)|Stockton family]], were relatives of the Boudinots.  Alumnus Edward Duff Balken's donation of [[Folk art]] led to a substantial collection in that area.  New acquisitions, enabled by a dedicated fund, are focused on areas where the collection is weak, notably [[still life]] and [[Genre art|genre painting]].{{sfn|Steward|p. 225}}

===Ancient, Byzantine, and Islamic art===

[[File:Roman, Mosaic pavement head of Medusa, late 2nd century A.D.jpg|thumb|Roman, Antioch, mosaic pavement, ''head of Medusa'', late 2nd century A.D.]]

Ancient art has played a central role in the museum's collection since its beginning.  The first major addition to the collection included many [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] vases, as well as those from [[Art of ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Greek art|Greece]], and [[Roman art|Rome]].  There are now more than 5,000 objects in the collection, documenting the early civilizations of [[Mesopotamia]], Iran, [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and the [[Levant]].  The great diversity of artifacts also covers the various eras of ancient Egypt, from pottery to stone [[relief]]s, amulets, wall paintings, bronze statuettes, and mummies.  The Greek collection includes significant works of both [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] and [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] pottery, including the vase used to identify the [[Princeton Painter]].  It spans the broad range of artistic work, from [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] bronze statuettes to [[terracotta]] figurines, jewelry to funerary reliefs, pottery from [[Rhodes]], [[Cyprus]], and [[Corinth]].

Ancient Italy is in particular well represented in the collection, from the Etruscan vases, metalwork, and sculptures to a great breadth of Roman antiquities.  The Roman collection includes portraits, sculptures, [[sarcophagi]], carved bone, coins, statuettes, and a spectacular silver-gilt wine cup.  The University's heritage of archaeological work in [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman Syria]] has left a legacy of basalt sculptures from [[Hauran]], funerary reliefs from [[Palmyra]], and a renowned collection of [[Antioch mosaics]].

Byzantine and Islamic art are an equally esteemed focus of the collection, with icons and jewelry from [[Constantinople]] sharing a gallery with pottery, metalwork, and glazed tiles from Egypt, Syria, and Iran.

In addition to works on display in the museum, a study gallery with hundreds of additional works is open to students and visitors.{{sfn|Steward|p. 61}}

===Pre-Columbian art===
[[File:God L with the Hero Twins.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|late Classic]], [[Ancient Maya art|Maya]] ('Codex' style), ''[[The Princeton Vase]]'', A.D. 670–750]]
The collection of [[Pre-Columbian art|ancient American art]] includes objects covering five thousand years of history, from the Arctic to Chile.  The collection's primary focus is on small, portable works of art, typically ceramic or stone. Of particular note are the more than twenty prized polychrome ceramic works, the Classic Mayan [[Princeton Vase]], and over thirty ceramic figurines, from the lowland [[Ancient Maya art|Maya]] region.  The collection of [[Olmec]] objects comprises smaller jade, [[Serpentinite|serpentine]], and ceramic works.  Of the collection's works from [[South America]], the most notable are those from the [[Moche culture|Mochica culture]], which flourished in Peru between 200 B.C. and A.D. 700.  The museum's holdings in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art include important collections of Arctic [[Walrus ivory|Walrus carvings]], art of the [[Tlingit]] people, and a growing representation from the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippi Valley]] and the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]].

The collection of Pre-Columbian works began in the 19th century through the efforts of the Reverend [[Sheldon Jackson]], an 1855 graduate of the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]].  He donated a collection of Native American ethnographic objects to the Seminary, which transferred them to the University's E. M. Museum of Geology and Archaeology, then in 1909 to the Guyot Hall Museum, which, after its closure in 2000, gave them to the Art Museum.  As with the art of Africa and [[Oceania]], Indigenous American art was not a focus of the museum's historic collecting.  Nonetheless, objects were steadily donated during the early decades of the museum, including in the Trumbull-Prime Collection and the donations of Frank Jewett Mather Jr.  The collection of ancient American art received its proper attention following the 1967 appointment of Gillett G. Griffin as faculty curator, a position held by him until 2004.  The current collection is largely the result of his efforts, both through his own collections and his influence on donors.{{sfn|Steward|p. 107}}

===Asian art===

[[File:Scroll for Zhang Datong.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Huang Tingjian]], ''Scroll for Zhang Datong'', A.D. 1100,{{sfn|Steward|pp. 20-21}} a canonical work of [[Chinese calligraphy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Patton|first1=Andy J.|title=""A Painter's Brush That Also Makes Poems": Contemporary Painting After Northern Song Calligraphy"|date=2013|publisher=Electronic Thesis and Dissertation Repository, Paper 1302|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/etd/1302}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The collection of Asian art began with the foundation of the museum, with the primary focus for the early decades being [[Japanese art]].  Major collections of [[Chinese art]] were incorporated in the 1930s and 40s, including the snuff bottle collection of James A. Blair and paintings from Dubois Schanck Morris.  The late 1950s brought significant additions of [[Chinese ritual bronzes]] and archaeological artifacts from J. Lionberger Davis, Class of 1900, as well as acquisitions from the Chester Dale and Dolly Carter Collection.

The primary strengths of the museum's collection are in Chinese and Japanese art, including [[Neolithic]] jade and pottery, ritual bronze vesslels, lacquerware, ceramics, sculpture and metalware, and woodblock prints.  The museum's collection of calligraphy and painting is among the finest outside of Asia, including rare masterpieces from the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan dynasties]] such as [[Huang Tingjian]]'s ''Scroll for Zhang Datong''.  The collection also has significant holdings in [[Korean art]], including a growing collection of artifacts ranging from the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period to the [[Joseon dynasty]].  The art of [[Indian art|India]], [[Gandhara]], Southeast Asia, and Central Asia are also represented, with the influence of Islam and Hinduism on the artistic traditions of the subcontinent represented through sculpture, statuettes, and painted miniatures.{{sfn|Steward|p.3}}

The Campus Collections comprise the multitude of paintings, sculptures, memorials, and monuments significant to the University's history and traditions.  Central to the collection are the [[Princeton Portraits]], numbering more than 600 paintings and sculptures which depict figures prominent in the history of the university.  The portraits span the breadth of American history, including the landmark portrait, ''George Washington at the Battle of Princeton'', by [[Charles Willson Peale]].  Washington himself provided the funds for the work.  Another highlight is the series of paintings by renowned sculpture and [[natural history]] artist [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] which depict dinosaurs and other prehistoric [[fauna]].  The series was commissioned by Princeton President [[James McCosh]] in 1876 as a progressive response to [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories.

The collection is also home to the celebrated [[Putnam Collection of Sculpture, Princeton University|Putnam Collection]], which comprises 22 works by master artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.  The collection was the result of an anonymous donation in honor of a Princeton alumnus who died in [[World War II]].  It is commonly regarded as one of the greatest collections of public art, providing a ''plein-air'' lesson in art history.

===European art===

[[File:The Mocking of Christ (van Dyck).jpg|thumb|[[Anthony van Dyck]], ''The Mocking of Christ'', 1628-30{{sfn|Steward|pp. 196-7}}]]

The collection of [[European art]] covers nearly nine hundred years, from the twelfth century to the 20th.  The strengths of the museum's holdings within this broad spectrum often reflect the Department of Art and Archaeology's curriculum, though with many unexpected treasures, due to the interests of donors.{{sfn|Steward|p. 173}}

The collection of [[medieval art]] is primarily the result of museum purchases, demonstrating the techniques and materials of artists, as well as the secular and spiritual uses of their work.  Among the collection of stained glass is a window from [[Chartres Cathedral]],&lt;ref name=European&gt;{{cite web|title=European Art|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/599/view|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the collection of medieval sculpture includes a ''[[gisant]]'' of a Spanish knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gisant: knight in armor|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/objects/27222|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other strengths are [[polychrome sculpture]] from Spain and Germany; French, German, and Italian metalwork; and [[Vitreous enamel|enamels]] and [[Ivory carving|ivories]] from France.

Notable in the early modern collection are the rare thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Italian gold-ground paintings from [[Siena]] including works by [[Fra Angelico]], [[Francesco Traini]], and [[Guido da Siena]].  The museum is home to an unusual group of Dutch [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] paintings from around 1600, including works by [[Hendrik Goltzius]] and [[Abraham Bloemaert]], the richest of its kind in an American museum. [[Baroque art]] is represented by [[Pietro da Cortona]] and [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]].  Notable [[rococo]] masters include [[Jean-Siméon Chardin]] and [[François Boucher]]. [[Age of Enlightenment]] paintings include works by [[Angelica Kauffman]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and the studio of [[Jacques-Louis David]].&lt;ref name=European/&gt;

The nineteenth-century collection consists of works from the [[Age of Revolution]] and [[Industrial Age]] which trace academic traditions and preparatory processes.  Themes represented include the rise of [[Landscape painting]], the human figure, the collecting of small sculpture, and the successive cultural and stylistic waves—[[Revivalism (architecture)|revival styles]], [[Orientalism]], [[Impressionism]], and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]].{{sfn|Steward|p. 173}}  Among the major artists represented are [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Claude Monet]], and [[Édouard Manet]].&lt;ref name=European/&gt;

Early-twentieth-century modernist movements are represented by works by [[Odilon Redon]], [[Gabriele Münter]], and Russian master [[Ilya Repin]], whose paintings are rare outside his homeland.  The museum continues to expand its collection of twentieth-century art, allowing visitors and students to assess the European contribution to [[Modernism]].{{sfn|Steward|p. 173}}

The [[Henry Pearlman|Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation]] has placed its magnificent collection of [[Post-Impressionist]] art on loan to the museum, including masterpieces by [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Chaim Soutine]].&lt;ref name=European/&gt;

The Department of Modern and Contemporary Art encompasses works created throughout the world between 1870 and the present, including painting, sculpture, video, and performance.  The systematic collection of modern works began in the late 1940s, with many key pieces received as alumni gifts or bequests.  The collection includes an important group of late landscapes by [[Claude Monet]] as well as an enigmatic painting by Édouard Manet, found in his studio after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manet|first1=Édouard|last2=Cachin|first2=Françoise|last3=Moffett|first3=Charles S.|last4=Bareau|first4=Juliet Wilson|author4-link=Juliet Wilson-Bareau|title=Manet, 1832-1883|date=1983|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York City|isbn=978-0870993596|pages=93–95|url={{Google books|sjSya-h9TYQC|title=Manet, 1832-1883|page=94|plainurl=yes}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twentieth-century [[modernism]] is represented by a small but stellar group of works by artists including [[Odilon Redon]], [[Vasily Kandinsky]], [[Gabriele Münter]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Yves Tanguy]], and [[Jean Arp]].  A rare late work by [[Ilya Repin]] is among his most important works outside his native Russia.

One of most important works in the museum's [[Post-war|postwar]] collection is [[Willem de Kooning]]'s ''Black Friday'', from his breakthrough exhibition in 1948.  Other artists represented in the strong collection of postwar art include [[Romare Bearden]], [[Lee Bontecou]], [[Dan Flavin]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Sol LeWitt]], [[Morris Louis]], [[Ad Reinhardt]], [[Martha Rosler]], [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Frank Stella]], and [[Hannah Wilke]], among others.  The museum's holding in [[Pop art]] are particularly strong, including works by [[George Segal]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. The museum renewed its commitment to contemporary art in 2008, with priority given to works that make significant contributions to the field and exemplify the pressing cultural, social, and philosophical issues of their day.  Recent acquisitions include artwork by [[Doug Aitken]], [[Allora &amp; Calzadilla|Jennifer Allora &amp; Guillermo Calzadilla]], [[Polly Apfelbaum]], [[Sanford Biggers]], [[Ellen Gallagher]], [[Wade Guyton]], [[Matthew Day Jackson]], [[Wangechi Mutu]], and [[Javier Téllez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modern and Contemporary Art|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/2712/view|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===

[[File:Dumbarton Presbytery.jpg|thumb|[[Hill &amp; Adamson|David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson]], ''Dumbarton Presbytery'', 1845{{sfn|Steward|p. 366}}]]

Princeton's photography collection is one of the leading museum collections in the United States.  The start of the collection was the 1949 gift by retired director Frank Jewett Mather Jr. of [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s landmark image ''[[The Steerage]]''.  The decisive moment for the medium at Princeton came in 1971 when [[David Hunter McAlpin]], Class of 1920, made a donation of his collection of 457 prints.  McAlpin was a friend and patron to two generations of American photographers, donating significant representations of the work of Stieglitz, [[Paul Strand]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Ansel Adams]], [[Wynn Bullock]], [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Edward Weston]], and [[Eliot Porter]], among others.  McAlpin also established a fund which has enabled, over time, the purchase of some 400 photographs, including work by [[Hill &amp; Adamson]], [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and [[William Henry Fox Talbot]].&lt;ref name=Photography&gt;{{cite web|title=Photography|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/600/view|website=Princeton University Art Museum|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Steward|p. 363}}

In 1972, Peter C. Bunnell, later museum director, was hired as the David H. McAlpin Professor of the History of Photography and Modern Art, making Princeton the first American university, and one of only a few worldwide, where photography was taught within the art history curriculum.  In his nearly thirty years at Princeton, he went on to build one of the foremost graduate programs in the field and to build one of the most notable teaching collections of historical photographs.  The construction of the McAlpin Study Center during the expansion of the museum in 1989 created a space for seminars to be taught using original works from the collection.

The collection includes work covering all major movements and historical trends.  Particular strengths include nineteenth-century British photography, French photographs of the 1850s-1870s, and Japanese and American postwar photography.  The museum has major holdings in [[Pictorialism]], anchored by the [[Clarence H. White]] collection and the archives of his eponymous school of photography.  In 1976, [[Minor White]] bequeathed to the museum his negatives, library, correspondence, and close to 20,000 prints of his own and other artists.  Other archives held by the museum include those of [[Ruth Bernhard]] and [[William B. Dyer]].&lt;ref name=Photography/&gt;{{sfn|Steward|p. 363}}

===Prints and drawings===

[[File:Dancers-(1900)-Degas.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Degas]], ''Dancers'', 1900, [[pastel]] with charcoal on tracing paper mounted on cream [[wove paper]]{{sfn|Steward|pp. 344-5}}]]

The collection of Prints and Drawings includes 15,000 works on paper as well as a small number of [[Illuminated manuscript]]s, by artists from the fourteenth century to the present.  Notable areas of strength include [[Old master print|old master]] and nineteenth-century European [[Printmaking|prints]], Italian and Spanish [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] [[drawing]]s, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American and British drawings, [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], and [[sketchbook]]s, a selection of Indian and Persian [[Persian miniature|miniature painting]], and a large collection of modern and contemporary Latin American works on paper.

The print collection began with the large bequest of [[Junius Spencer Morgan II|Junius Spencer Morgan]], Class of 1888, in 1932, which included old master [[engraving]]s and [[etching]]s, primarily by the notable seventeenth-century printmakers [[Hendrik Goltzius]], [[Jacques Callot]], and [[Stefano della Bella]].  In 1938, another bequest, by [[Dan Fellows Platt]], Class of 1895, laid the foundation of the collection of drawings, with works from the sixteenth to early twentieth centuries, including notable groups by [[Guercino]], [[Salvator Rosa]], [[Giovanni Battista]] and [[Domenico Tiepolo]], and [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]].  Frank Jewett Mather Jr., the museum's second director, made numerous purchases in the 1940s, including Italian Renaissance drawings, works on paper by [[Samuel Palmer]], and watercolors by [[John Marin]], and [[Paul Cézanne]].  In 1945, Professor Clifton R. Hall bequeathed his collection of old master prints and American watercolors, including three masterpieces by [[Edward Hopper]].  Hall also established an endowment for the Department of Art and Archaeology specifically for the purchase of works on paper, which has enabled the purchase of an exceptional collection of sixteenth- through eighteenth-century Spanish drawings.

Professor Felton Gibbons, following Hall's example, endowed a fund for acquiring works on paper that has allowed gaps in the collection to be filled, including Northern and Central European drawings, and to add to other areas of significance, such as [[German Expressionism]].  The modern and contemporary holdings continue to grow, with an emphasis on artists such as [[Glenn Ligon]], [[Martin Puryear]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and [[Kiki Smith]], who are a vital part of the teaching curriculum of the University.{{sfn|Steward|p. 313}}

===Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection===

[[File:1904, Cézanne, Mont Sainte-Victoire.jpg|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''[[Mont Sainte-Victoire (Cézanne)|Mont Sainte-Victoire]]'', ca. 1904-06&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mont Sainte-Victoire (La Montagne Sainte-Victoire)|url=http://www.pearlmancollection.org/artwork/mont-sainte-victoire|publisher=Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Henry Pearlman]] started his collection with the 1945 purchase, for $825, of [[Chaim Soutine]]'s ''View of Céret'', seen in the window of the [[Parke-Bernet]] auction house while walking down [[Park Avenue]].  Pearlman had made his fortune through founding the Eastern Cold Storage Insulation Corporation in 1919 and knew little of Soutine or contemporary art at the time he started collecting.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wullschlager|first1=Jackie|title=Cézanne and modern masterpieces from the Pearlman Collection|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/cd34c646-a877-11e3-b50f-00144feab7de.html#slide0|newspaper=Financial Times|date=March 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He would go on to amass more than fifty masterworks of late 19th- to mid-20th-century [[avant-garde]] European art, one of the most distinguished private collections of [[modern art]] in the United States.  Among the most notable works are [[Paul Cézanne]]'s ''[[Mont Sainte-Victoire (Cézanne)|Mont Sainte-Victoire]]'', [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s ''Tarascon Stagecoach'', and [[Amedeo Modigliani]]'s portrait of ''[[Jean Cocteau]]''.&lt;ref name=Yale&gt;{{cite web|last1=DeLue|first1=Rachael Z.|title=Cézanne and the Modern: Masterpieces of European Art from the Pearlman Collection|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/book.asp?isbn=9780300174403|website=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heart of the collection is the finest and best preserved collection of [[watercolors]] by Cézanne in the world, sixteen works including ''Three Pears'', which was fought over by [[Edgar Degas]] and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], with Degas as the victor, at Cézanne's first sale.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;  In addition to the thirty-three works by Cézanne, including the watercolors, six oil paintings, six prints, and five drawings, the collection boasts seven paintings by Soutine, two each by Degas and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and one each by van Gogh, Renoir, [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Maurice Utrillo]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]].  Sculpture is represented through works by [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], and Amedeo Modigliani, who is also represented by two oil paintings and one drawing.  The one exception to the modern focus of the collection is an [[engraving]] by [[Albrecht Dürer]], ''Adam and Eve''.  Henry Pearlman himself is represented by a bust by [[Giacomo Manzu]] and a portrait by [[Oskar Kokoschka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists|url=http://www.pearlmancollection.org/artists|website=Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection has been much exhibited, including an international tour in 2014-16 which included the [[Ashmolean Museum]] at [[Oxford University]], where it was the museum's most popular exhibition on record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pleming|first1=Clemency|title=Last chance to see the Ashmolean’s most popular exhibition ever|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/arts-blog/last-chance-see-ashmolean%E2%80%99s-most-popular-exhibition-ever|website=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Musée Granet]] in [[Aix-en-Provence]], the [[High Museum of Art]] in [[Atlanta]], and the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]] in [[Canada]], ending at the Princeton University Art Museum,&lt;ref name=Yale/&gt; where the collection has been on long-term loan since 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry and Rose Pearlman Collection|url=http://artmuseum.princeton.edu/collections/pearlman|website=Princeton University Art Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tau-, Psi- and phi- type [[figurine]]s''' date back to 1450-1100 BC in [[Mycenaean Greece]]. They were typically made of [[terracotta]], although a group of [[ivory]] figurines has been found,&lt;ref name="Olsen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Barbara A|title=Women, Children and the Family in the Late Aegean Bronze Age: Differences in Minoan and Mycenaean Constructions of Gender|journal=World Archaeology|date=Feb 1998|volume=29|issue=3|pages=380–392|jstor=125037|doi=10.1080/00438243.1998.9980386}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were found in tombs, shrines and settlement areas. They got their names from their shape and a resemblance to the Greek letters of [[tau]] (τ), [[Psi (letter)|psi]] (ψ) and [[Phi (letter)|phi]] (Φ).

Their function/purpose is unknown, although it has been suggested that their purpose changed with the context in which they were found.  Possible uses were children's toys,&lt;ref name="Olsen"/&gt; votive figurines or grave offerings.

Some figurines appear to wear flattened headdresses, which suggests they may be goddesses.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web|last=British Museum|title=Three terracotta figurines|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/t/three_terracotta_figurines.aspx|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to distinguish between goddesses and worshippers.  It is likely that they were made by the same craftsmen who made Mycenaean vases, as the decoration techniques are similar.&lt;ref name="BM"/&gt;

'''Right to light''' is a form of [[easement]] in [[English law]] that gives a long-standing owner of a building with windows a right to maintain the level of [[illumination (lighting)|illumination]]. It is based on the '''Ancient Lights''' law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpkDAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Ancient+lights+%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=On ancient lights: and the evidence ... - Google Books |publisher=books.google.co.uk |accessdate=2010-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights are most usually acquired under the [[Prescription Act 1832]].

==Rights==
In effect, the owner of a building with windows that have received natural daylight for 20 years or more is entitled to forbid any construction or other obstruction that would deprive him or her of that illumination. Neighbours cannot build anything that would block the light without permission. The owner may build more or larger windows but cannot enlarge their new windows before the new period of 20 years has expired. It is also possible for a right to light to exist if granted expressly by [[deed]], or granted implicitly, for example under the rule in ''[[Wheeldon v Burrows|Wheeldon v. Burrows]]'' (1879).

Once a right to light exists, the owner of the right is entitled to "sufficient light according to the ordinary notions of mankind": ''[[Colls v. Home &amp; Colonial Stores Ltd]]'' (1904). Courts rely on [[expert witnesses]] to define this term. Since the 1920s, experts have used a method proposed by [[Percy Waldram]] to assist them with this. Waldram suggested that ordinary people require one [[foot-candle]] of [[illuminance]] (approximately ten [[lux]]) for reading and other work involving visual discrimination. This equates to a [[sky factor]] (similar to the [[daylight factor]]) of 0.2%. Today, Waldram's methods are increasingly subject to criticism&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=D62CF262C987771E9EA2A8DB73A9A48F?contentType=Article&amp;contentId=1603352 Was Waldram wrong?], P Defoe, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Pitts (2000), [http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&amp;hdAction=lnkpdf&amp;contentId=844738 The grumble point: is it still worth the candle?], ''[[Structural Survey]]'' '''18'''(5):255–8&lt;/ref&gt; and the future of expert evidence in rights to light cases is currently the subject of much debate within the surveying profession.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rics.org/Practiceareas/Property/Rightstolight/Rights%20to%20light%20the%20debate.html Rights to light surveying practice, the debate begins], Paul Chynoweth, ''[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]'', 21 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], owners of buildings could gain new rights by registering properties that had been destroyed in [[bombing]]s and the period was temporarily increased to 27 years.

In the centre of [[London]] near [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown]] and [[Covent Garden]], particularly in back alleyways, signs saying "Ancient Lights" can be seen marking individual windows. The design and construction of [[Broadcasting House]] in the early 1930s was also affected by locals declaring their right to ancient lights. It resulted in a unique asymmetrical sloped design that allowed for sunlight to pass over the building to the residential quarters eastwards, long since demolished and now home to the new Egton Wing.

Recent case law from 2010, relating to a commercial development in the centre of Leeds ([http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/2010/2245.html ''HKRUK II v Heaney'']) has significantly changed the perceptions of risk associated with right-to-light, particularly in the context of commercial schemes.  This case upheld an injunction against a commercial property. The result of this is that many developers are now looking to work with local authorities to try to use section 237 of the [[Town and Country Planning Act 1990]].  This potentially stops injunctions against schemes that have over-riding social or economic advantages to an area.

=== United States ===
Under [[United States tort law]], in ''[[Fontainebleau Hotel]] Corp. v. Forty-Five Twenty-Five, Inc.'' (1959) the Florida [[Appellate Court]] stated that the "ancient lights" doctrine had been unanimously repudiated in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/dgolash/fontainebleau%20v.%204525.htm FOUNTAINEBLEAU HOTEL CORP., a Florida corporation, and Charnofree Corporation, a Florida corporation, Appellants, v. FORTY-FIVE TWENTY-FIVE, INC., a Florida corporation, Appellee.] @ LexisNexis Academic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.uchicago.edu/~rmcnary/briefs/property/Fontainebleau/ Case @ University of Chicago] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421194453/http://home.uchicago.edu/~rmcnary/briefs/property/Fontainebleau/ |date=2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, voters in [[San Francisco]] passed Proposition K, which prevents construction of any building over 40 feet that casts a shadow on a public park, unless the Planning Commission decides the shadow is insignificant. This proposition causes problems for [[Oceanwide_Center,_San_Francisco|a proposed 34-story building south of Market Street]], which would cast a shadow on a public park ten blocks away, for one hour of the day in the fall, as well as St. Mary's Square, Justin Herman Plaza, and Union Square for significant parts of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dineen|first1=J.K.|title=Long shadows create political hurdle for S.F. skyscraper project|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Long-shadows-create-political-hurdle-for-S-F-7382467.php|accessdate=30 June 2017|publisher=SF Chronicle|date=April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] has similar laws against the casting of shadows on [[Boston Common]], the [[Public_Garden_(Boston)|Public Garden]], and other important public open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/actsResolves/1990/1990acts0362.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sarmatian Review''''' ({{ISSN|1059-5872}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/publicationdetails.aspx?publicationId=507781c2-6646-42f8-8eaa-54a05ca3e372 | title=The Sarmatian Review | publisher=[[CEEOL]] | accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[English language]] [[peer review]]ed [[academic journal]] on [[Slavistics]], which is the study of [[culture]], [[history]], and [[society|societies]] of [[Slavic nations]] (located in [[Central Europe|Central]], [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Southern Europe]]) published by the '''Polish Institute of Houston''' at [[Rice University]] three times a year in January, April, and September. Since 1992 an abbreviated web edition appears six to ten weeks after the print edition and is available freely from their website. The editor is [[Ewa Thompson]].

== History ==
It was founded in 1981 under the title of '''''Houston Sarmatian''''' under the auspices of the Houston Chapter of the [[Polish Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. In 1988 it was renamed the ''Sarmatian Review''. The Polish Institute of Houston was formed in 1999 as a nonprofit public foundation, a cultural and educational institution whose main goal has been to continue the publication of ''Sarmatian Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polishchurchhouston.com/en/organizations/45-POLISH_CULTURAL_AND_CIVIC_ORGANIZATIONS_IN_HOUSTON.html | title=Polish Cultural and Civic Organizations in Houston | publisher=Polish Church Houston | date=2013-01-24 | accessdate=August 6, 2015 | author=Kimmel, Marek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent of the publication: "The Sarmatian Review was conceived by a group of American Polish scholars who observed a dearth of scholarly journals that would allow the [[Polish-American]] points of view to be heard. Polish-Americans, and other Americans of Central European ancestry, will be able to speak for themselves in a scholarly publication that reflects Central European and Polish-American identity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ejournal.coalliance.org/fullrec.cfm?EJID=1850 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020124120044/http://ejournal.coalliance.org/fullrec.cfm?EJID=1850 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=January 24, 2002 | title=The Sarmatian Review | publisher=Electronic Journal Miner | accessdate=August 6, 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the publications comes from [[Sarmatia]], a semi-legendary name for the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a multi-cultural state that spanned most of Eastern Europe from 16th to 18th centuries.

== Content ==
It deals with a variety of subjects: country-related articles ([[Poland]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] being most prominent), the [[post-Soviet]] period, the [[United States|American]] and European [[ethnic]] issues and matters related [[mass media]], [[higher education]], [[literature]], [[government]], [[religion]] and [[politics]]. It contains articles, [[review]] and sometimes literature samples ([[poetry]]).

'''Sexual differentiation''' is the process of development of the differences between [[male]]s and [[female]]s from an undifferentiated [[zygote]]. As male and female individuals develop from zygotes into [[fetus]]es, into infants, children, adolescents, and eventually into adults, [[sex]] and [[gender]] differences at many levels develop: [[gene]]s, [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, [[hormone]]s, [[anatomy]], and [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].

[[Sex differences]] range greatly and include physiologically differentiating. Sex-dichotomous differences are developments which are wholly characteristic of one sex only. Examples of sex-dichotomous differences include aspects of the sex-specific genital organs such as [[ovary|ovaries]], a [[uterus]] or a phallic [[urethra]]. In contrast, [[sexual dimorphism|sex-dimorphic]] differences are matters of degree (e.g., size of [[Phallus#In physical anatomy|phallus]]). Some of these (e.g., [[height|stature]], behaviors) are mainly statistical, with much overlap between male and female populations.

Nevertheless, even the sex-dichotomous differences are not absolute in the human population, and there are individuals who are exceptions (e.g., XY males with a uterus; undeveloped testes), or [[XY gonadal dysgenesis|phenotypical females with an XY karyotype]] (undeveloped reproductive organs), or who exhibit biological and/or behavioral characteristics of both sexes.

Sex differences may be induced by specific [[genes]], by [[hormones]], by [[anatomy]], or by [[Social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]]. Some of the differences are entirely physical (e.g., presence of a uterus) and some differences are just as obviously purely a matter of social learning and custom (e.g., relative hair length). Many differences, though, such as [[gender identity]], appear to be influenced by both biological and social factors ([[nature versus nurture|"nature" and "nurture"]]).

The early stages of human differentiation appear to be quite similar to the same biological processes in other mammals and the interaction of genes, hormones and body structures is fairly well understood. In the first weeks of life, a [[fetus]] has no anatomic  or hormonal [[sex]], and only a [[karyotype]] distinguishes male from female. Specific genes induce [[gonad]]al differences, which produce hormonal differences, which cause anatomic differences, leading to psychological and behavioral differences, some of which are innate and some induced by the [[society|social environment]].

==Sex determination system==
{{main|Sex determination system}}

Humans, many mammals, insects and other animals have an [[XY sex-determination system]]. Humans have forty-six chromosomes, including two sex chromosomes, XX in females and [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] in males. The [[Y chromosome]] must carry at least one essential gene which determines [[testis|testicular]] formation (originally termed ''TDF''). A gene in the sex-determining region of the short arm of the Y, now referred to as ''[[SRY]]'', has been found to direct production of a protein, [[testis determining factor]], which binds to DNA, inducing differentiation of cells derived from the [[gonadal ridge|genital ridges]] into testes. In transgenic XX mice (and some human [[XX male syndrome|XX male]]s), ''SRY'' alone is sufficient to induce male differentiation.

==Humans==
{{main|Sexual differentiation in humans}}
{{Further |Defeminization}}
[[File:YChromShowingSRY2.png|thumb|200px|The Human Y Chromosome showing the SRY gene which codes for a protein regulating sexual differentiation.]]
Various processes are involved in the development of [[sex differences in humans]]. Sexual differentiation in humans includes development of different genitalia and the internal genital tracts, breasts, body hair, and plays a role in gender identification.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gfmer.ch/Books/Reproductive_health/Human_sexual_differentiation.html{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of sexual differences begins with the [[XY sex-determination system]] that is present in humans, and complex mechanisms are responsible for the development of the phenotypic differences between [[male]] and [[female]] [[human]]s from an undifferentiated [[zygote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01726695 |title=Determination of sex chromosomal constitution and chromosomal origin of drumsticks, drumstick-like structures, and other nuclear bodies in human blood cells at interphase by fluorescence in situ hybridization |year=1990 |last1=Mukherjee |first1=Asit B. |last2=Parsa |first2=Nasser Z. |journal=Chromosoma |volume=99 |issue=6 |pages=432–5 |pmid=2176962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical sexual development, and ambiguous genitalia, can be a result of genetic and hormonal factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16160410 |year=2005 |last1=Kučinskas |first1=Laimutis |last2=Just |first2=Walter |title=Human male sex determination and sexual differentiation: Pathways, molecular interactions and genetic disorders |volume=41 |issue=8 |pages=633–40 |journal=Medicina |url=http://medicina.kmu.lt/0508/0508-01e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differentiation of other parts of the body than the [[sex organ]] creates the [[secondary sex characteristic]]s. Sexual dimorphism of skeletal structure develops during childhood, and becomes more pronounced at adolescence.  Sexual orientation has been demonstrated to correlate with skeletal characters that become dimorphic during early childhood (such as arm length to stature ratio) but not with characters that become dimorphic during puberty—such as shoulder width.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2003.07.003 |ref=harv |title=Anthropometric analysis of homosexuals and heterosexuals: Implications for early hormone exposure |year=2004 |last1=Martin |first1=James T |last2=Nguyen |first2=Duc Huu |journal=Hormones and Behavior |volume=45 |pages=31–9 |pmid=14733889 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humans and other animals==

===Brain differentiation===
{{Main|Neuroscience of sex differences}}

In most animals, differences of exposure of a fetal or infant [[brain]] to sex hormones produce significant differences of brain structure and function which correlate with adult reproductive behavior.

Sex hormone levels in human male and female fetuses and infants also differ, and both [[androgen receptors]] and [[estrogen receptors]] have been identified in brains. Several sex-specific genes not dependent on sex steroids are expressed differently in male and female human brains. Structural sex differences begin to be recognizable by 2 years of age, and in adult men and women include size and shape of [[corpus callosum]] (larger in women) and [[Nerve fascicle|fasciculae]] connecting each hemisphere internally (larger in men), certain [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] nuclei, and the [[gonadotropin]] feedback response to [[estradiol]].{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The absence of the genes that generate male genitalia do not single-handedly lead to a female brain.  The male brain requires more hormones, such as testosterone, in order to properly differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siiteri|first=PK|author2=Wilson, JD |title=Testosterone formation and metabolism during male sexual differentiation in the human embryo.|journal=The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism|date=Jan 1974|volume=38|issue=1|pages=113–25|pmid=4809636|doi=10.1210/jcem-38-1-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; These hormones are released due to a gene expressed during embryonic development.

''Starch analysis'' or '''starch grain analysis''' is a technique that is useful in [[archaeology|archaeological]] research to determine plant taxa. In certain samples of food plants, spices, drugs and desiccated archaeological plant matter, the histological elements can survive and thus be identified but in other samples, like carbonized (burnt) or older materials this is extremely difficult. However starch grains are much more hardy. The technique relies on the fact that a researcher can analyze or microscopically observe starch grains found on artifacts or in soils. Starch grains, ubiquitous in plants, have individual characteristics and resistance to grinding and drying and even to light burning so they are often preserved when other plant remains are lost - thus providing an additional tool to understand the past use of plants.

==Usefulness==
Starch grain analysis is not a perfect science, however, plant starch grain analysis is a diagnostic feature of multiple applications according to the peculiarities and to the origin of the plant material.&lt;ref name="CortellaPochettino1994"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortella |first1=A. R. |last2=Pochettino |first2=M. L. |title=Starch grain analysis as a Microscopic Diagnostic Feature in the Identification of Plant Material |journal=Economic Botany |volume=48 |issue=2 |year=1994 |pages=171–181 |issn=0013-0001 |doi=10.1007/BF02908212}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The size, shape and structure of grains from plant species, varies little, which can lead to identification. Starch grains have been removed and identified from stone tools, ceramic sherds, organic materials, dental calculus, and sediments&lt;ref name="Cagnato"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clarissacagnato.weebly.com/starch-grain-analysis.html |title=Starch Grain Analysis - Paleoethnobotany |author=Clarissa Cagnato |date= |accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animal remains to determine diet and when humans began to exploit wild food varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Nature 430, 670-673 (5 August 2004) | doi:10.1038/nature02734; Received 4 May 2004; Accepted 4 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
In some cases the grains can become degraded. Factors such as heat and water absorption may affect the structure of the grains, making  identification more difficult. Even if the  remains are well preserved, water logging, dehydration, desiccation or damage from  fungi can destroy the starch. In some cases, even within the same species, starch grains can differ in shape and size and the size of the grain affects its survivability in the archaeological record (Haslam 2004).

== Biology of starch ==
{{see also|Starch#Energy store of plants}}
[[Starch]] is produced in plants as a form of energy storage through the process of [[photosynthesis]]. When the plant is in need of energy, the stored starch is converted back into [[glucose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|p=35,36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Starch grain identification ==
There are two basic methods for identifying starch: 
* Diagnostic tests of chemical and physical properties
* Optical properties of the granules.

{{see also|Microscopy}}
[[File:Stärkemehl 800 fach Polfilter.jpg|thumb|right|Starch, 800x magnified, under polarized light, showing characteristic [[extinction cross]]]]
Starch grains are typically microscopically identified with either optical or electron microscopy. Starch grains can become clearer if they are stained a darker color with [[Iodine]] Stains. Logol's Iodine is one, used for [[staining]] starch because iodine reagents easily bind to starch but less easily to other materials. Features that allow identification of starch grains include:  presence of hilum (core of the grain), lamellae (or growth layers), birefringence, and extinction cross (a cross shape, visible on grains under revolving polarized light) which are visible with a [[microscope]] and shape and size.&lt;ref name="Cagnato" /&gt;

===Low magnification===
Archaeological research focused on residue adhering to [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] start at lower magnifications, commonly using a [[stereoscope]]. Most data obtained at this stage is [[Qualitative data|qualitative]], an important first stage to fuller analysis. Magnifications of between x10 and x50 are sufficient to locate target residues, describe features and confirm internal structures of the identified [[Residue (chemistry)|residues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|p=47,48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High magnification===
Modern light, high powered [[microscope]]s have an internal light source, allowing illuminaton with both transmitted and reflected light. These microscopes can provide a magnification of up to x1000: good enough to provide clear images of starch [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] as small as a few micrometres in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|p=48,49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starch granules show different sizes. For example;
* Tapioca starch: 5-35&amp;nbsp;[[µm]]
* Potato starch: 15-100&amp;nbsp;µm
* Maize starch: 5-25&amp;nbsp;µm
* Rice starch: 3-8&amp;nbsp;µm
but all are generally under 100 micrometres in size, and are, therefore, best observed under compound microscopes equipped with various lighting conditions and magnifications from x200 to x800.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The starch grains are also compared to standard reference collections for comparison. 
Archaeologists and researchers can consider four issues in classification of the plant(s) and its use(s): 
* Determination of whether evidence for the utilization of plants is present
* Study of the assemblage variation
* Determination of the presence of particular plant species
* Assign percentages of starch granules within a sample to a particular [[taxon]], and present [[Numerical data|quantitative data]] regarding relative abundance within the sample. Identification of ancient starch is fairly easily for the first three levels of [[Taxonomy (biology)|classification]], whilst the fourth level requires continued improvement in the description, classification, and identification of individual starch granules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|pp=115–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Starch in sediments ==
Starch granules retrieved from [[sediment]]s are used to reconstruct the [[habitat]]s associated with human [[land use]]. Such studies address two areas of interest to the archaeologist:
* [[landscapes]]; specifically the reconstruction of historical [[plant communities]] at the widest scale of the environment
* specific contexts, such as [[Human settlement|settlements]] or activity areas; focusing on individual [[archaeological site]]s, or separate contexts within them, with the goal of identify specific human activities at a particular location.
The stages involved in the analysis of starch from sediments are; [[Core sample|sampling]], [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] of starch, [[Microscope slide#Mounting|slide mounting]] and viewing, and interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sampling===
Sampling a sediment core or stratigraphic profile to gather information about an environment requires a detailed understanding of the way the sediments were formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|pp=145–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extraction===
Most extraction techniques follow a general methodology of: 
* sample preparation (sieving, drying, or soaking)
* [[wikt:disaggregation|disaggregation]] and [[wikt:deflocculation|deflocculation]] to break up the elements of the sample into single particles
* removal of undesired particles (sands, silts, minerals, organics).
* chemicals preservation of the starch granules.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|pp=151–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slide mounting and viewing===
Starch granules are mounted onto a slide, using a variety of [[Mounting media#Mounting media|mounting medias]] including, but not limited, to water, glycerol, and glycerine jelly. It is important that the material is dried thoroughly before being mounted to ensure that no further degradation of the sample occurs. 
The slide is then viewed, as appropriate, for identification and counting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|pp=161–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interpretation===
After the starch granules have been examined, the findings are then recorded and interpreted with respect to the research questions that are being investigated.

== Starch on artifacts ==
Artifacts collect starch granules and protect them from decay due to [[microorganisms]], thus providing excellent conditions for long-term preservation. The analysis may focus on the function of the tool, to examine a broader range of human behaviour but starch analysis also allows insights into craft activities involving the preparation of adhesives, medicines, or other nonfood items.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|pp=185–189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modified starch ==
Starch can also be investigated when it is not in its raw form. For example, [[Modified starch]] is created when the morphological or physico-chemical structure of native starch is disrupted in some way, such as in [[food preparation]]. The most common way to modify starch is to apply heat. [[Earth oven|Cooking pits]], [[hearth#Archaeological features|hearths]], and ovens that may have come into contact with starchy material yield  modified starches which can provide other insights.

Modified starch is only likely to be preserved under specific conditions, such as [[arid|arid regions]] because of its susceptibility to organic decay. Studies of ancient modified starch aid understanding of ancient food technology, variations in cuisine among different [[social group]]s, as well as provide an understanding the function of ancient food-processing equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preserved forms of modified starch include:
* '''discrete desiccated macroremains''': coherent foods that are not attached to any other object and are among the most easily recognizable ancient starchy prepared foodstuffs. They can be either the intended final prepared food, like loaves of bread, or intermediate products of the food processing sequence, like starch-rich, chaffy lumps{{clarify|date=May 2011}}.
* '''attached desiccated residues''': collections of starchy foodstuffs adhered to a container or vessel. The ability to identify these residues is affected by the quantity and appearance of the residue, as well as the awareness of the excavators. Residues containing obvious plant tissue are most easily recognizable, while thin smears are not as easy to recognize.
* '''charred residues''': normally the result of accidental overcooking and can be preserved as discrete fragments or remain stuck to the cooking vessel. Due to their charred nature, these residues are very difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|'''Torrence'''|'''2006'''|pp=206–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Statuette of a Wolf''', from the 6th to 5th centuries BC, is a bronze cast figure discovered in [[Ayrum]], [[Armenia]]. It is included in the [[History Museum of Armenia]]'s collection under the number 2225-26.

== Description ==
Around the hole, there are considerate eyes, and a round [[snout]] linearlly decorated. The wolf's mouth is open, showing its enormous teeth. The animal has a tense posture, its front legs are stretched in front, and its back legs are slightly bent. The paws include claws. The tail is long, with a curled tip. The wolf and the dog are associated with the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://treasury.am/hy/%D5%A3%D5%A1%D5%B5%D5%AC%D5%AB-%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%B1%D5%A1%D5%B6%D5%AB%D5%AF-1|title=Statuette of a Wolf – Armenian Treasury|website=Armenian Treasury|language=hy-AM|accessdate=2017-02-01}} {{Dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Worship ==
Armenia's ancient belief of dogs was attributed to them being a guide for the dead souls towards the underworld and their ability to revive the dead. The statuette is, of course, for worship and portrays mythical creatures. [[Deity|Deities]] with the head of a dog, whose ancient Armenian [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] were linked with death and the beliefs of resurrection.&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;Հայացք բրոնզե դարից, album-catalog, Հայաստանի պատմության թանգարան, 2016, 160 էջ: A Glance from the Bronze Age. Yerevan, History Museum of Armenia, 2016, 160 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legend ==
From the ancient stories about the [[Aralez (mythology)|Aralezs]], with the addition of [[Movses Khorenatsi]], the legends about [[Ara the Beautiful]] and [[Semiramis]] were introduced. Accordingly, the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] Queen Semiramis, fascinated by the beauty of the [[Armenians|Armenian]] King Ara, was trying to send him gifts. Rejected, Semiramis decided to achieve her goal using a gun. During the battle, Ara the Beautiful is killed. Distraught, Semiramis gives Ara the Beautiful's body to the Aralezs to lick his wounds in an effort to revive him.&lt;ref name="sculpture"/&gt;

The '''Swiss Heritage Society''' (SHS) is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit organisation]] dedicated to the advancement of [[Switzerland]]’s [[architecture|architectural]] heritage. Its focus is on the preservation of important [[landmark]]s, the development of the structural environment, and the promotion of good architectural design.

The Swiss Heritage Society was founded in 1905, has about 17,000 members and publishes the magazine ''Heimatschutz/Sauvegarde'' quarterly.

The Swiss Heritage Society pursues its goals mainly with [[public relations]] activities, through publications, technical consulting in construction projects, advisory functions in planning committees, appraisals, legal action, and financial [[Grant (money)|grants]] for pioneering projects. The SHS commends exemplary achievements by awarding prizes ([[Wakker Prize]], Heimatschutz Prize, Schulthess Horticultural Prize). Together with [[Pro Natura (Switzerland)|Pro Natura]], the SHS has been supporting the annual fundraising drive with chocolate [[Thaler|talers]] (''Schoggitaler'') for over fifty years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2864">'''''The Saturday Book''''' was an annual [[miscellany]], published from 1941 to 1975, reaching 34 volumes. It was edited initially by [[Leonard Russell (journalist)|Leonard Russell]]  and from 1952 by [[John Hadfield]].  A final compilation, ''The Best of the Saturday Book'', was published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;John Hadfield (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qvg7AAAAIAAJ ''The Best of the Saturday Book''], Hutchinson {{ISBN|978-0-09145-990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher throughout was [[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson's]]. 

''The Saturday Book'' provided literary and artistic commentary about life in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[Second World War]] and the ensuing decades. It covered a range of arts, including [[ballet]] and music.  Many writers contributed poems as well as [[essay]]s.

The very first volume totaled 444 pages, but, with paper in short supply,  the length of the second was slashed to 274 pages. From the third to the 24th volumes the number fluctuated between 288 and 304 pages, but the remaining ten ran to no more than 256 pages each, with the last one dropping to 240 pages.  

In 2002 Nekta Publications published ''What's Where in The Saturday Books: A Comprehensive Guide and Index'' by Peter Rowland, 154 pages long, which  provides an index and guide to the whole series.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Rowland (2002) ''What's Where in The Saturday Books'', Nekta Publications (Limited Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors==
The many writers who contributed to the series included [[H. E. Bates]], [[John Betjeman]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Laurie Lee]], [[Philip Larkin]], [[John Masefield]], [[H. J. Massingham]], [[George Orwell]], [[J. B. Priestley]], [[L. T. C. Rolt]], [[Siegfried Sassoon]], [[Evelyn Waugh]] and [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. 

The series was profusely illustrated with photographs, woodcuts and line drawings, many specially commissioned. Artists included [[Edward Ardizzone]], [[Roland Emmett]], [[L. S. Lowry]], [[Lawrence Scarfe]] and [[Richard Chopping]]. Photographers included [[Bill Brandt]], [[Cecil Beaton]], [[Douglas Glass]] and [[Edwin Smith (photographer)|Edwin Smith]]. Wood engravers included [[Robert Gibbings]], [[George Maclay]] and [[Agnes Miller Parker]].

[[George Orwell]]'s essay "Benefit of Clergy", intended for the volume published in 1944, was suppressed on grounds of obscenity, but its title remains in the table of contents.&lt;ref&gt;George Orwell (1944) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080521092041/http://whitewolf.newcastle.edu.au/words/authors/O/OrwellGeorge/essay/CriticalEssays/salvadordali.html "Benefit Of Clergy: Some Notes On Salvador Dali"]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woodhenge, Wiltshire.JPG|250px|right|thumb|Reconstructed Woodhenge, facing northwards]]
Timber circles in the [[British Isles]] date to the late [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]]. The posts themselves have long since disappeared and the sites are identified from the circles of [[posthole]]s that they stood in. [[Aerial photography]] and [[archaeological geophysics|geophysical survey]] have led to the discovery of increasing numbers of the features. Often a [[postpipe]] survives in the posthole fill aiding diagnosis.

They are usually more than {{convert|20|m}}, and up to {{convert|60|m}}, in diameter and the posts that constituted them were generally more than {{convert|50|cm}} wide. Technically, they always consist of at least two concentric circles or ovals of timbers although there are variations on the rule such as the monuments of [[Seahenge]] and [[Arminghall]], both in [[East Anglia]] which are often described as being timber circles.

Wider gaps between the posts are thought to have served as entrance routes. The builders replaced the posts as they decomposed and in some cases [[stone circle]]s were adopted instead during later phases.

They appear either alone or in the context of other monuments, namely [[henge]]s, such as that at [[Woodhenge]] and [[henge enclosure]]s such as those at [[Durrington Walls]]. The only excavated examples of timber circles that stood alone from other features are Seahenge and [[Arminghall]] in [[Norfolk]] and the early phases of [[The Sanctuary]] in [[Wiltshire]].

They probably served [[ritual]] purposes. Animal bone and domestic waste found at many timber circle sites implies some form of temporary habitation and seasonal feasting. They were built on high ground and would have been very conspicuous. Isolated burials have been found at some sites but not enough to suggest a strong funerary purpose.

Timber circles have a long history among Native American societies; their use stretches back for thousands of years and continues into the present day. From the 3400 year old [[Archaic period (North America)|Archaic period]] [[Poverty Point]] site in [[Louisiana]] to 2000 year old [[Hopewell tradition]] circles found in [[Ohio]] to the [[Sun Dance]] performed in wooden pole "corrals" by the [[Dhegihan languages|Dhegihan-Siouan]] and [[Caddoan languages|Caddoan]] speaking peoples of the [[Great Plains]].&lt;ref name=PAUKETATCAHOKIA&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Timothy Pauketat| last=Timothy R.| first=Pauketat |title= Cahokia : Ancient Americas Great City on the Mississippi| publisher=[[Viking Press]]| year=2009|isbn=978-0-670-02090-4 |chapter= High Plains Drifting }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a timber circle witnessed by Europeans was recorded by watercolor artist [[John White (colonist and artist)|John White]] in July 1585 when he visited the [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] village of [[Secotan]] in [[North Carolina]]. White was the artist-illustrator and mapmaker for the [[Roanoke Colony]] expedition sent by [[Sir Walter Raleigh]] to begin the first attempts at [[British colonization of the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia= NCpedia| url= http://ncpedia.org/biography/governors/white| title=John White |author=  Daniels, Dennis F.|accessdate= 2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; White's works represent the sole-surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of the Americas as encountered by England's first colonizers on the Atlantic seaboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url= https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/sketching-the-earliest-views-of-the-new-world-92306407/ | title= Sketching the Earliest Views of the New World | journal= Smithsonian Magazine | author= Tucker, Abigal| date= December 2008| accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whites watercolor and the writings of the chronicler who accompanied him, [[Thomas Harriot]], describes a great religious festival, possibly the [[Green Corn ceremony]], with participants holding a ceremonial dance at a timber circle. The posts of the circle were carved with faces. Harriot noted that many of the participants had come from surrounding villages and that "''every man attyred in the most strange fashion they can devise havinge certayne marks on the backs to declare of what place they bee.''" and that "''Three of the fayrest Virgins''" danced around a central post at the center of the timber circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia= Encyclopedia Virginia | url= https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/slide_player?mets_filename=sld3762mets.xml | title= A Selection of John White's Watercolors : A festive dance | accessdate=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty Point===

{{main|Poverty Point}}
The oldest known timber circles in North American archaeology were found at Poverty Point in 2009 by archaeologists from the [[University of Louisiana at Monroe]] and [[Mississippi State University]], led by Poverty Point station archaeologist Dr. Diana Greenlee. They discovered evidence in the {{convert|37.5|acre|ha}} plaza area for multiple wooden post circular structures ranging from {{convert|82|ft|m}} to {{convert|206|ft|m}} in diameter; built during the earliest habitation of the site circa 2400 BCE. The site now has a ring of concrete posts marking the position of one of the circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= The Archaeology of Events: Cultural Change and Continuity in the Pre-Columbian Southeast | page= 149| editor1= Gilmore, Zackary I. | editor2= O'Donoughue, Jason M. | publisher= [[University of Alabama Press]] | date= 2015| isbn= 978-0817318505}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= Poverty Point : Plaza | url= https://www.crt.state.la.us/dataprojects/archaeology/povertypoint/plaza.html |publisher = Louisiana Division of Archaeology |accessdate=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title= Poverty Point| author= Greenlee, Diana | url= http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/poverty-point-7 |publisher = Louisiana Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hopewell timber circles===
{{main|Moorehead Circle|Stubbs Earthworks}}
Other examples have been found at [[Hopewell culture]] sites in Ohio. [[Moorehead Circle]] was constructed about two millennia ago at the [[Fort Ancient (Lebanon, Ohio)|Fort Ancient Earthworks]]. It was discovered in 2005 by Jarrod Burks during magnetic surveys at the large hilltop enclosure near [[Lebanon, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis| title= Ohio Hopewell Ceremonial Bladelet Use at the Moorehead Circle, Fort Ancient | author= Miller, Gregory L. | url= http://etd.ohiolink.edu/send-pdf.cgi/Miller%20Gregory%20Logan.pdf?osu1275003441 | format= Masters| publisher= [[Ohio State University]] | year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site consists of three concentric circles; with the outer circle being about {{convert|60|m|ft}} in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/hocu/planyourvisit/upload/Lecture%20Series%202008.pdf|title= The Robert L.

According to radiocarbon dates performed on charcoal found at the site, it was built between 40 BCE and 130 CE, with other charcoal fragments from burnt posts dating to 250 to 420 CE, suggesting the circle was in use for several centuries.&lt;ref name=LEPPER&gt;{{Cite web| last= Lepper| first= Bradley T. | date=2007-05-01| url= http://lostworlds.org/woodhenge-at-fort-ancient-raises-interest-in-ritual-past/ | title= ‘Woodhenge’ at Fort Ancient raises interest in ritual past | accessdate= 2017-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 archaeologist Frank Cowan conducted excavations at the smaller circular enclosure at the [[Stubbs Earthworks]] in [[Warren County, Ohio]]; discovering a timber circle {{convert|240|ft|m}} in diameter and composed of 172 large posts. Carbon dating of charcoal found in post molds at the site have dated the structure to 200-300 CE.&lt;ref name=COWAN&gt;{{cite book| author= Cowan, Frank| chapter = Stubbs Earthworks : An Ohio Hopewell "Woodhenge" |editor = Lepper, Bradley T. |title= Ohio Archaeology : An illustrated chronicle of Ohio's Ancient American Indian Cultures |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Orange Frazer Press]] | location = [[Wilmington, Ohio]] | pages= 148–151 | isbn= 978-1882203390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Cahokia Woodhenge|Mound 72}}
The existence of the series of woodhenges at Cahokia was discovered during [[salvage archaeology]] undertaken by Dr. Warren Wittry in the early 1960s in preparation for a proposed highway interchange. Although the majority of the site contained village house features; a number of unusually shaped large post holes were also discovered. They formed a series of arcs of evenly spaced posts. Wittry hypothesized that the arcs could be whole circles and that the site was possibly a calendar for tracking solar events such as solstice and equinoxes. He began referring to the circles as "woodhenges"; comparing the structures to ones found in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Wittry, Warren L. | title= An American Woodhenge | journal= Cranbrook Institute of Science Newsletter | volume= 33 |issue=9| pages = 102–107| date= 1964|via= ''Explorations into Cahokia Archaeology'', Bulletin 7, Illinois Archaeological Survey, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Wittry, Warren L. | title= Discovering and Interpreting the Cahokia Woodhenges | journal= The Wisconsin Archaeologist | volume=77 |issue=3/4| pages= 26–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional excavations found evidence for five timber circles in the general vicinity, now designated Woodhenges I through V in [[Roman numerals]]. Each was a different diameter and had a different number of posts. Because four of the circles overlap each other it is thought they were built in a sequence, with each iteration generally being larger and containing 12 more posts than its predecessor.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER&gt;{{cite web| title= The Skywatchers of Cahokia | author= Iseminger, William R. | url= http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/aztecs/home/skywatchers-of-cahokia | publisher= Mexicolore | accessdate= 2017-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A full sequence for what has become known as Woodhenge III was found (except for nine posts on the western edge that had been lost to dump trucks for road construction fill) and a reconstruction of the circle was built in 1985; with the posts being placed into the original excavated post positions.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt; The Illinois State Park system oversees the Cahokia site and hosts public sunrise observations at the vernal and autumnal equinoxes and the winter and summer solstices.

Archaeologist Marvin Fowler has speculated that the woodhenges also served as “aligners” and that there may have been as many as 3 more in other strategic locations around the city of Cahokia, built to triangulate and lay out construction projects. At least one other possible circle at Cahokia has been put forward by Fowler, but his suggestion has not yet gained full acceptance by other archaeologists.&lt;ref name=ISEMINGER/&gt; This location was discovered near [[Mound 72|Mounds 72 and 96]], directly to the south of Monks Mound. Several post holes of what may have been a ceremonial area with a {{convert|412|ft|m}} in diameter circle and 48 posts.&lt;ref name=YoungWoodhenges&gt;{{cite book | author= Young &amp; Fowler | chapter= Woodhenges revisited | title = Cahokia: The Great Native American Metropolis | year = 2000 |pages=216–243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have dated the placement of at least one of the posts to approximately 950 CE.&lt;ref name=UWMALMOUND72&gt;{{cite web| title= Mound 72 | publisher= UW-Milwaukee Archaeological Laboratory |url = http://www4.uwm.edu/archlab/cahokia/mound72.cfm |accessdate= 2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological research has shown that four of the posts were at the cardinal locations of north, south, east and west, with eastern and western posts marking the position of the equinox sunrise and sunsets. Four other posts in the circle were shown to be at the summer solstice sunrise and sunset and the winter solstice sunrise and sunset positions. This setup is nearly identical to the diameter and post positions of Woodhenge III, differing only in that Woodhenge III was {{convert|2|ft|m}} smaller in diameter. The placement of the two mounds at the location and the directions in which they are oriented correspond to several of the solstice marking posts.&lt;ref name=YoungWoodhenges/&gt; The post nearest the later elite burial of the "Birdman" is the location that marked the summer solstice sunrise at the times of the sites use.&lt;ref name=CAHOKIALAYOUT&gt;{{cite web| title= Cahokia Layout | publisher= Illinois State Museum |url = http://www.museum.state.il.us/RiverWeb/landings/Ambot/prehistory/mississippian/technology/fac-cahokia-layout.html |accessdate= 2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early stages of the mounds were actually constructed around the posts, although at a later point the posts were removed.&lt;ref name=YoungWoodhenges/&gt;

It was conceived and is funded by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health| National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]]. Total Worker Health is tested and developed in six Centers of Excellence for Total Worker Health in the United States.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

== Definition ==
''Total Worker Health'' is defined as policies, programs, and practices that integrate protection from work-related safety and health hazards with promotion of injury and illness prevention efforts to advance worker well-being.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh|title=CDC - NIOSH Total Worker Health|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[occupational safety and health]] protection programs have primarily focused on ensuring that work is safe and that workers are protected from the harms that arise from work itself.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; Total Worker Health (TWH) builds on this approach through the recognition that work is a [[Social determinants of health|social determinant of health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/social_determinants/sdh_definition/en/|title=WHO {{!}} What are social determinants of health?|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job-related factors such as wages, hours of work, workload and stress levels, interactions with coworkers, and access to leave and healthful workplaces all can have an important impact on the well-being of workers, their families, and their communities. TWH explores opportunities to not only protect workers, but also ''advance'' their health and well-being by targeting the conditions of work. Scientific evidence now supports what many safety and health professionals, as well as workers themselves, have long suspected—that risk factors in the workplace can contribute to health problems previously considered unrelated to work. For example, there are work-related risk factors for abnormal weight fluctuations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luckhaupt|first=Sara E.|last2=Cohen|first2=Martha A.|last3=Li|first3=Jia|last4=Calvert|first4=Geoffrey M.|date=2014-03-01|title=Prevalence of Obesity Among U.S. Workers and Associations with Occupational Factors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074937971300617X|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=46|issue=3|pages=237–248|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2013.11.002|pmid=24512862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=nobrega&amp;f1=AU&amp;Startyear=&amp;t1=0&amp;s2=abreu&amp;terms=3&amp;Adv=1&amp;ct=&amp;B1=Search&amp;f2=AU&amp;Limit=500&amp;Sort=DP+DESC&amp;whichdate=DP&amp;D1=40&amp;EndYear=&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=2&amp;View=f&amp;|title=NIOSHTIC-2 Search Results - Full View|website=www2a.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; sleep disorders,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=caruso&amp;f1=*&amp;Startyear=&amp;Adv=0&amp;terms=1&amp;B1=Search&amp;whichdate=DP&amp;D1=40&amp;Limit=500&amp;Sort=DP+DESC&amp;EndYear=&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=5&amp;View=f&amp;|title=NIOSHTIC-2 Search Results - Full View|website=www2a.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; cardiovascular disease,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=luckhaupt&amp;f1=*&amp;Startyear=&amp;Adv=0&amp;terms=1&amp;B1=Search&amp;whichdate=DP&amp;D1=40&amp;Limit=500&amp;Sort=DP+DESC&amp;EndYear=&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=7&amp;View=f&amp;|title=NIOSHTIC-2 Search Results - Full View|website=www2a.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; depression,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=rayens&amp;f1=*&amp;Startyear=&amp;Adv=0&amp;terms=1&amp;B1=Search&amp;whichdate=DP&amp;D1=40&amp;Limit=500&amp;Sort=DP+DESC&amp;EndYear=&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=1&amp;View=f&amp;|title=NIOSHTIC-2 Search Results - Full View|website=www2a.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=wulsin&amp;f1=*&amp;Startyear=&amp;Adv=0&amp;terms=1&amp;B1=Search&amp;whichdate=DP&amp;D1=40&amp;Limit=500&amp;Sort=DP+DESC&amp;EndYear=&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=1&amp;View=f&amp;|title=NIOSHTIC-2 Search Results - Full View|website=www2a.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2a.cdc.gov/nioshtic-2/BuildQyr.asp?s1=arcury&amp;f1=*&amp;Startyear=&amp;Adv=0&amp;terms=1&amp;B1=Search&amp;whichdate=DP&amp;D1=40&amp;Limit=500&amp;Sort=DP+DESC&amp;EndYear=&amp;PageNo=1&amp;RecNo=11&amp;View=f&amp;|title=NIOSHTIC-2 Search Results - Full View|website=www2a.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other health conditions. In recognition of these emerging relationships, the TWH approach focuses on how environmental, workplace factors can both mitigate and enhance overall worker health beyond traditional occupational safety and health concerns.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

==History==
Total Worker Health originated from the ''Steps to a Healthier US Workforce'' symposium in October 2004, which sought to bring together knowledge and experience of [[occupational safety and health|health protection]] and [[health promotion]], in order to stimulate action for the development of programs.&lt;ref name = history&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/history.html |title=CDC - Total Worker Health History of Total Worker Health - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Program | publisher= NIOSH| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symposium developed around themes of research, practice and policy related to the integration of health protection and health promotion.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

By 2005, the initiative was redeveloped from the ''Steps to a Healthier US Workforce'' Symposium and renamed the NIOSH WorkLife Initiative.&lt;ref name = history/&gt; The WorkLife Initiative supported addressing worker health and [[quality of life|well-being]] in a novel way, by addressing the physical and organizational work environment concurrently with personal health decisions and behaviors of individuals.&lt;ref name = history/&gt; Some aims of the WorkLife Initiative included supporting evaluation of integrative approaches to work and health, promoting adoption of proven policies and practices, motivating trans-disciplinary collaboration among investigators and overcoming the traditional separation of occupational health and health promotion among professional communities.&lt;ref name = history/&gt; In September 2007, NIOSH and 35 other sponsors conducted the "WorkLife 2007: Protecting and Promoting Worker Health" symposium, in which over 450 participants explored the science and economics of integrated work-based programs, policies and practices that sustain and improve worker health and well-being.&lt;ref name = history/&gt; Collaborators at the symposium, which included leaders from labor, business and academic communities provided evidence of work and health benefits from integrated approaches.&lt;ref name = history/&gt; Coupled with case studies and anecdotal reports, the overall consensus was that such integrated work-based programs, if executed and sustained properly, can be good for worker health and business.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

In 2008, collaborators at NIOSH and the Centers of Excellence developed 10 recommendations, grouped in practice, research and policy, as a long-range strategy for advancing the WorkLife Initiative.&lt;ref name = Cheriak&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cherniack|first1=Martin|last2=Henning|first2=Rob|last3=Merchant|first3=James A.|last4=Punnett|first4=Laura|last5=Sorensen|first5=Laura R.|last6=Wagner|first6=Gregory|title=Statement on National WorkLife Priorities|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=54|issue=1|pages=10–20|year=2011|doi=10.1002/ajim.20900|pmid=20949545|pmc=5860803}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recommendations were based on evidence-based practice and research-to-practice initiatives.&lt;ref name=Cheriak/&gt; In 2011, a collaborative symposium with other federal agencies culminated in the "Healthier Federal Workers 2011 Symposium", which applied the integrated work health approaches to federal employees.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

In 2011, NIOSH WorkLife became "Total Worker Health" to better convey the more comprehensive approach to workplace prevention.&lt;ref name = transition&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/transition.html |title=CDC - Total Worker Health WorkLife Transitions to Total Worker Health - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Program | publisher= NIOSH| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Total Worker Health, NIOSH can continue to develop the initiatives from the WorkLife Initiative through research, interventions, partnerships and capacity building to meet the needs of the 21st-century workforce.&lt;ref name = transition/&gt;
The 10th International Conference on Occupational Stress and Health, known as ''Work, Stress and Health 2013'' will be organized by NIOSH along with the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[Society for Occupational Health Psychology]] and will center on Total Worker Health.&lt;ref name = WSH2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/wsh/ |title=Work, Stress and Health 2013 | publisher= American Psychological Association| accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2012 marked the publication of ''The Research Compendium: The NIOSH Total Worker Health Program: Seminal Research Papers 2012''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-146/|title=CDC - NIOSH Publications and Products - The Research Compendium: The NIOSH Total Worker Health Program: Seminal Research Papers 2012  (2012-146)|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-01-30|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2012146|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; presenting the rationale for the TWH approach. These papers noted that a small, but growing body of evidence suggests that integrating occupational safety and health protection program activities with other workplace policies, programs, and practices is more effective for safeguarding worker safety, health, and well-being than either of these programmatic activities on their own.

In 2014, NIOSH created the Office for TWH Coordination and Research Support (Office for TWH) to coordinate and advance these extramural and intramural efforts. In that same year, the Office for TWH partnered with the [[National Academy of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] to host a workshop on “Best and Promising Practices in Total Worker Health”, and also coordinated the 1st International Symposium to Advance Total Worker Health in Bethesda, MD, drawing over 350 live attendees.

The year 2015 marked developments for the program and Office, including the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]]’s granting of the mark “Total Worker Health” as an official registered trademark of the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]]; the launch of the first Center within TWH, the National Center for Productive Aging and Work; and a [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]]-cohosted Pathways to Prevention Workshop&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bradley|first=Cathy J.|last2=Grossman|first2=David C.|last3=Hubbard|first3=Rebecca A.|last4=Ortega|first4=Alexander N.|last5=Curry|first5=Susan J.|date=2016-08-16|title=Integrated Interventions for Improving Total Worker Health: A Panel Report From the National Institutes of Health Pathways to Prevention Workshop: Total Worker Health—What's Work Got to Do With It?|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|language=en|volume=165|issue=4|pages=279–83|doi=10.7326/m16-0740|pmid=27240228|issn=0003-4819}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled: “Total Worker Health&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;—What’s Work Got to Do with It?”.

== Issues ==
[[File:TWH Issues 4x3 10282015 final.jpg|alt=A full page of listing of issues relevant to NIOSH Total Worker Health, broken into the following categories: Control of Hazards and Exposures, Organization of Work, Built Environment Supports, Leadership, Compensation and Benefits, Community Supports, Changing Workforce Demographics, Policy Issues, and New Employment Patterns.|thumb|Issues Relevant to Advancing Worker Well-Being Through Total Worker Health]]
The accompanying graphic "Issues Relevant to Advancing Worker Well-being Through ''Total Worker Health''illustrates a wide-ranging list of issues that are relevant to advancing worker well-being through a Total Worker Health approach. The list of issues relevant to Total Worker Health was revised, retitled and published in November 2015 with input from stakeholders. This updated list reflects an expanded focus for TWH that recognizes that new technologies, new working conditions, and new emerging forms of employment present new risks to worker safety, health, and well-being. Understanding and reducing those risks are important elements of TWH. Additionally, this expanded focus recognizes that there are linkages between health conditions that may not arise from work but that can be adversely affected by work. A Total Worker Health approach advocates for the integration of all organizational policies, programs, and practices that contribute to worker safety, health and well-being, including those relevant to the control of hazards and exposures, the organization of work, compensation and benefits, built environment supports, leadership, changing workforce demographics, policy issues, and community supports.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/faq.html|title=Total Worker Health: Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|access-date=2017-01-31}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fundamentals of TWH Approaches workbook focuses on five Defining Elements of TWH:
* '''Defining Element of TWH 1:''' Demonstrate leadership commitment to worker safety and health at all levels of the organization.
* '''Defining Element of TWH 2:''' Design work to eliminate or reduce safety and health hazards and promote worker well-being.
* '''Defining Element of TWH 3:''' Promote and support worker engagement throughout program design and implementation.
* '''Defining Element of TWH 4:''' Ensure confidentiality and privacy of workers.
* '''Defining Element of TWH 5:''' Integrate relevant systems to advance worker well-being.

=== Essential Elements of Effective Workplace Programs (2008) ===
The ''Essential Elements of Effective Workplace Programs and Policies for Improving Worker Health and Wellbeing'' was first published in 2008. This document has since been updated and expanded in the recently published ''Fundamentals of Total Worker Health Approaches: Essential Elements for Advancing Worker Safety, Health and Well-being.'' The resources contained in the original ''Essential Elements'' are provided here for historical reference.

From the collaborations with the WorkLife Initiative, the ''Essential Elements of Effective Workplace Programs and Policies for Improving Worker Health and Wellbeing'' were developed detailing 20 key components of a comprehensive work-based health protection and health promotion program.&lt;ref name="elements"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/essentials.html |title=CDC - Total Worker Health Essential Elements of Effective Workplace Programs - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Program | publisher= NIOSH| accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These components were grouped into one of four areas: Organizational Culture and Leadership; Program Design; Program Implementation and Resources; and Program Evaluation.&lt;ref name="elements" /&gt; The essential elements of effective workplace programs are as follows:

=== National Total Worker Health Agenda and NIOSH Response to Summarized Stakeholders' Comments ===
[[File:National Total Worker Health Agenda.png|alt=Cover of the National Occupational Research Agenda for Total Worker Health.|thumb|244x244px|National Total Worker Health Agenda]]
In 2016, the NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health released a [[National Occupational Research Agenda]] (NORA) ''National Total Worker Health Agenda''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/office/research.html|title=CDC - Research Program Development &amp; Collaboration - NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(Agenda)'' to define and prioritize occupational safety and health research, practice, and prevention activities for 2016-2026. The ''Agenda'', representing the first time a TWH-specific NORA has been created, builds on an earlier draft (Proposed National TWH Agenda) released by NIOSH’s Office for Total Worker Health in September 2014. NIOSH invited stakeholders to provide comment on this draft agenda related to the top priority research, practice, and policy issues to help advance worker safety, health, and well-being. In 2015, in response to stakeholder input received, the TWH definition was expanded and the TWH approach was more finely focused in the final ''Agenda''. The refined description now present in the published ''Agenda'' better reflects the priorities of the program and helps to overcome the equating of TWH with traditional workplace wellness programs that fail to integrate worker protection elements. TWH continues to place priority upon a hazard-free work environment that protects the safety and health of all workers.

===Sit-stand workstations===
[[File:Treadmill workstation view 2.jpg|thumb|right|Pilot studies of sit-stand workstations have shown reductions in sedentary time and possible indications of improved health outcomes.]]

Concerns over the increasingly [[sedentary lifestyle]] of individuals and the associated health risks lead to this development. A study from a large sample of Australian adults found that prolonged sitting was a risk factor for all-cause mortality, independent of physical activity.&lt;ref name = "van der Ploeg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Ploeg|first1=HP|last2=Chey|first2=T|last3=Korda|first3=RJ|last4=Banks|first4=E|last5=Bauman|first5=A|title=Sitting time and all-cause mortality in 222497 Australian adults|journal=Arch Intern Med|volume=172|issue=6|pages=494–500|year=2012|pmid=22450936|doi=10.1001/archinternmed.2011.2174}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sit-stand workstations are custom-built computer workstations, allowing the user to adjust the height of the workplace envelope and to work while standing. With the implementation of sit-stand workstations, individuals will be able to reduce sedentary time while at work, thereby improving health outcomes, and possibly improving work productivity.

Published research in 2012 on the benefits from implementing sit-stand workstations in the workplace has resulted in the development of some pilot studies for Total Worker Health. While the individual results of the studies varied, the researchers found that sit-stand workstations resulted in an overall improvement in health outcomes of workers who switched to these workstations, in addition to the reduced sitting time. Such health benefits from these pilot studies include increased [[high-density lipoprotein|HDL cholesterol]], improved mood outcomes, reduced eye strain, and reduced upper back, neck and shoulder pain.&lt;ref name = Alkhajah&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alkhajah|first1=TA|last2=Reeves|first2=MM|last3=Eakin|first3=EG|last4=Winkler|first4=EA|last5=Owen|first5=N|last6=Healy|first6=GN|title=Sit-stand workstations: a pilot intervention to reduce office sitting time|journal=Am J Prev Med|volume=43|issue=3|pages=298–303|year=2012|pmid=22898123|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2012.05.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Pronk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pronk|first1=NP|last2=Katz|first2=AS|last3=Lowry|first3=M|last4=Payfer|first4=JR|title=Reducing occupational sitting time and improving worker health: The Take-a-Stand Project, 2011|journal=Prev Chronic Dis|volume=9|issue=110323|year=2012|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2012/11_0323.htm|accessdate=11 December 2012|doi=10.5888/pcd9.110323|pmc=3477898}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Robertson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=MM|last2=Ciriello|first2=VM|last3=Garabet|first3=AM|title=Office ergonomics training and a sit-stand workstation: effects on musculoskeletal and visual symptoms and performance of office workers|journal=Appl Ergon|volume=44|issue=1|pages=73–85|year=2012|pmid=22727324|doi=10.1016/j.apergo.2012.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson et al. found that the sit-stand workstation users, who were trained to vary their postures at work, exhibited increased productivity at work, compared to those who were not trained so.&lt;ref name = Robertson/&gt; Further, the study by Pronk et al. showed decreased [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and increased vigor among participants.&lt;ref name = Pronk/&gt; With these findings, NIOSH has begun a pilot program among employees for the Total Worker Health initiative.&lt;ref name = sitstand&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2012/12/sit-stand/ |title=CDC - NIOSH Science Blog - NIOSH Takes a Stand | publisher= NIOSH| accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health care workers===
Several studies out of the Harvard Center for Work, Health and Wellbeing have focused on the relationships between work context and quality of life measures for health care workers. A survey of over 1500 hospital patient care workers examined the relationships between health outcomes ([[low back pain|lower back pain]], inadequate [[physical exercise|physical activity]], and [[sleep deprivation]]) and work context measures.&lt;ref name = Sorensen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sorensen|first1=G|last2=Stoddard|first2=AM|last3=Stoffel|first3=S|last4=Buxton|first4=O|last5=Sembajwe|first5=G|last6=Hashimoto|first6=D|last7=Dennerlein|first7=JT|last8=Hopcia|first8=K|title=The Role of the Work Context in Multiple Wellness Outcomes for Hospital Patient Care Workers|journal=JOEM|volume=53|issue=8|pages=899–910|year=2011|pmid=21775897|doi=10.1097/JOM.0b013e318226a74a|pmc=3693572}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inadequate physical activity and sleep deficiency were associated, while lower back pain was not significantly related to either stressor.&lt;ref name=Sorensen/&gt;
Work context measures, such as low supervisor support, harassment at work, job title, and job culture were found to be associated with the quality of life and health outcomes for the hospital care workers.&lt;ref name = Sorensen/&gt;

===Aging workforce===
[[File:70 yr old miner.jpg|left|thumb|Seventy-year-old miner emerging from his coal mine in eastern Pennsylvania.]]
[[Aging in the American workforce]], the rapidly increasing numbers of older workers (ages 55 and above) comprising the workforce in the United States, could have significant impacts to the economy, social security benefits, occupational safety and health, health care, and American society as a whole. Researchers from the [[American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine]] (ACOEM) and NIOSH convened a national Invitational Summit on ‘’Advancing Workplace Health Protection and Promotion in the Context of an Aging Workforce’’ to address several questions and to develop consensus statements and recommendations for a national approach to tackle these issues.&lt;ref name = Loeppke&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loeppke|first1=Ronald R.|last2=Schill|first2=Anita L.|last3=Chosewood|first3=L.

==Organizations with Successful Integrated Health, Safety and Productivity Management Programs==
Various companies have implemented integrated health protection and health promotion management programs successfully, with documented health improvements and cost savings.&lt;ref name = Goetzel&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goetzel|first=Ron Z.|title=Examining the Value of Integrating Occupational Health and Safety and Health Promotion Programs in the Workplace|journal=NIOSH Report|year=2005|url=https://archive.org/download/ExaminingTheValueOfIntegratingOccupationalHealthAndSafetyAndHealth/BackgroundPaperGoetzelJan2005.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each integrated program varies a bit in focus areas and in implementation, but follow the components of Total Worker Health.

The '''Vorstengraf''' (''[[Grave (burial)|grave]] of the king'') in [[Oss]] is one of the largest [[burial mounds]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The hill was 3 metres high and had a diameter of 54 metres.  

==First, second and third Vorstengraf==
In 1933, the so-called Vorstengraf was uncovered during the construction of a trailer park on the [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]. It contained a bronze bucket containing a curved iron sword from 700 BC. The find was transferred to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in [[Leiden]]. The site of the hill was later a junkyard. The mound is now partly restored, a portion of the circumference of the hill is marked with poles. 

In 2009, a second Vorstengraf was discovered a few hundred metres from the first Vorstengraf. The finds from this tomb are displayed in the Jan Cunen Museum in Oss. In 2011, it was announced that a third ''Vorstengraf'' was discovered in [[Uden]].

==Pile graves==
[[File:Knooppunt Paalgraven.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Interchange Paalgraven in 2002]]

[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|250px|The original curved iron sword, [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]]]]
[[File:Oss vorstengraf.jpg|thumb|250px|The Vorstengraf from above]]
The Vorstengraf is located at the [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] ''Paalgraven''. This node is named after the pile graves that have been found in the immediate vicinity. These tombs were built in the period of the Early [[Bronze Age]] to the Early [[Iron Age]], between 2000 BC to 700 BC. 

To the east of Oss a new highway was built to connect the A50 and A59 from [[Emmeloord]] to [['s-Hertogenbosch]] (formerly the junction with the N265 [[Eindhoven]]-Oss). 

In the vicinity of the tomb two Forest Hills Tree Wreaths were excavated. According to archaeologists the poles probably had a [[ritual]] function. One of the hills is surrounded by a ditch. 

To the east and south of the Vorstengraf an urnfield was found dating back to the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Cremated remains are interred in an urn or cloth. Soon after the establishment of the Vorstengraf the burial ground was closed.

==Seven Mounds==
The area ''De Zevenbergen'' - ''Seven Mounds'' - was examined in 1964 and 1965 and seven burial mounds were found. When the junction was later modified the area had another investigation. Trial slots revealed that there had been a line of poles over a length of at least 100 meter in the area. In 2004 began the actual excavation of the multiple burial hills. 

In the 13th century a gallows was built on one of these hills. This was at a crossroads of continuous ruts on the heath and the remains of two victims were found nearby.

==Myths==
There are folk tales associated with the mound, local historian Jan Cunen (1884-1940) once recorded that a prince must have been buried in the heath.

The hill is also called Hansjoppenmountain. There are several stories about the [[Gnome]] Hans Joppen.
