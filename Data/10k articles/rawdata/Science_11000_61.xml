      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4313">'''Atomic Energy Project''' was started at the [[University of Rochester]] as a graduate teaching program. Also known as the University of Rochester Atomic Energy Project or URAEP.

==Atomic Energy Project genesis==
The Atomic Energy Project was the continuation of the [[Manhattan Project]] after the end of [[World War II]]. The idea was to continue the work of training the people necessary for the peaceful use of [[atomic energy]] and [[nuclear material]]s.

==Key personnel==
*[[Stafford L. Warren]] directed the Department of [[Radiology]] at Rochester and the Atomic Energy Project had three divisions. 
*[[William Freer Bale]] headed the [[Radiology]] and [[Biophysics]] division that worked largely on radioactive materials — for example, [[Radium]], [[Radon]], [[Plutonium]], and [[Polonium]].
*[[James Newell Stannard]] was responsible for 2 sections, the Radiation [[Toxicology]] section and the Radioautography section. 
*[[Harold Carpenter Hodge|Harold Hodge]] headed the [[Pharmacology]] and [[Toxicology]] division that focused on [[Uranium]] including inhalation studies. 
*[[Joe Wiseman Howland]], M.D., Ph.D. headed the Medical Services division. 
*[[Herbert Mermagen]] worked in the [[Medical Physics]] section as a [[Health physicist|radiological physicist]], known today as a [[health physicist]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Henry A., (27 April 1950) Quarterly Technical Report, 1 January 1950 thru 31 March 1950, Health and Biology UR-116, The University of Rochester, Atomic Energy Project, pp. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rochester Alumni-Alumnae Review, June–July 1946, School of Medicine Wins Citation from Army; Manhattan Project Contract  Renewed July 1. William F. Bale in photo. Vol. XXIII, No. 9, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schmeck, Harry. Rochester Alumni-Alumnae Review, (March 1957). Medical Project Helps Prepare U.S. for Atomic Age; Manhattan Project Contract Renewed July 1. William F. Bale in photo. Vol. XVIII, No. 4, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Rochester Atomic Energy Project. (1950). University of Rochester.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Dr. William F. Bale of the University of Rochester in his laboratory by Dr. Marks and Mr. Miazga at 11: 00 AM on 30 April 1974. https://www.osti.gov/opennet/servlets/purl/16124950/16124950.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

At Rochester, Bale worked with [[George Hoyt Whipple]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/whipple-george.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The discoveries of [[artificial radioactivity]] by [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie|Joliot-Curie]] and [[Fermi]] and the invention of the [[cyclotron]] by [[Ernest O. Lawrence]] with its capability of producing useful amounts of radioactive iron (&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Fe) permitted Whipple, Paul F. Hahn, and Bale in 1937 to begin an examination of the nature of iron absorption and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;Whipple, G. H., P. F. Hahn, W. F. Bale, and E. O. Lawrence. (1939). Radioactive iron and its metabolism in anemia. Its absorption, transportation, and utilization. ''Journal Exp. Med.'' 69:739-753.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiation Dose Reconstruction==
The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] ([[NIOSH]]) part of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] started the Radiation Dose Reconstruction NIOSH program area for the [[University of Rochester]] Atomic Energy Project.&lt;ref name=cdc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/uraep.html |title=NIOSH Program Area:Radiation Dose Reconstruction |work=Center for Disease Control |accessdate=August 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], earlier agencies, and contractors and subcontractors that worked at the [[University of Rochester]] Atomic Energy Project in [[Rochester, New York]], from 1 September 1943 - 30 October 1971, for at least 250 work days were included in the study.&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt; Additional employees included Laboratory Technicians that worked in the [[University of Rochester]] Atomic Energy Project laboratory building from 1 September 1943 to 19 June 1945.&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dol.gov/owcp/energy/regs/compliance/PolicyandProcedures/finalbulletinshtml/EEOICPABulletin10-20.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Sociological Association''' ('''BSA''') is a scholarly and professional society for [[sociologists]] in the [[United Kingdom]], and was founded in 1951. It publishes the academic journals ''[[Sociology (journal)|Sociology]]'', ''[[Work, Employment &amp; Society|Work, Employment and Society]]'' and ''[[Cultural Sociology (journal)|Cultural Sociology]]'' (with [[SAGE Publications]]) as well as its membership newsletter ''Network'' and a monthly eNewsletter. Formerly, the ''[[British Journal of Sociology]]'' was the BSA's official journal, but it was replaced by ''Sociology'' some years after the latter had been established.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. H. Halsey]], ''A History of Sociology in Britain'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a registered charitable company (charity no: 1080235) which states its mission is to "represent the intellectual and sociological interests of our members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britsoc.co.uk/about/about-the-bsa.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303133453/http://www.britsoc.co.uk/about/about-the-bsa.aspx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=March 3, 2012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==
The activities of the BSA are co-ordinated by an Advisory Forum charged with overseeing governance, membership services and publications. Decisions are monitored and ratified by the Board of Trustees, which includes the BSA president.

'''Corey Schou''' is [[Distinguished Professor|University Professor]] of [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] and Associate [[Dean (education)|Dean]] at [[Idaho State University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Who's Going to Train the Cyber Security Pros? |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/feb2000/nf00216d.htm |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=2000-02-16 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; director of the [[National Information Assurance Training and Education Center]] (NIATEC) and the Simplot Decision Support Center (SDSC), and for ten years the chair of the Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=AMERICA ON THE CYBER EDGE |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS145244+05-Mar-2008+PRN20080305 |work=[[Reuters]] |date=2008-03-05 |accessdate=2008-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, organizations began to recognize that connected PCs in various locations were much more vulnerable than a mainframe locked away in a single building. These organizations began seeking qualified individuals responsible for selecting, recommending and implementing security policy and procedures. However, few schools were offering information security curricula, much less academic degrees, and organizations would have to take an IT professional at his or her word that they knew how to manage information security for the entire [[(ISC)²|enterprise]].

By 1989 Schou and others had established a univied common Body of knowledge for computer security. Schou, with Idaho State university hosted the finalization [https://www.isc2.org/isc2-history.aspx meetings] in Salt Lake City. His work was later recognized by the organization with various awards in San Francisco ([https://www.isc2.org/20thanniversary/Default.aspx#FA Founder's award] and 
The need for a professional certification to maintain and validate a common knowledge, values, and ethics for individuals in the industry became a growing concern. Several IT professional societies recognized that a certification program attesting to the qualifications of information security personnel was needed.

Schou's work is recognized several organizations such as [https://www.isc2.org/isc2-history.aspx ISC2] as foundational to the Information Assurance discipline in academia.  His work for three decades has resulted in standards used internationally by government, industry and academia.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

== Teaching ==
Schou is a teacher and mentor whose style is described by his students and colleagues as [[Socratic method|Socratic]].  At all levels he encourages students to excel. Although he has had a full-service and research agenda, university records show that he has taught at least one class every semester for the past 30 years.

He currently heads one of the Scholarship for Service Cyber Corps programs that prepares individuals to be Information Assurance Professionals.  In this program all students take a full MBA program.  In addition they are exposed to both courses and practicum experiences.  Upon completion of the program the graduates have completed all the requirements for certification by the [[Committee on National Security Systems]]. The program is one of only three in the nation that is certified at all levels for all certifications [http://www.nsa.gov/ia/academic_outreach/nat_cae/index.shtml CAE].  In addition, graduates are expected to sit for the [[Systems Security Certified Practitioner]] SSCP and CISSP examinations from (ISC)2.  Currently the program has a 100% pass rate on the first try as documented in the university annual report to the National Science Foundation NSF.

In 1993 he was the first non-government employee to be recognized as Educator of the Year by the Federal Information Systems Security Educators Association [http://csrc.nist.gov/organizations/fissea/educator-year/recipients.shtml FISSEA]

== Writing ==
He is the author of several books on information assurance called ''Information Assurance for the Enterprise: A Roadmap to Information Security'' [http://www.mcgraw-hill.co.uk/html/0072255242.html McGraw Hill Catalog.]
and over 300 referred papers and monographs.

'''Dmitry Leontiyevich Ovtsyn''' ({{Lang-ru|Дмитрий Леонтьевич Овцын}}) (unknown - after 1757) was a Russian [[hydrographer]] and [[Arctic]] explorer. 

In 1734-1738, Ovtsyn led one of the units of the [[Second Kamchatka expedition]] that charted the coastline of the [[Kara Sea]] east of the river [[Ob River|Ob]]. In summer of 1737, his unit made its way from Ob to [[Yenisei]] and made the first hydrographic description of this part of the Siberian coastline. In 1741, Ovtsyn took part in [[Vitus Bering]]'s voyage to the shores of [[United States|America]].

The '''East Midlands Regional Assembly''' was the [[regional chamber]] for the [[East Midlands]] region of the [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emra.gov.uk/ East Midlands Regional Assembly - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It was based at [[Melton (borough)|Melton]].

==History==
It was created by the [[Regional Development Agencies Act 1998]]. It is based opposite PERA on ''Nottingham Road'' in Melton Mowbray.

==Function==
It was originally created to divide up the money given in government grants for the East Midlands. However, EMDA in Nottingham, the local government-run [[regional development agency]], is taking over this role, and has done similar work in the past. It is currently involved in promoting energy efficiency throughout businesses and local authorities in the East Midlands.

==Structure==
It had 111 members, with seventy from the 46 local authorities and thirty-five from local businesses. The Assembly Board has 18 members. There are 20 permanent staff. Government funding comes from the [[Department for Communities and Local Government]].

==Abolition==

The assembly was abolished on 31 March 2010 as part of the UK Government's Review of Sub-National Economic Development and Regeneration. Its functions were assumed by the [[East Midlands Development Agency]] and a newly constituted [[East Midlands Leaders' Board]], the executive arm of East Midlands Councils.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22060">In [[physics]], the '''Faraday effect''' or '''Faraday rotation''' is a [[magneto-optic]]al phenomenon—that is, an interaction between [[light]] and a [[magnetic]] field in a medium. The Faraday effect causes a rotation of the plane of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] which is linearly proportional to the component of the magnetic field in the direction of propagation. Formally, it is a special case of [[gyroelectromagnetism]] obtained when the [[dielectric permittivity]] [[tensor]] is diagonal.&lt;ref name="Prati2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Prati |first=E. |date=2003 |title=Propagation in gyroelectromagnetic guiding systems |journal=J. of Electr. Wav. and Appl. |volume=17 |issue=8 |pages=1177–1196 |doi=10.1163/156939303322519810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovered by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1845,  the Faraday effect was the first experimental evidence that light and electromagnetism are related. The theoretical basis of [[electromagnetic radiation]] (which includes visible light) was completed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 1860s and 1870s. This effect occurs in most optically [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[dielectric]] materials (including liquids) under the influence of [[magnetic field]]s.

The Faraday effect is caused by left and right circularly polarized waves propagating at slightly different speeds, a property known as [[Optical activity#Theory|circular birefringence]]. Since a linear polarization can be decomposed into the [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of two equal-amplitude circularly polarized components of opposite handedness and different phase, the effect of a relative [[Phase (waves)|phase]] shift, induced by the Faraday effect, is to rotate the orientation of a wave's linear polarization.

The Faraday effect has applications in measuring instruments. For instance, the Faraday effect has been used to measure optical rotatory power and for remote sensing of magnetic fields (such as [[fiber optic current sensor]]s). The Faraday effect is used in [[spintronics]] research to study the polarization of electron spins in semiconductors. [[Faraday rotator]]s can be used for amplitude modulation of light, and are the basis of [[optical isolator]]s and [[optical circulators]]; such components are required in optical telecommunications and other laser applications.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.rp-photonics.com/regenerative_amplifiers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Faraday photograph ii.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] holding a piece of glass of the type he used to demonstrate the effect of magnetism on polarization of light, c. 1857.]]
By 1845, it was known through the work of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]], [[Étienne-Louis Malus|Malus]], and others that different materials are able to modify the direction of polarization of light when appropriately oriented,&lt;ref name=horvath-thesis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horváth|first1=Gábor|title=Polarization Patterns in Nature - Imaging Polarimetry with Atmospheric Optical and Biological Applications|date=2003|publisher=Eötvös University|location=Budapest|url=https://arago.elte.hu/?q=node/11|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; making polarized light a very powerful tool to investigate the properties of transparent materials. Faraday firmly believed that light was an electromagnetic phenomenon, and as such should be affected by electromagnetic forces. He spent considerable effort looking for evidence of electric forces affecting the polarization of light through what are now known as [[electro-optic effect]]s, starting with decomposing electrolytes. However, his experimental methods were not sensitive enough, and the effect was only measured thirty years later by [[John Kerr (physicist)|John Kerr]].&lt;ref name=crowther-1920&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowther|first1=James Arnold|title=The life and discoveries of Michael Faraday|date=1920|publisher=Society for promoting Christian knowledge|pages=54–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=iWe4AAAAIAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=The+life+and+discoveries+of+Michael+Faraday&amp;ots=fTas7NUyy7&amp;sig=eZVLwqiv44mw1b0Uiwc3SjlINkk#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20life%20and%20discoveries%20of%20Michael%20Faraday&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraday then attempted to look for the effects of magnetic forces on light passing through various substances. After several unsuccessful trials, he happened to test a piece of "heavy" glass, containing traces of [[lead]], that he had made during his earlier work on glass manufacturing.&lt;ref name=mansuripur&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mansuripur|first1=Masud|title=The Faraday Effect|journal=Optics and Photonics News|issue=10|pages=32–36|url=http://www.mmresearch.com/articles/article3/|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faraday observed that when a beam of polarized light passed through the glass in the direction of an applied magnetic force, the polarization of light rotated by an angle that was proportional to the strength of the force. He was later able to reproduce the effect in several other solids, liquids, and gases by procuring stronger electromagnets.&lt;ref name="crowther-1920"/&gt;

The discovery is well documented in Faraday's daily notebook, which has since been published.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 Sept. 1845, in paragraph #7504, under the rubric ''Heavy Glass'', he wrote:
{{quotation|… '''BUT''', when the contrary magnetic poles were on the same side,  ''there was an effect produced on the polarized ray'',  and thus magnetic force and light were proved to have relation to each other. …|Faraday|Paragraph #7504|Daily notebook}} &lt;!-- I do not know better how to mark this up, but the emphasis on the word BUT is an attempt to reflect what Faraday wrote. In the published notebook, which is a facsimile of the original, one can see that Faraday wrote the word BUT very large, and underlined it several times. --&gt;

He summarized the results of his experiments on 30 Sept. 1845, in paragraph #7718, famously writing:
{{quotation|… Still, I have at last succeeded in illuminating a magnetic curve or line of force, and in magnetizing a ray of light. …|Faraday|Paragraph #7718|Daily notebook}}

==Physical interpretation==
The linear polarized light that is seen to rotate in the Faraday effect can be seen as consisting of the superposition of a right- and a left- circularly polarized beam (this [[superposition principle]] is fundamental in many branches of physics). We can look at the effects of each component (right- or left polarized) separately, and see what effect this has on the result.

In [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]] the direction of the electric field rotates at the frequency of the light, either clockwise or counter-clockwise. In a material, this electric field causes a force on the charged particles comprising the material (because of their low mass, the electrons are most heavily affected). The motion thus effected will be circular, and circularly moving charges will create their own (magnetic) field in addition to the external magnetic field. There will thus be two different cases: the created field will be parallel to the external field for one (circular) polarization, and in the opposing direction for the other polarization direction – thus the net B field is enhanced in one direction and diminished in the opposite direction. This changes the dynamics of the interaction for each beam and one of the beams will be slowed down more than the other, causing a phase difference between the left- and right-polarized beam. When the two beams are added after this phase shift, the result is again a linearly polarized beam, but with a rotation in the polarization direction.

The direction of polarization rotation depends on the properties of the material through which the light is shone. A full treatment would have to take into account the effect of the external and radiation-induced fields on the wave function of the electrons, and then calculate the effect of this change on the refractive index of the material for each polarization, to see whether the right- or left circular polarization is slowed down more.

==Mathematical formulation==

Formally, the magnetic [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] is treated as a non-diagonal tensor as expressed by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kales | first1 = M.

The relation between the [[angle of rotation]] of the polarization and the magnetic field in a transparent material is:

[[File:Faraday-effect.svg|thumb|right|335px|Polarization rotation due to the Faraday effect]]

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = \mathcal{V}Bd &lt;/math&gt;

where

:β is the angle of rotation (in [[radian]]s)
:''B'' is the magnetic flux density in the direction of propagation (in [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s)
:''d'' is the length of the path (in meters) where the light and magnetic field interact
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \mathcal{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Verdet constant]] for the material. This empirical proportionality constant (in units of radians per tesla per meter) varies with wavelength and temperature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vojna|first1=David|title=Faraday effect measurements of holmium oxide (Ho2O3) ceramics-based magneto-optical materials|journal=High Power Laser Science and Engineering|date=2018|volume=6|doi=10.1017/hpl.2017.37|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322709232_Faraday_effect_measurements_of_holmium_oxide_Ho2O3_ceramics-based_magneto-optical_materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vojna|first1=David|title=Verdet constant dispersion of CeF3 in the visible and near-infrared spectral range|journal=Optical Engineering|date=2017|volume=56|issue=6|page=067105|doi=10.1117/1.OE.56.6.067105|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317486975_Verdet_constant_dispersion_of_CeF3_in_the_visible_and_near-infrared_spectral_range|bibcode=2017OptEn..56f7105V}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is tabulated for various materials.

A positive Verdet constant corresponds to L-rotation (anticlockwise) when the direction of propagation is parallel to the magnetic field and to R-rotation (clockwise) when the direction of propagation is anti-parallel. Thus, if a ray of light is passed through a material and reflected back through it, the rotation doubles.

Some materials, such as [[terbium gallium garnet]] (TGG) have extremely high Verdet constants (≈ {{val|-134|u=rad/(T·m)}} for 632&amp;nbsp;nm light).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/BusinessVentures/SYNOPTICS/Products/SpecialtyCrystals/Pages/TGG.aspx |title=TGG (Terbium Gallium Garnet)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By placing a rod of this material in a strong magnetic field, Faraday rotation angles of over 0.78 rad (45°) can be achieved. This allows the construction of [[Faraday rotator]]s, which are the principal component of [[Faraday isolator]]s, devices which transmit light in only one direction.  The Faraday effect can, however, be observed and measured in a Terbium-doped glass with Verdet constant as low as (≈ {{val|-20|u=rad/(T·m)}} for 632&amp;nbsp;nm light).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dylan Bleier|title=Faraday Rotation Instructable|url=http://dylanbleier.com/faraday-rotation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar isolators are constructed for microwave systems by using [[Ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] rods in a [[waveguide]] with a surrounding magnetic field. A thorough mathematical description can be found [http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/em/lectures/node101.html here].

==In the interstellar medium==
The effect is imposed on light over the course of its propagation from its origin to the [[Earth]], through the [[interstellar medium]]. Here, the effect is caused by free [[electrons]] and can be characterized as a difference in the [[refractive index]] seen by the two circularly polarized propagation modes. Hence, in contrast to the Faraday effect in solids or liquids, interstellar Faraday rotation (β) has a simple dependence on the wavelength of light (λ), namely:

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = \mathrm{RM} \lambda^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where the overall strength of the effect is characterized by RM, the '''rotation measure'''. This in turn depends on the axial component of the interstellar magnetic field ''B&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the number density of electrons ''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', both of which vary along the propagation path. In [[Gaussian units|Gaussian cgs units]] the rotation measure is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM} = \frac{e^3}{2\pi m^2c^4}\int_0^d n_e(s) B_{||}(s) \;\mathrm{d}s&lt;/math&gt;

or in  [[SI]] units:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RM} = \frac{e^3}{8\pi^2 \varepsilon_0 m^2c^3} \int_0^d n_e(s) B_{||}(s) \;\mathrm{d}s \approx
  (2.62 \times 10^{-13}\, T^{-1})\, \int_0^d n_e(s) B_{||}(s)\; \mathrm{d}s
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''n&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(s)'' is the density of electrons at each point ''s'' along the path
:''B&lt;sub&gt;||&lt;/sub&gt;(s)'' is the component of the interstellar magnetic field in the direction of propagation at each point ''s'' along the path
:''e'' is the [[electric charge|charge]] of an electron;
:''c'' is the [[speed of light|speed of light in a vacuum]];
:''m'' is the [[mass]] of an electron;
:&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permittivity]];

The integral is taken over the entire path from the source to the observer.

Faraday rotation is an important tool in [[astronomy]] for the measurement of magnetic fields, which can be estimated from rotation measures given a knowledge of the electron number density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longair|first=Malcolm | authorlink=Malcolm Longair|title=High Energy Astrophysics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date = 1992|isbn=0-521-43584-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[radio pulsar]]s, the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] caused by these electrons results in a time delay between pulses received at different wavelengths, which can be measured in terms of the electron column density, or [[dispersion measure]]. A measurement of both the dispersion measure and the rotation measure therefore yields the weighted mean of the magnetic field along the line of sight.  The same information can be obtained from objects other than pulsars, if the dispersion measure can be estimated based on reasonable guesses about the propagation path length and typical electron densities. In particular, Faraday rotation measurements of polarized radio signals from extragalactic radio sources occulted by the solar corona can be used to estimate both the electron density distribution and the direction and strength of the magnetic field in the coronal plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mancuso |first=S. |last2=Spangler |first2=S. R. |title=Faraday Rotation and Models for the Plasma Structure of the Solar Corona |date=2000 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=539 |issue=1 |pages=480–491 |doi=10.1086/309205 |bibcode = 2000ApJ...539..480M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the ionosphere==
[[Radio wave]]s passing through the Earth's [[ionosphere]] are likewise subject to the Faraday effect. The ionosphere consists of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] containing free electrons which contribute to Faraday rotation according to the above equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the earth's magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the density of electrons in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the [[sunspot cycle]], the magnitude of the effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500&amp;nbsp;MHz (λ = 60&amp;nbsp;cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Wolfgang, Charles Hutchinson, (ed), ''The ARRL |Handbook for Radio Amateurs, Sixty Eighth Edition '', American Radio Relay League, 1990 {{ISBN|0-87259-168-9}}, pages 23-34 , 23-25,&lt;/ref&gt;  A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after [[Skywave|reflection by the ionosphere]] is rather unpredictable. However the Faraday effect due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at [[microwave]] frequencies, used by [[satellite communications]], the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.

==Of semiconductors==
[[File:GaAs-Faraday rotation spectrum.png|thumb|GaAs-Faraday rotation spectrum]]
Due to spin-orbit coupling, undoped GaAs single crystal exhibits much larger Faraday rotation than glass (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Considering the atomic arrangement is different along the (100) and (110) plane, one might think the Faraday rotation is polarization dependent. However, experimental work revealed an immeasurable anisotropy in the wavelength range from 880–1,600&amp;nbsp;nm. Based on the large Faraday rotation, one might be able to use GaAs to calibrate the B field of the terahertz electromagnetic wave which requires very fast response time. Around the band gap, the Faraday effect shows resonance behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=G. X.|first=Du|title=Fast Magneto-optical Spectrometry by Spectrometer|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3673638|publisher=Rev. Sci. Instrum.|accessdate=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, (ferromagnetic) semiconductors return both [[electro-gyration]] and a Faraday response in the high frequency domain. The combination of the two is described by [[gyroelectromagnetic media]],&lt;ref name="Prati2003" /&gt; for which gyroelectricity and gyromagnetism (Faraday effect) may occur at the same time.

==Of organic materials==
In organic materials, Faraday rotation is typically small, with a [[Verdet constant]] in the visible wavelength region on the order of a few hundred degrees per Tesla per meter, decreasing proportional to &lt;math&gt; \lambda^{-2} &lt;/math&gt; in this region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vandendriessche|first=Stefaan|display-authors=etal|title=Faraday rotation and its dispersion in the visible region for saturated organic liquids|doi=10.1039/C2CP23311H|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics |volume=14|issue=6|pages=1860–1864|bibcode = 2012PCCP...14.1860V|date=2012|url=https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/339734/2/Faraday+Fluids.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Verdet constant of organic materials does increase around electronic transitions in the molecule, the associated light absorption makes most organic materials bad candidates for applications. There are however also isolated reports of large Faraday rotation in organic liquid crystals without associated absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vandendriessche|first=Stefaan|display-authors=etal|title=Giant Faraday Rotation in Mesogenic Organic Molecules|doi=10.1021/cm4004118|journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=25|number=7|pages=1139–1143|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In plasmonic/magnetic materials==
[[File:Optical cavity created by plasmonic materials.png|300px|thumb|left]]
In 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Adam|title=Surface Plasmon Resonance Enhanced Magneto-optics(SuPREMO): Faraday Rotation Enhancement in Gold-Coated Iron Oxide Nanocrystals|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nl900007k|publisher=American Chemical Society|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Au core-shell nanostructures were synthesized to integrate  magnetic (γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and plasmonic (Au) properties into one composite. Faraday rotation with and without the plasmonic materials was tested and rotation enhancement under 530&amp;nbsp;nm light irradiation was observed. Researchers claim that the magnitude of the magneto-optical enhancement is governed primarily by the spectral overlap of the magneto-optical transition and the plasmon resonance.

The reported composite magnetic/plasmonic nanostructure can be visualized to be a magnetic particle embedded in a resonant optical cavity. Because of the large density of photon states in the cavity, the interaction between the electromagnetic field of the light and the electronic transitions of the magnetic material is enhanced, resulting in a larger difference between the velocities of the right- and left-hand circularized polarization, therefore enhancing Faraday rotation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10050">The '''Gay-Lussac Humboldt Prize''' is German - French science prize. It was created in 1981 by French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] and German Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] based on the recommendation of the German and French research ministries.

The prize is awarded to researchers that have made outstanding contributions in science, especially in cooperation between the two countries. Four to five German and French scientists from all research disciplines are honored with this award every year. The prize was originally named after [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and carries since 1997 the double name Gay-Lussac-Humboldt.

'''George William Francis Althofer''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|OAM}} (1903–1993) was an [[Australia]]n [[botany|botanist]], [[Plant nursery|nurseryman]], author and poet, with a special interest in the mint-bush genus ''[[Prostanthera]]'' as well as other Australian native plants, who founded the [[Burrendong Botanic Garden and Arboretum]].

==Life==
Althofer was born at Dripstone in the [[Wellington, New South Wales|Wellington]] [[Local government in Australia|local government area]] of [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] [[New South Wales]].  He attended school locally, in Dripstone, then Wellington and [[Mumbil, New South Wales|Mumbil]].

Althofer grew up working on his father's farm and [[orchard]], becoming an orchardist himself.  In 1938 he established a native plant nursery at his property "Nindethana" at Dripstone.  Inspired by the American example of the [[Arnold Arboretum]], and assisted by his brother Peter, he lobbied for the establishment of a similar institution with a focus on Australian native plants.  As a consequence, the 167 ha Burrendong Botanic Garden and Arboretum on the foreshore of [[Burrendong Dam|Lake Burrendong]], near Wellington, opened in 1964.

[[File:Cabinet V - Geissler tubes 1862.jpg|thumb|1862 Gas discharge tube with holder developed with [[Volkert Simon Maarten van der Willigen]] in 1856 (before he became curator of the [[Teylers Museum]]), in the [[Teylers Instrument Room]]]]
'''Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geißler''' (26 May 1814 in [[Neuhaus am Rennweg|Igelshieb]] – 24 January 1879) was a skilled [[glassblower]] and [[physicist]], famous for his invention of the [[Geissler tube]], made of glass and used as a low pressure gas-discharge tube.

Geissler descended from a long line of craftsmen in the [[Thuringian Forest|Thüringer Wald]] and in [[Bohemia|Böhmen]].&lt;ref name="perf"/&gt; He found work in different German universities, eventually including the [[University of Bonn]]. There he was asked by physicist [[Julius Plücker]] to design an apparatus for evacuating a glass tube. &lt;blockquote&gt;Plücker owed his forthcoming success in the electric discharge experiments in large measure to his instrument maker, the skilled glassblower and mechanic Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Geissler.  He learned the art of glassblowing in the duchy of [[Saxe-Meiningen]].... He finally settled down as an instrument-maker in a workshop of his own at the University of Bonn in 1852.&lt;ref name="perf"&gt;Per F. Dahl, ''Flash of the cathode rays: a history of J.J. Thomson's electron''. CRC Press, 1997, pp.49–52 .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Geissler made a hand-crank mercury pump, and glass tubes that could contain a superior vacuum.

The Geissler tube was used for entertainment throughout the 1800s and evolved around 1910 into commercial [[neon lighting]].  Advances in Plucker and Geissler's discharge tube technology developed into the [[Crookes tube]], with which the [[electron]] was discovered in 1897, and in 1906 into the amplifying [[vacuum tube]], the basis of electronics and long distance communication technologies like radio and television.

Geissler was awarded an honorary doctorate in 1868.&lt;ref name="perf"/&gt;

[[File:IXS Enterprise.jpg|thumb|The IXS ''Enterprise'' as imagined by Mark Rademaker]]

'''IXS ''Enterprise''''' is a conceptual [[Faster-than-light|interstellar superluminal]] [[spacecraft]] designed by [[NASA]] scientist Dr. [[Harold G. White]], revealed at SpaceVision 2008, designed for the goal of achieving [[Warp drive|warp travel]]. The conceptual spacecraft would make use of a modified version of the [[Alcubierre drive]]. Dr. White is currently running the [[White–Juday warp-field interferometer]] experiment in order to develop a [[proof of concept]] for Alcubierre-style warp travel, if possible. The Alcubierre drive uses [[exotic matter]] (not to be confused with [[antimatter]]) to travel faster than light.

While the concept had been out since 2008 the design of IXS ''Enterprise'' was popularized in June 2015 after a series of media outlets reported on the conceptual artwork done by Dutch artist Mark Rademaker in collaboration with NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillip|first1=Abby|title=This is the amazing design for NASA’s Star Trek-style space ship, the IXS ''Enterprise''|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/06/11/this-is-the-amazing-design-for-nasas-star-trek-style-space-ship-the-ixs-enterprise/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mark Rademaker, over 1,600 hours have been spent on the conceptual artwork that he created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phillips|first1=Chaka|title=Warp Speed Tests: NASA Advanced Propulsion Names Latest Model ''Enterprise'' After Star Trek|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15393/20140622/warp-speed-tests-nasa-advanced-propulsion-names-latest-model-enterprise-after-star-trek.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy required to power the warp drive, according to White,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peckham|first1=Matt|title=NASA Actually Working on Faster-than-Light Warp Drive|url=http://techland.time.com/2012/09/19/nasa-actually-working-on-faster-than-light-warp-drive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is approximately the [[negative energy|negative]] (negative energy is required for the Alcubierre drive concept to function) [[mass–energy equivalence]] of ''[[Voyager 1]]'', which has a mass of approximately 700 [[kilograms]]. Using E=mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, −700 kilograms of mass is equivalent to ~−63 [[exajoules]] of energy (this number is not definitive and can be further reduced). The ship has two thick outer rings (to reduce required energy) that generate the warp field—a contraction of space ahead, and expansion of space behind it. The space inside the rings is optimized to fit more space for cargo, crew and equipment.

'''ispace Inc'''. is a private Japanese company developing [[robotic spacecraft]] technologies to discover, map, and utilize the natural resources on the [[Moon]]. They will start by exploring the exploitation of [[lunar water]] in order to create a sustainable infrastructure and a Moon-based economy.&lt;ref name='ispace Home'&gt;[https://ispace-inc.com/ ispace Home site]. Accessed 11 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; ispace's long-term strategy is to build landers and rovers to compete for both transportation and exploration mission contracts from space agencies and private industry.

In 2010 White Label Space Japan was founded as a branch organization to the Dutch-led team White Label Space, a participant in the [[Google Lunar X Prize]] (GLXP).&lt;ref name="WLS Japan open"&gt;{{cite press release |date=September 9, 2010 |title=WLS Japan Office - Open For Business |url=http://www.whitelabelspace.com/2010/09/wls-japan-office-open-for-business.html  |publisher=White Label Space |access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ispace was founded in 2013 after White Label Space dropped out from the GLXP and transferred its GLXP participation right to White Label Space Japan. ispace is currently headquartered in [[Tokyo]], Japan with offices in the United States and [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name='B Wire'&gt;[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170302005800/en/Luxembourg-ispace-Tokyo-Based-Lunar-Robotic-Exploration-Company Luxembourg and ispace, a Tokyo-Based Lunar Robotic ExplorationCompany, Sign MoU to Co-Operate within the Spaceresources.lu Initiative]. ''Business Wire''. Released by the Luxembourg Ministry of the Economy. 2 March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The company's founder and CEO is Takeshi Hakamada.

ispace operates team [[Hakuto]] and their lunar rover, ''Sorato'', that will scout for water and explore other potential local resources.

==History==

Although ispace is now independent, it began as a branch of a European organization called White Label Space.&lt;ref name='Wired 2018'&gt;[https://www.wired.com/story/the-japanese-space-bots-that-could-build-moon-valley/ The Japanese Space Bots That Could Build Moon Valley]. Sarah Scoles, ''Wired''. 14 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; White Label Space (WLS) was an international team of space engineers that was founded in 2008 to compete in the [[Google Lunar X Prize]], for a grand price of $20 million to send a spacecraft to the Moon's surface, and have it travel 500 meters. WLS was headquartered in the Netherlands and led by Steve Allen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitelabelspace.com/2009/08/aoes-group-bv-specialist-space.html Dutch Firm AOES Group BV Partners with White Label Space Team in $30 Million Google Lunar X PRIZE], 31 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The European side was to develop a lander, while the Japanese group consisting of [[Tohoku University]] Space Robotics Lab and led by Kazuya Yoshida was to develop a rover. In 2010, White Label Space Japan LLC, the predecessor of ispace was founded by Takeshi Hakamada to manage the commercial and technical aspect of the Japanese group.&lt;ref name="WLS Japan open"/&gt; When the European teammates dropped out from GLXP in January 30, 2013, the Japan-based members continued the work and the GLXP participation right was transferred from the Netherlands to Japan. Steve Allen, WLS's leader was succeeded by Takeshi Hakama. In May 2013, the team's parent company, White Label Space Japan changed its name to ispace, while WLS itself was renamed team Hakuto in July 15 of the same year.&lt;ref name='Wired 2018'/&gt;  As per September 2018, ispace plans to orbit its lunar lander around the moon. The company has signed up for two launches on [[SpaceX]]'s [[Falcon 9]] rockets, to take place in 2020 and 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.trtworld.com/asia/japan-lunar-exploration-firm-to-head-for-moon-on-spacex-rockets-20468|title=Japan lunar exploration firm to head for moon on SpaceX rockets|website=Japan lunar exploration firm to head for moon on SpaceX rockets|language=tr-TR|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17904898/ispace-hakuto-r-spacex-falcon-9-rocket-lunar-lander-rover|title=Japanese company ispace says it will launch two missions to the Moon in 2020 and 2021|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October, 2018, a industry team formed by [[Draper Laboratory]], along with ispace, [[General Atomics]], and [[Spaceflight Industries]] submitted a proposal for a commercial lunar lander to [[NASA]]'s [[Commercial Lunar Payload Services]] Program. According to Draper, ispace will serve as the team's design agent.&lt;ref name="Foust201810"&gt;{{cite news |last=Foust |first=Jeff |date=October 10, 2018 |title=Draper bids on NASA commercial lunar lander competition |url=https://spacenews.com/draper-bids-on-nasa-commercial-lunar-lander-competition/ |newspaper=[[SpaceNews]] |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
&lt;!--ispace home site seems to show outdated plans that differ from the info reported by the media this year. It seems the architecture is fluid and will likely continue to change; unclear what several sources call "orbiting rover".--&gt;
[[File:Water Detected at High Latitudes on the Moon.jpg|thumb|Image of the Moon taken by the [[Moon Mineralogy Mapper]]. Blue shows the spectral signature of [[hydroxide]] (component of water), green shows the brightness of the surface as measured by reflected infrared radiation from the [[Sun]] and red shows a mineral called [[pyroxene]].]]

The long-term strategy of ispace is to build landers and rovers to compete for both transportation and exploration mission contracts from space agencies and private industry. They aim at mining [[lunar water]] and other resources to support a future Moon-based infrastructure.&lt;ref name='TechAsia'&gt;[https://www.techinasia.com/talk/takeshi-hakamada-ispace They want moon landings to be a commercial reality — and that's just the start]. Time Romero, ''Tech in Asia''. August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first demonstration mission includes a small rover called  ''Sorato'' which is planned to be delivered to the lunar surface by the ''Peregrine'' lander built [[Astrobotic Technology]], to be launched on an [[Atlas V]] rocket in 2020.&lt;ref name='First launch'&gt;[http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/missions/commercial/astrobotic-ready-become-delivery-service-moon/ Astrobiotic Ready to Become Delivery Service to the Moon]. Michael Coli, ''Spaceflight Insider''. 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The second demonstration mission includes a lander currently being designed by ispace, that would deploy a number of small rovers. The lander would be launched as a secondary payload on a commercial launch vehicle.&lt;ref name='March 2018'/&gt;

If the technology validations are successful, ispace plans to offer a regular series of lander missions to carry up to {{conv|30|kg}} of customer payloads per flight.&lt;ref name='March 2018'/&gt; The company also plans to collect a wide variety of data about the Moon's environment, which they plan to sell to its customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2017/12/13/this-japanese-space-startup-raised-90-2-million-to-go-to-the-moon/#7aeac94276b6 This Japanese Space Startup Raised $90.2 Million To Go To The Moon].

'''Iterative Learning Control''' (ILC) is a method of [[Process control|tracking control]] for systems that work in a repetitive mode. Examples of systems that operate in a repetitive manner include [[robot]] arm manipulators, chemical batch processes and [[Reliability engineering|reliability testing]] rigs. In each of these tasks the system is required to perform the same action over and over again with high [[Accuracy and precision|precision]]. This action is represented by the objective of accurately tracking a chosen reference signal &lt;math&gt;r(t)&lt;/math&gt; on a finite time interval.

Repetition allows the system to improve tracking accuracy from repetition to repetition, in effect learning the required input needed to track the reference exactly. The learning process uses information from previous repetitions to improve the control signal ultimately enabling a suitable control action can be found [[iteration|iteratively]]. The [[internal model (motor control)|internal model]] principle yields conditions under which perfect tracking can be achieved but the design of the control algorithm still leaves many decisions to be made to suit the application. A typical, simple control law is of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;u_{p+1}=u_p +K * e_p&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_p&lt;/math&gt; is the input to the system during the pth repetition, &lt;math&gt;e_p&lt;/math&gt; is the tracking error during the pth repetition and K is a design parameter representing operations on &lt;math&gt;e_p&lt;/math&gt;. Achieving perfect tracking through iteration is represented by the mathematical requirement of convergence of the input signals as &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; becomes large whilst the rate of this convergence represents the desirable practical need for the learning process to be rapid. There is also the need to ensure good algorithm performance even in the presence of uncertainty about the details of process dynamics. The operation &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is crucial to achieving design objectives and ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization computations.

'''Liz Neeley''' is a [[science communicator]] and the [[Executive director|Executive Director]] of [[The Story Collider]], a nonprofit organization that focuses on true, personal stories inspired by science. She began her career in [[marine biology]] and [[Marine conservation|conservation]] and has since become an expert in the use of narrative storytelling for effective [[science communication]].

== Education &amp; Early Career ==
Neeley received her Bachelor of Arts in [[Marine Biology]] in 2002. She then completed her Master's degree at [[Boston University]] in Ecology and Evolution in 2005. Her graduate research centered on the evolution of color patterns and visual communication systems in tropical reef fishes—[[wrasse]]s and [[parrotfish]]—in the laboratory of Gil Rosenthal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swordtail.tamu.edu/en/personnel.html|title=People - Rosenthal Lab - Mate Choice and Evolutionary Genetics|last=symisun.com|first=SymiSun* -|website=swordtail.tamu.edu|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduate school, she began a career in marine conservation, applying her general subject matter knowledge to science advocacy. She began working at [[SeaWeb]], a communications-based nonprofit organization committed to promoting understanding around [[Ocean science|ocean]] and [[Environmental science|conservation science]] to a host of stakeholders—from decision makers to community leaders to the media. By strategically communicating to these groups, SeaWeb worked to foster the development of measures to protect the ocean. From 2005 to 2006, Neeley worked with SeaWeb's Asia Pacific Program, partnering with local communities and researchers in Fiji and Papua New Guinea to build communications capacity for them to share their knowledge of local coral reefs ecosystems with the local media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=ftp://ftp.nodc.noaa.gov/pub/data.nodc/coris/library/NOAA/CRCP/project/1395/training_enhance_mpa_network_fiji_papua_new_guinea.pdf|title=Communications Trainings to Enhance Marine Protected Area Network Development and Effectiveness in Fiji and Papua New Guinea|author=|authors=|first=|date=2009|publisher=|issue=|doi=|location=|edition=|volume=|page=|pages=|pmid=|docket=|quote=|author-link=|access-date=|format=|others=|chapter=|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she transitioned to the role of Program Manager at SeaWeb, where she helped launch the "Too Precious to Wear" campaign, partnering with the fashion industry to raise awareness around the toll of dredging deep sea coral. The campaign sought to impose limits on coral use in fashion, design, and home decor through the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.today.com/news/sea-lovers-say-coral-too-precious-wear-wbna25501461|title=Sea lovers say coral is too precious to wear|work=TODAY.com|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docplayer.net/15623175-Corals-in-the-the-state-of-corals-and-recommendations-for-recovery.html|title=Corals. in the.

== Science Communication Career ==
Following her tenure at [[SeaWeb]], Neeley focused her career more on efforts around [[science communication]], training scientists on how best to share their knowledge of science with a range of stakeholders. She has served as a contributing author on a range of books on science communication. She wrote a section on utilizing social media to promote a scientist's work for ''Science Blogging: The Essential Guide'' and contributed a chapter on communicating controversial topics in science on social media in ''Effective Risk Communication''. She also co-authored ''Escape from the Ivory Tower: a guide to making your science matter'' during her time at the nonprofit COMPASS''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/science-blogging-the-essential-guide/oclc/920017519|title=Science blogging: the essential guide|last=Wilcox|first=Christie|last2=Brookshire|first2=Bethany|last3=Goldman|first3=Jason G|date=2016|isbn=978-0300197556|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/e/9781136272356/chapters/10.4324/9780203109861-17|journal=Taylor &amp; Francis|language=en|doi=10.4324/9780203109861-17|date=2013-10-30|doi-broken-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/escape-from-the-ivory-tower-a-guide-to-making-your-science-matter/oclc/699823828|title=Escape from the ivory tower: a guide to making your science matter|last=Baron|first=Nancy|last2=Neeley|first2=Liz|date=2010|publisher=Island Press|isbn=9781597266635|location=Washington|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neeley has lent her expertise to a number of groups centered on communicating science to the public, previously serving on the advisory board of the CommLab at [[MIT]] from 2015 to 2017 and on the Advisory Council of [[Ensia]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nemc.us/meeting/2017/load_bio.php?id=253|title=National Environmental Monitoring Conference - NEMC|website=www.nemc.us|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also holds a Lecturer appointment at [[Yale School of Medicine]] in conjunction with the National Neuroscience Curriculum Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicine.yale.edu/people/search/liz_neeley.profile|title=Elizabeth Neeley &gt; People and Organizations at YSM {{!}} Yale School of Medicine|website=medicine.yale.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== COMPASS ===
In 2008, Neeley joined COMPASS, a nonprofit organization co-founded by marine ecologist and former [[NOAA]] Administrator [[Jane Lubchenco]] to train scientists to more effectively share their expertise with journalists, decision makers, and the public at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.compassscicomm.org/our-mission-history|title=COMPASS {{!}} Our Mission &amp; History|website=COMPASS {{!}} USA {{!}} Science Communication|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Neeley served as the Assistant Director of Science Outreach, working to develop their training programs in science communication and connecting scientists to public conversations around their expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Brooke|last2=Baron|first2=Nancy|last3=English|first3=Chad|last4=Galindo|first4=Heather|last5=Goldman|first5=Erica|last6=McLeod|first6=Karen|last7=Miner|first7=Meghan|last8=Neeley|first8=Elizabeth|date=2013-04-30|title=COMPASS: Navigating the Rules of Scientific Engagement|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1001552|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001552|issn=1544-9173|pmc=3640098|pmid=23637575}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2013/05/15/science-communication-at-a-tipping-point|title=Science Communication at a Tipping Point : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also launched COMPASS's training programs around how scientists can more effectively utilize [[social media]] to share their work and engage with a broader audience.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McClain|first=Craig|last2=Neeley|first2=Liz|date=2014|title=A critical evaluation of science outreach via social media: its role and impact on scientists|journal=F1000Research|volume=3|pages=300|doi=10.12688/f1000research.5918.2|issn=2046-1402|pmc=4376169|pmid=25866620}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.compassscicomm.org/single-post/2015/04/25/Assembling-Science-Networks-Online|title=Assembling (Science) Networks Online {{!}} COMPASS {{!}} USA {{!}} Science Communication|website=COMPASS {{!}} USA {{!}} Science Communication|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her tenure at COMPASS, she was affiliate staff at the [[University of Washington]] in the School of Aquatic &amp; Fisheries Sciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Story Collider ===
In 2015, Neeley became the Executive Director of [[The Story Collider]], a nonprofit organization that brings true, personal stories inspired by science to the public through live shows and a weekly podcast. The organization also trains scientists on how to employ the tools of storytelling to become better communicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/dec/06/listen-to-this-story-collider-human-stories-behind-science|title=Listen to this: Story Collider reveals the human stories behind the science|last=Locker|first=Melissa|date=2015-12-06|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.storycollider.org/about-us-2/|title=About us|website=The Story Collider|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, she's also spearheaded efforts in applying storytelling to more traditionally academic forms of communication, curating a collection of "Conservation stories from the front lines" for [[PLOS Biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gross|first=Liza|last2=Hettinger|first2=Annaliese|last3=Moore|first3=Jonathan W.|last4=Neeley|first4=Liz|date=February 2018|title=Conservation stories from the front lines|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=16|issue=2|pages=e2005226|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005226|issn=1545-7885|pmc=5798755|pmid=29401208|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has spoken about the importance of storytelling for science at a number of universities and organizations, including the [[Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology]], the [[University of Washington College of the Environment]]'s Bevan Series, and at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=BeckmanInstitute|title="The Power of Personal Stories About Science" - Story Collider's Liz Neeley (Lecture)|date=2017-10-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1CcFX9YIqQ|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wsg.washington.edu/event/bevan-series-2018-liz-neeley/|title=Bevan Series 2018: Liz Neeley|website=Washington Sea Grant|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tgs.northwestern.edu/about/news-events/stories/2016/science,-sense-making,-and-storytelling.html|title=Science, Sense-making, and Storytelling: The Graduate School - Northwestern University|last=|first=|date=|website=www.tgs.northwestern.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the policy arena, she has contributed a position paper on the use of narrative persuasion to help scientists ethically navigate the world of decision making at the Institute on Science for Global Policy in partnership with [[Sigma Xi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|url=http://scienceforglobalpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/56955bba166cb-ISGP%20Communicating%20Science%20for%20Policy.pdf|title=Communicating Science for Policy|author=Neeley|authors=|first=Liz|date=August 2015|publisher=Institute on Science for Global Policy (ISGP)|issue=|doi=|location=|edition=|volume=|page=|pages=23–33|pmid=|docket=|quote=|author-link=|access-date=July 31, 2018|format=PDF|others=|chapter=Training in Narrative Persuasion for Ethical, Effective Science Communication|section=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neeley has also told stories of her own for The Story Collider, including a story about a field expedition gone awry during her time as an undergraduate and another about her colleagues forgetting her while working on coral conservation in Fiji.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.storycollider.org/stories/2017/3/10/in-the-field-liz-neeley-heith-copes|title=In the Field: Stories about venturing into the wild|work=The Story Collider|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.storycollider.org/stories/2017/10/13/invisibility-stories-about-hiding-in-plain-sight|title=Invisibility: Stories about hiding in plain sight|work=The Story Collider|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality: Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.&lt;/ref&gt; The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]], the invention of vertical [[windmill]]s, [[spectacles]], [[mechanical clock]]s, and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques ([[Gothic architecture]], [[medieval castle]]s), and [[agriculture]] in general ([[three-field crop rotation]]).

The [[List of early medieval watermills|development of water mills]] from their [[List of ancient watermills|ancient origins]] was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone. By the time of the ''[[Domesday Book]]'', most large villages had turnable mills, around 6,500 in [[England]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holt|1988|pp=7–8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water-power was also widely used in [[mining]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].

European technical advancements from the 12th to 14th centuries were either built on long-established techniques in medieval Europe, originating from [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] antecedents, or adapted from cross-cultural exchanges through trading networks with the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]], [[China]], and [[History of India|India]]. Often, the revolutionary aspect lay not in the act of invention itself, but in its technological refinement and application to political and economic power. Though [[gunpowder]] along with other weapons had been started by Chinese, it was the Europeans who developed and perfected its military potential, precipitating European expansion and eventual imperialism in the Modern Era.

Also significant in this respect were advances in maritime technology. Advances in shipbuilding included the multi-masted [[ship]]s with [[lateen]] sails, the [[Rudder|sternpost-mounted rudder]] and the skeleton-first [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] construction. Along with new navigational techniques such as the [[Compass|dry compass]], the [[Jacob's staff]] and the [[astrolabe]], these allowed economic and military control of the seas adjacent to Europe and enabled the global navigational achievements of the dawning [[Age of Exploration]].

At the turn to the [[Renaissance]], [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]’s invention of [[Printing press|mechanical printing]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience. The technical drawings of late-medieval artist-engineers [[Guido da Vigevano]] and [[Villard de Honnecourt]] can be viewed as forerunners of later Renaissance works such as [[Taccola]] or [[Leonardo da Vinci|da Vinci]].

== Civil technologies ==
The following is a list of some important medieval technologies. The approximate date or first mention of a technology in medieval Europe is given. Technologies were often a matter of cultural exchange and date and place of first inventions are not listed here (see main links for a more complete history of each).

=== Agriculture ===

'''[[Carruca]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)
[[File:Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg|thumb|340x340px|Carruca (Heavy Plough )]]
A type of heavy wheeled plough commonly found in Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device consisted of four major parts. The first part was a [[Coulter (agriculture)]] at the bottom of the plough.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This knife was used to vertically cut into the top sod to allow for the [[plowshare]] to work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The plowshare was the second pair of knives which cut the sod horizontally, detaching it from the ground below.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The third part was the moldboard, which curled the sod outward.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth part of the device was the team of eight oxen guided by the farmer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This type of plough eliminated the need for cross-plowing by turning over the furrow instead of merely pushing it outward.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life and Thought in the Early Middle Ages|last=Hoyt|first=Robert S|publisher=University of Minnesota|year=1967|isbn=|location=Lund Press, Minneapolis|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of wheeled plough made seed placement more consistent throughout the farm as the blade could be locked in at a certain level relative to the wheels.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A disadvantage to this type of plough was its maneuverability.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Since this equipment was large and lead by a small herd of oxen, turning the plough was difficult and time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This caused many farmers to turn away from traditional square fields and adopt a longer, more rectangular field to ensure maximum efficiency.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Ard (plough)]]''' (5th century)

An early medieval plough that consisted of a sharpened wooden post pulled by either animals or humans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This lightweight and primitive plough was used primarily before the invention of the [[carruca]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ard was inefficient in more firm northern soil but did decent work in southern areas where the soil was much softer.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the ard required the user to apply constant pressure to the plough in order to make sure the edge could break the ground, the soil was merely pushed to the sides instead of being properly turned over.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horse collar]]''' (6th to 9th centuries)

Once oxen started to be replaced by horses on farms and in fields, the [[yoke]] became obsolete due to its shape not working well with a horses' posture.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The first design for a horse collar was a throat-and-girth-harness.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These types of harnesses were unreliable though due to them not being sufficiently set in place.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The loose straps were prone to slipping and shifting positions as the horse was working and often caused asphyxiation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the eighth century, the introduction of the rigid collar eliminated the problem of choking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The rigid collar was "placed over the horses head and rested on its shoulders.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This permitted unobstructed breathing and placed the weight of the plow or wagon where the horse could best support it."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Horseshoe]]s''' (9th century)

Allowed horses to carry larger loads and move around with greater traction on hard to walk surfaces.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The practice of shoeing horses was initially practiced in the Roman Empire but lost popularity throughout the Middle Ages until around the 11th century.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although horses in the southern lands could easily work while on the softer soil, the rocky soil of the north proved to be damaging to the horses' hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Since the north was the problematic area, this is where shoeing horses first became popular.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The introduction of gravel roadways was also cause for the popularity of horseshoeing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The loads a shoed horse could take on these roads were significantly higher than one that was barefoot.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By the 14th century, not only did horses have shoes, but many farmers were shoeing oxen and donkeys in order to help prolong the life of their hooves.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The size and weight of the horseshoe changed significantly over the course of the middle ages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the 10th century, horseshoes were secured by six nails and weighed around one-quarter of a pound, but throughout the years, the shoes grew larger and by the 14th century, the shoes were being secured with eight nails and weighed nearly half a pound.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crop rotation]]''' (8th century)

Also called the Two-field system. This system included the farmers' field being divided into two separate crops.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One field would grow a crop while the other was allowed to lie fallow and was used to feed livestock and regain lost nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Every year, the two fields would switch in order to ensure fields did not become nutrient deficient.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the 11th century, this system was introduced into Sweden and spread to become the most popular form of farming.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Three-field system]]''' (8th century)
[[File:De Grey Hours f.9.r Wine pressing.jpg|thumb|An individual grape stomping as a form of wine pressing.]]
The ideal three-field system is one that separates a section of land into three equal parts.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Each one of the three parts holds a different crop.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One part holds a spring crop, such as barley or oats, another part holds a winter crop, such as wheat or rye, and the third part is an off-field that is left alone to grow and is used to help feed livestock.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By rotating the three crops to a new part of the land after each year, the off-field regains some of the nutrients lost during the growing of the two crops.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; This system increases agricultural productivity over the [[Two-field system]] by only having one-third of the field not being used instead of one half.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Another advantage of crop rotation is that many scholars believe it helped increase yields by up to 50%.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Wine press]]''' (12th century)

This device was the first practical means of [[Pressing (wine)]] on a plane surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The wine press was an expensive piece of machinery that only the wealthy could afford.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The method of [[Grape stomping]] was often used as a less expensive alternative.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While white wines required the use of a wine press in order to preserve the color of the wine by removing the juices quickly from the skin, red wine did not need to be pressed until the end of the juice removal process since the color did not matter.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Many red wine winemakers used their feet to smash the grapes then used a press to remove any juice that remained in the grape skins.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Technology in Medieval European Life|last=Wigelsworth|first=Jeffery R.|publisher=The Greenwood Press|year=2006|isbn=0-313-33754-3|location=Westport, CT|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Qanat]]''' (5th century)

An underground passage used to water fields, crops, and provide drinking water.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These tunnels had a gradual slope which used gravity to pull the water from either an [[aquifer]] or [[water well]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval Folk Astronomy and Agriculture in Arabia and the Yemen|last=Varisoc|first=Daniel Martin|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|year=1997|isbn=0-86078-651-X|location=Brookfield, Vermont|pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system was originally found in middle eastern areas and is still used today in places where surface water is hard to find.

=== Architecture and construction ===
'''[[Pendentive]] architecture''' (6th century)

A specific spherical form in the upper corners to support a dome. Although the first experimentation was made in the 200s, it was in the 6th century in the [[Byzantine Empire]] that its potential was fully achieved.

'''[[Artesian well]]''' (1126)

A thin rod with a hard iron cutting edge is placed in the bore hole and repeatedly struck with a hammer, underground water pressure forces the water up the hole without pumping. Artesian wells are named after the town of Artois in France, where the first one was drilled by Carthusian monks in 1126.

'''[[Central heating]] through [[Underfloor heating|underfloor channels]]''' (9th century)

In the early medieval Alpine upland, a simpler central heating system where heat travelled through underfloor channels from the furnace room replaced the Roman [[hypocaust]] at some places. In [[Reichenau Abbey]] a network of interconnected underfloor channels heated the 300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; large assembly room of the monks during the winter months. The degree of efficiency of the system has been calculated at 90%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=456–459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Vault (architecture)#Rib vault|Rib vault]]''' (12th century)

An essential element for the rise of [[Gothic architecture]], rib vaults allowed vaults to be built for the first time over rectangles of unequal lengths. It also greatly facilitated scaffolding and largely replaced the older [[groin vault]].

'''[[Chimney]]''' (12th century)

The earliest true chimneys appeared in Northern Europe during the 12th century, and with them came the first true fireplaces.

'''[[Arch bridge|Segmental arch bridge]]''' (1345)

The [[Ponte Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] is considered medieval Europe's first stone segmental arch bridge.

[[File:Treadmillcrane.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Treadwheel crane]]]]
'''[[Treadwheel crane]]''' (1220s)

The earliest reference to a [[treadwheel]] in archival literature is in France about 1225,&lt;ref name="Andrea Matthies, p.515"&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=515}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from tread-drums, windlasses and occasionally cranks were employed for powering cranes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[List of historical harbour cranes|Stationary harbour crane]]''' (1244)

Stationary harbour cranes are considered a new development of the Middle Ages; its earliest use being documented for Utrecht in 1244.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=345}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical harbour crane was a pivoting structure equipped with double treadwheels. There were two types: wooden gantry cranes pivoting on a central vertical axle and stone tower cranes which housed the windlass and treadwheels with only the jib arm and roof rotating.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"&gt;{{harvnb|Matheus|1996|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cranes were placed on docksides for the loading and unloading of cargo where they replaced or complemented older lifting methods like [[see-saw]]s, [[winch]]es and [[Yard (sailing)|yards]].&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 345"/&gt; '''Slewing cranes''' which allowed a rotation of the load and were thus particularly suited for dockside work appeared as early as 1340.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthies|1992|p=534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Crane vessel|Floating crane]]'''

Beside the stationary cranes, floating cranes which could be flexibly deployed in the whole port basin came into use by the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Crane (machine)|Mast crane]]'''

Some harbour cranes were specialised at mounting masts to newly built sailing ships, such as in Gdańsk, Cologne and Bremen.&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Wheelbarrow]]''' (1170s)

The wheelbarrow proved useful in building construction, mining operations, and agriculture. Literary evidence for the use of wheelbarrows appeared between 1170 and 1250 in north-western Europe. The first depiction is in a drawing by [[Matthew Paris]] in the mid-13th century.

=== Art ===
[[File:Jan van Eyck 091.jpg|thumb|180px|''[[Portrait of a Man in a Turban]]'', oil painting by [[Jan van Eyck]] (1433)]]
'''[[Oil paint]]''' (by 1125)

As early as the 13th century, oil was used to add details to tempera paintings and paint wooden statues. Flemish painter [[Jan van Eyck]] developed the use of a stable oil mixture for [[panel painting]] around 1410.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Karel van Mander]] propagated a myth that van Eyck invented oil painting, but [[Theophilus Presbyter|Theophilus]] ([[Roger of Helmarshausen]]?) clearly gives instructions in his 1125 treatise, ''On Divers Arts''. The van Eyck brothers were among the earliest Early Netherlandish painters to employ it for detailed panel painting and achieved new effects through the use of glazes, [[wet-on-wet]] and other techniques. {{cite book|authorlink=Ernst Gombrich|last=Gombrich|first=E. H.|title=The Story of Art|pages=236–39|publisher=Phaidon|year=1995|isbn=0-7148-3355-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clocks ===
'''[[Hourglass]]''' (1338)

Reasonably dependable, affordable and accurate measure of time. Unlike water in a [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the rate of flow of sand is independent of the depth in the upper reservoir, and the instrument is not liable to freeze. Hourglasses are a medieval innovation (first documented in [[Siena]], Italy).

'''[[Clock|Mechanical clocks]]''' (13th to 14th centuries)

A European innovation, these weight-driven clocks were used primarily in clock towers.

=== Mechanics ===
'''[[Crank (mechanism)|Compound crank]]'''

The Italian physician [[Guido da Vigevano]] combines in his 1335 ''Texaurus'', a collection of war machines intended for the recapture of the Holy Land, two simple cranks to form a compound crank for manually powering war carriages and [[Paddle steamer#History|paddle wheel boats]]. The devices were fitted directly to the vehicle's axle respectively to the shafts turning the paddle wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=112}}; {{harvnb|Hall|1979|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metallurgy ===
'''[[Blast furnace]]''' (1150–1350)

Cast iron had been made in China before the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Genius of China: 3000 years of science, discovery and invention |last1=Temple|first1= Robert|coauthors= Joseph Needham|year= 1986|publisher = Simon and Schuster|location=New York |isbn= |pages=| postscript = &lt;Based on the works of Joseph Needham&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  European cast iron first appears in Middle Europe (for instance Lapphyttan in Sweden, Dürstel in Switzerland and the Märkische Sauerland in Germany) around 1150,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm Archaeological Investigations on the Beginning of Blast Furnace-Technology in Central Europe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208193313/http://www.uni-muenster.de/UrFruehGeschichte/kier1.htm |date=2007-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in some places according to recent research even before 1100.&lt;ref&gt;Radomir Pleiner: Vom Rennfeuer zum Hochofen.

Jh., in: Uta Lindgren (ed.): ''Europäische Technik im Mittelalter. 800-1400'', Berlin 2001 (4th ed.), pp. 249-256 (255) {{ISBN|3-7861-1748-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is considered to be an independent European development.&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Heinz Ludwig, Volker Schmidtchen: ''Propyläen Technikgeschichte. Metalle und Macht 1000-1600'', Berlin 1997, p.389f. {{ISBN|3-549-05633-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milling ===
{{Further|List of early medieval watermills}}
'''[[Ship mill]]''' (6th century)

The ship mill is a Byzantine invention, designed to mill grains using hydraulic power. The technology eventually spread to the rest of Europe and was in use until ca. 1800.
'''[[Paper mill]]''' (13th century)

The first certain use of a water-powered [[paper mill]], evidence for which is elusive in both Chinese&lt;ref&gt;[[Tsien, Tsuen-Hsuin]] 1985, pp. 68−73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|2005|p=28, fn. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Muslim paper making,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|pp=414f.}}; {{harvnb|Thompson|1978|p=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; dates to 1282.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|1996|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Rolling mill]]''' (15th century)

Used to produce metal sheet of an even thickness. First used on soft, malleable metals, such as [[lead]], [[gold]] and [[tin]]. Leonardo da Vinci described a rolling mill for wrought iron.

'''[[Tide mill|Tidal Mill]]s''' (6th century)

The earliest tidal mills were excavated on the Irish coast where watermillers knew and employed the two main [[waterwheel]] types: a 6th-century tide mill at Killoteran near [[Waterford]] was powered by a vertical waterwheel,&lt;ref name="Murphy 2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Murphy|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the tide changes at [[Little Island, Cork|Little Island]] were exploited by a twin-flume horizontal-wheeled mill (c. 630) and a vertical undershot waterwheel alongside it.&lt;ref name="Wikander 1985, 155–157"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=155–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harnvb|Rynne|2000|pp=17, 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early example is the [[Nendrum Monastery mill]] from 787 which is estimated to have developed seven to eight [[horsepower]] at its peak.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McErlean|Crothers|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ Nendrum Monastery mill] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225336/http://www.nendrum.utvinternet.com/tmill/ |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Windmill|Vertical windmill]]s''' (1180s)

Invented in Europe as the pivotable post mill, the first surviving mention of one comes from Yorkshire in England in 1185. They were efficient at grinding grain or draining water. Stationary tower mills were also developed in the 13th century.

'''[[Trip hammer|Water hammer]]''' (12th century at the latest)

Used in metallurgy to forge the metal blooms from [[bloomery|bloomeries]] and [[Catalan forge]]s, they replaced manual hammerwork. The water hammer was eventually superseded by [[steam hammer]]s in the 19th century.

=== Navigation ===
'''[[History of the compass#Dry compass|Dry compass]]''' (12th century)

The first European mention of the directional compass is in [[Alexander Neckam]]'s ''On the Natures of Things'', written in Paris around 1190.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara M. Kreutz, “Mediterranean Contributions to the Medieval Mariner's Compass,” ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 14, No. 3. (July 1973), p.368&lt;/ref&gt; It was either [[Compass#Question of diffusion|transmitted from China or the Arabs]] or an [[Compass#Question of independent European invention|independent European innovation]]. Dry compass were invented in the Mediterranean around 1300.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic C. Lane, “The Economic Meaning of the Invention of the Compass,” ''The American Historical Review'', Vol. 68, No. 3. (April 1963), p.615ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Compass|Astronomical compass]]''' (1269)

The French scholar [[Pierre de Maricourt]] describes in his experimental study ''Epistola de magnete'' (1269) three different compass designs he has devised for the purpose of astronomical observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1951|pp=2ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pintle and gudgeon rudder system scheme.svg|thumb|180px|Scheme of a sternpost-mounted medieval rudder]]
'''[[Rudder|Stern-mounted rudders]]''' (1180s)

The first depiction of a pintle-and-gudgeon rudder on church carvings dates to around 1180. They first appeared with [[Cog (ship)|cog]]s in the North and Baltic Seas and quickly spread to Mediterranean. The iron hinge system was the first stern rudder permanently attached to the ship hull and made a vital contribution to the navigation achievements of the [[age of discovery]] and thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautarch.tamu.edu/pdf-files/Mott-MA1991.pdf Lawrence V. Mott, ''The Development of the Rudder, A.D. 100-1600: A Technological Tale'', Thesis May 1991, Texas A&amp;M University]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Printing, paper and reading ===
'''[[Movable type]] [[printing press]]''' (1440s)

[[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s great innovation was not the printing itself, but instead of using carved plates as in [[woodblock printing]], he used separate letters (''types'') from which the printing plates for pages were made up. This meant the types were recyclable and a page cast could be made up far faster.

'''[[Paper]]''' (13th century)

Paper was invented in China and transmitted through Islamic Spain in the 13th century. In Europe, the paper-making processes was mechanized by water-powered mills and paper presses (see [[paper mill]]).

[[File:Friedrich Herlin, Reading Saint Peter (1466).jpg|thumb|180px|Reading [[Saint Peter]] with eyeglasses (1466)]]

'''[[Rotating bookmark]]''' (13th century)

A rotating disc and string device used to mark the page, column, and precise level in the text where a person left off reading in a text.  Materials used were often leather, velum, or paper.

'''[[Spectacles]]''' (1280s)

The first spectacles, invented in Florence, used convex lenses which were of help only to the far-sighted. Concave lenses were not developed prior to the 15th century.

'''[[Watermark]]''' (1282)

This medieval innovation was used to mark paper products and to discourage counterfeiting. It was first introduced in [[Bologna]], Italy.

=== Science and learning ===

'''[[Theory of impetus]]''' (6th century)

A scientific theory that was introduced by [[John Philoponus]] who made criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics, and it served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as to [[Galileo Galilei]]  who ten centuries later, during the [[Scientific Revolution]], extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case as to why Aristotelian physics was flawed. It is the intellectual precursor to the concepts of [[inertia]], [[momentum]] and [[acceleration]] in [[classical mechanics]].

'''[[Arabic numerals]]''' (13th century)

The first recorded mention in Europe was in 976, and they were first widely published in 1202 by [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] with his ''Liber Abaci''.

'''[[University]]'''

The first [[medieval universities]] were founded between the 11th and 13th centuries leading to a rise in literacy and learning. By 1500, the institution had spread throughout most of Europe and played a key role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. Today, the educational concept and institution has been globally adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1970|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Textile industry and garments ===
'''[[button|Functional button]]''' (13th century)

German buttons appeared in 13th-century Germany as an indigenous innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn White: "The Act of Invention: Causes, Contexts, Continuities and Consequences", ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 3, No. 4 (Autumn, 1962), pp. 486-500 (497f. &amp; 500)&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became widespread with the rise of snug-fitting clothing.

'''[[Loom|Horizontal loom]]''' (11th century)

Horizontal looms operated by foot-treadles were faster and more efficient.

'''[[Silk]]''' (6th century)

Manufacture of silk began in Eastern Europe in the 6th century and in Western Europe in the 11th or 12th century. Silk had been imported over the [[Silk Road]] since antiquity. The technology of "silk throwing" was mastered in Tuscany in the 13th century. The silk works used waterpower and some regard these as the first mechanized textile mills.

'''[[Spinning wheel]]''' (13th century)

Brought to Europe probably from India.

[[File:KnightsTemplarPlayingChess1283.jpg|thumb|right|[[Knights Templar]] playing chess, ''[[Libro de los juegos]]'' (1283)]]
'''[[Chess]]''' (1450)

The earliest predecessors of the game originated in 6th-century AD India and spread via Persia and the Muslim world to Europe. Here the game evolved into its current form in the 15th century.

'''[[Forest glass]]''' (c. 1000)

This type of glass uses [[wood ash]] and sand as the main raw materials and is characterised by a variety of greenish-yellow colours.

'''[[Grindstone (tool)|Grindstone]]s''' (834)

Grindstones are a rough stone, usually sandstone, used to sharpen iron. The first rotary grindstone (turned with a leveraged handle) occurs in the ''[[Utrecht Psalter]]'', illustrated between 816 and 834.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 110"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hägermann, the pen drawing is a copy of a late-antique manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hägermann|Schneider|1997|pp=425f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second crank which was mounted on the other end of the axle is depicted in the ''[[Luttrell Psalter]]'' from around 1340.&lt;ref name="White, Jr. 1962, 111"&gt;{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Liquor]]''' (12th century)

Primitive forms of distillation were known to the [[Babylonia]]ns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Levey |first=Martin |title=Chemistry and Chemical Technology in Ancient Mesopotamia |date=1959 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |page=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=76ILAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Indians in the first centuries AD.&lt;ref name="habib"&gt;[[Irfan Habib]] (2011), [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&amp;pg=PA55 ''Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500'', page 55], [[Pearson Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Early evidence of distillation also comes from [[Alchemy|alchemists]] working in [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]], [[Roman Egypt]], in the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Forbes1970"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Robert James|title=A short history of the art of distillation: from the beginnings up to the death of Cellier Blumenthal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|accessdate=29 June 2010|year=1970|publisher=BRILL|pages=57, 89|isbn=978-90-04-00617-1|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220084813/http://books.google.com/books?id=XeqWOkKYn28C|archivedate=20 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|medieval Arabs]] adopted the distillation process,&lt;ref name="Gorak"&gt;{{cite book|title=Distillation: Fundamentals and Principles|page=5-10|editor=Andrzej Gorak, Eva Sorensen|publisher=Academic Press|year=2014|isbn=9780123865489}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later spread to Europe. Texts on the distillation of waters, wine, and other spirits were written in [[Salerno]] and [[Cologne]] in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Gorak" /&gt;

Liquor consumption rose dramatically in Europe in and after the mid-14th century, when distilled liquors were commonly used as remedies for the [[Black Death]]. These spirits would have had a much lower [[Alcohol by volume|alcohol content]] (about 40% ABV) than the alchemists' pure distillations, and they were likely first thought of as medicinal [[elixir]]s. Around 1400, methods to distill spirits from wheat, barley, and rye were discovered. Thus began the [[List of national liquors|"national" drinks]] of Europe, including  [[gin]] (England) and ''[[grappa]]'' (Italy). In 1437, "burned water" ([[brandy]]) was mentioned in the records of the [[County of Katzenelnbogen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com/begriffe.html graf-von-katzenelnbogen.com], ''Trinkglas.''&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''[[Magnet]]s''' (12th century)

Magnets were first referenced in the ''[[Roman d'Enéas]]'', composed between 1155 and 1160.

'''[[Mirror]]s''' (1180)

The first mention of a "glass" mirror is in 1180 by [[Alexander Neckham]] who said "Take away the lead which is behind the [[glass]] and there will be no image of the one looking in."

'''Illustrated surgical atlas''' (1345)

Guido da Vigevano (c. 1280 − 1349) was the first author to add illustrations to his anatomical descriptions. His ''Anathomia'' provides [[picture]]s of [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomical]] structures and techniques such as the dissection of the head by means of [[trephination]], and depictions of the [[meninges]], [[cerebrum]], and [[spinal cord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Di Ieva|2007|pp=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Quarantine]]''' (1377)

Initially a 40-day-period, the quarantine was introduced by the [[Republic of Ragusa]] as a measure of disease prevention related to the [[Black Death]]. It was later adopted by Venice from where the practice spread all around in Europe.

'''[[Mouse trap|Rat trap]]s''' (1170s)

The first mention of a rat trap is in the medieval romance ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]'' by [[Chrétien de Troyes]].

'''[[Soap]]''' (9th century)

Soap came into widespread European use in the 9th century in semi-liquid form, with hard soap perfected by the Arabs in the 12th century.

== Military technologies ==

=== Armour ===
'''[[Gambeson|Quilted Armour]]''' (pre 5th - 14th Century)

There was a vast amount of armour technology available through the 5th to 16th centuries. 
Most soldiers during this time wore padded or quilted armor. This was the cheapest and most available armor for the majority of soldiers. Quilted armour was usually just a jacket made of thick linen and wool meant to pad or soften the impact of blunt weapons and light blows. Although, this technology predated the 5th century, it was still extremely prevalent because of the low cost and the weapon technology at the time made the bronze armor of the Greeks and Romans obsolete. Quilted armour was also used in conjunction with other types of armour. Usually worn over or under leather, mail, and later plate armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=72|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Boiled_leather|Cuir Bouilli]]''' (5th-10th Century)

Hardened leather armour also called Cuir Bouilli was a step up from quilted armour. Made by boiling leather in either water, wax or oil to soften it so it can be shaped, it would then be allowed to dry and become very hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flank|first1=Lenny|title=A History of European Armor|journal=Hidden History|date=May 24, 2016|url=https://lflank.wordpress.com/2016/05/24/a-history-of-european-armor/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large pieces of armour could be made such as breast plates, helmets, and leg guards, but many times smaller pieces would be sewn into the quilting of quilted armour or strips would be sewn together on the outside of a linen jacket. This was not as affordable as the quilted armour but offered much better protection against edged slashing weapons.

'''[[Chain mail|Chain Mail]]''' (11th-16th Century)

The most common type during the 11th through the 16th centuries was the '''[[Hauberk]]''', also known earlier than the 11th century as the Carolingian byrnie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technologies|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=64|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Made of interlinked rings of metal, it sometimes consisted of a coif that covered the head and a tunic that covered the torso, arms, and legs down to the knees. Chain mail was very effective at protecting against light slashing blows but ineffective against stabbing or thrusting blows. The great advantage was that it allowed a great freedom of movement and was relatively light with significant protection over quilted or hardened leather armour. It was far more expensive than the hardened leather or quilted armour because of the massive amount of labor it required to create. This made it unattainable for most soldiers and only the more wealthy soldiers could afford it. Later, toward the end of the 13th century '''[[banded mail]]''' became popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed of washer shaped rings of iron overlapped and woven together by straps of leather as opposed to the interlinked metal rings of chain mail, banded mail was much more affordable to manufacture. The washers were so tightly woven together that it was very difficult penetrate and offered greater protection from arrow and bolt attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|pages=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Banded_Mail_Armour.jpg|thumb|right|Banded Mail Armour Construction]]

'''[[Jazerant]]''' (11th century)

The Jazerant or Jazeraint was an adaptation of chain mail in which the chain mail would be sewn in between layers of linen or quilted armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Andre-Driussi|first1=Micheal|title=Lexicon Urthus|date=2008|publisher=Sirius Fiction|isbn=0964279517|page=192|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceptional protection against light slashing weapons and slightly improved protection against small thrusting weapons, but little protection against large blunt weapons such as maces and axes. This gave birth to reinforced chain mail and became more prevalent in the 12th and 13th century. Reinforced armour was made up of chain mail with metal plates or hardened leather plates sewn in. This greatly improved protection from stabbing and thrusting blows. 

'''[[Scale Armour]]''' (12th century)

A type of '''[[Lamellar armour]]''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medievil Militay Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=70|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made up entirely of small, overlapping plates. Either sewn together, usually with leather straps, or attached to a backing such as linen, or a quilted armor. Scale armour does not require the labor to produce that chain mail does and therefore is more affordable. It also affords much better protection against thrusting blows and pointed weapons. Though, it is much heavier, more restrictive and impedes free movement. 

[[File:KHM Wien S XIII - Jousting armour by Jörg and Lorenz Helmschmid front.jpg|thumb|180px|Jousting armor commissioned by [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1494]]

'''[[Plate armour|Plate Armour]]''' (14th century)

Plate armour covered the entire body. Although parts of the body were already covered in plate armour as early as 1250, such as the Poleyns for covering the knees and Couters - plates that protected the elbows,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first complete full suit without any textiles was seen around 1410-1430. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henry|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''[[Components of medieval armour]]''' that made up a full suit consisted of a cuirass, a gorget, vambraces, gauntlets, cuisses, greaves, and sabatons held together by internal leather straps. Improved weaponry such as crossbows and the long bow had greatly increased range and power. This made penetration of the chain mail hauberk much easier and more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=DeVries|first1=Kelly|last2=Smith|first2=Robert Douglas|title=Medieval Military Technology|date=2012|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Canada|isbn=978-1-4426-0497-1|page=74|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1400's most plate was worn alone and without the need of a hauberk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashdown|first1=Charles Henery|title=European Arms &amp; Armour|date=1967|publisher=Brussel &amp; Brussel|location=New York|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advances in metal working such as the blast furnace and new techniques for carburizing made plate armour nearly impenetrable and the best armour protection available at the time. Although plate armour was fairly heavy, because each suit was custom tailored to the wearer, it was very easy to move around in. A full suit of plate armour was extremely expensive and mostly unattainable for the majority of soldiers. Only very wealthy land owners and nobility could afford it. The quality of plate armour increases as more armour makers became more proficient in metal working. A suit of plate armour became a symbol of social status and the best made were personalized with embellishments and engravings. Plate armour saw continued use in battle until the 17th century.

=== Cavalry ===
'''[[Saddle|Arched saddle]]''' (11th century)

The arched saddle enabled mounted [[knight]]s to wield [[lance]]s underarm and prevent the charge from turning into an unintentional pole-vault. This innovation gave birth to true shock [[cavalry]], enabling fighters to charge on full gallop.

'''[[Spur]]s''' (11th century)

Spurs were invented by the Normans and appeared at the same time as the cantled saddle. They enabled the horseman to control his horse with his feet, replacing the whip and leaving his arms free. Rowel spurs familiar from cowboy films were already known in the 13th century. Gilded spurs were the ultimate symbol of the knighthood - even today someone is said to "earn his spurs" by proving his or her worthiness.

'''[[Stirrup]]''' (6th century)

Stirrups were invented by steppe nomads in what is today Mongolia and northern China in the 4th century. They were introduced in Byzantium in the 6th century and in the Carolingian Empire in the 8th. They allowed a mounted knight to wield a sword and strike from a distance leading to a great advantage for mounted cavalry.

=== Gunpowder weapons ===
'''[[Cannon]]''' (1324)

Cannons are first recorded in Europe at the siege of Metz in 1324. In 1350 [[Petrarch]] wrote "these instruments which discharge balls of metal with most tremendous noise and flashes of fire...were a few years ago very rare and were viewed with greatest astonishment and admiration, but now they are become as common and familiar as any other kinds of arms."&lt;ref name="Matheus 1996, 346"/&gt;

'''[[Volley gun]]'''

See [[Ribauldequin]].

'''[[Gunpowder|Corned gunpowder]]''' (late 14th century)

First practiced in Western Europe, corning the black powder allowed for more powerful and faster ignition of cannons. It also facilitated the storage and transportation of black powder. Corning constituted a crucial step in the evolution of gunpowder warfare.

[[File:Mons Meg, Medieval Bombard, Edinburgh, Scotland. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|180px|Scottish bombard [[Mons Meg]]]]
'''[[Supergun]]''' (late 14th century)

Extant examples include the wrought-iron [[Pumhart von Steyr]], [[Dulle Griet]] and [[Mons Meg]] as well as the cast-bronze [[Faule Mette]] and [[Faule Grete]] (all from the 15th century).

=== Mechanical artillery ===
'''[[Trebuchet|Counterweight trebuchet]]''' (12th century)

Powered solely by the force of gravity, these catapults revolutionized medieval siege warfare and construction of fortifications by hurling huge stones unprecedented distances. Originating somewhere in the eastern Mediterranean basin, counterweight trebuchets were introduced in the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 1100 CE, and was later adopted by the [[Crusader states]] and as well by the other armies of Europe and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf Paul E. Chevedden, "The Invention of the Counterweight Trebuchet: A Study in Cultural Diffusion", ''Dumbarton Oaks Papers'', No. 54 (2000), pp.71-116 (104f.)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205183303/http://www.doaks.org/DOP54/DP54ch4.pdf |date=2007-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Missile weapons ===
'''[[Greek fire]]''' (7th century)

An incendiary weapon which could even burn on water is also attributed to the Byzantines where they installed it on their ships. It played a crucial role in the Byzantine Empire's victory over the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] during the [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)]]

'''[[Grenade]]''' (8th century) [[File:Liquid fire granades Chania.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Ceramic grenades that were filled with Greek fire, surrounded by [[caltrop]]s, 10th–12th century, [[National Historical Museum (Greece)|National Historical Museum]], Athens, Greece]]

Rudimentary incendiary grenades appeared in the [[Byzantine Empire]], as the Byzantine soldiers learned that [[Greek fire]], a Byzantine invention of the previous century, could not only be thrown by [[flamethrower]]s at the enemy, but also in stone and ceramic jars. 

'''[[English longbow|Longbow]] with massed, disciplined archery''' (13th century)

Having a high rate of fire and penetration power, the longbow contributed to the eventual demise of the medieval [[knight]] class{{dubious|date=July 2016}}. Used particularly by the English to great effect against the French cavalry during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1337–1453).

'''[[Arbalest|Steel crossbow]]''' (late 14th century)

European innovation. Came with several different cocking aids to enhance draw power, making the weapons also the first hand-held mechanical crossbows.

=== Miscellaneous ===
'''[[Combined arms]] tactics''' (14th century)

The [[battle of Halidon Hill]] 1333 was the first battle where intentional and disciplined combined arms infantry tactics were employed.{{dubious|date=October 2012}} The English men-at-arms dismounted aside the archers, combining thus the staying power of super-heavy infantry and striking power of their two-handed weapons with the missiles and mobility of the archers using longbows and shortbows
. Combining dismounted knights and men-at-arms with archers was the archetypal Western Medieval battle tactics until the [[battle of Flodden]] 1513 and final emergence of firearms.

In [[quantum gravity]], the [[phase space]] is infinite dimensional as we are dealing with a field theory. An approximation which is sometimes taken is to only consider the largest wavelength modes of the order of the size of the universe when studying [[cosmological model]]s. This is the '''minisuperspace''' approximation. The validity of this approximation holds as long as the [[adiabatic approximation]] holds.

An example would be to only consider the scale factor and Hubble constant for a [[Friedman-Robertson-Walker]] model in minisuperspace model&lt;ref&gt;N. Pinto-Neto and J. C. Fabris, Classical and Quantum Gravity 30, 143001 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Pinto-Neto, F. T. Falciano, R. Pereira, and E. S. Santini, Phys. Rev. D 86, 063504 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. P. Kim, Phys. Lett. A 236, 11 (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; the small true vacuum bubble which is nearly spherical with one single parameter of the scalar factor a is described as minisuperspace. It plays a significant role in the explanation of the origin of universe as a bubble in quantum cosmological theory.&lt;ref&gt;A. Vilenkin, Phys. Rev. D 50, 2581 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hajn was first a founder and chief designer at [[Avia]], along with [[Pavel Beneš]], in 1919.  The two began repairing planes in a workshop within the complex of an old sugar factory in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="aviahistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avia-as.com/index.php?m=17|title=AVIA: History|publisher=AVIA|accessdate=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One year later, they designed their first two-seater plane, the [[Avia BH-1]].  From 1923 to 1925, the two developed the [[Avia BH-7]], [[Avia BH-9|BH-9]], and [[Avia BH-11|BH-11]] monoplanes, launching the era of biplane fighters.  The BH-11 won the [[Coppa d' Italia]] prize.  Three years later, their [[Avia BH-21]] fighter was considered one of the world's best planes.&lt;ref name="czechinvest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.czechinvest.org/data/files/aerospace-2008-99-en.pdf|title=Aerospace Industry in the Czech Republic|publisher=CzechInvest|accessdate=31 January 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203120101/http://www.czechinvest.org/data/files/aerospace-2008-99-en.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neofunctionalism''' is the perspective that all [[Social integration|integration]] is the result of past integration. The term may also be used to literally describe a [[social theory]] that is 'post' traditional [[structural functionalism]]. Whereas theorists such as [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]] openly appropriated the term,&lt;ref&gt;A. Ruth Wallace &amp; Alision Wolf, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory '', New Jersey, Pearson Education, 2006 (6th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; others, such as the [[post-structuralist]] philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], have been categorized as contemporary functionalists by their critics.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1985), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, p268&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Functionalism in international relations theory was developed by David Mitrany. International relations neofunctionalism was developed by [[Ernst B. Haas|Ernst Haas]] in the 1960s to give a formal explanation to the work of [[Jean Monnet]] (1888–1979).

==Parsonian Thinking==

In [[sociology]], neofunctionalism represents a revival of the thought of [[Talcott Parsons]] by [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]], who sees neofunctionalism as having 5 central tendencies:
*to create a form of structural functionalism that is multidimensional and includes micro as well as macro levels of analysis
*to push functionalism to the left and reject Parsons’s optimism about [[modernity]]
*to argue for an implicit democratic thrust in functional analysis
*to incorporate a conflict orientation, and
*to emphasize uncertainty and interactional creativity.

While Parsons consistently viewed actors as analytical concepts, Alexander defines action as the movement of concrete, living, breathing persons as they make their way through time and space. In addition he argues that every action contains a dimension of [[free will]], by which he is expanding functionalism to include some of the concerns of symbolic [[interactionism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ruth Wallace &amp; Alision Wolf, ''Contemporary Sociological Theory '', New Jersey, Pearson Education, 2006 (6th ed.), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil J. Smelser]] sets out to establish the concept of ambivalence as an essential element of understanding individual behavior and social institutions. His approach, based on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]’s theory, takes intrapsychic processes rather than roles at the starting point. He sees ambivalence (to hold opposing affective orientations toward the same person object or symbol) as most applicable in situations where persons are dependent on one another. The common element of dependency is in his opinion that freedom to leave is restricted because it is costly either politically, ideologically or emotionally. Thus dependence entails [[entrapment]]. Following his views on ambivalence, Smelser argues that attitude surveys should be seen as distorted structures of reality that minimize and delegitimizes ambiguity and ambivalence.

==Niklas Luhmann's Objection==
[[Niklas Luhmann]] sees Parsons’ theory as missing the concepts of [[self-reference]] and complexity. Self-reference is a condition for the efficient functioning of systems. It means that a system is able to observe itself, can reflect on itself and can make decisions as a result of this reflection. In Luhmann’s theory, the chief task performed by social systems is to reduce complexity, which brings more choices and more possibilities; it takes more noes to reach a "yes". [[Religion]] or functional equivalents in modern society can provide actors with shared standards of action accepted on [[faith]], which allow complex sets of interactions to proceed in a world that would otherwise be chaotic and incomprehensible.

Furthermore Luhmann makes the distinction between risk, a potential harm threatening an individual that is based on a decision made by the individual, and danger, a potential harm to which an individual is passively exposed. The critical difference between the decision maker and the people affected by the decision is that what is a risk for one is a danger for the other. Whereas people in primitive societies were threatened primarily by dangers, people in modern society are threatened primarily by risks caused by our dependency on the decision makers.

The '''Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment''' ('''OGLE''') is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[astronomy|astronomical]] project based at the [[University of Warsaw]] that runs a long-term variability sky survey (1992-present). Main goals are the detection and classification of variable stars ([[Pulsating variable|pulsating]] and [[Eclipsing variable stars|eclipsing]]), discoveries of the [[microlensing]] events, [[Dwarf nova|dwarf novae]], studies of the [[Galaxy]] structure and the [[Magellanic Clouds]]. Since the project began in 1992, it has discovered multitude of [[extrasolar planet]]s, together with a first planet discovered using [[transit method]] ([[OGLE-TR-56b]]) and [[Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets#Gravitational_microlensing|gravitational microlensing]] method. The project from its inception is led by Prof. [[Andrzej Udalski]].

== Description ==

The main targets of the experiment are the [[Magellanic Clouds]] and the [[Galactic Bulge]], because of the large number of intervening stars that can be used for microlensing during a stellar [[Astronomical transit|transit]]. Most of the observations have been made at the [[Las Campanas Observatory]] in [[Chile]]. Cooperating institutions include [[Princeton University]] and the [[Carnegie Institution]].

The project is now in its fourth phase. The first phase, OGLE-I (1992–1995), was the project pilot phase; for OGLE-II (1996–2000), a [[telescope]] was specially constructed, placed in Las Campanas Observatory and dedicated to the project. The 8-chip mosaic CCD camera was built in Poland and shipped to Chile. OGLE-III (2001–2009) was primarily devoted to detecting [[gravitational microlensing]] events and transiting planets in four fields: the [[Galactic Bulge]], the constellation [[Carina (constellation)|Carina]],&lt;ref name="Loeillet 2008"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Udalski | first1 = A. | title = The Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment. Real Time Data Analysis Systems in the OGLE-III Survey | year = 2003 | journal = [[Acta Astronomica]] | volume = 53 | pages = 291| bibcode = 2003AcA....53..291U | arxiv=astro-ph/0401123}}&lt;/ref&gt; and toward both [[Magellanic Clouds]]. As a byproduct of the constant monitoring of hundreds of millions of stars, the largest catalogs of variable stars were constructed, and the first exoplanets discovered using the microlensing technique were detected. In 2010, following engineering work in 2009, the fourth and current phase, OGLE-IV, was started using a 32-chip mosaic CCD camera. The main goal for this phase is to increase the number of planetary detections using microlensing, enabled by the new camera.

Recently the OGLE team, in cooperation with scientists mostly from USA, New Zealand and Japan, proved that small, Earth-like planets can exist in great distance from stars around which they revolve despite there being other stars near them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fnp.org.pl/laureaci-fnp-odkryli-zimna-ziemie/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/345/6192/46.abstract#aff-17&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planets discovered ==

At least seventeen planets have so far been discovered by the OGLE project. Eight of the planets were discovered by the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Transit method|transit method]] and six by the [[Methods of detecting extrasolar planets#Gravitational microlensing|gravitational microlensing method]].

Planets are shown in the order of discovery. Planets in multiple-planet systems are highlighted in yellow. Please note that list below may not be complete.

The '''Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council''' ('''PPARC''') was one of a number of [[research council]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. It directed, coordinated and funded research in [[particle physics]] and [[astronomy]] for the people of the UK. Its head office was at Polaris House in [[Swindon]], [[Wiltshire]], but it also operated three scientific sites: the [[UK Astronomy Technology Centre]] (UK ATC) in Edinburgh, the [[Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes]] (ING) in La Palma and the [[Joint Astronomy Centre]] (JAC) in Hawaii. It published the ''Frontiers'' magazine three times a year, containing news and highlights of the research and outreach programmes it supports.

The PPARC was formed in April 1994 when the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] was split into several organizations; other products of the split included the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] (EPSRC) and the [[Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council]] (BBSRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Donald W.

The ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' provides that any named [[taxon]] in the family group, genus group, or species group have a [[name-bearing type]] which allows the name of the taxon to be objectively applied. The type does not define the taxon: that is done by a taxonomist; and an indefinite number of competing definitions can exist side by sided . Rather, a type is a point of reference.  A name has a type, and a taxonomist (having defined the taxon) can determine which existing types fall within the scope of the taxon. He or she can then use the rules in the Code to determine the [[valid name (zoology)|valid name]] for the taxon.

"[[Horizon 2020]]", the [[European Commission]]'s program for science funding announced in 2013, made RRI a main focus.&lt;ref name="sciencemag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/01/be-responsible-researcher-reach-out-and-listen |title=To be a responsible researcher, reach out and listen |last=Pain |first=Elisabeth |date=2017-01-17 |access-date=2018-11-14 |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it was suggested that the "broader impacts" criteria of the [[National Science Foundation]] were, despite certain dissimilarities, in effect coming to resemble RRI standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis |first1=Michael |last2=Laas |first2=Kelly |title="Broader Impacts" or "Responsible Research and Innovation"?

One area in which RRI principles are being applied is [[quantum computing]]. A research collaboration led by [[Oxford University]] within the [[UK National Quantum Technologies Programme]] aims to reveal how quantum computing can be socially and economically transformative, and to identify the potential downsides of the "[[disruptive innovation|disruption]]" it might bring about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/NQITRRI/index.html |title=Responsible Research and Innovation in Networked Quantum IT |website=[[University of Oxford]], Department of Computer Science |access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the criticisms voiced about RRI, prominent concerns include the vagueness of the terminology, the possibility of discouraging [[blue skies research]] and the lack of sufficient practical reward for embracing RRI in a research culture based on competition and short-term contracts.&lt;ref name="sciencemag" /&gt;

'''Rodolfo Gambini''' (born May 11, 1946) is a physicist and professor of the [[Universidad de la Republica]] in Montevideo, [[Uruguay]] and a visiting professor at the [[Horace Hearne Institute]] for Theoretical Physics at the [[Louisiana State University]].

He works on [[loop quantum gravity]]. He got his PhD in [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University (University of Paris 6)|Université de Paris VI]] working with [[Achilles Papapetrou]]. From there he moved to the [[Universidad Simón Bolívar]] in Venezuela where he rose through the professorial ranks. It was there that together with fellow physicist [[Antoni Trías]] he invented the loop representation for [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang-Mills theories]] in 1986.

Gambini returned to Uruguay in 1987 after democracy had returned to the country. Gambini has published over 100 scientific articles ranging from philosophy of science and foundations of quantum mechanics to lattice gauge theories to quantum gravity. He was head of the Pedeciba, the main funding agency for basic sciences in Uruguay (2003–2008). He is a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for Advancement of Science, a member of the Third World Academy of Sciences, the Latin American Academy of Sciences and the Academy of Exact and Natural Sciences of Argentina. He is the 2003 winner of the Third World Academ of Sciences prize in physics and has received numerous distinctions in Uruguay. In particular he was awarded the 2004 Presidential Medal of Science, the Prize to the Intellectual Work in 2011 and made an honorary doctorate of the University of the Republic in 2010.

In recent years he has studied issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics, having developed the Montevideo Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics. He also found the exact solution of the quantum Einstein equations in loop quantum gravity for vacuum spherically symmetric space-times, which resolves the singularity inside black holes.

Gambini is a recipient of the 2003 [[TWAS Prize]].&lt;ref name="Prizes and Awards"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://twas.org/opportunities/prizes-and-awards |title=Prizes and Awards |date=2016 |publisher=The World Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3083">A '''scintillating bolometer''' (or luminescent bolometer) is a [[scientific instrument]] used [[particle physics]] in the search for events with low energy deposition. These events could include [[dark matter]], low energy [[solar neutrinos]], [[double beta decay]] or rare [[radioactive decay]]. It works by simultaneously measuring both the light pulse and heat pulse generated by a particle interaction within its internal [[scintillator]] crystal. The device was&lt;ref&gt;http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?198809032&lt;/ref&gt; originally proposed by L. Gonzalez-Mestres and D. Perret-Gallix (LAPP, IN2P3/CNRS)

In their &lt;ref&gt;http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/21/000/21000903.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; rapporteur contribution to the Proceedings of the XXIV International Conference on High-Energy Physics, Munich, August 1988, Gonzalez-Mestres and Perret-Gallix wrote :

''Perhaps bolometry should in some cases be combined with other detection techniques (luminescence?) in order to produce a primary fast signal as timing strobe. If light is used as a complementary signature, particle identification can be achieved through the heat-light ratio, where nucleus recoil is expected to be less luminescent than ionizing particles. The success of such a development would open the way to unprecedented achievements in background rejection for rare event experiments.''

Further explanations, including a description of the detector and possible applications incorporating in particular BGO and tungstates, were given by these authors in other papers such as [http://ccdb5fs.kek.jp/cgi-bin/img/allpdf?200033910 their contribution] to the March 1989 Moriond Meeting (pages 16-18).

The luminescent bolometer has since then been developed by scientists from several groups, including the [[CNRS]] Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale and [[University of Zaragoza]] collaboration in view of the proposed [[ROSEBUD]] particle detector experiment in the [[Canfranc Underground Laboratory]]. Rosebud uses a [[bismuth germanate]] ([[bismuth|Bi]]{{sub|4}}[[Germanium|Ge]]{{sub|3}}[[Oxygen|O]]{{sub|12}}, "BGO") detector crystal. 

The CRESST collaboration [http://www.cresst.de/cresst.php is currently using] the same kind of device with CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; crystals in an experiment to detect dark matter at [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso]].

Within the context of [[sociology]], and as defined by Webster and Driskell,&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster Jr |first=Murray |author2=James E. Driskell Jr |title=Status Generalization: A Review and Some New Data|journal=American Sociological Review|date=April 1978|volume=43|issue=2|pages=220–236|jstor=2094700|doi=10.2307/2094700}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''status generalization''' is "the process by which statuses of actors external to a particular interaction are imported and allowed to determine important features of that interaction."  As an example, Webster and Driskell cite the tendency of white male executives to rise to leadership within a group even when their executive skills are not relevant to the group's task.&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;

==Research==
Status generalization is highly researched when looking into racism, discrimination, and the stereotyping that results from this. Brezina and Winder (2003)&lt;ref name=Brezina&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brezina|first=Timothy|author2=Kenisha Winder |title=Economic Disadvantage, Status Generalization, and Negative Racial Stereotyping By White Americans|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|date=December 2003|volume=66|issue=4|pages=402|doi=10.2307/1519837}}&lt;/ref&gt; researched whites’ racial stereotyping of blacks and the association between blacks and lower socioeconomic statuses. They found that negative racial stereotyping is fueled by the continuing association between race and economic disadvantage, that “if blacks continue to fall behind economically, then they must not be trying hard enough”.&lt;ref name=Brezina/&gt; The results of their research shows that the mere awareness that whites have about the relatively disadvantaged position blacks are in contributes to the negative stereotyping and thus contributes to negative status generalization when within groups.

The dissertation done by Monroe illustrates how hierarchies of status are created and become legitimized. The dissertation particularly focuses on the situation in where a low status person gains legitimate authority or power in higher status positions. They theory was tested using an experiment designed to have two by two groups working on cooperative tasks. One of the pair was a confederate trying to display dominant characteristics and the reactions to the dominant behaviors served as the dependent variable in the study. Results of the study show that performance evaluation had an effect on influence and status consistency.&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, P. T.Creating a legitimated power and prestige order: The impact of status consistency and performance evaluations on expectations for competence and status. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A: Humanities and Social Sciences, , 3207-3207. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/619962300&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
The concept of status generalization can be applied particularly when looking at groups that are task oriented.  Group members' external status (race, age, gender, or occupation) may determine their roles within the group more than their particular skills to achieve the group's goals.&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;

Modern social psychologists have taken interest in the underpinnings of status generalization. The expression of status generalization is salient in everyday life, but motives have remained relatively ambiguous. Researchers Oldmeadow, Platow, &amp; Foddy present an explanation, “the underlying psychological process that gives rise to (status generalization) in naturally occurring task-groups is psychological group formation, understood as self-categorization and social identification with other task-group members.”&lt;ref&gt;Oldmeadow, J., Platow, M. J., &amp; Foddy, M. (2005). Task-groups as self-categories: A social identity perspective on status generalization. Current Research in Social Psychology, 10(18) Retrieved from http://www.uiowa.edu/~grpproc/crisp/crisp.10.18.html&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers remind readers that people naturally identify with others due to characteristics such as SES, race, and gender. After identifying with others, people establish a pecking order that predicts group influence such as speaking order and command of topic.

When people are put into task groups and physical status characteristics are made salient (skin color, age, social economic status), those individuals with the best perceived characteristics are more likely to be rewarded with more power and prestige.  Even when status characteristics are irrelevant to the task at hand they still have an effect the role one is given. Those who have the skills that are relevant to a task are often over looked if they are a minority and too much emphasis can be placed on someone in the group if they are of a high status outside of the group; even if the skills that they have are irrelevant to the task.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4857">The '''Super High Altitude Research Project''' (Super HARP, SHARP) was a U.S. government project conducting research into the firing of high-velocity projectiles high into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] using a two-stage [[light-gas gun]], with the ultimate goal of propelling satellites into [[Earth orbit]]. Design work on the prototype [[space gun]] began as early as 1985 at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in California and became operational in December 1992.&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/sharp.html|title=SHARP at Encyclopedia Astronautica|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest gas gun in the world.&lt;ref name="pop-sci"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1277296.html?page=1|title=The Jules Verne Gun|magazine=Popular Science|date=April 1998|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc.|accessdate=2009-09-03}}{{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and operation==
Rather than a single straight barrel, the SHARP gun uses an L-shape design with 2 separate sections; the {{convert|270|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} long steel combustion section &amp; pump tube section is connected to the {{convert|155|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} long launch tube (or barrel) at a [[right angle]]. 100-ton rail-mounted sleds sit at both ends of the pump tube to absorb recoil energy from firing and a smaller 10-ton sled is mounted on a perpendicular set of tracks at the aft-end of the launch-tube near the junction point.&lt;ref name="pop-sci" /&gt;

The firing sequence begins with the ignition of a [[methane]] gas mixture in the combustion section behind the piston at the far end of the pump tube. The resultant explosion rapidly drives the 1-ton [[steel]] piston down the pump tube and further compresses the pre-pressurized [[hydrogen]] gas that fills the other end of the pump tube.  As the piston accelerates toward the junction point, it rapidly compresses the hydrogen gas in the pump tube to a pressure of {{convert|60000|psi|atm|abbr=on|adj=on}}. The small projectile, meanwhile, rests in the adjacent depressurized launch tube. As the hydrogen gas reaches maximum pressure, a coupling holding the projectile in place is destroyed and the hydrogen drives the projectile down a 4-in diameter barrel at extremely high velocities until it bursts through a thin plastic sheet covering the end of the gun. All recoil forces are absorbed by the rail-mounted sleds as they are propelled outwards along their tracks.&lt;ref name="pop-sci" /&gt;

==Tests and cancellation==
Headed by [[John Hunter (scientist)|John Hunter]], the SHARP gun fired projectiles using expanding [[hydrogen]] and achieved velocities of {{convert|3|km/s|mph|abbr=on|adj=on}} or [[mach number|Mach]] 8.8 for {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on|adj=on}} projectiles. Had the project continued, there were plans to elevate the tube and begin space launch trials potentially reaching speeds of up to {{convert|7|km/s|mph|abbr=on|adj=on}}, or about Mach 21.&lt;ref name="astronautix" /&gt;

The tests were designed as a precursor to the "''Jules Verne Launcher''," an even larger light-gas gun with a {{convert|3500|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} barrel length designed in the early 1990s{{ref|Hunter}} for first-stage [[satellite]] launch. This was to cost $1 billion, but funding was not forthcoming and the project was eventually canceled in 1995. However, the SHARP gun continued to be used for high-speed tests in other areas of research, such as [[scramjet]] development.&lt;ref name="astronautix" /&gt;

The concept of ballistic [[escape velocity]] is well proven.  The largest challenge is maintaining such high velocities, because air resistance and aerothermal heating will significantly slow down any such object.

'''Symmetries in quantum mechanics''' describe features of spacetime and particles which are unchanged under some transformation, in the context of [[quantum mechanics]], [[relativistic quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]], and with applications in the [[Standard Model (mathematical formulation)|mathematical formulation of the standard model]] and [[condensed matter physics]]. In general, [[symmetry in physics]], [[invariant (physics)|invariance]], and [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, are fundamentally important constraints for formulating [[Theoretical physics|physical theories]] and models. In practice, they are powerful methods for solving problems and predicting what can happen. While conservation laws do not always give the answer to the problem directly, they form the correct constraints and the first steps to solving a multitude of problems.

This article outlines the connection between the classical form of [[Continuous symmetry|continuous symmetries]] as well as their [[operator (physics)|quantum operators]], and relates them to the [[Lie group]]s, and relativistic transformations in the [[Lorentz group]] and [[Poincaré group]].

==Notation==

The notational conventions used in this article are as follows. Boldface indicates [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s, [[four vector]]s, [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]], and [[tensor operator|vectorial operators]], while [[quantum state]]s use [[bra–ket notation]]. Wide hats are for [[operator (physics)|operators]], narrow hats are for [[unit vector]]s (including their components in [[tensor index notation]]). The [[Einstein notation|summation convention]] on the repeated [[tensor index notation|tensor indices]] is used, unless stated otherwise. The [[Minkowski metric]] [[metric signature|signature]] is (+−−−).

==Symmetry transformations on the wavefunction in non-relativistic quantum mechanics==

===Continuous symmetries===

Generally, the correspondence between continuous symmetries and conservation laws is given by [[Noether's theorem]].

The form of the fundamental quantum operators, for example energy as a [[partial derivative|partial]] [[time derivative]] and momentum as a spatial [[gradient]], becomes clear when one considers the initial state, then changes one parameter of it slightly. This can be done for displacements (lengths), durations (time), and angles (rotations). Additionally, the invariance of certain quantities can be seen by making such changes in lengths and angles, which illustrates conservation of these quantities.

In what follows, transformations on only one-particle wavefunctions in the form:

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega}\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \psi(\mathbf{r}',t') &lt;/math&gt;

are considered, where &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega} &lt;/math&gt; denotes a [[unitary operator]]. Unitarity is generally required for operators representing transformations of space, time, and spin, since the norm of a state (representing the total probability of finding the particle somewhere with some spin) must be invariant under these transformations. The inverse is the [[Hermitian conjugate]] &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega}^{-1} = \widehat{\Omega}^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;. The results can be extended to many-particle wavefunctions. Written in [[Dirac notation]] as standard, the transformations on [[quantum state]] vectors are:

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega}\left|\mathbf{r}(t)\right\rangle = \left|\mathbf{r}'(t')\right\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

Now, the action of &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega} &lt;/math&gt; changes ''ψ''('''r''', ''t'') to ''ψ''('''r'''&amp;prime;, ''t''&amp;prime;), so the inverse &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega}^{-1} = \widehat{\Omega}^\dagger &lt;/math&gt; changes ''ψ''('''r'''&amp;prime;, ''t''&amp;prime;) back to ''ψ''('''r''', ''t''), so an operator &lt;math&gt; \widehat{A} &lt;/math&gt; invariant under &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\Omega} &lt;/math&gt; satisfies:

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{A}\psi = \widehat{\Omega}^\dagger\widehat{A}\widehat{\Omega}\psi \quad \Rightarrow \quad \widehat{\Omega}\widehat{A}\psi = \widehat{A}\widehat{\Omega}\psi &lt;/math&gt;

and thus:

:&lt;math&gt; [\widehat{\Omega},\widehat{A}]\psi = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

for any state ''ψ''. Quantum operators representing [[observables]] are also required to be [[Hermitian operator|Hermitian]] so that their [[eigenvalue]]s are [[real number]]s, i.e. the operator equals its [[Hermitian conjugate]], &lt;math&gt; \widehat{A} = \widehat{A}^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;.

===Overview of Lie group theory===

Following are the key points of group theory relevant to quantum theory, examples are given throughout the article. For an alternative approach using matrix groups, see the books of Hall&lt;ref&gt;

Let ''G'' be a ''[[Lie group]]'', which is a group that locally is [[Parametrization|parameterized]] by a finite number ''N'' of [[real number|real]] [[Continuous function|continuously varying]] parameters ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;. In more mathematical language, this means that ''G'' is a smooth [[manifold]] that is also a group, for which the group operations are smooth.
*the ''dimension of the group'', ''N'', is the number of parameters it has.
*the ''group [[element (mathematics)|element]]s'', ''g'', in ''G'' are [[function (mathematics)|function]]s of the parameters:
::&lt;math&gt;g = G(\xi_1, \xi_2, \cdots )&lt;/math&gt;
:and all parameters set to zero returns the ''[[identity element]]'' of the group:
::&lt;math&gt;I = G(0,0 \cdots )&lt;/math&gt;
:Group elements are often matrices which act on vectors, or transformations acting on functions.
*The ''generators of the group'' are the [[partial derivative]]s of the group elements with respect to the group parameters with the result evaluated when the parameter is set to zero:
::&lt;math&gt;X_j = \left. \frac{\partial g}{\partial \xi_j} \right|_{\xi_j = 0} &lt;/math&gt;
:In the language of manifolds, the generators are the elements of the tangent space to ''G'' at the identity. The generators are also known as infinitesimal group elements or as the elements of the [[Lie algebra]] of ''G''. (See the discussion below of the commutator.)
:One aspect of generators in theoretical physics is they can be construed themselves as operators corresponding to symmetries, which may be written as matrices, or as differential operators. In quantum theory, for [[unitary representation]]s of the group, the generators require a factor of ''i'':
::&lt;math&gt;X_j = i \left. \frac{\partial g}{\partial \xi_j} \right|_{\xi_j = 0} &lt;/math&gt;
:The generators of the group form a [[vector space]], which means [[linear combination]]s of generators also form a generator.
*The generators (whether matrices or differential operators) satisfy the ''[[commutator|commutation relations]]'':
::&lt;math&gt;\left[X_a,X_b\right] = i f_{abc}X_c&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''f&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the (basis dependent) ''[[structure constant]]s'' of the group. This makes, together with the vector space property, the set of all generators of a group a [[Lie algebra]]. Due to the [[antisymmetry]] of the bracket, the structure constants of the group are antisymmetric in the first two indices. 
*The ''[[group representation|representations of the group]]'' then describe the ways that the group ''G'' (or its Lie algebra) can act on a vector space. (The vector space might be, for example, the space of eigenvectors for a Hamiltonian having ''G'' as its symmetry group.) We denote the representations using a capital ''D''. One can then differentiate ''D'' to obtain a  representation of the Lie algebra, often also denoted by ''D''. These two representations are related as follows:
::&lt;math&gt;D[g(\xi_j)] \equiv D(\xi_j) = e^{ i \xi_j D(X_j)}&lt;/math&gt;
:''without'' [[Einstein notation|summation on the repeated index]] ''j''. Representations are linear operators that take in group elements and preserve the composition rule:
::&lt;math&gt; D(\xi_a)D(\xi_b) = D(\xi_a \xi_b). &lt;/math&gt;
A representation which cannot be decomposed into a [[direct sum]] of other representations, is called ''irreducible''. It is conventional to label [[irreducible representation]]s by a superscripted number ''n'' in brackets, as in ''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;, or if there is more than one number, we write ''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'', ''m'', ... )&lt;/sup&gt;.

There is an additional subtlety that arises in quantum theory, where two vectors that differ by multiplication by a scalar represent the same physical state. Here, the pertinent notion of representation is a [[projective representation]], one that only satisfies the composition law up to a scalar. In the context of quantum mechanical spin, such representations are called [[spinor|spinorial]].

===Momentum and energy as generators of translation and time evolution, and rotation===

The space [[Translation operator (quantum mechanics)|translation operator]] &lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}(\Delta \mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt; acts on a wavefunction to shift the space coordinates by an infinitesimal displacement Δ'''r'''. The explicit expression &lt;math&gt;\widehat{T}&lt;/math&gt; can be quickly determined by a [[Taylor expansion]] of ''ψ''('''r''' + Δ'''r''', ''t'') about '''r''', then (keeping the first order term and neglecting second and higher order terms), replace the space derivatives by the [[momentum operator]] &lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{p}}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly for the [[time translation]] operator acting on the time parameter, the Taylor expansion of ''ψ''('''r''', ''t'' + Δ''t'') is about ''t'', and the time derivative replaced by the [[energy operator]] &lt;math&gt;\widehat{E}&lt;/math&gt;.

The exponential functions arise by definition as those limits, due to [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]], and can be understood physically and mathematically as follows. A net translation can be composed of many small translations, so to obtain the translation operator for a finite increment, replace Δ'''r''' by  Δ'''r'''/''N'' and Δ''t'' by  Δ''t''/''N'', where ''N'' is a positive non-zero integer. Then as ''N'' increases, the magnitude of Δ'''r''' and Δ''t'' become even smaller, while leaving the directions unchanged. Acting the infinitesimal operators on the wavefunction ''N'' times and taking the limit as ''N'' tends to infinity gives the finite operators.

Space and time translations commute, which means the operators and generators commute.

For a time-independent Hamiltonian, energy is conserved in time and quantum states are [[stationary state]]s: the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the energy eigenvalues ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{U}(t) = \exp\left( - \frac{i \Delta t E}{\hbar}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

and all stationary states have the form

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r}, t + t_0) = \widehat{U}(t - t_0) \psi(\mathbf{r},t_0) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial time, usually set to zero since there is no loss of continuity when the initial time is set.

An alternative notation is &lt;math&gt;\widehat{U}(t - t_0) \equiv U(t, t_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

===Angular momentum as the generator of rotations===

====Orbital angular momentum====

The rotation operator acts on a wavefunction to rotate the spatial coordinates of a particle by a constant angle Δ''θ'':

:&lt;math&gt;{R}(\Delta\theta,\hat{\mathbf{a}})\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \psi(\mathbf{r}',t)&lt;/math&gt;

where '''r&amp;prime;''' are the rotated coordinates about an axis defined by a [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)&lt;/math&gt; through an angular increment Δ''θ'', given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}' = \widehat{R}(\Delta\theta,\hat{\mathbf{a}})\mathbf{r}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\widehat{R}(\Delta\theta,\hat{\mathbf{a}})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[rotation matrix]] dependent on the axis and angle. In group theoretic language, the rotation matrices are group elements, and the angles and axis &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta \hat{\mathbf{a}} = \Delta\theta(a_1, a_2, a_3)&lt;/math&gt; are the parameters, of the three-dimensional [[special orthogonal group]], SO(3). The rotation matrices about the [[standard basis|standard]] [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian basis vector]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}_x, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_y, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_z&lt;/math&gt; through angle {{nowrap|Δ''θ''}}, and the corresponding generators of rotations {{nowrap|'''J''' {{=}} (''J&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''J&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'')}}, are:

More generally for rotations about an axis defined by &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, the rotation matrix elements are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=C.B. Parker| title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics| publisher=McGraw Hill|edition=2nd|page=1333|year=1994| isbn=0-07-051400-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;[\widehat{R}(\theta, \hat{\mathbf{a}})]_{ij} = (\delta_{ij} - a_i a_j) \cos\theta - \varepsilon_{ijk} a_k \sin\theta  + a_i a_j &lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]].

It is not as obvious how to determine the rotational operator compared to space and time translations. We may consider a special case (rotations about the ''x'', ''y'', or ''z''-axis) then infer the general result, or use the general rotation matrix directly and [[tensor index notation]] with ''δ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''ε&lt;sub&gt;ijk&lt;/sub&gt;''. To derive the infinitesimal rotation operator, which corresponds to small Δ''θ'', we use the [[small angle approximation]]s sin(Δ''θ'') ≈ Δ''θ'' and cos(Δ''θ'') ≈ 1, then Taylor expand about '''r''' or ''r&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', keep the first order term, and substitute the [[angular momentum operator]] components.

The ''z''-component of angular momentum can be replaced by the component along the axis defined by &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt;, using the [[dot product]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}\cdot\widehat{\mathbf{L}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Again, a finite rotation can be made from lots of small rotations, replacing Δ''θ'' by {{nowrap|Δ''θ''/''N''}} and taking the limit as ''N'' tends to infinity gives the rotation operator for a finite rotation.

Rotations about the ''same'' axis do commute, for example a rotation through angles ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''θ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; about axis ''i'' can be written

:&lt;math&gt;R(\theta_1 + \theta_2 , \mathbf{e}_i) = R(\theta_1 \mathbf{e}_i)R(\theta_2 \mathbf{e}_i)\,,\quad [R(\theta_1 \mathbf{e}_i),R(\theta_2 \mathbf{e}_i)]=0\,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, rotations about ''different'' axes do not commute. The general commutation rules are summarized by

:&lt;math&gt; [ L_i , L_j ] = i \hbar \varepsilon_{ijk} L_k. &lt;/math&gt;

In this sense, orbital angular momentum has the common sense properties of rotations. Each of the above commutators can be easily demonstrated by holding an everyday object and rotating it through the same angle about any two different axes in both possible orderings; the final configurations are different.

In quantum mechanics, there is another form of rotation which mathematically appears similar to the orbital case, but has different properties, described next.

====Spin angular momentum====

All previous quantities have classical definitions. Spin is a quantity possessed by particles in quantum mechanics without any classical analogue, having the units of angular momentum. The spin [[vector operator]] is denoted &lt;math&gt; \widehat{\mathbf{S}} = (\widehat{S_x}, \widehat{S_y}, \widehat{S_z}) &lt;/math&gt;. The eigenvalues of its components are the possible outcomes (in units of &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;) of a measurement of the spin projected onto one of the basis directions.

Rotations (of ordinary space) about an axis &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}}&lt;/math&gt; through angle ''θ'' about the unit vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}&lt;/math&gt; in space acting on a multicomponent wave function (spinor) at a point in space is represented by:

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Spin rotation operator''' (''finite'')
|equation = &lt;math&gt; \widehat{S}(\theta , \hat{\mathbf{a}}) = \exp\left( - \frac{i}{\hbar}\theta \hat{\mathbf{a}} \cdot \widehat{\mathbf{S}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding= 6
|border = 1
|border colour = black
|background colour=white}}

However, unlike orbital angular momentum in which the ''z''-projection quantum number ''{{ell}}'' can only take positive or negative integer values (including zero), the ''z''-projection [[spin quantum number]] ''s'' can take all positive and negative half-integer values. There are rotational matrices for each spin quantum number.

Evaluating the exponential for a given ''z''-projection spin quantum number ''s'' gives a (2''s'' + 1)-dimensional spin matrix. This can be used to define a [[spinor]] as a column vector of 2''s'' + 1 components which transforms to a rotated coordinate system according to the spin matrix at a fixed point in space.

For the simplest non-trivial case of ''s'' = 1/2, the spin operator is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{\mathbf{S}} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \boldsymbol{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Pauli matrices]] in the standard representation are:

:&lt;math&gt;
\sigma_1 = \sigma_x =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;1\\
1&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
\,,\quad \sigma_2 = \sigma_y =
\begin{pmatrix}
0&amp;-i\\
i&amp;0
\end{pmatrix}
\,,\quad \sigma_3 = \sigma_z =
\begin{pmatrix}
1&amp;0\\
0&amp;-1
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Total angular momentum====

The total angular momentum operator is the sum of the orbital and spin

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{\mathbf{J}} = \widehat{\mathbf{L}} + \widehat{\mathbf{S}} &lt;/math&gt;

and is an important quantity for multi-particle systems, especially in nuclear physics and the quantum chemistry of multi-electron atoms and molecules.

We have a similar rotation matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \widehat{J}(\theta,\hat{\mathbf{a}}) = \exp\left( - \frac{i}{\hbar}\theta \hat{\mathbf{a}} \cdot \widehat{\mathbf{J}}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

===Conserved quantities in the Quantum Harmonic Oscillator===

The dynamical symmetry group of the ''n'' dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator is the special unitary group SU(''n''). As an example, the number of infinitesimal generators of the corresponding Lie algebras of SU(2) and SU(3) are three and eight respectively. This leads to exactly three and eight independent conserved quantities (other than the Hamiltonian) in these systems.

The two dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator has the expected conserved quantities of the Hamiltonian and the angular momentum, but has additional hidden conserved quantities of energy level difference and another form of angular momentum.

==Lorentz group in relativistic quantum mechanics==

Following is an overview of the Lorentz group; a treatment of boosts and rotations in spacetime. Throughout this section, see (for example) T. Ohlsson (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-13950-4320|author=T. Ohlsson|title=Relativistic Quantum Physics: From Advanced Quantum Mechanics to Introductory Quantum Field Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|pages=7–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRavtAW5EFcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}

Lorentz transformations can be parametrized by [[rapidity]] {{nowrap|''φ''}} for a boost in the direction of a three-dimensional [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{n}} = (n_1, n_2, n_3)&lt;/math&gt;, and a rotation angle {{nowrap|''θ''}} about a three-dimensional [[unit vector]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{a}} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)&lt;/math&gt; defining an axis, so &lt;math&gt;\varphi\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \varphi(n_1, n_2, n_3)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\theta\hat{\mathbf{a}} = \theta(a_1, a_2, a_3)&lt;/math&gt; are together six parameters of the Lorentz group (three for rotations and three for boosts). The Lorentz group is 6-dimensional.

===Pure rotations in spacetime===

The rotation matrices and rotation generators considered above form the spacelike part of a four-dimensional matrix, representing pure-rotation Lorentz transformations. Three of the Lorentz group elements &lt;math&gt;\widehat{R}_x, \widehat{R}_y, \widehat{R}_z &lt;/math&gt; and generators {{nowrap|'''J''' {{=}} (''J''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''J''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} for pure rotations are:

|-

The rotation matrices act on any [[four vector]] '''A''' = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and rotate the space-like components according to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}' = \widehat{R}(\Delta\theta,\hat{\mathbf{n}})\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

leaving the time-like coordinate unchanged. In matrix expressions, '''A''' is treated as a [[column vector]].

===Pure boosts in spacetime===

A boost with velocity {{nowrap|''c''tanh''φ''}} in the ''x'', ''y'', or ''z'' directions given by the [[standard basis|standard]] [[Cartesian coordinate system#Representing a vector in the standard basis|Cartesian basis vector]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{e}}_x, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_y, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_z&lt;/math&gt;, are the boost transformation matrices. These matrices &lt;math&gt; \widehat{B}_x, \widehat{B}_y, \widehat{B}_z&lt;/math&gt; and the corresponding generators {{nowrap|'''K''' {{=}} (''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} are the remaining three group elements and generators of the Lorentz group:

1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}  \,.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The boost matrices act on any four vector '''A''' = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and mix the time-like and the space-like components, according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}' = \widehat{B}(\varphi,\hat{\mathbf{n}}) \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

The term "boost" refers to the relative velocity between two frames, and is not to be conflated with momentum as the ''generator of translations'', as explained [[#The Poincaré group in relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory|below]].

===Combining boosts and rotations===

Products of rotations give another rotation (a frequent exemplification of a subgroup), while products of boosts and boosts or of rotations and boosts cannot be expressed as pure boosts or pure rotations. In general, any Lorentz transformation can be expressed as a product of a pure rotation and a pure boost. For more background see (for example) B.R. Durney (2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= B.R.

The boost and rotation generators have representations denoted {{nowrap|''D''('''K''')}} and {{nowrap|''D''('''J''')}} respectively, the capital {{nowrap|''D''}} in this context indicates a [[group representation#Definitions|group representation]].

For the Lorentz group, the representations {{nowrap|''D''('''K''')}} and {{nowrap|''D''('''J''')}} of the generators {{nowrap|'''K'''}} and {{nowrap|'''J'''}} fulfill the following commutation rules.

In all commutators, the boost entities mixed with those for rotations, although rotations alone simply give another rotation. [[Exponential function#Lie algebras|Exponentiating]] the generators gives the boost and rotation operators which combine into the general Lorentz transformation, under which the spacetime coordinates transform from one rest frame to another boosted and/or rotating frame. Likewise, exponentiating the representations of the generators gives the representations of the boost and rotation operators, under which a particle's spinor field transforms.

In the literature, the boost generators {{nowrap|'''K'''}} and rotation generators {{nowrap|'''J'''}} are sometimes combined into one generator for Lorentz transformations {{nowrap|'''M'''}}, an antisymmetric four-dimensional matrix with entries:

:&lt;math&gt;M^{0a} = -M^{a0} = K_a \,,\quad M^{ab} = \varepsilon_{abc} J_c \,.&lt;/math&gt;

and correspondingly, the boost and rotation parameters are collected into another antisymmetric four-dimensional matrix {{nowrap|'''ω'''}}, with entries:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{0a} = - \omega_{a0} = \varphi n_a \,,\quad \omega_{ab} = \theta \varepsilon_{abc} a_c \,,&lt;/math&gt;

The general Lorentz transformation is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\Lambda(\varphi,\hat{\mathbf{n}}, \theta,\hat{\mathbf{a}}) = \exp\left(-\frac{i}{2}\omega_{\alpha\beta}M^{\alpha\beta}\right) = \exp \left[-\frac{i}{2}\left(\varphi \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \mathbf{K} + \theta \hat{\mathbf{a}} \cdot \mathbf{J}\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Einstein notation|summation over repeated matrix indices]] ''α'' and ''β''. The Λ matrices act on any four vector '''A''' = (''A''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and mix the time-like and the space-like components, according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}' = \Lambda(\varphi,\hat{\mathbf{n}}, \theta,\hat{\mathbf{a}}) \mathbf{A} &lt;/math&gt;

===Transformations of spinor wavefunctions in relativistic quantum mechanics===

In [[relativistic quantum mechanics]], wavefunctions are no longer single-component scalar fields, but now 2(2''s'' + 1) component spinor fields, where ''s'' is the spin of the particle. The transformations of these functions in spacetime are given below.

Under a proper [[orthochronous]] [[Lorentz transformation]] {{nowrap|('''r''', ''t'') → Λ('''r''', ''t'')}} in [[Minkowski space]], all one-particle quantum states {{nowrap|''ψ&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt;''}} locally transform under some [[Representation theory of the Lorentz group|representation]] {{nowrap|''D''}} of the [[Lorentz group]]:&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Weinberg, S.|journal=Phys.

:&lt;math&gt;\psi_\sigma(\mathbf{r}, t) \rightarrow D(\Lambda) \psi_\sigma(\Lambda^{-1}(\mathbf{r}, t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where {{nowrap|''D''(Λ)}} is a finite-dimensional representation, in other words a {{nowrap|(2''s'' + 1)×(2''s'' + 1)}} dimensional [[square matrix]], and {{nowrap|''ψ''}} is thought of as a [[column vector]] containing components with the {{nowrap|(2''s'' + 1)}} allowed values of {{nowrap|''σ''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \begin{bmatrix} \psi_{\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \vdots \\ \psi_{\sigma=-s + 1}(\mathbf{r},t) \\ \psi_{\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t) \end{bmatrix}\quad\rightleftharpoons\quad {\psi(\mathbf{r},t)}^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} {\psi_{\sigma=s}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; {\psi_{\sigma=s - 1}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; \cdots &amp; {\psi_{\sigma=-s + 1}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star &amp; {\psi_{\sigma=-s}(\mathbf{r},t)}^\star \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Real irreducible representations and spin===

The [[irreducible representation]]s of {{nowrap|''D''('''K''')}} and {{nowrap|''D''('''J''')}}, in short "irreps", can be used to build to spin representations of the Lorentz group. Defining new operators:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mathbf{J} + i \mathbf{K}}{2}\,,\quad \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{J} - i \mathbf{K}}{2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

so {{nowrap|'''A'''}} and {{nowrap|'''B'''}} are simply [[complex conjugate]]s of each other, it follows they satisfy the symmetrically formed commutators:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[A_i ,A_j\right] = \varepsilon_{ijk}A_k\,,\quad \left[B_i ,B_j\right] = \varepsilon_{ijk}B_k\,,\quad \left[A_i ,B_j\right] = 0\,,&lt;/math&gt;

and these are essentially the commutators the orbital and spin angular momentum operators satisfy. Therefore, {{nowrap|'''A'''}} and {{nowrap|'''B'''}} form operator algebras analogous to angular momentum; same [[Ladder operator#Angular momentum|ladder operator]]s, ''z''-projections, etc., independently of each other as each of their components mutually commute. By the analogy to the spin quantum number, we can introduce positive integers or half integers, {{nowrap|''a, b''}}, with corresponding sets of values {{nowrap|''m'' {{=}} ''a'', ''a'' − 1, ... −''a'' + 1, −''a''}} and {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} ''b'', ''b'' − 1, ... −''b'' + 1, −''b''}}. The matrices satisfying the above commutation relations are the same as for spins ''a'' and ''b'' have components given by multiplying [[Kronecker delta]] values with angular momentum matrix elements:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(A_x\right)_{m'n',mn} = \delta_{n'n} \left(J_x^{(m)}\right)_{m'm}\,\quad \left(B_x\right)_{m'n',mn} = \delta_{m'm} \left(J_x^{(n)}\right)_{n'n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(A_y\right)_{m'n',mn} = \delta_{n'n} \left(J_y^{(m)}\right)_{m'm}\,\quad \left(B_y\right)_{m'n',mn} = \delta_{m'm} \left(J_y^{(n)}\right)_{n'n}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left(A_z\right)_{m'n',mn} = \delta_{n'n} \left(J_z^{(m)}\right)_{m'm}\,\quad \left(B_z\right)_{m'n',mn} = \delta_{m'm} \left(J_z^{(n)}\right)_{n'n}&lt;/math&gt;

where in each case the row number ''m&amp;prime;n&amp;prime;'' and column number ''mn'' are separated by a comma, and in turn:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(J_z^{(m)}\right)_{m'm} = m\delta_{m'm} \,\quad \left(J_x^{(m)} \pm i J_y^{(m)}\right)_{m'm} = m\delta_{a',a\pm 1}\sqrt{(a \mp m)(a \pm m + 1)}&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for '''J'''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sometimes the [[tuple]] abbreviations:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{A}\right)_{m'n',mn} \equiv \left[\left(A_x\right)_{m'n',mn}, \left(A_y\right)_{m'n',mn}, \left(A_z\right)_{m'n',mn}\right]&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{B}\right)_{m'n',mn} \equiv \left[\left(B_x\right)_{m'n',mn}, \left(B_y\right)_{m'n',mn}, \left(B_z\right)_{m'n',mn}\right]&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\mathbf{J}^{(m)}\right)_{m'm} \equiv \left[\left(J_x^{(m)}\right)_{m'm}, \left(J_y^{(m)}\right)_{m'm}, \left(J_z^{(m)}\right)_{m'm}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

are used.&lt;/ref&gt; The three '''J'''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; matrices are each {{nowrap|(2''m'' + 1)×(2''m'' + 1)}} square matrices, and the three '''J'''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; are each {{nowrap|(2''n'' + 1)×(2''n'' + 1)}} square matrices. The integers or half-integers ''m'' and ''n'' numerate all the irreducible representations by, in equivalent notations used by authors: {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'', ''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ (''m'', ''n'') ≡ ''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'')&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;otimes; ''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which are each {{nowrap|[(2''m'' + 1)(2''n'' + 1)]×[(2''m'' + 1)(2''n'' + 1)]}} square matrices.

Applying this to particles with spin {{nowrap|''s''}};
*left-handed {{nowrap|(2''s'' + 1)}}-component spinors transform under the real irreps {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''s'', 0)&lt;/sup&gt;}},
*right-handed {{nowrap|(2''s'' + 1)}}-component spinors transform under the real irreps {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(0, ''s'')&lt;/sup&gt;}},
*taking [[direct sum]]s symbolized by {{nowrap|&amp;oplus;}} (see [[direct sum of matrices]] for the simpler matrix concept), one obtains the representations under which {{nowrap|2(2''s'' + 1)}}-component spinors transform: {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''m'', ''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;oplus; ''D''&lt;sup&gt;(''n'', ''m'')&lt;/sup&gt;}} where {{nowrap|''m'' + ''n'' {{=}} ''s''}}. These are also real irreps, but as shown above, they split into complex conjugates.

In these cases the {{nowrap|''D''}} refers to any of {{nowrap|''D''('''J''')}}, {{nowrap|''D''('''K''')}}, or a full Lorentz transformation {{nowrap|''D''(Λ)}}.

===Relativistic wave equations===

In the context of the [[Dirac equation]] and [[Weyl equation]], the Weyl spinors satisfying the Weyl equation transform under the simplest irreducible spin representations of the Lorentz group, since the spin quantum number in this case is the smallest non-zero number allowed:  1/2. The 2-component left-handed Weyl spinor transforms under {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(1/2, 0)&lt;/sup&gt;}} and the 2-component right-handed Weyl spinor transforms under {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(0, 1/2)&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Dirac spinors satisfying the Dirac equation transform under the representation {{nowrap|''D''&lt;sup&gt;(1/2, 0)&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;oplus; ''D''&lt;sup&gt;(0, 1/2)&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the direct sum of the irreps for the Weyl spinors.

==The Poincaré group in relativistic quantum mechanics and field theory==

[[Space translation symmetry|Space translations,]] [[Time translation symmetry|time translations]], [[Rotational symmetry|rotations]], and [[Lorentz Boost|boosts]], all taken together, constitute the [[Poincaré group]]. The group elements are the three rotation matrices and three boost matrices (as in the Lorentz group), and one for time translations and three for space translations in spacetime. There is a generator for each. Therefore, the Poincaré group is 10-dimensional.

In [[special relativity]], space and time can be collected into a four-position vector {{nowrap|'''X''' {{=}} (''ct'', −'''r''')}}, and in parallel so can energy and momentum which combine into a [[four-momentum]] vector {{nowrap|'''P''' {{=}} (''E''/''c'', −'''p''')}}. With relativistic quantum mechanics in mind, the time duration and spatial displacement parameters (four in total, one for time and three for space) combine into a spacetime displacement {{nowrap|Δ'''X''' {{=}} (''c''Δ''t'', −Δ'''r''')}}, and the energy and momentum operators are inserted in the four-momentum to obtain a four-momentum operator,

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\mathbf{P}} = \left(\frac{\widehat{E}}{c},-\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\right)  = i\hbar\left(\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial}{\partial t},\nabla\right) \,, &lt;/math&gt;

which are the generators of spacetime translations (four in total, one time and three space):

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{X}(\Delta \mathbf{X}) = \exp\left(-\frac{i}{\hbar}\Delta\mathbf{X}\cdot\widehat{\mathbf{P}}\right) = \exp\left[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\left(\Delta t\widehat{E} + \Delta \mathbf{r} \cdot\widehat{\mathbf{p}}\right)\right] \,. &lt;/math&gt;

There are commutation relations between the components four-momentum '''P''' (generators of spacetime translations), and angular momentum '''M''' (generators of Lorentz transformations), that define the Poincaré algebra:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Principles of Quantum Field Theory|author=N.N.

* &lt;math&gt;[P_\mu, P_\nu] = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{ 1 }{ i }[M_{\mu\nu}, P_\rho] = \eta_{\mu\rho} P_\nu - \eta_{\nu\rho} P_\mu\,&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\frac{ 1 }{ i }[M_{\mu\nu}, M_{\rho\sigma}] = \eta_{\mu\rho} M_{\nu\sigma} - \eta_{\mu\sigma} M_{\nu\rho} - \eta_{\nu\rho} M_{\mu\sigma} + \eta_{\nu\sigma} M_{\mu\rho}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''η'' is the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor. (It is common to drop any hats for the four-momentum operators in the commutation relations). These equations are an expression of the fundamental properties of space and time as far as they are known today. They have a classical counterpart where the commutators are replaced by [[Poisson bracket]]s.

To describe spin in relativistic quantum mechanics, the [[Pauli–Lubanski pseudovector]]

:&lt;math&gt;W_{\mu}=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} J^{\nu \rho} P^\sigma ,&lt;/math&gt;

a [[Casimir operator]], is the constant spin contribution to the total angular momentum, and there are commutation relations between '''P''' and '''W''' and between '''M''' and '''W''':

:&lt;math&gt;\left[P^{\mu},W^{\nu}\right]=0 \,, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[J^{\mu \nu},W^{\rho}\right]=i \left( \eta^{\rho \nu} W^{\mu} - \eta^{\rho \mu} W^{\nu}\right) \,, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\left[W_{\mu},W_{\nu}\right]=-i \epsilon_{\mu \nu \rho \sigma} W^{\rho}  P^{\sigma} \,. &lt;/math&gt;

Invariants constructed from '''W''', instances of [[Casimir invariant]]s can be used to classify irreducible representations of the Lorentz group.

==Symmetries in quantum field theory and particle physics==

===Unitary groups in quantum field theory===

Group theory is an abstract way of mathematically analyzing symmetries. Unitary operators are paramount to quantum theory, so [[unitary group]]s are important in particle physics. The group of ''N'' dimensional unitary square matrices is denoted U(''N''). Unitary operators preserve inner products which means probabilities are also preserved, so the quantum mechanics of the system is invariant under unitary transformations. Let &lt;math&gt; \widehat{U} &lt;/math&gt; be a unitary operator, so the inverse is the [[Hermitian adjoint]] &lt;math&gt; \widehat{U} = \widehat{U}^\dagger &lt;/math&gt;, which commutes with the Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\widehat{U}, \widehat{H} \right]=0 &lt;/math&gt;

then the observable corresponding to the operator &lt;math&gt; \widehat{U}&lt;/math&gt; is conserved, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation &lt;math&gt; \widehat{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since the predictions of quantum mechanics should be invariant under the action of a group, physicists look for unitary transformations to represent the group.

Important subgroups of each U(''N'') are those unitary matrices which have unit determinant (or are "unimodular"): these are called the special unitary groups and are denoted SU(''N'').

====U(1)====

The simplest unitary group is U(1), which is just the complex numbers of modulus 1. This one-dimensional matrix entry is of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;U=e^{-i\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''θ'' is the parameter of the group, and the group is Abelian since one-dimensional matrices always commute under matrix multiplication. Lagrangians in quantum field theory for complex scalar fields are often invariant under U(1) transformations. If there is a quantum number ''a'' associated with the U(1) symmetry, for example baryon and the three lepton numbers in electromagnetic interactions, we have:

:&lt;math&gt;U=e^{-ia\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

====U(2) and SU(2)====

The general form of an element of a U(2) element is parametrized by two complex numbers ''a'' and ''b'':

:&lt;math&gt;U = \begin{pmatrix}
a &amp; b \\
-b^\star &amp; a^\star \\
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and for SU(2), the determinant is restricted to 1:

:&lt;math&gt; \det(U) = aa^\star + bb^\star = {|a|}^2 + {|b|}^2 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In group theoretic language, the Pauli matrices are the generators of the [[special unitary group]] in two dimensions, denoted SU(2). Their commutation relation is the same as for orbital angular momentum, aside from a factor of 2:

:&lt;math&gt; [ \sigma_a , \sigma_b ] = 2i \hbar \varepsilon_{abc} \sigma_c &lt;/math&gt;

A group element of SU(2) can be written:

:&lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j) = e^{i \theta \sigma_j /2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a Pauli matrix, and the group parameters are the angles turned through about an axis.

The two-dimensional isotropic quantum harmonic oscillator has symmetry group SU(2), while the symmetry algebra of the rational anisotropic QHO is a nonlinear extension of u(2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|author=D. Bonastos|title=Symmetry Algebra of the Planar Anisotropic Quantum Harmonic Oscillator with Rational Ratio of Frequencies|eprint=hep-th/9402099|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U(3) and SU(3)====

The eight [[Gell-Mann matrices]] {{nowrap|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (see article for them and the structure constants) are important for [[quantum chromodynamics]]. They originally arose in the theory SU(3) of flavor which is still of practical importance in nuclear physics. They are the generators for the SU(3) group, so an element of SU(3) can be written analogously to an element of SU(2):

:&lt;math&gt;U(\theta,\hat{\mathbf{e}}_j) = \exp\left(-\frac{i}{2} \sum_{n=1}^8 \theta_n \lambda_n \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''θ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' are eight independent parameters. The {{nowrap|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} matrices satisfy the commutator:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\lambda_a, \lambda_b \right] = 2i f_{abc}\lambda_c&lt;/math&gt;

where the indices {{nowrap|''a''}}, {{nowrap|''b''}}, {{nowrap|''c''}} take the values 1, 2, 3... 8. The structure constants ''f&lt;sub&gt;abc&lt;/sub&gt;'' are totally antisymmetric in all indices analogous to those of SU(2). In the standard colour charge basis (''r'' for red, ''g'' for green, ''b'' for blue):

:&lt;math&gt;|r\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\,,\quad |g\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\,,\quad |b\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

the colour states are eigenstates of the {{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}} matrices, while the other matrices mix colour states together.

The eight [[gluon]]s states (8-dimensional column vectors) are simultaneous eigenstates of the [[adjoint representation]] of {{math|SU(3)}} , the 8-dimensional representation acting on its own Lie algebra {{math|su(3)}}, for the {{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|''λ''&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;}} matrices. By forming tensor products of representations (the standard representation and its dual) and taking appropriate quotients, protons and neutrons, and other hadrons are eigenstates of various representations of {{math|SU(3)}} of color. The representations of SU(3) can be described by a "theorem of the highest weight".&lt;ref&gt;

===Matter and antimatter===

In relativistic quantum mechanics, relativistic wave equations predict a remarkable symmetry of nature: that every particle has a corresponding [[antiparticle]]. This is mathematically contained in the spinor fields which are the solutions of the relativistic wave equations.

[[Charge conjugation]] switches particles and antiparticles. Physical laws and interactions unchanged by this operation have [[C symmetry]].

===Discrete spacetime symmetries===

*[[Parity (physics)|Parity]] mirrors the [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]] of the spatial coordinates from left-handed to right-handed. Informally, space is "reflected" into its mirror image. Physical laws and interactions unchanged by this operation have [[P symmetry]].
*[[T-symmetry|Time reversal]] flips the time coordinate, which amounts to time running from future to past. A curious property of time, which space does not have, is that it is unidirectional: particles traveling forwards in time are equivalent to antiparticles traveling back in time. Physical laws and interactions unchanged by this operation have [[T symmetry]].

===''C'', ''P'', ''T'' symmetries===

*[[CPT theorem]]
*[[CP violation]]
*[[Non-Hermitian quantum mechanics|PT symmetry]]
*[[Lorentz violation]]

===Gauge theory===

{{main|Gauge theory}}

In [[quantum electrodynamics]], the symmetry group is U(1) and is [[Abelian group|abelian]]. In [[quantum chromodynamics]], the symmetry group is SU(3) and is [[Non-abelian group|non-abelian]].

The electromagnetic interaction is mediated by [[photon]]s, which have no electric charge. The [[electromagnetic tensor]] has an [[electromagnetic four-potential]] field possessing gauge symmetry.

The strong (color) interaction is mediated by [[gluon]]s, which can have eight [[color charge]]s. There are eight [[gluon field strength tensor]]s with corresponding [[gluon four potential]]s field, each possessing gauge symmetry.

===The strong (color) interaction===

====Color charge====

Analogous to the spin operator, there are [[color charge operator]]s in terms of the Gell-Mann matrices ''λ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{F}_j = \frac{1}{2}\lambda_j &lt;/math&gt;

and since color charge is a conserved charge, all color charge operators must commute with the Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;\left[\hat{F}_j,\hat{H}\right] = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

====Isospin====

[[Isospin]] is conserved in strong interactions.

===The weak and electromagnetic interactions===

====Duality transformation====

Magnetic monopoles can be theoretically realized, although current observations and theory are consistent with them existing or not existing. Electric and magnetic charges can effectively be "rotated into one another" by a [[Magnetic monopole#Duality transformation|duality transformation]].

====Electroweak symmetry====

*[[Electroweak symmetry]]
*[[Electroweak symmetry breaking]]

===Supersymmetry===

{{main|Supersymmetry}}
A Lie superalgebra is an algebra in which (suitable) basis elements either have a commutation relation or have an anticommutation relation. Symmetries have been proposed to the effect that all fermionic particles have bosonic analogues, and vice versa. These symmetry have theoretical appeal in that no extra assumptions (such as existence of strings) barring symmetries are made. In addition, by assuming supersymmetry, a number puzzling issues can be resolved. These symmetries, which are represented by Lie superalgebras, have not been confirmed experimentally. It is now believed that they are broken symmetries, if they exist. But it has been speculated that [[dark matter]] is constitutes [[gravitino]]s, a spin 3/2 particle with mass, its supersymmetric partner being the [[graviton]].

==Exchange symmetry==

{{See also|Exchange interaction|Identical particles|Holstein–Herring method}}

The concept of '''exchange symmetry''' is derived from a fundamental [[postulate]] of [[quantum statistics]], which states that no observable [[physical quantity]] should change after exchanging two [[identical particles]]. It states that because all observables are proportional to &lt;math&gt;\left| \psi \right|^2&lt;/math&gt; for a system of [[identical particles]], the [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; must either remain the same or change sign upon such an exchange.

Because the exchange of two identical particles is mathematically equivalent to the [[rotation]] of each particle by 180 degrees (and so to the rotation of one particle's frame by 360 degrees),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feynman|first=Richard|title=The 1986 Dirac Memorial Lectures|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65862-1|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; the symmetric nature of the wave function depends on the particle's [[spin (physics)|spin]] after the [[Rotation operator (quantum mechanics)|rotation operator]] is applied to it. Integer spin particles do not change the sign of their wave function upon a 360 degree rotation—therefore the sign of the wave function of the entire system does not change.  Semi-integer spin particles change the sign of their wave function upon a 360 degree rotation (see more in [[spin–statistics theorem]]).

Particles for which the wave function does not change sign upon exchange are called [[boson]]s, or particles with a [[symmetric]] wave function. The particles for which the wave function of the system changes sign are called [[fermion]]s, or particles with an [[antisymmetric relation|antisymmetric]] wave function.

Fermions therefore obey different statistics (called [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]]) than bosons (which obey [[Bose–Einstein statistics]]). One of the consequences of Fermi–Dirac statistics is the [[Pauli exclusion principle|exclusion principle]] for fermions—no two identical fermions can share the same quantum state (in other words, the wave function of two identical fermions in the same state is zero). This in turn results in [[degeneracy pressure]] for fermions—the strong resistance of fermions to compression into smaller volume. This resistance gives rise to the “stiffness” or “rigidity” of ordinary atomic matter (as atoms contain electrons which are fermions).

'''''The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time''''' is 1973 book about the [[theoretical physics]] of [[spacetime]] by [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gibbons |first1=G. W. |last2=Shellard |first2=E. P. S. |last3=Rankin |first3=S.

==Background==
Hawking and Ellis attempt to describe the foundation of space itself and its nature of [[Metric expansion of space|infinite expansion]], using [[differential geometry]] to examine the consequences of the physicist [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]].

Hawking co-wrote the book with Ellis, while a [[post doc]] at [[Cambridge University]]. In his 1988 book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', he describes ''The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time'' as "highly technical" and unreadable for the common reader.

The book, now considered a classic, has also appeared in paperback format and has been reprinted many times.{{ref|a|a}}

==Critical response==
The book received extremely favourable reviews, with ''[[New Scientist]]'' proclaiming that "if you could only ever read one science book, this should probably be it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/opinion/mg19726452.400-review-ithe-oxford-book-of-modern-science-writingi-selected-by-richard-dawkins.html |title=Review: The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, selected by Richard Dawkins |accessdate=26 March 2008 |publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Forbes of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised Dawkins' inclusions, stating that "every reader is likely to make a discovery or two".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-oxford-book-of-modern-science-writing-ed-richard-dawkins-828939.html |title=The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing, ed.

'''Universal adaptive strategy theory''' ('''UAST''') is an evolutionary theory developed by [[J. Philip Grime]] in collaboration with Simon Pierce describing the general limits to [[ecology]] and [[evolution]] based on the [[trade-off]] that organisms face when the resources they gain from the environment are allocated between either growth, maintenance or regeneration – known as the universal three-way trade-off.

==General theory==
A universal three-way [[trade-off]] produces [[Plant strategies|adaptive strategies]] throughout the tree of life, with extreme strategies facilitating the survival of genes via: C (competitive), the survival of the individual using traits that maximize resource acquisition and resource control in consistently productive [[Ecological niche|niches]]; S (stress-tolerant), individual survival via maintenance of metabolic performance in variable and unproductive niches; or R ([[ruderal]]), rapid gene propagation via rapid completion of the lifecycle and regeneration in niches where events are frequently lethal to the individual.

It is impossible for an organism to evolve a survival strategy in which all resources are devoted exclusively to one of these investment paths, but relatively extreme strategies exist, with a range of intermediates. The system can be represented by a triangle, with the three extreme possibilities at its vertices. The different species may be located at some particular point inside this triangle, accommodating a certain percentage of each of the three strategies.

It is possible to use multivariate statistics to determine the main trends in [[Phenotypic trait|phenotypic variability]] in a range of organisms, which for various major animal groups (most prominently [[vertebrate]]s), has been shown to have three main endpoints consistent with UAST.

UAST is a key part of the twin-filter model describing how species with similar overall strategies but divergent sets of minor traits [[Coexistence theory|coexist]] in ecological communities.

==C-S-R Triangle theory==
C-S-R Triangle theory is the application of UAST to [[plant biology]]. The three strategies are competitor, stress tolerator, and ruderal. These strategies each thrive best in a unique combination of either high or low intensities of [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]].

===Competitors===
Competitors are plant species that thrive in areas of low intensity stress and disturbance and excel in [[Competition (biology)|biological competition]]. These species are able to outcompete other plants by most efficiently tapping into available resources. Competitors do this through a combination of favorable characteristics, including rapid growth rate, high productivity (growth in height, lateral spread, and root mass), and high capacity for [[phenotypic plasticity]]. This last feature allows competitors to be highly flexible in morphology and adjust the allocation of resources throughout the various parts of the plant as needed over the course of the growing season.

===Stress tolerators===
Stress tolerators are plant species that live in areas of high intensity stress and low intensity disturbance. Species that have adapted this strategy generally have slow growth rates, long-lived leaves, high rates of nutrient retention, and low phenotypic plasticity. Stress tolerators respond to environmental stresses through physiological variability. These species are often found in stressful environments such as alpine or arid habitats, deep shade, nutrient deficient soils, and areas of extreme pH levels.

===Ruderals===
[[Ruderal species|Ruderals]] are plant species that prosper in situations of high intensity disturbance and low intensity stress. These species are fast-growing and rapidly complete their life cycles, and generally produce large amounts of seeds. Plants that have adapted this strategy are often found colonizing recently disturbed land, and are often [[Annual plant|annuals]].

==Relation to the R* theory==
Understanding the differences between the CSR theory  and its major alternative the [[R* rule|R* theory]] has been a major goal in [[community ecology]] for many years.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Craine|first1=Joseph|title=Reconciling plant strategy theories of Grime and Tilman|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jabot|title=general modelling framework for resource-ratio and CSR theories of plant community dynamics|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2012.02024.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unlike the R* theory that predicts that competitive ability is determined by the ability to grow under low levels of resources, the CSR theory predicts that competitive ability is determined by [[relative growth rate]] and other size related traits. While some experiments supported the R* predictions, other supported the CSR predictions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The different predictions stem from different assumptions on the [[size-asymmetric competition|size asymmetry of the competition]]. The R* theory assumes that competition is size symmetric (i.e. resource exploitation is proportional to individual biomass), the CSR theory assumes that competition is size-asymmetric (i.e. large individuals exploit disproportional higher amounts of resources compared with smaller individuals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeMalach|title=Size asymmetry of resource competition and the structure of plant communities|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the [[taxonomic rank]] in botany||Plant variety (disambiguation){{!}}Plant variety}}
{{hatnote|Not to be confused with the legal term [[Plant variety (law)|"plant variety"]], equivalent to the [[cultivar]] rank in taxonomy}}

In [[botanical nomenclature]], '''variety''' (abbreviated '''var.'''; in {{lang-la|varietas}}) is a [[taxonomic rank]] below that of [[species]] and [[subspecies]] but above that of [[Form (botany)| form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|date=2012|url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art4 |chapter= Article 4|quote=4.1. If a greater number of ranks of taxa is desired, [...a]n organism may thus be assigned to taxa of the following ranks (in descending sequence): [... genus, ... species, subspecies,] variety ({{lang|la|varietas}}), subvariety ({{lang|la|subvarietas}}), form ({{lang|la|forma}}), and subform ({{lang|la|subforma}}). ... 4.3. Further ranks may also be intercalated or added, provided that confusion or error is not thereby introduced.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it gets a three-part [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific name]]. It is sometimes recommended that the subspecies rank should be used to recognize geographic distinctiveness, whereas the variety rank is appropriate if the taxon is seen throughout the geographic range of the species.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.hortax.org.uk/varieties-and-forms.html |chapter=Varieties and forms |title=HORTAX: Cultivated Plant Taxonomy Group |accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
The pincushion cactus, ''[[Escobaria vivipara]]'' &lt;small&gt;(Nutt.) Buxb.&lt;/small&gt;, is a wide-ranging variable species occurring from [[Canada]] to [[Mexico]], and found throughout [[New Mexico]] below about {{convert|2600|m|ft}}. Nine varieties have been described. Where the varieties of the pincushion cactus meet, they [[intergrade]]. The variety ''Escobaria vivipara'' var. ''arizonica'' is from [[Arizona]], while ''Escobaria vivipara'' var. ''neo-mexicana'' is from New Mexico.

==Definitions==

The term is defined in different ways by different authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=On The Use Of The Terms "Subspecies" And "Variety" |author=Robert T. Clausen |journal=Rhodora |volume=43 |issue=509 |year=1941 |pages=157–167 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14513#page/175/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]], while recognizing that the word "variety" is often used to denote "[[cultivar]]", does not accept this usage. Variety  is defined in the code as follows: "Variety (varietas) the category in the botanical nomenclatural hierarchy between species and form (forma)". However the code acknowledges the other usage as follows: "term used in some national and international legislation for a clearly distinguishable taxon below the rank of species; generally, in legislative texts, a term equivalent to cultivar. See also: cultivar and variety (varietas)".{{sfn|Brickell et al|2016}}

A variety will have an appearance distinct from other varieties, but will hybridize freely with those other varieties (if brought into contact).{{sfn|Salm et al|2015}}

==Other nomenclature uses==
* In [[plant breeding]] nomenclature, at least in countries that are signatory to the [[UPOV]] Convention, "[[Plant variety (law)|variety]]" or "plant variety" is a legal term.
* In [[zoological nomenclature]], the only allowed rank below that of species is that of [[subspecies]]. A name that was published before 1961 as that of a variety is taken to be the name of a subspecies. A name published after 1960 as that of a variety does not formally exist. In zoology, [[Form (zoology)|forms]] and [[Morph (zoology)|morphs]] are used informally if needed, but are unregulated by the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]''. 
* In [[bacteriological nomenclature]], "variety" is not allowed, but names published as varieties before 1992 are taken to be published as subspecies.
* In [[viticulture]] nomenclature, what is referred to as "[[grape variety|grape varieties]]" are in reality [[cultivar]]s according to usage in the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' or "[[Plant variety (law)|plant varieties]]" in the legal sense rather than botanical  taxonomy varieties, since they are propagated by [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] and have properties that are not stable under [[sexual reproduction]]. However, usage of the term variety is so entrenched in viticulture that a change to cultivar is unlikely.

'''''Watch Mr. Wizard''''' is an American [[television program]] (1951–1965) for children that demonstrates the science behind ordinary things. The show's creator and on-air host was [[Don Herbert]]. Marcel LaFollette says of the program, "It enjoyed consistent praise, awards, and high ratings throughout its history. At its peak, ''Watch Mr. Wizard'' drew audiences in the millions, but its impact was far wider. By 1956, it had prompted the establishment of more than five thousand Mr. Wizard science clubs, with an estimated membership greater than one hundred thousand."&lt;ref name=LaFollette02&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Survey of Science Content in U.S. Television Broadcasting, 1940s through 1950s: The Exploratory Years |first=Marcel C. |last=LaFollette |journal=Science Communication |date=September 2002 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=34–71 |doi=10.1177/107554700202400103 |url=http://scx.sagepub.com/content/24/1/34.abstract}}Subscription required.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was briefly revived in 1971, and then in the 1980s was a program on the [[Nickelodeon]] children's [[television network]] as ''Mr. Wizard's World''.

==1951-1965: Original series==
[[File:Mr Wizard.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Herbert in 1961.]]
''Watch Mr. Wizard'' first aired on [[NBC]] on March 3, 1951 with [[Don Herbert]] as the title character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrwizardstudios.com/watchmrwizardtvshow.htm |title=Watch Mr. Wizard |accessdate=2012-05-24 |year=2004 |publisher=Mr. Wizard Studios, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the weekly half hour [[live television|live television show]] Herbert played a science hobbyist, and every Saturday morning a neighbor boy or girl would come to visit. The children were played by child actors; one of them ([[Rita Walter|Rita McLaughlin]]) enjoyed a long subsequent acting career. Mr. Wizard always had some kind of laboratory experiment going that taught something about science. The experiments, many of which seemed impossible at first glance, were usually simple enough to be re-created by viewers.

The show was very successful; by 1954 it was broadcast live by 14 stations, and by [[kinescope]] (a film made from the television monitor of the original live broadcast) by an additional 77.&lt;ref name=Sternberg&gt;{{cite book |last=Sternberg |first=Joel |editor1-first=Horace |editor1-last=Newcomb |title=Museum of Broadcast Communications - Encyclopedia of Television (Second Edition): Volume 1 |chapterurl=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/W/htmlW/watchmrwiz/watchmrwiz.htm |chapter=Watch Mr. Wizard |publisher=CRC Press |year=2004 |pages=2487–2488 |isbn=9781579584115}}&lt;!--see also https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXgj7a55agC&amp;pg=PA2487--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Wizard Science Clubs were started throughout North America, numbering 5,000 by 1955 and 50,000 by 1965.&lt;ref name=Sternberg /&gt;&lt;!--nice to have this number confirmed; it isn't clear which source Sternberg used.--&gt; The show moved from [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] to [[New York City|New York]] on September 5, 1955, and had produced 547 live broadcasts by the time the show was canceled in 1965, with the last telecast on June 27.&lt;ref&gt;"N.B.C.

''Mr. Wizard's World'', a faster-paced version of the show developed by Don Herbert, was shown three times a week on [[Nickelodeon]], the then rising kids cable channel. Once again, the revival was produced in Canada (this time in [[Calgary]]). It produced 78 episodes from 1983 onwards, and continued to run thereafter as reruns.  During its airing on Nickelodeon, it was the channel's #3 rated show in 1983 (behind ''[[Livewire (talk show)|Livewire]]'' and ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]]''). It was also famous for its ''Ask Mr. Wizard'' segment where Mr. Wizard answered questions sent in by viewers of all ages.  Episodes of it were reaired in 2005-2006 on the digital cable channel [[The Science Channel]]. It still frequently airs on The Science Channel. Herbert once said: "My time on this Earth is getting shorter and shorter each day, but no matter how old I get, and even when I am dead, Mr. Wizard's World will never die". It was cancelled in 1990, though reruns continued on [[Nick at Nite]] until 1995 and often in early morning time slots right after Nick at Nite finished, through at least March 2000. In 1994, Herbert developed another new series of 15-minute spots called ''Teacher to Teacher with Mr. Wizard''. They highlighted individual elementary science teachers and their projects. The series was sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]] and was shown on Nickelodeon. Selected episodes of ''Mr. Wizard's World'' are available on DVD from Mr. Wizard Studios Inc. in 10-Single Volumes featuring 4-Episodes on each disk, Gift Box-Sets is also available. Five seasons of the show, 75 episodes, of the 78 total were released on Amazon instant streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NL5PPW4 |title=Mr. Wizard's World, 5 Seasons |accessdate=2014-12-27 |year=2014 |publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LaFollette applauds the unrivaled popularity and longevity of the original Mr. Wizard,&lt;ref name=LaFollette2013/&gt;{{rp|173}} but suggests that its sequels and other educational programs were often initiated in response to social criticism, then cancelled once such pressure diminished.&lt;ref name=LaFollette2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaFollette|first1=Marcel Chotkowski|title=Science on American television : a history|date=2013|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=177|location=Chicago, Ill.|isbn=978-0-226-92199-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}}
