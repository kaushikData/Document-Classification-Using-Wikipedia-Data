'''Algis Uždavinys''' (1962–2010) was a prolific [[Lithuania]]n philosopher and scholar. His work pioneered the hermeneutical [[Comparative religion|comparative study]] of Egyptian and Greek religions, especially their esoteric relations to Semitic religions, and in particular the [[Sufism|inner aspect of Islam]] (Sufism). His books have been published in Lithuanian, Russian, English and French, including translations of [[Plotinus]], [[Frithjof Schuon]] and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] into Russian and Lithuanian.

==Early life==
Brought up in [[Druskininkai]], by the [[Neman River|Nemunas River]] in southern [[Lithuania]], Uždavinys moved to [[Vilnius]] to pursue studies at the former State Art Institute of Lithuania, now [[Vilnius Academy of Art|Vilnius Academy of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref name="kazimieras"&gt;Kazimieras Seibutis, "In memoriam Algis Uždavinys", ''Acta Orientalia Vilnensia'' 9.2: 185–187.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==
Upon graduation he came in contact with the writings and authors of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] or [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialist]] school, and this influenced his comparative exegesis, notably his studies on [[Sufism]], the [[Ancient Egyptian religion]], and his assertion of the substantial continuity of Greek philosophical tradition from [[Pythagoras]] down to the latest [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] authors.&lt;ref name="golden"&gt;See his [http://www.worldwisdom.com/uploads/pdfs/80.pdf Introduction] to ''The Golden Chain''.&lt;/ref&gt; In this last claim he was expressly indebted to [[Pierre Hadot]].&lt;ref name="golden"/&gt;

Uždavinys was an active member of the editorial board of the journal ''Acta Orientalia Vilnensia''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oc.vu.lt/en/aov.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115220130/http://www.oc.vu.lt/en/aov.html |archivedate=2011-11-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and head of the Department of Humanities at the [[Vilnius Academy of Art|Vilnius Academy of Fine Arts]], [[Kaunas]] Faculty; as an [[art criticism|art critic]], philosopher and intellectual he was a prominent figure in Lithuanian cultural life. In 2008 he spent time as a research fellow at [[La Trobe University]] in [[Bendigo]], [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;See Harry Oldmeadow "In Memoriam: Algis Uždavinys (1962-2010) and his Antipodean Sojourn," ''Sacred Web'' 27, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isns.us/. See also the obituary by J. Finamore ''International Journal of the Platonic Tradition'', vol. 5, no. 1, 2011 , pp. 4&amp;ndash;5(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and The [[Lithuanian Artists' Association]], and a regular contributor to journals such as ''Sacred Web'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sacredweb.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vancouver]], and ''Sophia'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sophiajournal.com/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washington DC]].

[[File:D. Fr. Alvaro Pelagio, Bispo de Coron, e de Silves.png|thumb|Print of Alvarus Pelagius ([[Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal]])]]
'''Álvaro Pelayo''' ({{lang-la|Alvarus Pelagius}}; c. 1280 &amp;ndash; 25 January 1352) was a celebrated Galician [[canonist]].

==Life==
Alvarus was born at [[O Salnés|Salnés]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].  He studied [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]] at [[Bologna]], but in 1304 resigned his [[benefice]]s, and entered the [[Franciscan Order]]. He is said to have been a pupil of [[Duns Scotus]] and to have been tutor to the children of [[Don Pedro, Regent of Portugal]]. Certain it is that he became [[prison|penitentiary]] to [[Pope John XXII]] at [[Avignon]], that he enjoyed much favour with this pontiff, and was employed by him to refute the claims of the [[antipope]] [[Pietro Rainalducci]] of [[Corbario]]. In 1333 Alvarus became titular Bishop of [[Koroni|Coron]] in [[Achaia (Roman province)|Achaia]], and two years later was appointed to the [[See of Sylves]] in Portugal. He also served as [[Apostolic nuncio]] in Portugal, but was not created [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], as some writers have asserted. He died in [[Seville]], where he was buried in the Monastery of St. Clare.

==Works==
Alvarus is chiefly remarkable for his work ''De planctu ecclesiae libri duo''. This work, begun at Avignon in 1330, completed in 1332, corrected in 1335 and again in 1340 at [[Santiago de Compostela|Compostela]], is notable not only for its extreme defence of [[ecclesiastical rights]] but still more, perhaps, for the freedom and force with which the author assails and rebukes the ecclesiastical abuses of his time. Alvarus has been reproached by [[Antoninus of Florence|St. Antoninus]] and others with having too far favoured the error of the [[Fraticelli]] about poverty, but, as [[Sbaralea]] shows, it is not difficult to justify him against this charge. On the then agitated question of poverty in the Franciscan Order he wrote with less passion and with more weight than [[Ubertino da Casale]], although he addressed almost the same reproaches as the latter to the relaxed friars within the order. The ''De planctu'' was first published at [[Ulm]] in 1474. This edition is very rare, and is not free from error. Later editions appeared at Venice (1500) and at Lyons (1517).

Besides the "De planctu", [[Wadding]] attributed to Alvarus the following: "Collyrium adversus haereses"; "[[Speculum regum]]" (one book); "Super sentent. libros 4"; "Apologia contra Marsilum Patav. et Guliel. Ocham"; and other unedited works.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |challenges}}

The '''Augustinian theodicy''', named for the 4th- and 5th-century theologian, philosopher and (according to some [[Christian denominations]]) [[Saint#Christianity|Saint]] [[Augustine of Hippo]], is a type of [[Christian theology|Christian]] [[theodicy]] designed in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]]. As such, it attempts to explain the probability of an [[omnipotence|omnipotent]] (all-powerful) and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] (all-good) [[God in Christianity|God]] amid evidence of evil in the world. A number of variations of this kind of theodicy have been proposed throughout history; their similarities were first described by the 20th-century philosopher [[John Hick]], who classified them as "Augustinian". They typically assert that God is perfectly (ideally) [[good and evil|good]]; that he created the world [[Ex nihilo|out of nothing]]; and that evil is the result of humanity's [[original sin]]. The entry of evil into the world is generally explained as punishment for [[sin]] and its continued presence due to humans' misuse of [[free will]]. God's goodness and benevolence, according to the Augustinian theodicy, remain perfect and without responsibility for evil or suffering.

Augustine of Hippo was the first to develop the theodicy. He rejected the idea that evil exists in itself, instead regarding it as a corruption of goodness, caused by humanity's abuse of free will. Augustine believed in the existence of a physical [[Hell]] as a punishment for sin, but argued that those who choose to accept the [[salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] of [[Jesus Christ]] will go to [[Heaven]]. In the 13th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] &amp;ndash; influenced by Augustine &amp;ndash; proposed a similar theodicy based on the view that God is goodness and that there can be no evil in him. He believed that the existence of goodness allows evil to exist, through the fault of humans. Augustine also influenced [[John Calvin]], who supported Augustine's view that evil is the result of free will and argued that sin corrupts humans, requiring God's [[grace (Christianity) |grace]] to give moral guidance.

The theodicy was criticised by Augustine's contemporary Fortunatus, a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] who contended that God must still be somehow implicated in evil, and 18th-century theologian [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] criticised Augustine's concept of evil for not dealing with individual human suffering. Hick regards evil as necessary for the moral and spiritual development of humans, and [[process theology|process theologians]] have argued that God is not omnipotent and so cannot be responsible for any evil. The logic of Augustine's approach has been adapted by [[Alvin Plantinga]], among others. Plantinga's adapted Augustinian theodicy, the [[free will defence]] &amp;ndash; which he proposed in the 1980s &amp;ndash; attempts to answer only the [[logical problem of evil]]. Such a defence (not a "theodicy" proper) does not demonstrate the existence of God, or the probable existence of God, but attempts to prove that the existence of God and the presence of evil (or ''[[privatio boni]]'') in the world are not logically contradictory.

==General forms==
The Augustinian theodicy was first distinguished as a form of [[theodicy]] by [[John Hick]] in ''Evil and the God of Love'', written in 1966, in which he classified Augustine's theodicy and its subsequent developments as "Augustinian". Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, which attempts to clear God of all responsibility for evil, based on human free will, and the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which casts [[God]] as responsible for evil but justified because of its benefits for human development.&lt;ref name=Hall2003&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinian theodicy is a response to the [[Problem of evil#Evidential problem of evil|evidential problem of evil]],&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, pp. 48–49&lt;/ref&gt; which raises the concern that if God is [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]], there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence&amp;nbsp;– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/evil/#DirIndVerEviArgEvi | title=The Problem of Evil |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=16 September 2002 |date=21 August 2009 | accessdate=8 February 2012 | author=Tooley, Michael|authorlink=Michael Tooley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=S&amp;P2010 /&gt; The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence.&lt;ref name=Bennett2008&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the [[privation]] of good&amp;nbsp;– the corruption of God's good creation.&lt;ref name="Menn"&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;

The Augustinian theodicy supports the notion of [[original sin]]. All versions of this theodicy accept the theological implications of the [[Genesis creation narrative]], including the belief that God created human beings without sin or suffering. Evil is believed to be a just punishment for the [[fall of man]]: when Adam and Eve first disobeyed God and were exiled from the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–178&lt;/ref&gt; The free will of humans is offered by the Augustinian theodicy as the continued reason for [[moral evil]]: people commit immoral acts when their will is evil.&lt;ref name="Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010"/&gt; The evil nature of human will is attributed to original sin; Augustinian theologians argue that the sin of Adam and Eve corrupted the will of human beings,&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining that God is blameless and good, and not himself responsible for evil.&lt;ref name=Geivett&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Augustine===
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 AD) was a philosopher and theologian born in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]] (present-day [[Algeria]]). He followed the [[Manichaeism|Manichaean religion]] during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' and ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', develop key ideas regarding his response to suffering. In ''Confessions'', Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by [[materialism]] and that reading [[Plato]]'s works enabled him to consider the existence of a non-physical [[substance theory|substance]]. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from a theological (and non-Manichean) perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=24 March 2000 |date=12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the writings of [[Paul the Apostle]].&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer 1995, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; In ''City of God'', Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#HisEsc | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=24 March 2000 |date=12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine proposed that evil could not exist within God, nor be created by God, and is instead a by-product of God's creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the notion that evil exists in itself, proposing instead that it is a privation of (or falling away from) good, and a corruption of nature.&lt;ref name="Menn" /&gt; He wrote that "evil has no positive nature; but the loss of good has received the name 'evil.'"&lt;ref&gt;''The City of God'', Augustine of Hippo, Book XI, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; Both moral and [[natural evil]] occurs, Augustine argued, owing to an evil use of free will,&lt;ref name=Bennett2008 /&gt; which could be traced back to [[Adam and Eve|Adam and Eve's]] original sin.&lt;ref name=Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010&gt;Svendsen &amp; Pierce 2010, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that this evil will, present in the [[soul|human soul]], was a corruption of the will given to humans by God, making suffering a just punishment for the sin of humans.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Because Augustine believed that all of humanity was "[[Preformationism|seminally present in the loins of Adam]]", he argued that all of humanity inherited Adam's sin and his just punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of his belief that free will can be turned to evil, Augustine maintained that it is vital for humans to have free will, because they could not live well without it. He argued that evil could come from humans because, although humans contained no evil, they were also not perfectly good and hence could be corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Augustine believed that a physical [[Hell]] exists, but that physical punishment is secondary to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Cavadini 1999, p. 422&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, he believed that Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin.&lt;ref name=Cavadini1999p423&gt;Cavadini 1999, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved if they choose to receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.&lt;ref name=Cavadini1999p423 /&gt;

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[File:Gentile da Fabriano 052.jpg|thumb|[[Gentile da Fabriano]]'s portrait of Thomas Aquinas, who developed a theodicy heavily influenced by Augustine]]
Thomas Aquinas, a thirteenth-century [[scholasticism|scholastic]] philosopher and theologian heavily influenced by Augustine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aquinas/#ThoAri | title=Saint Thomas Aquinas | work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | origyear=12 July 1999 | date=30 September 2009 | accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a form of the Augustinian theodicy in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. Aquinas began by attempting to establish the existence of God,&lt;ref name="Little"&gt;Little 2005, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; through his [[Quinque viae|Five Ways]], and then attested that God is good and must have a morally sufficient reason for allowing evil to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas proposed that all goodness in the world must exist perfectly in God, and that, existing perfectly, God must be perfectly good. He concluded that God is goodness, and that there is no evil in God.&lt;ref name=Geivett /&gt;

Aquinas supported Augustine's view that evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of this evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin.&lt;ref name=Svendsen&amp;Pierce2010 /&gt; Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the [[moral agency|agent]]. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect.&lt;ref&gt;Little 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–43&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the [[Book of Job]], argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with [[heaven]] and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil.&lt;ref name="Little" /&gt; Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Howard-Snyder 1996, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it.&lt;ref&gt;Korsmeyer 1995, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.&lt;ref&gt;Wawrykow 2005, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Calvin===

[[John Calvin]], a sixteenth-century French theologian and principal figure in the development of [[Calvinism]], was influenced by Augustine's works.&lt;ref name="Cavadini"&gt;Cavadini 1999, pp. 116–118&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Augustine, Calvin was willing to accept that God is responsible for evil and suffering; however, he maintained that God cannot be [[indictment|indicted]] for it.&lt;ref&gt;Case-Winters 1990, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin continued the Augustinian approach that sin is the result of the fall of man, and argued that the human [[mind]], [[Will (philosophy)|will]], and [[Emotion|affections]] are corrupted by sin. He believed that only the grace of God is sufficient to provide humans with ongoing ethical guidance, arguing that reason is blinded by humans' sinful nature.&lt;ref&gt;McKim 2004, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; Calvin proposed that humanity is [[predestined]], divided into the elect and the [[Reprobation|reprobate]]: the elect are those who God has chosen to save and are the only ones who will be saved.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Thomas 1963, pp. 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Fortunatus===
Augustine's ''Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean'', which partly touches on the problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself considered four years earlier, in ''Free Will''). Quoting the [[New Testament]], Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine replied by arguing that the sin of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of [[Habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref&gt;''Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean'', Augustine of Hippo, Ch. XXII&lt;/ref&gt; This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, pp. 146–147&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Fredriksen 2010, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
Scholars of religion Paul Ingram and Frederick Streng argued that the teachings of [[Buddhism]] challenge Augustine's view of good and evil, proposing a [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]] in which good and evil have equal value instead of casting good over evil, as Augustine did. This is similar to the Manicheist account of good and evil&amp;nbsp;– that the two are equal and in conflict&amp;nbsp;– though Buddhism teaches that the two will come to a final conclusion and transcend the conflict.&lt;ref name="Ingram"&gt;Ingram &amp; Streng 1986, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; Ingram and Streng argued that the Augustinian theodicy fails to account for the existence of evil before Adam's sin, which Genesis presents in the form of the [[Serpent (Bible)|serpent's]] temptation.&lt;ref name="Ingram" /&gt;

===Francesco Antonio Zaccaria===
The Italian theologian [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] criticised Augustine's concept of evil in the eighteenth century. He noted a distinction between using the term evil to imply blame (sin) and to imply lament (suffering) and argued that Augustine posited sin to have occurred before suffering. This was problematic for Zaccaria, who believed that it made Augustine seem offhand and uninterested in human suffering. For Zaccaria, Augustine's perception of evil as a privation did not satisfactorily answer the questions of modern society as to why suffering exists.&lt;ref&gt;Zaccaria 2009, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===John Hick===
John Hick criticised the Augustinian theodicy when he developed his own theodicy in 1966. Hick supported the views of the German theologian [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], which he classified as Irenaean, who argued that the world is perfectly suited for the moral development of humans and that this justifies the existence of evil. He insisted that, while the Augustinian theodicy attempted to justify historical occurrences of evil, the [[Irenaean theodicy]] seeks to justify God eternally. Hick saw Augustine's view that a perfect world went wrong as incoherent and contradictory, and argued that, if humans were made perfectly good, then it should have been impossible for them to have made an immoral choice. He questioned the success of the theodicy with the charge that it does not remove the blame for evil from God: Augustine presented a theology of predestination; Hick argued that, if God knew the choices that his creation would make, he must be responsible for them.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, pp. 40–42&lt;/ref&gt; Hick's theodicy rejected the idea of the inheritance of sinfulness, and he believed that an eternal hell would render "a Christian theodicy impossible".&lt;ref&gt;Hick 2010, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The Irenaean theodicy does not, as the Augustinian theodicy does, attempt to protect God from being responsible for evil; rather, it argues that God is responsible but justified for it because of the benefits it has for human development. Both theodicies stress the perfection of God's creation, but differ in why the world is seen as perfect. Augustine also believed, as Hick did, that bringing good out of evil is preferable to the evil not occurring in the first place.&lt;ref name=B&amp;N2005&gt;Barber &amp; Neville 2005, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Process theology===
In ''God, Power and Evil: A Process Theodicy'', published in 1976, [[David Ray Griffin]] criticised Augustine's reliance on free will and argued that it is incompatible with divine [[omniscience]] and omnipotence. Griffin argued in later works that humans cannot have free will if God is omniscient. He contented that, if God is truly omniscient, then he will know infallibly what people will do, meaning that they cannot be free. Griffin argued that the human will could not oppose God's will, if God is omnipotent. He proposed that original sin as Augustine conceived it must itself be caused by God, rendering any punishment he wills unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin 1976, pp. 60–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Process theology]] argues that God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, he has the power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels the pain of the world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Melse 1993, pp. 13–24&lt;/ref&gt; Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ''ex nihilo'' (as Augustine proposed), God created it out of a pre-existent chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb &amp; Griffin 1976, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alvin Plantinga===
[[File:AlvinPlantinga.JPG|thumb|[[Alvin Plantinga]], who presented a version of the free will defence as an alternative response to the problem of evil]]
In the 1980s, [[Alvin Plantinga]] presented a version of the free will defence which, he argued, demonstrated that the existence of an omnipotent benevolent God and of evil are not inconsistent. He believed that, unless it could be shown that the two are not inconsistent, they would be necessarily contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, Plantinga believed that a "possible state of affairs" must be proposed which, if actual, would make God's existence and the existence of evil consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that a third proposition&amp;nbsp;– that evil is the result of the actions of free, rational, fallible human beings&amp;nbsp;– allows the existence of God and evil to be consistent.&lt;ref name=McGrath1995&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga supported this argument by claiming that there are some things that an omnipotent God could not do, yet remain omnipotent&amp;nbsp;– for example, if an omnipotent God has necessary existence, he could not create a world in which he does not exist. For this reason, Plantinga argued that an omnipotent God could not create any universe that he chooses, as Leibniz had proposed. He suggested that, even in a world where humans have free will, their actions may be so predictable that God could not create a world where they would do something unpredictable.{{efn|Steve Duncan used the example of a rational man who is offered $5 for a Rembrandt. Assuming that he understands the meaning of the transaction and has no other reason to accept the offer, it can be predicted that he will reject the offer. Duncan holds that God could not create a world where the man freely accepts the offer (without changing the situation), illustrating Plantinga's point. {{refn|Duncan 2007, p. 105}} }} Finally, he argued that if every moral agent freely makes at least one bad moral decision in any possible universe, God cannot create a universe where there is human freedom and no evil. Plantinga maintained that the existence of an omnipotent, benevolent God and the existence of evil are not inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan 2007, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;

Plantinga's version of the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his [[natural theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than attempt to show the existence of God as likely in the face of evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has noted that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.&lt;ref name=McGrath1995 /&gt;

===Critique from an evolutionary scientific position===
Supposing that the evolutionary theory, the current consensus, is correct, John Hick criticised Augustine's theory for being "implausible" in light of Darwin's theory of [[evolution]], as it would make Augustine's idea of a fall from perfection inaccurate;&lt;ref&gt;Davis 2001, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; this is reiterated by professors [[Nancey Murphy]] and [[George Francis Rayner Ellis]], who also contend that Augustine's idea of transmitting original sin from Adam to the rest of humanity requires biological explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis &amp; Murphy 1996, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of Comparative Religion [[Arvind Sharma]] has argued that natural evil cannot be the result of moral evil in the way Augustine suggested: scientific consensus is that natural disasters and disease existed before humans and hence cannot be the result of human sin.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma 2006, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; 

The twentieth-century philosopher [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] attempted to reinterpret the Augustinian theodicy in the light of evolutionary science by presenting its underlying argument without [[Creation myth|mythology]]. Niebuhr proposed that Augustine rejected the Manichean view that grants evil [[ontology|ontological]] existence and ties humans' sin to their created state. Augustine's argument continued, according to Niebuhr, by proposing that humans have a tendency to sin because of a biologically inherited nature and rejected the [[Pelagian view]] that human will could overcome sin on its own.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; Niebuhr believed Augustine's argument placed sin in the human will, which was corrupted by Adam's original sin. He argued that the logic behind Augustine's theodicy described sin as inevitable but unnecessary, which he believed captured the argument without relying on a literal interpretation of the fall, thus avoiding critique from scientific positions.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Peters, Hewlett &amp; Russell 2008, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1740 [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], known as Frederick the Great, came to power in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Under the rule of the philosophically-oriented Frederick II, Berlin gave birth to an intellectual renaissance in which it became one of the most important centers of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe. The city was an important book and press location, as well as the new home of many drama groups. Later, it hosted a National Theatre, the Academy of the Arts and the Academy of Sciences. 

Central to the Berlin Enlightenment was a learned society of friends known as the ''Aufklärer'' (enlighteners), including the publisher and bookseller [[Friedrich Nicolai]], the poet and philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Ramler]], the philosopher [[Johann Georg Sulzer]], [[Thomas Abbot]], [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], and [[Moses Mendelssohn]]. They pursued literary and literary interests, often linked with the goal of civil [[emancipation]]; at the same time, they were loyal and patriotic to the State of Prussia. The union of the civil enlightenment and the state of Prussia and its King bespoke their underlying national goals, and the advancement of German language and literature. This was also hindered by Frederick II's preference for the French language.

'''Cascade Framework''' is a [[Free Software|free]] [[CSS framework]] for creating [[website]]s and [[web app]]s. Similar to [[Bootstrap (framework)|Bootstrap]] and [[Foundation (framework)|Foundation]], it contains a wide range of [[HTML]] and [[CSS]]-based interface components, as well as optional [[JavaScript]] extensions.

==Origin==
Dissatisfied with the architecture of Bootstrap and Foundation, John Slegers wanted to create an alternative that offered more flexibility and better performance without cutting back on features.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} He came up with the name Cascade Framework for his project and released it under the [[MIT License]] in March 2013.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The last stable release is version 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/jslegers/cascadeframework Cascade Framework Github page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cascade Framework 2 is currently under development and will involve a rewrite of the codebase into the [[Sass (stylesheet language)|Sass]] language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascade-framework.com/ Cascade Framework]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cascade-framework.com/compare.html Cascade Framework - CSS Frameworks compared]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Cascade Framework 1.x is written in pure CSS. It supports [[responsive web design|responsive design]] and all modern browsers as well as IE6+. For an optimal balance between footprint and flexibility, it implements a modifier design pattern inspired by [[SMACCS]] and [[OOCSS]].

Binpress lists the following key features:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.binpress.com/app/cascade-framework-putting-back-the-c-in-css/1543 Binpress - Cascade Framework]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Cascade Framework is entirely based on an OOCSS architecture optimised for both performance and flexibility.
* Cascade Framework contains advanced components like “panels”, “tab blocks” and “navigation” components that can be combined in various ways.
* Cascade Framework is design agnostic. You can choose the default theme, create one of your own or just work with your own project specific custom design and leave out the default theme entirely. Both typography and color scheme are separated in separate modules to suit that purpose.
* Cascade Framework allows you to choose between a Semantic Grid technique and a presentational grid technique. Twitter Bootstrap offers only a presentational grid technique.
* With Cascade Framework, you can use any number of columns you want (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,16 and 24 columns are supported) throughout your project and nest them freely.
* Cascade Framework’s grid uses a special padding element for its gutter, which combined with the media object integration makes the grid both more powerful and easier to use than any other grid system.
* The total CSS code of Cascade Framework is only 9712 bytes minified and gzipped and can be further reduced if you don't need all modules. For many projects, you’ll do fine with a build of Cascade Framework with that’s only 3910 bytes.
* Cascade Framework has a “light” version that’s no more than 2010 bytes in total. While it doesn’t contain components like panels or tabs, it still offers you a clean design for a whole bunch of elements, support for IE6, responsive behavior, etc. If you need just its grid features, you can go as lightweight as 323 bytes.
* Cascade Framework offers support up to IE6 and there are no plans to drop support for older browsers in the near future.

Cascade Framework is open source and available on [[GitHub]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/jslegers/cascadeframework Github - Cascade Framework]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/jslegers/cascadeframeworklight Github - Cascade Framework Light]&lt;/ref&gt; Developers are encouraged to participate in the project and make their own contributions to the platform.

==Appraisal==

In an article posted on October 13, 2013, Crunchify lists Cascade Framework as #5 in its "Top 5 New and Favorite Responsive Frameworks".&lt;ref&gt;[http://crunchify.com/top-5-new-and-favorite-responsive-frameworks/ Crunchify - Top 5 New and Favorite Responsive Frameworks]&lt;/ref&gt; The first four are respectively Bootstrap, Cardinal, TypePlate and Furrato.

In an article posted on October 24, 2013, CodeGeekz lists it among "12 Fresh and Useful Frameworks".&lt;ref&gt;[http://codegeekz.com/fresh-and-useful-css-frameworks-for-developers/ CodeGeekz - Fresh and Useful CSS Frameworks for Developers]&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects listed are Gumby, Solved by Flexbox, UI Kit, SkelJS, Cardinal, Layers CSS, Grid Forms, Gridism, Maxmert, Rocket CSS and Kube Framework.

[[Linux]] portal Linuxlinks lists Cascade Framework as one of the ten "finest open source lightweight frameworks to kick start CSS and HTML projects".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20131012153228688/LightweightFrameworks.html Linuxlinks - Lightweight Frameworks to Kick Start HTML / CSS Projects]&lt;/ref&gt; Other projects listed are Quantum Framework, Pure, Baseline, HTML KickStart, Base, KNACSS, Toast, Motherplate and HTML5 Boilerplate.

Cascade Framework was [[Softpedia]]'s Script of the day on September 6, 2013.&lt;ref name="news.softpedia"&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/Script-of-the-Day-Cascade-Framework-379543.shtml Softpedia - Script of the day, September 6th, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; Softpedia's scripts tester Catalin Cimpanu&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linkedin.com/pub/catalin-cimpanu/22/a7a/585 LinkedIn - Catalin Cimpanu]&lt;/ref&gt; explains why, according to him, Cascade Framework isn't your typical framework:&lt;ref name="news.softpedia" /&gt;

{{quote|The Cascade CSS framework is a unique project these days. Unlike most CSS frameworks that focus on the UI, Cascade focuses on code organization and cross-browser compliance, something that most CSS frontend developers these days don't care about anymore.

While CSS framework developers has been busy in packing as much UI modules as they can in their frameworks' core, most of them forgot the main problem with Web development, a problem that's been around since the early 2000s: cross-browser compliance.

While most frameworks break when seen from a different, older browser, the Cascade Framework still renders the same and even gracefully degrades in ancient browsers.

Impossible right? Not impossible, but very possible, as this framework has proven. The biggest difference with Cascade compared to other CSS frameworks is the way code has been organized, making it super easy for developers to not only use, but also maintain the websites they build. All without breaking in older browsers.}}

Cascade Framework was also one of two winning submissions of a contest organised by Belgian web development company Openminds in the context of their 2013 [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] conference, called Arrrrcamp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arrrrcamp.be/blog/2013/08/05/announcing-the-winners-for-our-pull-request-contest Arrrrcamp - announcing the winners of our pull request contest] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106023502/http://arrrrcamp.be/blog/2013/08/05/announcing-the-winners-for-our-pull-request-contest |date=November 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration==

[[File:Screenshot of Cascade Framework Advanced.png|thumb|Cascade Framework Advanced]] As of May 19, 2014, a Cascade Framework-based Drupal theme has been added to the Drupal website sandbox &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.drupal.org/sandbox/florian/2269981 Drupal theme]&lt;/ref&gt; as a sandbox project.

As of October 29, 2014, Cascade Framework Advanced has been released. This Open Source project integrates Cascade Framework with [[JQuery UI]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/jslegers/cascadeframeworkadvanced Cascade Framework Advanced]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dhyāna sutras''' ({{zh|c=禪経}}) or "meditation summaries" ({{zh|c=禪要}}) are a group of early [[Buddhist meditation]] texts which are mostly based on the Yogacara{{refn|group=note|To be distinguished from the Mahayana [[Yogacara school]], though they may have been a precursor.&lt;ref name=Deleanu/&gt;}} meditation teachings of the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school of [[Kashmir]] circa 1st-4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name=Deleanu&gt;Deleanu, Florin (1992); [https://ahandfulofleaves.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mindfulness-of-breathing-in-the-dhayana-sutra_florin-deleanu_1992.pdf Mindfulness of Breathing in the Dhyāna Sūtras]. Transactions of the International Conference of Orientalists in Japan (TICOJ) 37, 42-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the texts only survive in Chinese and were key works in the development of the Buddhist meditation practices of [[Chinese Buddhism]].

==Overview==
The Dhyāna sutras focus on the concrete details of the meditative practice of the Yogacarins of northern [[Gandhara]] and [[Kashmir]] and were known as masters of Buddhist meditation. Kashmir probably became a center of dhyāna practice due to the efforts of Madhyāntika (Majjhantika), a disciple of [[Ananda|Ānanda]], who traveled north to practice and  teach meditation.&lt;ref name="ibc.ac.th"&gt;Chan, Yiu-wing (2013), [https://web.archive.org/web/20150522111224/http://ibc.ac.th/faqing/files/English_Translation_ofBuddhabhadra_Meditation_Sutra.pdf An English translation of the Dharmatrta-Dhyna Sutra], PhD thesis, University of Hongkong&lt;/ref&gt;

The five main types of meditation in these sutras are:
* [[anapanasati]] (mindfulness of breathing),  
* [[patikulamanasikara|paṭikūlamanasikāra]] meditation - mindfulness of the impurities of the body, 
* loving-kindness [[mettā|maitrī]] meditation, 
* the contemplation on the twelve links of [[pratītyasamutpāda]], 
* the contemplation on the [[Physical characteristics of the Buddha#The 32 Signs of a Great Man|Buddha’s thirty-two Characteristics]]. 

In addition some sutras contain instructions on contemplation of the [[Skandha#Eighteen Dhātus|''dhātu''-s]] (elements); contemplation of white bones and fresh corpses; and contemplation of [[bodhisattva]]s such as [[Amitābha]].&lt;ref name=Yuanci&gt;Ven. Dr. Yuanci, [http://www.undv.org/vesak2012/iabudoc/31YuanciFINAL.pdf A Study of the Meditation Methods in the DESM and Other Early Chinese Texts], The Buddhist Academy of China.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The content of these texts is connected with the Yogacara [[abhidharma]] works, especially the ''Abhidharmamahāvibhāsā-śāstra'' (MVŚ, 阿毗達磨大毗婆沙論), which frequently cites the practices of the early Yogacarins, and the large ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra]]'' (YBŚ).&lt;ref&gt;Cheung Tsui Lan Liza (2013), [http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/209436/1/FullText.pdf?accept=1 Doctrines of Spiritual Praxis from Abhidharma to Mahāyāna Yogācāra: With Special Reference to the Śrāvakabhūmi of the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra], PhD dissertation, University of Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the doctrines in these sutras are mostly in line with early Buddhist orthodoxy, they are the work of Buddhists and translators who also lived and traveled through [[Central Asia]] and [[China]], therefore some of them also include [[Mahayana]] Buddhist teachings and meditation methods common to the [[Buddhist texts#Samadhi Sutras|Samadhi sutras]]. The Dhyāna sutras are thus a set of texts which illustrate the evolution of meditation from early Buddhist methods to Mahayana techniques. Sutras such as the ''Chanfa Yaojie'' ({{zh|c=禪法要解}}, compiled in India no later than the third century) contain meditations which are derived from the earlier [[nikāya]]s as well as material dealing with the Mahayana bodhisattva ideal &lt;ref name=HangDat&gt;Thich Hang Dat, A REAPPRAISAL OF KUMĀRAJĪVA’S ROLE IN MEDIEVAL CHINESE BUDDHISM: AN EXAMINATION OF KUMĀRAJĪVA’S TRANSLATION TEXT ON “THE ESSENTIAL EXPLANATION OF THE METHOD OF DHYANA” {{cite web |url=http://www.thichhangdat.com/files/Master_Thesis.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518100726/http://www.thichhangdat.com/files/Master_Thesis.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mahayana [[śūnyatā]] teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Deleanu, Florin. 1993. “Mahāyānist Elements in Chinese Translations of Śrāvakayānist Yogācārabhūmi Texts.”&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|reason=no source is given and no references to it can be found on the internet |date=August 2016}}

One of the earliest Chinese translators of meditation summaries was the [[Parthia]]n meditation master [[An Shigao]] (安世高, 147-168 CE) who worked on various texts including the influential ''Anban shouyi jing'' (Sanskrit: Ānāpānasmṛti-sūtra), or the “Mindfulness of Breathing discourse”.&lt;ref&gt;Phra Kiattisak Ponampon Kittipanyo (2014), [https://web.archive.org/web/20150601153720/https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10523/5456/PonamponPhraK2015MA.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y Mission, Meditation and Miracles: An Shigao in Chinese Tradition], MA thesis, Dunedin, NZ: University of Otago.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Eastern Han]] period the foremost meditation technique taught by An Shigao and his school was a form of [[anapanasati]] (annabanna 安那般那) which remained influential for centuries afterwards. Most of these summaries only survive in Chinese translation and often they are not in their original form but also include later accretions such as commentary work by Chinese translators. The difficulty of working with the Chinese translations is shown by the corrupt nature of the Da Anban shouyi jing, which according to Florin Deleanu "gathers together An Shigao's original translation, almost impossible to reconstruct, fragments from An Shigao's own commentary as well as fragments
from glosses by Chen Hui, Kang Senghui, Zhi Dun, Daoan, and Xie Fu."&lt;ref name=Deleanu /&gt; A recently discovered manuscript of the Anban Shouyi Jing at Kongo-ji temple (Japan) seems to be an actual An Shigao translation.&lt;ref name="chinesebuddhiststudies.org"&gt;Huei, Shi Guo (2008).

According to Eric Greene, the Scripture on the twelve gates and its commentary provide some of the most comprehensive information on the practice of early Chinese Meditation (Chan),&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Eric (2014).

Another work, the ''Discourse on the Essential Secrets of Meditation'' (Taisho 15 no. 613) is one of the oldest texts to be translated into Chinese on the subject of meditation (circa 2nd or 3rd century CE) and therefore was likely to have had an influence on the meditation practices of [[Tiantai Buddhism]] and [[Chan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=Yuanci /&gt; This text belonged to the Buddhist [[Dārṣṭāntika]] school and the first Chinese translation was made by [[Zhi Qian]] in the early part of the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref name=Yuanci /&gt;

A later important Chinese translator of these texts was [[Kumārajīva]] (334–413 CE) who translated several important meditation sutras by 402. Kumarajiva's translated meditation scriptures such as the Chanfa yaojie (禪法要解) were widely promoted by his disciple [[Tao Sheng]]. A contemporary of Kumarajiviva, [[Buddhabhadra (translator)|Buddhabhadra]], a Sarvastivadin from [[Kapilavastu (ancient city)|Kapilavastu]], translated the Damoduoluo chan jing (Dharmatrāta Dhyāna sūtra), a Sarvastivada Dārṣṭāntika meditation manual associated with the Indian teachers [[Dharmatrāta]] and [[Buddhasena]]. This text, written in verse, includes orthodox Sarvastivadin meditation techniques such as [[anapanasati|ānāpāna-smṛti]] as well as [[tantra|tantric]] Mahayanist practices such as visualization and [[maṇḍala]] instructions. Hence this work is proof that some later Mahayana meditation practices were derived from techniques developed by Sarvastivada Yogacarins.&lt;ref name="ibc.ac.th"/&gt; Taken together, the translations by Kumarajiva and Buddhabhadra of Sarvastivadin meditation manuals laid the groundwork for the practices of [[Chan Buddhism]] (Zen) and the works of the [[Tiantai]] meditation master [[Zhiyi]].&lt;ref name=HangDat /&gt;

'''Dimitrie Cuclin''' ({{OldStyleDate|April 5|1885|March 24}} &amp;nbsp;– February 7, 1978) was a Romanian [[classical music]] composer, musicologist, philosopher, translator, and writer.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Dimitrie Cuclin was born in the city of [[Galaţi]], a port on the left shore of the [[Danube]]. His father was an immigrant from czarist [[Bessarabia]], from the village of Cucleni, near the town of [[Izmail]]. He had studied music at the Theological Seminar of Izmail and at the Universities of [[Iaşi]] and [[Bucharest]]. At the time of Dimitrie’s birth he was a music teacher at the Vasile Alecsandri High School in Galați. His mother was of peasant origin, from the village of Pechea, located about 25 miles from Galați; she was a housewife. Dimitrie Cuclin completed his primary and secondary studies in his native city, where his father was his first music teacher. During high-school, he began to compose small musical pieces, which impressed the composer G.D. Kiriac, who thus suggested that Cuclin should go to Bucharest to study music.

===Studentship===

The young composer applied first at the Conservatory (1903), where he was rejected for being above the age limit, and then at the Royal Academy of Music (1904), where he was accepted at the section of Theory and Harmony. After three years of studentship in Bucharest, Cuclin obtained a scholarship for Paris. He failed to get into the Conservatory (he was not a brilliant violin player, although he was an acceptable one), but he was admitted at [[Vincent D’Indy]]’s [[Schola Cantorum]], where he studied until his scholarship expired in 1914. Because of the government’s refusal to supplement his scholarship, Cuclin had to leave France without completing his studies, thus without a French university degree, but with an attestation from D’Indy that certified his competencies. In Paris he met his future wife, Zoe, born Dumitrescu, ex Damian (d. 1973). They were married in 1920.

===Professorship===
{{For LMST|Dimitrie|Cuclin}}

Once back in Romania, he was mobilised during the [[First World War]], but did not go to the Front. He played violin at the Orchestra of Iasi, conducted by [[George Enescu]], in what was left free of the [[Kingdom of Romania]]. After the War’s end, in 1919, he became a Professor at the Conservatory of Music, and had the title of the newly founded chair of Musical Aesthetics. Between 1922 and 1930 Cuclin taught in New York, at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music and City College of Music. He returned to the Bucharest Conservatory in 1930 and remained there until 1948, when he retired. During the Second World War, in the times of the [[National Legionary State]], Cuclin was briefly the Director of the Conservatory, but he did not have the best relations with the [[Iron Guard|Legion]], a fact that got him relieved of that responsibility.

===Retirement===

At the beginning of the [[Communist Romania|Communist]] régime, Dimitrie Cuclin was condemned for political reasons to serve two years (1950-1952) in a [[labour camp]] at the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]]. The event that fired up the regime’s reaction was Cuclin’s attendance at a musical soirée at the Goethe-Institute in Bucharest. He was thus imprisoned for being “[[idealist]]” and “[[reactionary]]”. After this sinister episode, Cuclin was able to create again, and in fact it is in this period that he commenced his career as a symphonist. Towards the end of his life, he was close to being elected a correspondent member of the [[Romanian Academy]], but the [[proletkult]] poet [[Mihai Beniuc]] opposed the move. He died in [[Bucharest]] in 1978&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsack.com/PersonFMTDetail.cfm?PersonPK=100019988|title=MusicSack|accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the complications of heart disease contracted while a prisoner in the communist work camps.

===Awards and distinctions===

He is also the author of 3 string quartets &amp; numerous other chamber, piano pieces, sacred choruses &amp; songs. In addition to these, Cuclin composed sonatas, madrigals, melodies of folkloric inspiration, etc. A detailed list of his works &amp; bibliography is contained  in Viorel Cosma's "Muzicieni romani" (Bucharest 1970).

As a composer, Cuclin is an exponent of the French school, following the line of [[César Franck]] and [[Vincent D’Indy]].

==Literature==

Cuclin wrote a lot of poetry, of which only a small part is published, and was also a translator of poetry.

===Original works===

Cuclin wrote in Romanian, English, and French. His literary works comprise theater plays, opera librettos, and poems. Among his published volumes, the following are the most important:

*''Destinée mystique. Poésies diverses'', Bucarest : Imprimeries Independența, 1919 (in French)
*''Poems'', Bucharest, Tiparul Oltenia, year unknown (in English)
*''[[Doina]]s and Sonnets'', Bucharest, Tiparul Oltenia, 1932 (in Romanian)
*''Sofonisba: Versified Tragedy in One Prologue and Three Acts'', Bucharest, Tipografia Presa, 1945

Cuclin's poetry follows the antebellic paradigm of the [[Romanian literature]], imposed by such writers as [[Heliade Rădulescu]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu|Bolintineanu]], [[Grigore Alexandrescu|Alexandrescu]], [[Alecsandri]], [[Eminescu]], [[Vlahuţă]], [[Coşbuc]] and [[Octavian Goga|Goga]]. He cultivates especially the sonnet, of which he has a musical understanding: the [[sonnet]] was for him the literary equivalent of a [[sonata]]. It is no wonder that, in the '70s, he failed to have a new poetry volume published: his style was long time outdated.

===Translations===

As a translator, Cuclin made himself remarked by his translation of Eminescu's poems in English: ''Poems'', Bucharest, I.E.Toroutiu, 1938.

He translated also from [[Latin]] the first two books of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (Ovid)|Fasti]]'', published by the same editor, year unknown.

==Philosophy==

===Works===

Cuclin had a permanent preoccupation for [[metaphysics]] all his life and he wrote several versions of a work called ''A Treatise of the Metaphysics''. The earliest such treatise that is available in manuscript is entitled ''La théorie de l’immortalité'' (1931), and an abridged version in Romanian, realised by Cuclin himself, was published only in 1990. The latest integral version of a ''Traité de la métaphysique'' dates from the ’50, most probably after Cuclin’s release from the labour camp. There are indications that Cuclin wrote at least four versions of the treatise, in French and Romanian, but those could not be found, as they are buried in the private collections.

This last book-length treatise has two subtitles, namely, “A theory of nothingness” and “Towards a new aspect of Marxism”. Cuclin had the naivety to think that the official Marxism could incorporate his philosophy. We have several published compressed versions of his metaphysical system, some being to his disciples which noted them after a lecture or oral exposition of the master, and one being written by Cuclin himself (in Cuclin 1986), thus more reliable .

Other published works with philosophical content are ''Musique: science, art et philosophie'' (Cuclin 1934), in the documents of the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy from Prague and his innovatory ''Treatise of Musical Aesthetics'' (Cuclin 1933). The first part of this treatise is a partial exposition of his metaphysical vision, the foundation of his [[aesthetics]].

===Ideas===

====General overview====

The system of Cuclin is a form of [[idealism]], but not one very easy to characterise. It is a musical [[panpsychism]], claiming influence from the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought, and showing the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] to be a living system of harmonized functions, in continuous expansion. It has been suggested that his particular brand of idealism be called “functionalist idealism” (Rusu 2002). During the communist period, the philosophy of Cuclin was considered a [[materialist]] [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] (Matei 1985, Tănase 1985), point of view contested by Rusu.

====Concept of metaphysics====

Cuclin’s explications concerning the title of his ''Traité de la métaphysique'' are of great value for the understanding of his vision. Thus, we have “a treatise” and not “the treatise”, because metaphysics can be exposed in many treatises; and we have “of the metaphysics”, and not “of metaphysics”, because there is but one “metaphysics”. “The metaphysics” is, in fact, more like “the metaphysical realm” for Cuclin, or the domain of the transcendence. Thus, he proposed to produce one of the possible surveys of this domain.

====Method of metaphysics====

The method of Cuclin is the logical enquiry, followed up to an absurdity, or violent contradiction. The contradiction is the sign of reaching the truth, because the truth is found in logical reasoning, not in reason. An absurdity is the sign that the reason does not agree with the results of the logical reasoning, but is not a sign of unreality or falseness. Rather the opposite is true, that the point of view of the reason is unreliable and many times false. With this almost [[Eleatic]] method, Cuclin reaches some sort of [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] [[monism]], which will be briefly presented in the following lines.

But firstly we will note another methodological aspect of Cuclin’s metaphysics, namely the contribution of the “[[science of music]]” to the knowledge of the reality. The science of music is not a science of the sound, because the sound is not essential to music. The phenomenon of the “enharmony” and the fact that each sound can have different functions in different chords proves to Cuclin that the sound is only the contingent bearer of a “function” which can have other contingent bearers, like emotion and feeling. The “function” is determined as a degree of movement of the soul, towards pleasure or pain. Thus, the music is literally done with the soul, not with the sound, and it passes from the sound into the soul in virtue of this invariant which is the function. The science of music, then, provides us with the laws of the function, the ultimate component of reality.

====Categories====

His central category is that of essence, which constitutes the ultimate ontological ground. Equated by Cuclin with the pure [[nothingness]], but a positive nothingness, like the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[nirvana]], the essence it is roughly an equivalent of the [[spirit]], but it differs greatly because it presents itself as a system of [[harmonic]]s, like an absolute sound composed of infinitely many harmonics, each one bearing a specific function within the whole. This realm of essence, governed by the laws of  [[harmony]] (which laws we know from the science of music) has a will, and a purpose for the realising of which the will mobilises. The purpose of this great harmonic system is to acquire self-consciousness. Therefore, the essence degrades itself in an impure mode, the substance, which is the second fundamental category of Cuclin's metaphysics.

====Cosmology====

The process of degradation that commences with the pure essence and ends with the pure substance is called by Cuclin “the separation of essence”. In this process of separation are generated diverse entities which are a mixture of substance and essence, where one of these aspects is prevalent. Actually, every extant thing is a mixture of essence and substance in different proportions. The first element into which the essence separates is the magnetism (or [[magnetic field]]), from which is further separated the electricity, followed by light and so on until the living matter is obtained. This cosmology, mostly fantastic, bears the influences of [[evolutionism]] and [[voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]], with a trace of [[Hegelianism]].

====Artistic creation and immortality====

The human being is a culmination of the substantialisation of the essence; from here the reverted process can begin, that of the re-essentialisation of the substance. The first process, the separation of the essence or its substantialisation, was also called analysis. The process of the re-essentialistion of the substance is called synthesis. Through this synthetic process which is the human creation, the re-essentialised substance can be transposed as a magnetic double in a great harmonic system, which is the image of the pure essence, regarded as re-essentialised substance. Thus, the essence stand in front of itself and, with the help of the human creation, takes consciousness of itself. This implies an [[ethics]] of creation and a theory of [[immortality]]. Through his creations the man constitutes a magnetic double of his [[Personality psychology|personality]], which is integrated in the great harmonic system which is the Essence. Thus, by contributing through creation to the becoming self-conscious of the Essence, the man becomes also immortal.

====Influence====

Although isolated from the community of the philosophers, Cuclin had private disciples which assimilated his philosophy (e.g. Ion Bârsan). One of his students, [[Alexandru Bogza]], wrote in solitude a philosophical system, called "the critical realism" (no connection with the homonymous American philosophical movement), published posthumously. This system bears the traces of a certain Cuclinian influence (Cuclin is quoted several times by Bogza), but the depth of this influence is yet to be assessed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5305">{{refimprove|date=November 2018}}'''Eisegesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|s|ɪ|s}}) is the process of interpreting a text or portion of text in such a way that the process introduces one's own presuppositions, agendas, or biases into and onto the text. This is commonly referred to as ''reading into'' the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = eisegesis… the interpretation of a text (as of the Bible) by reading into it one's own ideas… | last = Webster | title = New Collegiate Dictionary | page = 364 | publisher = G. &amp; C. Merriam | edition = 8th | year = 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The act is often used to "prove" a pre-held point of concern to the reader and to provide him or her with [[confirmation bias]] in accordance with his or her pre-held agenda. Eisegesis is best understood when contrasted with ''[[exegesis]]''. While exegesis is the process of drawing out the meaning from a text in accordance with the context and discoverable meaning of its author, ''eisegesis'' occurs when a reader imposes his or her interpretation into and onto the text. As a result, exegesis tends to be objective when employed effectively while eisegesis is regarded as highly subjective.

The plural of eisegesis is ''eisegeses'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|s|i:|z}}). An individual who practices eisegesis is known as an ''eisegete'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|aɪ|s|ɪ|ˈ|dʒ|i:|t}}); this is also the verb form. The term "eisegete" is often used in a mildly derogatory fashion.

Although the terms ''eisegesis'' and ''[[exegesis]]'' are commonly heard in association with Biblical interpretations, both (and especially exegesis) are broadly used across literary disciplines.

==In Biblical study==
While [[exegesis]] is an attempt to determine the historical context within which a particular verse exists—the so-called "[[Sitz im Leben]]" or life setting—eisegetes often neglect this aspect of [[Bible |Biblical study]].

In the field of [[Biblical exegesis]], scholars take great care to avoid eisegesis. In this field, eisegesis is regarded as "poor exegesis".

In the field of ''biblical [[Prooftext |proof texts]]'', Christian theologians and missionaries are often accused of practicing eisegesis using isolated, out-of-context quotations from the Christian Bible to establish a proposition or to read Christ into the Hebrew Bible.

While some denominations and scholars denounce Biblical eisegesis, many Christians are known to employ it—albeit inadvertently—as part of their own experiential [[theology]]. Modern [[Evangelicalism |evangelical]] scholars accuse [[liberal Protestant]]s of practicing Biblical eisegesis, while [[Mainline (Protestant) |mainline]] scholars accuse [[Fundamentalist Christianity |fundamentalists]] of practicing eisegesis. [[Roman Catholic Church |Roman Catholics]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church |Orthodox Christians]] say that all [[Protestantism |Protestants]] engage in eisegesis, because the [[Bible]] can be correctly understood only through the lens of [[Holy Tradition]] as handed down by the institutional Church; this is articulated in the ''[[Dei verbum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dei verbum | chapter = III |url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html| website= The Vatican |publisher= The Holy See |accessdate= 16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jews, in turn, might assert that Christians practice eisegesis when they read the Old Testament as anticipating Jesus of Nazareth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Kaiser, Jr.|Kaiser, W. C., Jr.]], ''The Majesty of God in the Old Testament: A Guide for Preaching and Teaching'' ([[Grand Rapids, MI]]: [[Baker Publishing Group |Baker Academic]], 2007), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=1fgSJLLanNIC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 16–17].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, M. [http://www.aish.com/sp/ph/Isaiah_53_The_Suffering_Servant.html "Isaiah 53: The Suffering Servant—Cutting Through the Distortions and Mistranslations of this Enigmatic Text"], Aish, May 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In conducting Bible translation, translators have to make many exegetical decisions. Sometimes the decisions made by translators are criticized by those who disagree, and who characterize the work of the translators as involving "eisegesis". Some translators make their doctrinal distinctives clear in a preface, such as Stephen Reynolds in his [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], where he explained his belief that Christians should never drink alcohol, and translated accordingly. Such translators may be accused by some of eisegesis, but they have made their positions clear.

Exactly what constitutes eisegesis remains a source of debate among theologians, but most scholars agree about the importance of determining the authorial intentions. Determining the author's intent can often be difficult, especially for books which were written anonymously.

== History ==

GNU social was spun out of the [[GNU FM]] project. The founder was Matt Lee and the early developers were fellow FSF employees, Donald Robertson and Deborah Nicholson.

StatusNet deployment based on the formerly known as Laconica was the [[Identi.ca]] open-microblogging service. Hosted by original StatusNet creators StatusNet Inc., Identi.ca offered free accounts to the public and serves as the co-flagship (along with freelish.us) for the installable version of StatusNet. The site has migrated to [[pump.io]].

Version 0.9.0, released March 3, 2010, added support for OStatus, a new distributed update standard superseding [[OpenMicroBlogging]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://status.net/wiki/StatusNet_0.9.0 StatusNet 0.9.0] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120717054603/http://status.net/wiki/StatusNet_0.9.0 |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://status.net/2010/03/04/statusnet-0-9-0-released StatusNet 0.9.0 Released] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120720130102/http://status.net/2010/03/04/statusnet-0-9-0-released |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

June 8, 2013 it was announced StatusNet would be merged into the GNU social project, along with Free Social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gnu.org/software/social/merge.html|title=GNU social|date=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service is interoperable with the federated social network [[Mastodon (software)|Mastodon]] and other [[OStatus]] platforms.&lt;ref name="ProjectGitHub"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon|title=tootsuite/mastodon|website=GitHub|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Names ===
StatusNet was renamed from Laconica coinciding with the release of version 0.8.1 (a.k.a. "Second Guessing") of the StatusNet software.&lt;ref name="StatusNet081WikiPageAug282009"&gt;StatusNet 0.8.1 (2009-8-28) {{cite web |url=http://status.net/wiki/StatusNet_0.8.1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112041805/http://status.net/wiki/StatusNet_0.8.1 |archivedate=2013-01-12 |df= }}, StatusNet Wiki Retrieved 2009-8-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

StatusNet's name "simply reflects what our software does: send ''status'' updates into your social ''net''work."&lt;ref name=laconica-is-now-statusnet /&gt;

Laconica's name was a reference to the [[Laconic phrase]], a particularly concise or terse statement the likes of which are famously attributed to the leaders of [[Sparta]] ([[Laconia]] being the Greek region containing Sparta). In microblogging, all messages are forced to be very short due to the ~140 character tradition on message size, thus they are all de facto laconic phrases.

'''Gabriel Patrick Duffy''' (1942–2008) was an author and philosopher born in [[Dublin, Ireland]], and is best known for his [[autobiography]], ''Sham to Rock''. Duffy emigrated to [[London]] in 1963, where he worked as an accountant. He then worked in recruitment, subsequently establishing and building up Gabriel Duffy, which in the 1980s became a well known and successful financial recruitment consultancy.  When, as a result of the [[recession]] in the early 1990s, the business hit difficulties, he turned full-time to his great love, writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gabrielduffy.org/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726071901/http://gabrielduffy.org/about.html |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has two daughters and was friendly with the novelist [[Colin Wilson]]. Duffy died of [[peritonitis]] in his [[Brighton]] flat in early December, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/mar/31/obituary-gabriel-duffy&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sham to Rock  ''"Growing Up in Forties and Fifties Dublin"'' ==

Sham to Rock was first published in 2003 by [[Aengus books]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sham-Rock-Growing-Forties-Fifties/dp/0954486803&lt;/ref&gt; It is an autobiographical account of the first 17 years of Duffy's life, and focuses on his physical, mental and social maturation in a [[Catholic]] society. The title symbolises the movement from the sham hypocrisy of the immediate post-war years to a more open and [[multicultural|cosmopolitan]] approach to life: rock. The book was well received in the media, with the [[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]] describing it as "lively and evocative, as well as beautifully and economically written"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/he-should-have-been-a-great-irish-writer-484549.html&lt;/ref&gt; while The Irish World stated that "his observations [...] will keep you riveted right through to the very last page".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theirishworld.com/&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sales of Sham to Rock were lower than expected and, given this, there were no further editions. A sequel to Sham to Rock has been drafted, but not yet published.&lt;ref&gt;http://gabrielduffy.org {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709113451/http://www.gabrielduffy.org/ |date=2011-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giorgio Agamben''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|ɡ|æ|m|b|ən}}; {{IPA-it|aˈɡambɛn|lang}}; born 22 April 1942) is an Italian philosopher best known for his work investigating the concepts of the [[state of exception]],&lt;ref&gt;Generally speaking, "state of exception" includes German ''Notstand'', English state of emergency and others [[martial law]]. Agamben prefers using this term as it underlines the structure of ''ex-ception'', which is simultaneously of inclusion and exclusion. "Ex-ception" can be opposed to the concept of "example" as developed by [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[#Work|form-of-life]] (borrowed from [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]) and ''[[homo sacer]]''. The concept of [[biopolitics]] (borrowed and adapted from [[Michel Foucault]]) informs many of his writings.

== Biography ==
Agamben was educated at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]], where in 1965 he wrote an unpublished [[laurea]] thesis on the political thought of [[Simone Weil]]. Agamben participated in [[Martin Heidegger]]'s [[Le Thor]] seminars (on [[Heraclitus]] and [[Hegel]]) in 1966 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Heidegger, ''Four Seminars'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana UP, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, he worked primarily on linguistics, philology, poetics, and topics in medieval culture. During this period, Agamben began to elaborate his primary concerns, although their political bearings were not yet made explicit. In 1974–1975 he was a fellow at the [[Warburg Institute]], [[University of London]], due to the courtesy of [[Frances Yates]], whom he met through [[Italo Calvino]]. During this fellowship, Agamben began to develop his second book, ''Stanzas'' (1977).

Agamben was close to the poets [[Giorgio Caproni]] and [[José Bergamín]], and to the Italian novelist [[Elsa Morante]], to whom he devoted the essays "The Celebration of the Hidden Treasure" (in ''The End of the Poem'') and "Parody" (in ''Profanations''). He has been a friend and collaborator to such eminent intellectuals as [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]] (in whose ''[[The Gospel According to St. Matthew (film)|The Gospel According to St. Matthew]]'' he played the part of [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]]), [[Italo Calvino]] (with whom he collaborated, for a short while, as advisor to the publishing house [[Arnoldo Mondadori Editore|Einaudi]] and developed plans for a journal), [[Ingeborg Bachmann]], [[Pierre Klossowski]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and others.

His strongest influences include [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Walter Benjamin]] and [[Michel Foucault]]. Agamben edited Benjamin's collected works in Italian translation until 1996, and called Benjamin's thought "the antidote that allowed me to survive Heidegger".&lt;ref&gt;Leland de la Durantaye, ''Giorgio Agamben: A Critical Introduction'' (Stanford, CA: Stanford UP, 2009), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Agamben discovered several important lost manuscripts by Benjamin in the archives of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. Benjamin had left these manuscripts to [[Georges Bataille]] when he fled Paris shortly before his death. The most relevant of these to Agamben's own later work were Benjamin's manuscripts for his theses ''On the Concept of History''.&lt;ref&gt;See de la Durantaye, pp. 148–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Agamben has engaged since the nineties in a debate with the political writings of the German jurist [[Carl Schmitt]], most extensively in the study ''State of Exception'' (2003). His recent writings also elaborate on the concepts of Michel Foucault, whom he calls "a scholar from whom I have learned a great deal in recent years".&lt;ref&gt;''The Signature of All Things: On Method'' (New York: Zone, 2009), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agamben's political thought was founded on his readings of [[Aristotle]]'s ''Politics'', ''Nicomachean Ethics'', and treatise ''On the Soul'', as well as the exegetical traditions concerning these texts in late antiquity and the Middle Ages. In his later work, Agamben intervenes in the theoretical debates following the publication of Nancy's essay ''La communauté désoeuvrée'' (1983),&lt;ref&gt;Nancy's essay responded to a proposal by [[Jean-Christophe Bailly]], who put the word and concept of ''community'', then relatively neglected in French philosophical discourse, up for discussion. Bailley's contribution was "The community, the number," a topic for an issue of the French magazine ''[[Aléa]]'', which was edited at that time by [[Christian Bourgois]]. Cf. Jean-Luc Nancy, ''La communauté désoeuvrée'' (Paris: Christian Bourgois, 1983). In English transl., ''The Inoperative Community'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s response, ''La communauté inavouable'' (1983). These texts analyzed the notion of [[community]] at a time when the [[European Community]] was under debate. Agamben proposed his own model of a community which would not presuppose categories of identity in ''The Coming Community'' (1990). At this time, Agamben also analyzed the ontological condition and "political" attitude of [[Bartleby, the Scrivener|Bartleby]] (from [[Herman Melville]]'s short story) — a ''scrivener'' who does not react, and "prefers not" to write.

Currently, Agamben is teaching at [[Accademia di Architettura di Mendrisio]] ([[Università della Svizzera Italiana]]) and has taught at the [[University Iuav of Venice|Università IUAV di Venezia]], the [[Collège International de Philosophie]] in Paris, and the [[European Graduate School]] in [[Saas-Fee]], Switzerland; he previously taught at the [[University of Macerata]] and at the [[University of Verona]], both in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;See: [http://www.egs.edu/faculty/giorgio-agamben/biography/ Giorgio Agamben] Faculty profile at [[European Graduate School]]{{Failed verification|date=April 2016}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326173917/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/giorgio-agamben/biography/ |date=26 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also has held visiting appointments at several American universities, from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], to [[Northwestern University]], and at [[Heinrich Heine University]], Düsseldorf. Agamben received the Prix Européen de l'Essai Charles Veillon in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-veillon.ch/prix/g_agamben.php Fondation Charles Veillon] Prix Européen de l'Essai. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he was awarded the [[Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize]] by the [[University of Tübingen]] for his work titled ''Leviathans Rätsel'' (Leviathan's Riddle, translated into English by Paul Silas Peterson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agamben|first=Giorgio. |title=Leviathans Rätsel|year=2013|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|location=Tübingen|isbn=978-3-16-153195-8|page=106|url=http://www.mohr.de/en/religious-studies/subject-areas/all-books/buch/leviathans-raetsel.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812212004/http://www.mohr.de/en/religious-studies/subject-areas/all-books/buch/leviathans-raetsel.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work &lt;!--'Bios (philosophy)' and 'Zoe (philosophy)' redirect here--&gt; ==
Much of Giorgio Agamben's work since the 1980s can be viewed as leading up to the so-called ''Homo Sacer'' project, which properly begins with the book ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life''. In this series of works, Agamben responds to [[Hannah Arendt]]'s and Foucault's studies of totalitarianism and biopolitics. Since 1995 he has been best known for this ongoing project, the volumes of which have been published out of order, and which include:

In the final volume of the series, Agamben intends to address "the concepts of forms-of-life and lifestyles." "What I call a form-of-life," he explains, "is a life which can never be separated from its form, a life in which it is never possible to separate something like bare life. [...] [H]ere too the concept of privacy comes in to play."&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Rauff, "An Interview with Giorgio Agamben," ''German Law Journal'' 5.5 (2004): 613. PDF available at [http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=437 Germanlawjournal.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040824073830/http://www.germanlawjournal.com/article.php?id=437 |date=24 August 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|If human beings were or had to be this or that [[substance theory|substance]], this or that destiny, no ethical experience would be possible&amp;nbsp;... This does not mean, however, that humans are not, and do not have to be, something, that they are simply consigned to nothingness and therefore can freely decide whether to be or not to be, to adopt or not to adopt this or that destiny (nihilism and decisionism coincide at this point). There is in effect something that humans are and have to be, but this is not an essence nor properly a thing: ''It is the simple fact of one's own existence as possibility or potentiality&amp;nbsp;...''|&lt;ref&gt;''The Coming Community'' (1993), section 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The reduction of life to 'biopolitics' is one of the main threads in Agamben's work, in his critical conception of a ''homo sacer'', reduced to 'bare life', and thus deprived of any rights. Agamben's concept of the ''homo sacer'' rests on a crucial distinction in Greek between "bare life" (''la vita nuda'' or '''''zoê'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|oʊ|i}}; Gk. ζωή ''zoê'') and "a particular mode of life" or "qualified life" ('''''bios'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|b|aɪ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|oʊ|s}}; Gk. βίος ''bios''). In Part III, section 7 of ''Homo Sacer'', "The Camp as the 'Nomos' of the Modern", he evokes the [[concentration camps]] of World War II. "The camp is the space that is opened when the state of exception begins to become the rule." Agamben says that "What happened in the camps so exceeds (is outside of) the juridical concept of crime that the specific juridico-political structure in which those events took place is often simply omitted from consideration." The conditions in the camps were "''conditio inhumana''," and the incarcerated somehow defined outside the boundaries of humanity, under the exception laws of ''[[Schutzhaft]]''. Where law is based on vague, unspecific concepts such as "race" or "good morals," law and the personal subjectivity of the judicial agent are no longer distinct.

In the process of creating a state of exception these effects can compound. In a realized state of exception, one who has been accused of committing a crime, within the legal system, loses the ability to use his voice and represent themselves. The individual can not only be deprived of their citizenship, but also of any form of agency over their own life. "Agamben identifies the state of exception with the power of decision over life."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Ranciere]]. Who is the Subject of the Rights of Man? ''South Atlantic Quarterly'', 2004, 103(2–3):297–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the state of exception, the distinction between ''bios'' (the life of the citizen) and ''zoê'' (the life of ''homo sacer'') is made by those with judicial power. For example, Agamben would argue that [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]] exemplifies the concept of 'the state of exception' in the United States following 9–11. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Agamben mentions that basic universal [[human rights]] of Taliban individuals while captured in Afghanistan and sent to Guantánamo Bay in 2001 were negated by US laws. In reaction to the removal of their basic human rights, detainees of Guantánamo Bay prison went on [[Guantanamo hunger strike|hunger strike]]s. Within a state of exception, when a detainee is placed outside the law, he is according to Agamben, reduced to "bare life" in the eyes of the judicial powers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Here, one can see why such measures as hunger strikes can occur in such places as prisons. Within the framework of a system that has deprived the individual of power, and their individual basic human freedoms, the hunger strike can be seen as a weapon or form of resistance. "The body is a model which can stand for any bounded system. Its boundaries can represent any boundaries which are threatened or precarious."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Douglas. ''Purity and Danger: An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo'' (1966) London: Ark Paperbacks, 1984, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; Within a state of exception the boundaries of power are precarious and threaten to destabilize not only the law, but one's humanity, as well as their choice of life or death. Forms of resistance to the extended use of power within the state of exception as suggested in Guantánamo Bay prison also operate outside the law. In the case of the hunger strike, the prisoners were threatened and endured force feeding not allowing them to die. During the [[hunger strikes]] at Guantánamo Bay prison, accusations and founded claims of forced feedings began to surface in the autumn of 2005. In February 2006, ''The New York Times'' reported that prisoners were being force fed in Guantánamo Bay prison and in March 2006, more than 250 medical experts, as reported by the BBC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4790742.stm "Doctors attack US over Guantanamo"]&lt;/ref&gt; voiced their opinions of the forced feedings stating that this was a breach of the government's power and was against the rights of the prisoners.

===''The Coming Community'' (1993)===
In ''The Coming Community'', published in Italian in 1990 and translated into English by longtime admirer [[Michael Hardt]] in 1993, Agamben describes the social and political manifestation of his philosophical thought. Employing diverse short essays he describes the nature of "whatever singularity" as that which has an "inessential commonality, a solidarity that in no way concerns an essence". It is important to note his understanding of "whatever" not as being indifference but based on the Latin "quodlibet ens"&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Salzani - [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/474289/pdf Quodlibet: Giorgio Agamben's Anti-Utopia]&lt;/ref&gt; translated as "being such that it always matters".

Agamben starts off by describing ''"The Lovable"''

{{quotation|Love is never directed toward this or that property of the loved one (being blond, being small, being tender, being lame), but neither does it neglect the properties in favor of an insipid generality (universal love): The lover wants the loved one ''with all of its predicates'', its being such as it is.|&lt;ref&gt;''The Coming Community'' (1993), page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the same sense, Agamben talks about "ease" as the "place" of love, or "rather love as the experience of taking-place in a whatever singularity", which resonates his use of the concept "use" in the later works.

{{quotation|In this sense, ease names perfectly that "free use of the proper" that, according to an expression of [[Friedrich Hölderlin]]'s, is "the most difficult task." |&lt;ref&gt;''The Coming Community'' (1993), page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Following the same trend, he employs, among others, the following to describe the "watershed of whatever":

*Example – particular and universal
*Limbo – blessed and damned
*Homonym – concept and idea
*Halo – potentiality and actuality
*Face – common and proper, genus and individual
*Threshold – inside and outside
*Coming community – state and non-state (humanity)&lt;ref name="The Coming Community 1993"&gt;''The Coming Community'' (1993){{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other themes addressed in ''The Coming Community'' include the commodification of the body, evil, and the messianic.

Unlike other continental philosophers he does not reject the age-old dichotomies of subject/object and potentiality/actuality outright, but rather turns them inside-out, pointing out the zone where they become indistinguishable.

{{quotation|Matter that does not remain beneath form, but surrounds it with a halo|&lt;ref name="The Coming Community 1993"/&gt;}}

The political task of humanity, he argues, is to expose the innate potential in this zone of indistinguishability. And although criticised as dreaming the impossible by certain authors,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Simoes da Silva. [https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_2/dasilva.htm Strip It Bare – Agamben's Message For A More Hopeful World.] Book Review. 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615053052/http://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_2/dasilva.htm |date=15 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he nonetheless shows a concrete example of ''whatever singularity'' acting politically:

{{quotation|Whatever singularity, which wants to appropriate belonging itself, its own being-in-language, and thus rejects all identity and every condition of belonging, is the principal enemy of the State. Wherever these singularities peacefully demonstrate their being in common there will be Tiananmen, and, sooner or later, the tanks will appear|&lt;ref&gt;''The Coming Community'' (1993), page 86.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== ''Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'' (1995) &lt;!--'Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life'' (1995)' redirects here --&gt; ===
In his main work ''"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life"'' (1998), Giorgio Agamben analyzes an obscure&lt;ref&gt;''Homo Sacer'', p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; figure of [[Roman law]] that poses fundamental questions about the nature of law and [[power (sociology)|power]] in general. Under the laws of the Roman Empire, a man who committed a certain kind of crime was banned from society and all of his rights as a [[citizenship|citizen]] were revoked. He thus became a ''"[[homo sacer]]"'' (sacred man). In consequence, he could be killed by anybody, while his life on the other hand was deemed "sacred", so he could not be sacrificed in a ritual ceremony.

Although Roman law no longer applied to someone deemed a ''Homo sacer'',  they remained "under the spell" of law. Agamben explains the latter idea as "human life&amp;nbsp;... included in the juridical order solely in the form of its exclusion (that is, of its capacity to be killed)". ''Homo sacer'' was therefore ''excluded'' from law itself, while being ''included'' at the same time. This figure is the exact mirror image of the [[sovereignty|sovereign]] (''[[basileus]]'') — a king, emperor, or president — who stands, on the one hand, ''within'' law (so he can be condemned, e.g., for treason, as a natural person) and ''outside'' the law (since as a [[body politic]] he has power to suspend law for an indefinite time).

Giorgio Agamben draws on Carl Schmitt's definition of the Sovereign as the one who has the power to decide the state of exception (or ''[[justitium]]''), where law is indefinitely "suspended" without being abrogated. But if Schmitt's aim is to include the necessity of state of emergency under the rule of law, Agamben on the contrary demonstrates that all life cannot be subsumed by law. As in ''Homo sacer'', the state of emergency is the inclusion of life and necessity in the juridical order solely in the form of its exclusion.{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}

Agamben opines that laws have always assumed the authority to define "bare life" — ''zoe'', as opposed to ''bios'', that is 'qualified life' — by making this exclusive operation, while at the same time gaining power over it by making it the subject of political control. The power of law to actively separate "political" beings (citizens) from "bare life" (bodies) has carried on from [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] to [[Modernity]] — from, literally, [[Aristotle]] to [[Auschwitz]]. Aristotle, as Agamben notes, constitutes political life via a simultaneous inclusion and exclusion of "bare life": as Aristotle says, man is an animal born to life (Gk. ζῆν, ''zen''), but existing with regard to the [[Eudaimonia|good life]] (εὖ ζῆν, ''eu zen'') which can be achieved through politics.&lt;ref&gt;''Homo Sacer'', Stanford UP, 1998, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Bare life, in this ancient conception of politics, is that which must be transformed, via the State, into the "good life"; that is, bare life is that which is supposedly excluded from the higher aims of the state, yet is included precisely so that it may be transformed into this "good life". Sovereignty, then, is conceived from ancient times as the power which determines what or who is to be incorporated into the political body (in accord with its ''bios'') by means of the more originary exclusion (or exception) of what is to remain outside the political body—which is at the same time the source of that body's composition (''zoe'').&lt;ref&gt;"Sovereign violence is in truth founded not on a pact but on the exclusive inclusion of bare life in the state." (''Homo Sacer'', Stanford UP, 1998, p. 107)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Agamben, [[biopower]], which takes the bare lives of the citizens into its political calculations, may be more marked in the modern state, but has essentially existed since the beginnings of sovereignty in the West, since this structure of ''ex-ception'' is essential to the core concept of sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Of course, this understanding of "biopower" is distinct from Foucault's use of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;

Agamben would continue to expand the theory of the state of exception first introduced in ''"Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life"'', ultimately leading to the ''"State of Exception"'' in 2005. Instead of leaving a space between law and life, the space where human action is possible, the space that used to constitute politics, he argues that politics has "contaminated itself with law" in the state of exception. Because "only human action is able to cut the relationship between violence and law", it becomes increasingly difficult within the state of exception for humanity to act against the State.

=== ''State of Exception'' (2005) ===&lt;!--Linked from 'Auctoritas'--&gt;
In this book, Giorgio Agamben traces the concept of '[[state of exception]]' (''Ausnahmezustand'') used by Carl Schmitt to Roman ''[[justitium]]'' and ''[[auctoritas]]''. This leads him to a response to Carl Schmitt's definition of [[sovereignty]] as the power to proclaim the exception.

Agamben's text ''State of Exception'' investigates the increase of power by governments which they employ in supposed times of crisis. Within a state of emergency, Agamben refers to the states of exception, where constitutional rights can be diminished, superseded and rejected in the process of claiming this extension of power by a government.

The state of exception invests one person or government with the power and voice of authority over others extended well beyond where the law has existed in the past. "In every case, the state of exception marks a threshold at which [[logic]] and [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] blur with each other and a pure violence without ''logos'' claims to realize an enunciation without any real reference" (Agamben, pg 40). Agamben refers a continued state of exception to the Nazi state of Germany under Hitler's rule. "The entire Third Reich can be considered a state of exception that lasted twelve years. In this sense, modern totalitarianism can be defined as the establishment, by means of the state of exception, of a legal civil war that allows for the physical elimination not only of political adversaries but of entire categories of citizens who for some reason cannot be integrated into the political system" (Agamben, pg 2).

The political power over others acquired through the state of exception, places one government — or one form or branch of government — as all powerful, operating outside the laws. During such times of extension of power, certain forms of knowledge shall be privileged and accepted as true and certain voices shall be heard as valued, while of course, many others are not. This oppressive distinction holds great importance in relation to the production of knowledge. The process of both acquiring knowledge, and suppressing certain knowledge, is a violent act within a time of crisis.

Agamben's ''State of Exception'' investigates how the suspension of laws within a state of emergency or crisis can become a prolonged state of being. More specifically, Agamben addresses how this prolonged state of exception operates to deprive individuals of their citizenship. When speaking about the military order issued by President George W. Bush on 13 November 2001, Agamben writes, "What is new about President Bush's order is that it radically erases any legal status of the individual, thus producing a legally unnameable and unclassifiable being. Not only do the Taliban captured in Afghanistan not enjoy the status of POW's (prisoner of war) as defined by the [[Geneva Convention]], they do not even have the status of people charged with a crime according to American laws" (Agamben, pg 3). Many of the individuals captured in Afghanistan were taken to be held at [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantánamo Bay]] without trial. These individuals were termed as "[[enemy combatants]]." Until 7 July 2006, these individuals had been treated outside the Geneva Conventions by the United States administration.

==== ''Auctoritas'', "charisma" and ''Führertum'' doctrine ====
Agamben shows that ''auctoritas'' and ''[[potestas]]'' are clearly distinct — although they form together a [[Wiktionary:binary|binary]] system".&lt;ref&gt;''State of Exception'' (2005){{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], who explains that ''auctoritas'' is "less than an [[General order|order]] and more than an advice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodor Mommsen]], ''Römisches Staatsrecht'' ("Roman Constitutional Law", volume III) (Graz, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

While ''potestas'' derives from social function, ''auctoritas'' "immediately derives from the ''patres'' personal condition". As such, it is akin to [[Max Weber]]'s concept of [[charismatic authority|charisma]]. This is why the tradition ordered, at the king's death, the creation of the sovereign's wax-double in the ''funus imaginarium'', as [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] demonstrated in ''The King's Two Bodies'' (1957). Hence, it is necessary to distinguish two bodies of the sovereign in order to assure the continuity of ''dignitas'' (term used by Kantorowicz, here a synonym of ''auctoritas''). Moreover, in the person detaining ''auctoritas'' — the sovereign — [[Public sphere|public life]] and [[Private sphere|private life]] have become inseparable. [[Augustus]], the first Roman emperor who claimed ''auctoritas'' as the basis of ''[[princeps]]'' status in a famous passage of ''Res Gestae'', had opened up his house to public eyes.

The concept of ''auctoritas'' played a key-role in fascism and [[Nazism]], in particular concerning Carl Schmitt's theories, argues Agamben:

{{quotation|To understand modern phenomena such as the fascist ''[[Duce]]'' or the Nazi ''[[Führer]]'', it is important not to forget their continuity with the principle of ''auctoritas principis'' {Agamben refers here to Augustus's ''Res Gestae''}. {...} Neither does the ''Duce'' nor the ''Führer'' represent constitutionally defined public charges – even though Mussolini and Hitler endorsed respectively the charge of head of government and Reich's chancellor, just as Augustus endorsed the ''imperium consulare'' or the ''potestas tribunicia''. The ''Duce''{{'}}s or the ''Führer''{{'}}s qualities are immediately related to the physical person and belong to the [[biopolitical]] tradition of ''auctoritas'' and not to the juridical tradition of ''potestas''|&lt;ref&gt;''State of Exception'', chapter 6: "''Auctoritas'' and ''potestas''", §7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, Agamben opposes Foucault's concept of "[[biopolitics]]" to right (law), as he defines the state of exception, in ''Homo sacer'', as the inclusion of life by right under the figure of ex-ception, which is simultaneously inclusion and exclusion. Following Walter Benjamin's lead, he explains that our task would be to radically differentiate "pure violence" from right, instead of tying them together, as did Carl Schmitt.

Agamben concludes his chapter on "''Auctoritas'' and ''potestas''" writing:

{{quotation|It is significative that modern specialists were so inclined to admit that ''auctoritas'' was inherent to the living person of the ''pater'' or the ''princeps''. What was evidently an ideology or a ''fictio'' aiming to be the groundwork of ''auctoritas''' preeminence or, at least, specific rank compared to ''potestas'' thus became a figure of right's {law – "droit"} [[immanence]] to life. (...) Although it is evident that there can't be an eternal human type that would incarnate itself each time in Augustus, Napoleon, Hitler, but only more or less comparable ("semblables") mechanisms {"dispositif", a term often used by Foucault} – the state of exception, ''justitium'', the ''auctoritas principis'', the ''Führertum'' -, put in use in more or less different circumstances, in the 1930s – overall, but not only – in Germany, the power that Weber had defined as "charismatic" is related to the concept of ''auctoritas'' and elaborated in a ''[[Führertum]]'' doctrine as the original and personal power of a leader. In 1933, in a short article intending to define the fundamental concepts of national-socialism, Schmitt defines the ''Führung'' principle by the "root identity between the leader and his entourage" {"''identité de souche entre le chef et son entourage"''} (we shall note the use of weberian concepts).|&lt;ref&gt;''State of Exception'', chapter 6, §8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Agamben's thoughts on the state of emergency leads him to declare that the difference between dictatorship and democracy is thin indeed, as [[rule by decree#Giorgio Agamben's critique of the use of decrees-law|rule by decree]] became more and more common, starting from World War I and the reorganization of constitutional balance. Agamben often reminds that [[Hitler]] never ''abrogated'' the [[Weimar Constitution]]: he ''suspended'' it for the whole duration of the [[Third Reich]] with the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], issued on 28 February 1933. Indefinite suspension of law is what characterizes the state of exception. Thus, Agamben connects Greek political philosophy through to the [[concentration camps]] of 20th century fascism, and even further, to detainment camps in the likes of [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantánamo Bay]] or immigration detention centers, such as [[Bari]], Italy, where asylum seekers have been imprisoned in football stadiums. In these kinds of camps, entire zones of exception are being formed: the state of exception becomes a status under which certain categories of people live, a ''capture'' of life by right. Sovereign law makes it possible to create entire areas in which the application of the law itself is held suspended, which is the basis of the [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s definition of an "[[unlawful combatant|enemy combatant"]].

===''The Highest Poverty'' (2011)===

The English edition was translated by Adam Kotsko. In this study of medieval monastic rules, Agamben offers a genealogical approach to several concepts that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] established in his late philosophy, primarily the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'': [[rule-following]], [[Form of life (philosophy)|form-of-life]], and the central importance of '[[Use theory|use]]' (for Wittgenstein: 'the meaning of a word is its use in language', and he uses 'language' not just to speak of word-language but any understandable behaviour). Agamben traces earlier versions of the term 'form-of-life' throughout the development of monastic life, beginning with the establishment of a genre of written rules in the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Giorgio Agamben 2013"&gt;Giorgio Agamben. The Highest Poverty: Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life. Translated by Adam Kotsko. Stanford CA: Stanford University Press 2013, p.xiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the book is to differentiate between 'law' and a particular use of rule that is opposite to the implementation of law. In order to sketch out the potential of this concept, we would need 'a theory of use – of which Western philosophy lacks even the most elementary principles'.&lt;ref name="Giorgio Agamben 2013"/&gt; Agamben turns to the Franciscans to survey a unique historical incident of a group organising itself with a rule that ''is'' their life, and thinking of their own lives not as their own possession but as a communal 'use'; he looks at the ways in which this idea developed and how it eventually lapsed into the church's law.
According to reviewer [[Nathan Schneider]], "''The Highest Poverty'' examines two medieval Christian attempts, in the name of eternal life, to live this life beyond the reach of ordinary politics: several centuries of monasticism, and then the brief and momentous epiphany in the movement founded by Francis of Assisi. Each, according to Agamben, fails in revealing ways."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commies for Christ|last=Schneider|first=Nathan|publisher=The New Inquiry|date=December 13, 2013|url=http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/commies-for-christ/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of US response to 9/11 ===
Giorgio Agamben is particularly critical of the United States' response to [[11 September 2001 attacks|11 September 2001]], and its instrumentalization as a permanent condition that legitimizes a "[[state of exception]]" as the dominant paradigm for governing in contemporary politics. He warns against a "generalization of the state of exception" through laws like the [[USA PATRIOT Act]], which means a permanent installment of [[martial law]] and [[emergency powers]]. In January 2004, he refused to give a lecture in the United States because under the [[US-VISIT]] he would have been required to give up his [[biometric]] information, which he believed stripped him to a state of "bare life" (''zoe'') and was akin to the [[tattooing]] that the [[Nazis]] did during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Giorgio Agamben. {{cite news |title=''Non au tatouage biopolitique'' "No to Bio-Political Tattooing" |date=10 January 2004 |publisher=[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/totalControl.html "No to Bio-Political Tattooing"] by Giorgio Agamben, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], 10 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Agamben's criticisms target a broader scope than the US "[[war on terror]]". As he argues in ''State of Exception'' (2005), [[rule by decree]] has become common since World War I in all modern states, and has been since then generalized and abused. Agamben points out a general tendency of modernity, recalling for example that when [[Francis Galton]] and [[Alphonse Bertillon]] invented "judicial photography" for "[[anthropometric]] identification", the procedure was reserved to criminals; to the contrary, today's society is tending toward a generalization of this procedure to all citizens, placing the population under permanent suspicion and [[surveillance]]: "The political body thus has become a criminal body". And Agamben notes that the [[Jews deportation]] in [[Vichy France|France]] and other occupied countries was made possible by the photos taken from [[identity cards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} Giorgio Agamben. {{cite news|title=''Non à la biométrie'' ("No to Biometrics")|date=5 December 2005|publisher=''[[Le Monde]]''|url=http://souriez.info/article.php3?id_article=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Agamben's political criticisms open up in a larger philosophical [[critique]] of the concept of sovereignty itself, which he argues is intrinsically related to the state of exception.

'''Harry George Drickamer''' (November 19, 1918 – May 6, 2002), born Harold George Weidenthal, was a pioneer experimentalist in high-pressure studies of [[condensed matter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jonas, Jiri|author2=Slichter, Charles|authorlink2=Charles Pence Slichter|title=Obituary: Harry George Drickamer|journal=Physics Today|date=October 2002|volume=55|issue=10|pages=71|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/55/10/10.1063/1.1522182|doi=10.1063/1.1522182}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work generally concerned understanding the electronic properties of matter.

Drickamer was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], USA, to Louise Weidenthal and Harold Weidenthal. His father died when Harry was very young, and after his mother remarried, Harry’s stepfather adopted him. After graduating early from public schools in East Cleveland, he played minor league professional baseball in the [[Cleveland Indians]] farm system, then entered [[Vanderbilt University]] on a football scholarship. He soon transferred to [[Indiana University]] and then to the [[University of Michigan]], where he received a B.S. in [[chemical engineering]] in 1941 and master's degree one year later.

In 1942 Drickamer began work at the Pan American Refinery in [[Texas City, Texas]]. After his fellow students played a prank by forging his name on a sign-up sheet for the Ph.D. qualifying exam in chemical engineering, he decided to take the 16-hour exam. After he started work in Texas, he received word that he had passed. He then combined work with study of [[physics]] and [[quantum mechanics]], and in February 1946 returned to the University of Michigan for one term to receive his Ph.D.

Drickamer joined the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], where he subsequently remained for his entire professional career. After his initial appointment as an assistant professor of chemical engineering in 1946, he was promoted to associate professor in 1949 and to full professor in 1953. In 1958 he was appointed professor of chemical engineering and physical chemistry, and in 1983 he became professor of chemical engineering, chemistry, and physics.

==Legacy==
Drickamer died of stroke on May 6, 2002, in Urbana. In honor of his outstanding achievements and hard work, one graduate student every year at Illinois from either Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Chemistry, or Physics will be awarded the Harry G. Drickamer Research Fellowship via the Drickamer Fund.

Harry is the father of esteemed biochemist Kurt Drickamer, currently a professor at [[Imperial College London], discoverer of C-type Lectins. His other son, Lee C. Drickamer is a well-known animal behaviorist and textbook author who received the 2010 Distinguished Animal Behaviorist Award from the Animal Behavior Society. Now retired as Regents' Professor Emeritus, he spent his academic career at Williams College, Southern Illinois University, and Northern Arizona University.

'''''Indigo''''' is a 2003 American fantasy drama film produced and directed by Stephen Deutsch (credited as Stephen Simon).&lt;ref name=King&gt;{{cite book|title=Luminous: The Spiritual Life on Film|last=King|first=Mike|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2014|isbn=9781476613239|pages=60–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vNeAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film deals with the supposed phenomenon of "[[indigo children]]" — a set of children alleged to have certain "special psychological and spiritual attributes". Its release was sponsored by the Spiritual Cinema Circle, a DVD club that mails spiritually themed films to subscribers each month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/commentaries/moviesthatmove.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041014185716/http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/commentaries/moviesthatmove.html|title=Movies that Move|last=Ward|first=Angie|work=[[Christianity Today]]|date=2004-10-12|archivedate=2004-10-14|accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
At the beginning of the story Ray Talloway ([[Neale Donald Walsch]]) is a construction manager whose business is near bankruptcy. His semi-estranged daughter Cheryl (Sarah Rutan) quarrels with him on the slightest pretext, while her husband Alex (Gregory Linington) is one of a small group of minor criminals. Cheryl and Alex have one daughter, Grace (shared role by Meghan McCandless as older Grace and Angelina Hess as younger Grace), who is the [[indigo child]] of the story, and who eventually reunites the family.

One night, Alex takes Cheryl to a "party" that promises something exciting to happen to the participants (presumably overuse of drugs). Cheryl is worried by leaving Grace alone in the car; therefore, Alex leaves to check on her. A few minutes later, a police detachment arrests every one of the criminals. Grace, who was asleep in the car, wakes and sees her mother taken to prison. Ray, who is asleep at home, receives a call from the police station informing him of his daughter's arrest. He goes to the police station, arriving deep in telephone conversation with one of his business partners, who warns him of protest by environmentalists at the site of one of his latest projects. This causes him to abandon his daughter at the station and drive to the site. The sight of the crowd protesting his efforts to eradicate a forest to make room for a new highway, combined with the effect of having his daughter arrested, causes him to experience a small nervous breakdown.

Here, the film jumps ahead five years. In the interim, Ray has lost his job and is living at home alone, as the owner of a very old car which is on the verge of disintegration. Cheryl has been in jail for possession of illegal drugs even though she is innocent. Ray has neither come to visit her nor bailed her out of prison. Grace is living in a children's home superintended by a nurse (Saffron Henke). Alex has fled, possibly to [[Canada]], and has not appeared since.

A visit by her lawyer leaves Cheryl afraid for Grace's safety, the lawyer having intimated that Alex might kidnap Grace in exchange for money he believes to be in Cheryl's possession. After this scene is over, viewers see the lawyer walking to a car and accepting a bribe. Cheryl, who has not seen this, calls Ray asking that he visit her. When he arrives, Cheryl tells him of the lawyer's information and asks him to retrieve Grace and take care of her until Cheryl is released on parole. Ray does so, out of a sense of duty towards his daughter and guilt at being an inadequate father and grandfather. Upon her reappearance, Grace is revealed to have developed her supermundane abilities to the point where they are unsettling to Ray, who unceremoniously kidnaps her with her consent and aid. Having escaped, the two meet with Ray's girlfriend Sally (Lynette Louise), who temporarily harbors them. Ray and Grace later drive north to [[Ashland, Oregon]], where they think to hide until Cheryl's parole takes effect. On the way, they spend the night in a hotel and begin to develop a bond. The hotel manager is astonished next morning when Grace brings his father, who suffers a severe case of [[Alzheimer's disease]], into waking consciousness. He reacts with the accusation that it is the work of the devil, whereupon Ray and Grace leave, while the father and son begin to reconcile.

At a park, Grace befriends a lonely boy called Nicholas, who like her is one of the [[indigo children]]. The nature thereof is explained to Ray (and thus to the viewer) by Nicholas' mother while the children play.

Further north, Ray's car finally fails to operate so that he and Grace are forced to walk. They are befriended by a group of teenagers who are on their way to Mt. Ashland, one of whom is played by Neale's son, Karus Walsch, with whom they spend the night in a cabin. Karus's character, Logan, is disturbed by Grace's telling of a story of his childhood that revives painful memories. According to her, he could communicate with angels when he was a boy but suppressed his ability when his older brother beat him whenever he talked about it. Another one of the teenagers, Emma, expresses skepticism and anger at Grace's powers, especially when Grace claims to see the spirit of Emma's mother; later, Emma accepts Grace's ways and becomes grateful.

When Ray and Grace arrive at the arranged cabin, they find to Ray's surprise that it is occupied by Ray's long-estranged son Stewart (Dane Bowman). Stewart is there to collect the money that he thinks Cheryl hid and believes that Grace knows where it is. He takes her hostage; at this, Ray claims that Grace requires a medicine that is in his suitcase. Stewart allows Ray to open the suitcase, in which is no medicine but a pistol, with which Ray intends to frighten his son. As Ray reaches for the pistol, he suddenly recalls his past and reconsiders his decision. He attempts to apologize to Stewart, but Stewart refuses to accept this. An arrival of two police officers at the cabin surprises them all, with the exception of Grace, who had summoned them. Grace reveals that the younger of the two, Officer Whitfield, was one of the officers who had captured Cheryl, and that he has illegally been using the money Stewart sought.

The film ends with the reconciliation and reunion of the family.

'''Dr. Ivan Seliminski'''  (1799-1866) was a prominent [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] philosopher, scholar, teacher and medical doctor.

== Education ==
He was born in [[Sliven]] in 1799. Later  he took the name of this town as his surname. His early school years were spent in a Greek school in Sliven. His secondary education was in Kidonia. He traveled in [[Europe]].

== Teacher ==

Seliminski returned to Sliven in 1825. He opened a school in which he taught physics. His school became one of the first Bulgarian lower level  secondary schools.

== Evacuation in Bessarabia ==

On the eve of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russian-Turkish War]] (1828 - 1829) he organized many Bulgarians to support the Russian army. With the creation of revolutionary organizations in Sliven and some other cities, Seliminski became the first major Bulgarian revolutionary. After the war Seliminski participated in Russian delegations. Many Bulgarian people left their homes and emigrated to the other side of the [[Danube]] in Vlahia. Ivan Seliminski opened a school and was a teacher in New Sliven (now Berjazka) and [[Bucharest]].

== Medical Doctor ==
From 1840 to 1844 Seliminski studied medicine in [[Athens]]. After that he traveled to [[Paris]] (1845) and practiced as a medical doctor in Bucharest, [[Braila]] and [[Bessarabia]] until the end of his life (1845 - 1866).

[[File:Korea-Jeonju Hyanggyo 4342-07.JPG|thumb|Daeseongjeon (shrine hall) at the Jeonju Hyanggyo]]

The '''Jeonju Hyanggyo''' is a [[hyanggyo]] (school) originally established at the Gyeonggijeon Shrine site in [[Jeonju]], [[Korea]], sometime early in the 15th century, during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).&lt;ref name="KSJH"&gt;http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264422&lt;/ref&gt; Gyeonggijeon Shrine was erected in  1410 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiarooms.com/travel-guide/south-korea/south-korea-tourist-attractions/major-historic-sites-in-south-korea/gyeonggijeon-shrine-in-south-korea.html&lt;/ref&gt; so construction of the Jeonju Hyanggyo had to follow sometime later.

At the time of the Second Japanese Invasion in 1592 the Gyeonggijeon Shrine and the Jeonju Hyanggyo were completely destroyed.  In 1603 the hyanggyo was moved to and rebuilt at its present Jeonju location.&lt;ref name="AHA"&gt;http://www.orientalarchitecture.com/koreasouth/jeonju/jeonjuhyanggyo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the more typical hyanggyo Jeonhakhumyo style described above at the [[Goheung Hyanggyo]], The Jeonju Hyanggyo employees the less conventional style of being placed on level ground.  The memorial enshrinement area centers on the Daeseongjeon (Confucian shrine hall) in the front, while the educational area centers on the Myeongyundang (lecture hall) that is located the rear.  This is an unusual configuration for a hyanggyo.  In all, there are a total of 99 rooms at the Jeonju Hyanggyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocp.go.kr/jsp/vr/cybertour_main.jsp?codeid%3D13020401%26eflag%3DE |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611153914/http://www.ocp.go.kr/jsp/vr/cybertour_main.jsp?codeid=13020401&amp;eflag=E |archivedate=2011-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeonju Hyanggyo is designated historical treasure #379.&lt;ref name="KSJH"/&gt;

'''John Hadley''' (born 27 September 1966) is an Australian [[philosopher]] whose research concerns [[moral philosophy|moral]] and [[political philosophy]], including [[animal ethics]], [[environmental ethics]] and [[metaethics]]. He is currently a [[senior lecturer]] in philosophy in the School of Humanities and Communication Arts at [[Western Sydney University]]. He has previously taught at [[Charles Sturt University]] and the [[University of Sydney]], where he studied as an [[undergraduate]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] candidate. In addition to a variety of articles in [[peer-reviewed journals]] and [[edited collections]], he is the author of the 2015 [[monograph]] ''Animal Property Rights'' ([[Lexington Books]]) and the co-editor, with [[Elisa Aaltola]], of the 2015 collection ''Animal Ethics and Philosophy'' ([[Rowman &amp; Littlefield International]]). 

Hadley is known for his account of animal [[property rights]] theory. He proposes that wild animals be offered property rights over their [[territory (animal)|territories]], and that guardians be appointed to represent their interests in decision-making procedures. He suggests that this account could be justified directly, on the basis of the interests of the animals concerned, or indirectly, so that natural environments are protected. The theory has received discussion in popular and academic contexts, with critical responses from farming groups and mixed responses from moral and political theorists. Hadley has also conducted research on normative issues related to [[animal rights]] extremism, the aiding of others and [[utilitarianism]].

==Career==
Hadley read for a [[bachelor of arts]] and [[doctorate]] in philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]] (USYD).&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; His [[doctoral thesis]] was supervised by Caroline West,&lt;ref name="2015-ix"&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; in USYD's Department of Philosophy, and was submitted in 2006 under the title of ''Animal Property: Reconciling Ecological Communitarianism and Species-egalitarian Liberalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal property|url=http://opac.library.usyd.edu.au/record=b3267296~S4|format=library record|publisher= University of Sydney Library|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his doctoral research, the "basic elements" of his animal property rights theory were "first assembled",&lt;ref name="2015-ix"/&gt; leading to the publication of "Nonhuman Animal Property: Reconciling Environmentalism and Animal Rights" in the ''[[Journal of Social Philosophy]]''.&lt;ref name="Reconciling"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2005|title=Nonhuman Animal Property: Reconciling Environmentalism and Animal Rights|journal=[[Journal of Social Philosophy]]|volume=36|issue=3|pages=305–15|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2005.00277.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he also published in the ''[[Journal of Value Inquiry]]'',&lt;ref name="Machan"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2004|title=Using and abusing others: A reply to Machan|journal=[[Journal of Value Inquiry]]|volume=38|issue=3|pages=411–4|doi=10.1007/s10790-005-5319-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Philosophy in the Contemporary World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2005|title=Excluding Destruction: Towards an Environmentally Sustainable Libertarian Property Rights Regime|journal=[[Philosophy in the Contemporary World]]|volume=12|issue=2|pages=22–9|doi=10.5840/pcw200512217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]'',&lt;ref name="Hadley, John 2006 445–51"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2006|title=The Duty to Aid Nonhuman Animals in Dire Need|journal=[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|volume=23|issue=4|pages=445–51|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5930.2006.00358.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as working as a [[lecturer]] in the USYD philosophy department and a [[guest lecturer]] for the USYD Laboratory Animal Services.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{Cite web|title=John Hadley; Biography|url=http://www.uws.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_john_hadley|publisher=University of Western Sydney|accessdate=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his PhD, Hadley worked as a lecturer in [[communication ethics]] in the [[Charles Sturt University]] (CSU) School of Communication and a lecturer in philosophy at the CSU School of Humanities and Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="Volume biog"/&gt; He then joined the [[University of Western Sydney]] School of Humanities and Communication Arts, first as a lecturer in philosophy,&lt;ref name="Volume biog"&gt;{{cite book|authors= Aaltola, Elisa, and John Hadley (eds)|year=2015|chapter=Notes on Contributors|title=Animal Ethics and Philosophy|location=London, United Kingdom|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|pages=227–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then as a [[senior lecturer]] in philosophy.&lt;ref name="Bio"/&gt; ''Animal Ethics and Philosophy: Questioning the Orthodoxy'', a [[edited collection|collection]] edited by Hadley with the Finnish philosopher [[Elisa Aaltola]], was published in 2015 by [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield International]]. The book aimed to move debate in [[animal ethics]] beyond developing [[Ethical extensionism|extentionist]] accounts and to examine the [[metaphilosophical]] and [[metaethical]] problems with extentionist accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aaltola, Elisa  |author2=John Hadley|year=2015|chapter=Introduction: Questioning the Orthodoxy|title=Animal Ethics and Philosophy|editors=Elisa Aaltola and John Hadley|location=London, United Kingdom|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hadley's own contribution drew attention to a perceived [[inconsistent triad]] in [[animal rights]] philosophy: the idea that moral status is determined by psychological factors (like [[sentience]]), and not [[species]]; that human and nonhuman animals are of the same [[Natural kind|kind]]; and that [[wikt:genomic plasticity|genomic plasticity]] offers the best explanation for change in [[natural selection]].&lt;ref name="metalevel"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hadley, John|year=2015|chapter=A Metalevel Problem for Animal Rights Theory|title=Animal Ethics and Philosophy|editors=Elisa Aaltola and John Hadley|location=London, United Kingdom|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield International|pages=15–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Hadley published a [[monograph]] with [[Lexington Books]] entitled ''Animal Property Rights: A Theory of Territory Rights for Wild Animals''. The book, partially building upon his doctoral research, presents a large amount of new material on Hadley's animal property rights theory.&lt;ref name="2015-ix"/&gt;

===Animal property rights===
[[File:Coyote Bandelier Los Alamos NM.jpg|thumb|right|A [[coyote]] [[scent-marking]]. Hadley proposes that the territorial behaviour of sentient animals should be used to determine the extent of the space over which they have a property right.]]
Hadley is known for his theory of animal property rights, according to which animals should be afforded property rights over their [[territory (animal)|territory]].&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, ''Animal Rights Without Liberation'', 163-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Animal Ethics and the Political"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milburn review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Milburn chapter"/&gt; Hadley has developed his theory of animal property rights through his doctoral research,&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, John (2006).

The practical side of Hadley's proposal rests on two key principles: a guardianship system, according to which knowledgeable guardians would be appointed to represent animal property holders in land management decision-making, and the use of animals' territory-marking behaviour to determine the limits of their property.&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', chap. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Hadley rejects [[First possession theory of property|first occupancy]] and [[Labor theory of property|labour-mixing]] accounts of [[Appropriation (economics)|appropriation]],&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', chap. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and instead suggests that there are two ways that his account might fruitfully be justified.&lt;ref name="Property chapter"/&gt; First, it might be justified directly, with reference to the interests of animals. This relies upon the fact that wild animals require their territory in order to satisfy their basic needs and the claim that this results in an interest in territory strong enough to ground a right. If animals have a right to use their territory, Hadley claims, then they necessarily have a property right in that territory.&lt;ref name="Reconciling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Property chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', chap. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Second, it might be justified indirectly, as animals (of some species, at least) might be given property rights as a means of protecting natural environments.&lt;ref name="Property chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chap. 5"&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', chap. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Hadley presents his proposal against the backdrop of an explicit [[pragmatism]],&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and holds that animal property rights theory has the potential to reconcile animal and environmental ethics.&lt;ref name="Reconciling"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chap. 5"/&gt;

Hadley's proposal has been placed in the context of the "political turn" in animal ethics; the emergence of animal ethics literature focused on [[justice]].&lt;ref name="Animal Ethics and the Political"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cochrane, Alasdair, Siobhan O'Sullivan and Robert Garner|year=2016|title=Animal ethics and the political|journal=Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy|doi=10.1080/13698230.2016.1194583}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milburn review"/&gt; Another academic who has proposed that wild animals be afforded property rights over their habitats is the British philosopher Steve Cooke. Like Hadley, he utilises an interest-based account of animal rights, but, unlike Hadley, he suggests that [[sovereignty]] would be an appropriate tool to protect animals' interest in their habitat if property fails.&lt;ref name="Cooke"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cooke, Steve|year=2017|title= Animal Kingdoms: On Habitat Rights for Wild Animals|journal=[[Environmental Values]]|volume=26|issue=1|pages=53-72|doi=10.3197/096327117X14809634978555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Property chapter"/&gt; Other theorists exploring the normative aspects of human relationships with wild animals explicitly deny that they are extending property rights to animals. The US-based ethicist [[Clare Palmer]], for instance, argues for a duty to respect wild animals' space, but claims that arguing for a property right for these animals would be "difficult", and instead bases her account on the fact that human actions can make animals "painful, miserable and vulnerable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Palmer, Clare|year=2010|title=Animal Ethics in Context|location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|doi=10.7312/palm12904|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian theorists [[Sue Donaldson]] and [[Will Kymlicka]] are critical of Hadley's proposal to extend property rights to animals, claiming that property rights are insufficient to protect animals' interests.&lt;ref name="Zoopolis 160"/&gt; Instead, they argue that animals should be considered sovereign over their territories.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Kymlicka, ''Zoopolis'', chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; They write that

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is one thing to say that a bird has a property right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals often need to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.&lt;ref name="Zoopolis 160"&gt;Donaldson and Kymlicka, ''Zoopolis'', 160&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

They also compare the possibility of extending property rights to animals to the approach of European colonists, who were prepared to extend property, but not sovereignty, rights to native peoples, resulting in oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson and Kymlicka, ''Zoopolis'', 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Hadley, however, is himself critical of Donaldson and Kymlicka's sovereignty proposal,&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, ''Animal Property Rights'', 83–97&lt;/ref&gt; though the British philosopher Josh Milburn suggests that the proposals may not be as far apart as the authors indicate.&lt;ref name="Milburn chapter"&gt;Milburn, Josh (2016). "Nonhuman animals and sovereignty: On ''Zoopolis'', failed states and institutional relationships with free-living animals". In: Andrew Woodhall and Gabriel Garmendia da Trindade, ''Intervention or Protest''. Wilmington, Delaware: Vernon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British political theorist [[Alasdair Cochrane]] also questions the extension of property rights to animals. Though describing Hadley's proposal as "ingenious",&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, ''Animal Rights Without Liberation'', 163&lt;/ref&gt; he criticises it on two grounds. First, he questions Hadley's claim of a relationship between property and basic needs, and, second, denies that animal property rights would appease environmentalists, given that they would allow the destruction of environments which do not contain sentient animals.&lt;ref&gt;Cochrane, ''Animal Rights Without Liberation'', 164&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[book review]], Milburn stresses the significance of Hadley's theory, but questions the extent to which the implementation of animal property rights would be desirable without the achievement of other animal rights and the extent to which Hadley's account is genuinely about ''property'' rights.&lt;ref name="Milburn review"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Milburn, Josh|year=2017|title=John Hadley: Animal Property Rights: A Theory of Habitat Rights for Wild Animals|journal=[[Res Publica (journal)|Res Publica]]|volume=32|issue=1|pages=147-51|doi=10.1007/s11158-016-9345-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other research===
Hadley has considered the ethics of humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues that there is a duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired.&lt;ref name="Hadley, John 2006 445–51"/&gt; He argues that [[libertarian]] property rights, consistent with [[Robert Nozick]]'s interpretation of the [[Lockean proviso]], should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2005b|title=Excluding Destruction: Towards an Environmentally Sustainable Libertarian Property Rights Regime|journal=[[Philosophy in the Contemporary World]]|volume=12|issue=2|pages=22–9|doi=10.5840/pcw200512217}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has elsewhere explored libertarian theory's denial of moral powers (including the power to acquire property) to animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2017|title=Non-autonomous sentient beings and original acquisition |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]]|volume=77|issue=2|pages=293-99|doi=10.1093/analys/anx074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hadley has conducted research on animal rights extremism, concluding that the phenomenon is a complex one, and that a full understanding of individual extremists' intentions and targets are necessary to understand the ethical acceptability of extremist acts and whether such acts are appropriately classified as terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2009|title=Animal Rights Extremism and the Terrorism Question|journal=[[Journal of Social Philosophy]]|volume=40|issue=3|pages=363–78|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9833.2009.01457.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds that while [[direct action]] should be tolerated in liberal democracies, this toleration should not extend to certain campaigning tactics used by extremists, such as threat-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hadley, John|year=2015|title=Animal Rights Advocacy and Legitimate Public Deliberation|journal=[[Political Studies (journal)|Political Studies]]|volume=63|issue=3|pages=696–712|doi=10.1111/1467-9248.12105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With O'Sullivan, Hadley has conducted research on utilitarianism and the relationship between obligations to animals and obligations to needy humans. The scholars argue that there is a conflict in Singer's philosophy between the obligation to aid needy humans and to protect animals,&lt;ref name="Singer chap"&gt;{{cite book|author1=O'Sullivan, Siobhan  |author2=John Hadley|year=2009|chapter=Conflict in Peter Singer's Philosophy – Animal Protection versus an Obligation to Give|title=On the Ethical Life: The Philosophy of Peter Singer|location=Newscastle-upon-Tyne|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|editor=Raymond Aaron Younis|pages=43–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Westerners who own pets should, rather than spending large amounts of money extending the lives of their companions, [[euthanise]] severely ill animals and instead donate money to aiding those in the [[developing world]].&lt;ref name="Vet"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hadley, John  |author2=Siobhan O'Sullivan|year=2009|title=World Poverty, Animal Minds and the Ethics of Veterinary Expenditure|journal=[[Environmental Values (journal)|Environmental Values]]|volume=18|issue=3|pages=361–78|doi=10.3197/096327109X12474739376578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maarten Boudry''' (born 15 August 1984) is a [[Flemish]] [[philosopher]] and [[scientific skepticism|skeptic]]. He has been a researcher and teaching member of the Department of [[Philosophy]] and [[Ethics|Moral Sciences]] at [[Ghent University]] since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.philosophy.ugent.be/personeel?departmentnumber=lw01&amp;ugentid=802000257690 |title=dr.

== Academic background ==
Boudry began his studies in philosophy at [[Ghent University]] in 2002, where he graduated [[cum laude]] in 2006. Between 2007 and 2011, he conducted [[research]] at [[Ghent University]] (Logic, History and Philosophy of Science), funded by a research grant from the Flemish foundation Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (FWO). After obtaining his [[PhD]], he became a postdoctoral fellow at Ghent University, again with the financial support of the FWO. In 2013, he was also a postdoctoral fellow at the Konrad Lorenz Institute in [[Vienna]] for six months, where he worked on the philosophical underpinnings of [[irrationality]]. Boudry has undertaken many foreign study visits. Additionally, he is a frequent speaker at international conferences and gives guest lectures at academic institutions.

Boudry is a member of a number of scientifically-oriented organizations: the Flemish skeptical organization [[SKEPP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title="Iedereen heeft zijn logica"; Maarten Boudry (24) stelt zich als filosoof kritisch op tegenover het paranormale |author=Frederic Vansteenkiste |work=Krant van West-Vlaanderen |date=27 March 2009  |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sssrweb.org/member_publications.cfm |title=Member Publications |work=Website SSSR |publisher=Society for the Scientific Study of Religion |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Center for Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_K-qtp6iiL1Y19POXNZeTBJUkk/edit |title=Curriculum Vitae |author=Maarten Boudry |work=Website Maarten Boudry |accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Imperfect Cognition research network of the Epistemic Innocence Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/epistemicinnocence/network/boudry-maarten |title=Boudry, Maarten |publisher=Epistemic Innocence |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also one of the founders of [[Het Denkgelag]],&lt;ref name="KD"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kritischdenken.info/de-naakte-keizers-van-de-psychoanalyse-een-interview-met-maarten-boudry/ |title=Maarten Boudry over Freud en De Naakte Keizers van de Psychoanalyse |author=Jozef Van Giel |work=Kritisch Denken |publisher=Russells Theepot |date=9 November 2014 |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which organizes [[List of skeptical conferences|skeptical conferences]] in Flanders.

== Sokal affair ==
{{See also|List of scholarly publishing hoaxes}}
In 2011, Boudry pulled a [[Sokal affair|Sokal-style]] hoax. Boudry wanted to put [[Christian philosopher]]s to the test by writing a meaningless [[abstract (summary)|abstract]], full of [[theology|theological]] jargon, with the title "The Paradoxes of Darwinian Disorder. Towards an Ontological Reaffirmation of Order and Transcendence".&lt;ref name="CPC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://cpc.ziltsysteem.nl/customers/cpc.ziltsysteem.nl/documents/Program%20Book%20CPC%202011.pdf |title=The Future of Creation Order |work=Program book Christian Philosophy Conference 2011 |publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam]] |date=2011 |accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abstract contained sentences such as, "In the Darwinian perspective, order is not immanent in reality, but it is a self-affirming aspect of reality in so far as it is experienced by situated subjects."&lt;ref name="gebazel"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/4464/Religie-filosofie/article/detail/3325391/2012/10/02/VU-in-verlegenheid-theologisch-betoog-blijkt-gebazel.dhtml |title=VU in verlegenheid: theologisch betoog blijkt gebazel |author=Robin de Wever |work=Trouw |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=22 December 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[anagram]]-[[pseudonym]] Robert A. Maundy from the fictitious College of the Holy Cross in [[Reno, Nevada]], Boudry submitted the abstract to the organizers of the Christian philosophical conference "The Future of Creation Order" at the [[VU University Amsterdam]] and the Centre of Theology and Philosophy at the [[University of Nottingham]], which both accepted it without any reservations.&lt;ref name="CPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meester"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.filosofie.nl/nl/nieuws/19535/vu-voor-schut-met-namaakartikel.html |title=VU voor schut met namaakartikel |author=Maarten Meester |work=Filosofie.nl |publisher=Filosofie Magazine |date=4 October 2012 |accessdate=22 December 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax, which Boudry revealed in mid-2012 on [[Facebook]] but became more widely known only after the [[United States|American]] scientist [[Jerry Coyne]] blogged about it,&lt;ref name="Meester"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2012/09/25/a-sokal-style-hoax-by-an-anti-religious-philosopher-2/|title=A Sokal-style hoax by an anti-religious philosopher « Why Evolution Is True|work=Why Evolution Is True|first=Jerry|last=Coyne|authorlink=Jerry Coyne|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; received attention in a number of Dutch [[Protestantism|Protestant]] newspapers such as ''[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]]'', ''[[Trouw]]'', and ''[[Nederlands Dagblad]]''.&lt;ref name="herkenden"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/3325784/2012/10/03/Filosofen-herkenden-onzin-niet.dhtml |title=Filosofen herkenden onzin niet |work=Trouw |date=3 October 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= |title=VU door grap Belgische filosoof in verlegenheid |work=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]] |date=2 October 2012  |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.trouw.nl/tr/nl/5009/Archief/archief/article/detail/3326898/2012/10/05/Een-schelmenstreek-in-theologisch-jargon.dhtml |title=Een schelmenstreek in theologisch jargon |work=Trouw |date=5 October 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="onzintekst"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nd.nl/artikelen/2012/oktober/02/christelijke-filosofen-aanvaarden-onzintekst |title=Christelijke filosofen aanvaarden onzintekst |author=Aaldert van Soest |work=Nederlands Dagblad |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in an interview with the Dutch popular philosophy magazine ''Filosofie Magazine'' about the reason for the hoax, Boudry said the following:
{{Quote|This was primarily a satirical prank for me, an exercise in grammatically correct nonsense, filled with hollow phrases and theological jargon. In that sense I seem to have succeeded, because the text was credible enough for two [[theology]] and [[philosophy of religion]] conferences: namely the conference at VU, and the 'What is life' conference, organized by the Centre of Theology and Philosophy of Nottingham University.&lt;ref name="Meester"/&gt;}}

No one had discovered that "Robert A. Maundy" and the "College of the Holy Cross" did not exist. [[Gerrit Glas]], president of the conference at the time, found the text to be odd and said they had hesitated for a long time, but ultimately decided to give "Maundy" the benefit of the doubt.&lt;ref name="herkenden"/&gt; Glas admitted that he should have been more critical&lt;ref name="gebazel"/&gt; and defended himself by saying that "it is not uncommon for texts on process theology, [[negative theology]], and [[postmodernism]] to be [[Wikt:inscrutable|inscrutable]]".&lt;ref name="herkenden"/&gt;&lt;ref name="herkenden"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nd.nl/artikelen/2012/oktober/02/christelijke-filosofen-in-de-maling-genomen |title=Christelijke filosofen in de maling genomen |work=[[Nederlands Dagblad]] |date=2 October 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher of religion [[Taede A. Smedes]] at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]] considered Boudry's action to be unworthy of an academic, but also found it astonishing that the conference organizers had accepted the text: "Anyone who makes the simple effort to understand the first sentences of {{Sic|Boudry/Maundry's}} abstract (if that is even possible), will immediately notice that it is incomprehensible nonsense."&lt;ref name="onzintekst"/&gt;

== Skepticism ==
[[File:Het Denkgelag ‘The Limits of Science’.jpg|thumb|Boudry moderating a debate between [[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci]], [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]] and [[Lawrence M. Krauss|Krauss]] ([[Het Denkgelag]] 2013).]]
Maarten Boudry is mainly known for his skepticism and critical attitude toward [[pseudoscience]]. As a [[philosopher of science]], one of his main interests is the study of pseudoscience in all its forms and expressions. He studies the fallibility of human reasoning that might underlie pseudoscience and irrationality. Boudry characterizes pseudoscience as "an imitation of real [[science]]". In his [[Master's degree|MA]] [[thesis]], entitled ''De naakte Keizers van de Psychoanalyse'' (The Naked Emperors of Psychoanalysis), he explains why he classifies [[psychoanalysis]] as a pseudoscience and which immunizing strategies this school of thought has developed over the years to withstand criticism. Together with [[philosopher]] [[Johan Braeckman]] he wrote the book ''De ongelovige Thomas heeft een punt'' ([[Doubting Thomas]] has a point), in which they offer arguments against [[parascience]] and pseudoscience, blind faith, [[wishful thinking]], [[astrology]], [[irrationality]], [[psychokinesis]], and [[dowsing]], as they consider these ideas to be grounded in [[logical fallacy|logical fallacies]]. The title refers to the attitude of [[Thomas the Apostle]], who was initially skeptical when he was told that [[Historical Jesus|Jesus]] had been [[Resurrection|resurrected]]. In an interview, Boudry said:
{{Quote
|[...] [it] is also interesting for philosophers to take a closer look at pseudoscience, because it also teaches us something about the difference between good science and pseudoscience, and thus indirectly about how science works as well.&lt;ref name="KD"/&gt;}}

In publications and debates, Boudry also criticizes [[religion]], [[intelligent design]], and theology. In 2014, during the Dutch Nationale Religiedebat (National Religion Debate), philosophers Maarten Boudry and [[Herman Philipse]] (both of whom are [[atheist]]s) debated Stefan Paas and Rik Peels on the question of whether belief in a god is reasonable and what the impact of nonbelief on morality is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eo.nl/geloven/nieuws/item/om-de-hete-brij-heen/ |title=Nationaal Religiedebat: Dansen om de hete brij |author=KlaasJan Baas |publisher=Evangelische Omroep |date=30 January 2014 |accessdate=18 February 2017 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boudry also debated Christian philosopher Emanuel Rutten during the Denkcafé debate "Does [[God]] Exist?" in December 2012, where he said the following:
{{Quote
|Of course we can't exclude the existence of God. But you can say the same about the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. We could also introduce another all-knowing being: the [[Unicorn]], an intelligent [[wikt:ungulate#English|ungulate]]. That animal knows everything, also that God doesn't exist. Or maybe God is the victim of an evil demon. He may know that he himself exists, but there could be a [[demon]] who tricked him into thinking he's the [[Creator deity|creator]] of heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.arminius.nu/entry/479/denkcafe-bestaat-god&amp;source=archief |title=Video Denkcafé: Bestaat God? |publisher=Congres- &amp; debatcentrum Arminius |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=24 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Maurizio Ferraris''' (born February 7, 1956 in [[Turin]]) is an Italian [[continental philosopher]] and scholar. 

His name is attached to the philosophical current named "[[New realism (philosophy)#New realism (contemporary philosophy)|new realism]]" (he wrote the ''Manifesto of New Realism'' in 2012, published by SUNY Press in 2014), that shares significant similarities with speculative realism and object oriented ontology. A pupil of [[Gianni Vattimo]], and influenced by [[Jacques Derrida]], he started as a theorist of hermeneutics before turning his attention to the analytic strand. Over the years he has been able to create an effective synthesis between the two approaches, creating a new ontological realism that rejects Kant's schematism in the cognitive area.

Since 1995 Ferraris has been full Professor of Philosophy in the Department of Literature and Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he also runs the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology). He studied in Turin, Paris and Heidelberg and has taught at major European Universities. He is the director of the Rivista di Estetica and is part of the directive committee of Critique and aut aut.  From 1989 to 2010 he has written for the cultural supplement of Il Sole 24 ORE; since 2010 he has been writing for the cultural section of la Repubblica. His main areas of expertise are hermeneutics, aesthetics and ontology.

==Biography==
Ferraris graduated from Philosophy at the University of Turin in 1979, under the guidance of Gianni Vattimo. In the early years of his career he divided his time between teaching, research and cultural journalism. From 1979 to 1988 he has been an editor, and then co-director, of Alfabeta, whose directive committee includes, among others, Antonio Porta, Nanni Balestrini, Maria Corti, Umberto Eco, Francesco Leonetti, Pier Aldo Rovatti and Paolo Volponi. In the early eighties he began his relationship with Derrida, who deeply marked his philosophical training. On the academic level, in 1984, after two years of teaching in Macerata (1982–83), he began to teach in Trieste, interspersing his didactic activities with a series of stays in Heidelberg. Here, after getting in contact with Gadamer, he started his studies in hermeneutics.

In 1995, Ferraris was called in Turin, as a full Professor of Aesthetics, and later began teaching Metaphysics (Filosofia teoretica) in 1999. While working as a director of program (i.e. teacher) at the Collège international de philosophie from 1998 to 2004, in 1999 he founded the Laboratory for Ontology (LabOnt) and the Inter-University Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology (CTAO). Currently Ferraris is full Professor of Philosophy at the University of Turin, where he is also the President of the LabOnt (Laboratory for Ontology) and of the Centre for Theoretical and Applied Ontology (CTAO). He is a Fellow of Käte Hamburger Kolleg “Recht als Kultur” (Bonn) and a Honorary Fellow of the Center for Advanced Studies of South East Europe (Rijeka). Ferraris has been Fellow of the Italian Academy for Advanced Studies in America and of the Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung. He has also been Directeur d’études of the Collège International de Philosophie and a Visiting Professor at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (Paris) as well as other European and American Universities.

Ferraris is a columnist for ‘La Repubblica’, the Director of ‘Rivista di Estetica’, and the Co-director of ‘Critique’ and the ‘Revue francophone d’esthétique’. He wrote more than fifty books that have been translated into several languages. The books that have appeared in English are: ''History of Hermeneutics'' (Humanities Press, 1996), ''Documentality or Why it is Necessary to Leave Traces'' (Fordham UP, 2012), ''Goodbye Kant!'' (SUNY UP, 2013); ''Where Are You? An Ontology of the Cell Phone'' (Fordham UP, 2015) and ''Manifesto of New Realism'' (SUNY UP, 2015). Maurizio Ferraris has worked in the field of aesthetics, hermeneutics and social ontology, attaching his name to the theory of [[documentality]], and contemporary [[New realism (philosophy)#New realism (contemporary philosophy)|new realism]].

==Thought==
Ferraris’ early interests lay in French post-structuralist philosophy, with special attention to authors such as Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan and Gilles Deleuze. A special role in the formation of his thought was undoubtedly played by Jacques Derrida, with whom Ferraris has maintained a relationship of research, later turned into a friendship, since 1981. Evidence of this phase of his thought can be found in his early works: ''Differenze'' (1981), ''Tracce'' (1983) and ''La svolta testuale (''1984). Ferraris has specifically dedicated to Derrida: ''Postille a Derrida (''1990), ''Honoris causa a Derrida'' (1998), I''ntroduzione a Derrida'' (2003), ''Il gusto del segreto'' (1997) [A Taste for the Secret, Blackwell 2001] and, finally, ''Jackie Derrida. Ritratto a memoria'' (2006). While working with Gadamer, starting in the early eighties, Ferraris then turned to hermeneutics, writing: ''Aspetti dell’ermeneutica del Novecento'' (1986), ''Ermeneutica di Proust'' (1987), ''Nietzsche e la filosofia del Novecento'' (1989) and especially ''Storia dell’ermeneutica'' (1988) ''History of Hermeneutics'', Humanities Press, 1996

==The turning point ==
At the end of the eighties, Ferraris developed an articulated critique of Heidegger and Gadamer's tradition (see, in particular, ''Cronistoria di una svolta'', the 1990 afterword to Heidegger’s conference “The Turn”), which makes use of post-structuralism to challenge the romantic and idealistic legacy affecting such tradition. The conclusion of this critical path led the philosopher to the reconsideration of the relationship between the spirit and the letter as well as to a reversal of their traditional opposition. Oftentimes, both philosophers and ordinary people despise the letter (the rules and constraints instituted through documents and inscriptions of various kinds) and set the spirit (i.e. thought and will) above it, recognizing the creative freedom of the latter as opposed to the former. For Ferraris, it is the letter that precedes and founds the spirit. Thus occurred the transition to the second phase of the thought of the Italian philosopher.

Ferraris abandoned hermeneutic relativism and Derridean deconstruction to embrace a form of realistic objectivism according to which "objectivity and reality, considered by radical hermeneutics as principles of violence and abuse, are in fact – and precisely because of the contraposition between spirit and letter mentioned above – the only protection against arbitrariness".&lt;ref&gt;"Maurizio Ferraris", in D. Antiseri e S. Tagliagambe (a cura di), Filosofi italiani contemporanei, Milano: Bompiani, pp. 226-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This principle, which applies to morals, is based on the acknowledgement of a sphere of reality that is independent of interpretations (see, in particular, L’ermeneutica, 1998). The external world, recognized as unamendable, and the relationship between conceptual schemes and sensory experience (aesthetics, restored to its etymological meaning of "science of sensory perception", acquires a primary significance – see, in particular, Analogon rationis (1994 ), Estetica (1996, with other authors), L’immaginazione (1996), Experimentelle Ästhetik (2001) and Estetica razionale (1997)) are the dominant themes of the second phase of Ferraris’ thought, which involves a re-reading of Kant through the naive physics of the perceptologist Paolo Bozzi (see Il mondo esterno (2001) and Goodbye Kant!(2004, forthcoming for SUNY Press)). Ferraris’ "critical ontology" recognizes the world of everyday life as largely impenetrable compared to conceptual schemes. The failure to acknowledge this principle traces back to the confusion between ontology (the sphere of being) and epistemology (the sphere of knowledge); such confusion is critically thematised by Ferraris starting from the character of unamendability that is typical of being as opposed to knowledge (see in particular: Ontologia (2003) and Storia dell’ontologia (2008, with other authors)). His reflection on realism led, in 2011, to the elaboration of the Manifesto of New Realism.&lt;ref&gt;"Maurizio Ferraris", la Repubblica, 8 August 2011, http:/ / www. alfabeta2. it/ 2011/ 09/ 09/ manifesto-del-new-realism/ #more-1513. For the full press review of the debate surrounding the "Manifesto of New Realism" see http:/ / labont. it/ dibattito-sul-nuovo-realismo.&lt;/ref&gt;

==From social ontology to documentality==
The natural outcome of critical ontology is the twofold acknowledgement of the external world as unamendable and of the domain of objects which Kantian transcendental philosophy rightly applies to: that of social objects. This new phase of Ferraris’ thought was ideally inaugurated with the publication of Dove sei? Ontologia del telefonino (2005) [Where are you? Ontology of the Cell Phone, forthcoming for Fordham UP] and went on with Babbo Natale, Gesù adulto (2006), Sans Papier (2007), La fidanzata automatica (2007) and Il tunnel delle multe (2008). The basic thesis is that the distinction between ontology and epistemology, combined with the acknowledgment of the ontological autonomy of the sphere of social objects (regulated by the constitutive law "object = inscribed act"), allows for the correction of Derrida's thesis that "there is nothing outside the text "(literally, and asemantically,"there is no outside text") so as to theorize, against Searle, that “there is nothing social outside the text." This leads to the mature stage of Ferraris’ thought, fully exposed and systematized in what may be considered his summa: Documentalità. Perché è necessario lasciar tracce (2009) [Documentality. Why It Is Necessary to Leave Traces, Fordham UP, 2010] - and a monographic issue of the ‚“Monist“  (Edited by Maurizio Ferraris and [[Leonardo Caffo]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themonist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/97-2CFP.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentality==
The most influential ontology of social reality, formulated by the American philosopher John Searle (1995), is based on collective intentionality, which allegedly ensures that certain physical objects (e.g. a piece of paper) are transformed into social objects (e.g. a banknote). As noted by Barry Smith (2003), this perspective has difficulty in accounting for both negative entities – such as debts, which apparently do not have a physical counterpart – and the new, seemingly intangible, social objects generated by the Web. The theory of documentality proposed by Maurizio Ferraris (2005) aims to solve these problems by arguing that social objects are always recordings of social acts. This accounts for both negative entities and the virtual entities of the web, which consist precisely of recordings just like any other social object. For the theory of documentality, the constitutive rule of social reality is "Object = Inscribed Act", where “inscribed” is equal to “recorded”. That is: a social object is the result of a social act (such as to involve at least two people), which is characterized by its being recorded on some support, including the minds of the people involved in the act (in the case of informal social acts such as promises).

Articulated by Ferraris (2009) in a complete ontological theory and by Smith ( 2012) in a theory of document acts, documentality has three main reasons of interest. First, it has been able to account for the substantial growth of documents and recording devices in the Web world, which is very well explained by the proposed constitutive law of social reality. Secondly, it has been able to explain why social reality, while requiring the presence of subjects for the enactment of acts, may develop independently from them and even without their knowledge (an economic recession can be taking place even if no human subject is aware of it). Third, instead of making social reality depend on the action of collective intentionality – with an increasing social constructivism (Searle 2010) – documentality is capable of substantiating a "new realism" (Ferraris, 2012) that helps continental philosophy come out of the impasses of postmodernism and reconnect with analytic philosophy. [Source of this description of documentality: L. Caffo, "From Documentality to New Realism", in ''The Monist'', 97:2 April 2014].

==New realism==
{{main|New realism (contemporary philosophy)}}
The realist turn carried out by Maurizio Ferraris starting from the formulation of aesthetics not as philosophy of art, but as ontology of perception and sensory experience (Estetica razionale&lt;ref&gt;http:/ / labont. it/ publication/ estetica&lt;/ref&gt; 1997 new edition 2011), finds a further declination in the Manifesto del nuovo realismo (2012) [Manifesto of new realism, SUNY Press, 2014]. New Realism – the principles of which were anticipated by Ferraris in an article published in La Repubblica on August 8, 2011&lt;ref&gt;http:/ / ricerca. repubblica. it/ repubblica/ archivio/ repubblica/ 2011/ 08/ 08/ il-ritorno-al-pensiero-forte. html&lt;/ref&gt; and which then started a massive debate&lt;ref&gt;http:/ / nuovorealismo. wordpress. com/&lt;/ref&gt; – is primarily a consideration of some historical, cultural and political phenomena (i.e. the analysis of postmodernism up to its deteriorating into media populism).  From these reflections follows the urge to shed light over the outcomes produced by the derivations of postmodernism within contemporary thought (i.e. the interpretation of philosophical realisms and "theories of truth" that developed starting from the end of last century in response to a deviation of the relationship between the individual and reality). This, in turn, leads to the proposal of an antidote to the degeneration of postmodernist ideology and the degraded and mendacious relationship with the world that it has caused: New Realism, in fact, identifies itself with the synergistic action of three key words, Ontology, Critique and Enlightenment.  New Realism has been the subject of several debates and national and international conferences and has called for a series of publications that involve the concept of reality as a paradigm even in non-philosophical areas.  In fact, the debate on new realism, for number of contributions and media response, has no equivalent in the recent cultural history, to the point of being chosen as 'case study' for the analysis of the sociology of communication and linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;See R. Scarpa, Il caso Nuovo Realismo. La lingua del dibattito filosofico contemporaneo,Milano-Udine, Mimesis, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the international arena, the Manifesto of new realism can be found in several translations: English (SUNYI Press), French (Hermann), German (Klostermann), Spanish (Biblioteca Nueva) ecc. New realism was discussed in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, in the Neue Zürcher Zeitung and the Süddeutsche Zeitung.&lt;ref&gt;These and other references can be found here: http:/ / nuovorealismo. wordpress. com/ rassegna/ 2013-2/&lt;/ref&gt; A monographic issue of the ‚“Monist“  (Edited by Maurizio Ferraris and Mario De Caro) will also shortly appear.&lt;ref&gt;http:/ / www. themonist. com/ wp-content/ uploads/ 2010/ 06/ 98-4CFP. html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the topic was re-elaborated both in Warum es die Welt nicht gibt by [[Markus Gabriel]] (Berlin, Ullstein Verlag 2013) and in Manifiesto del nuevo realismo analógico (Buenos Aires, Circulo Herméneutico 2013) by Mauricio Beuchot (México-UNAM) and José Luis Jerez (Argentina-UNCo).

'''History:''' 
In the frame of hermeneutics, as a reaction against its constructivist or nihilistic outcomes, Maurizio Ferraris has proposed the so-called "New Realism" (Manifesto del nuovo realismo, 2012), a philosophical orientation shared by both analytic philosophers – such as Mario De Caro (see Bentornata Realtà, ed by De Caro and Ferraris, 2012), and continental philosophers, such as Mauricio Beuchot (Manifesto del realismo analogico, 2013), and Markus Gabriel (Fields of Sense: A New Realist Ontology, 2014). New Realism also garnered the support of great thinkers such as [[Umberto Eco]], [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[John Searle]], intersecting with other realistic movements that arose independently but responding to similar needs, such as the "speculative realism" defended by the French philosopher [[Quentin Meillassoux]] and the American philosopher [[Graham Harman]]. For New Realism, the fact that it is becoming increasingly clear that science is not systematically the ultimate measure of truth and reality does not mean that we should say goodbye to reality, truth or objectivity, as was posited by much twentieth century philosophy. Rather, it means that philosophy, as well as jurisprudence, linguistics or history, has something important and true to say about the world.

In this context, New Realism presents itself primarily as a negative realism: the resistance that the outside world opposes to our conceptual schemes should not be seen as a failure, but as a resource – a proof of the existence of an independent world. If this is the case, however, this negative realism turns into a positive realism: in resisting us reality does not merely set a limit we cannot trespass, but it also offers opportunities and resources. This explains how, in the natural world, different life-forms can interact in the same environment without sharing any conceptual scheme and how, in the social world, human intentions and behaviors are made possible by a reality that is first given, and that only at a later time may be interpreted and, if necessary, transformed. Now that the season of postmodernism has died out, New Realism expresses the widespread need for renewal in extra-disciplinary areas such as architecture, literature, pedagogy and medicine.

'''Mechanism''' is the belief that natural wholes (principally living things) are like complicated machines or artifacts, composed of parts lacking any intrinsic relationship to each other. Thus, the source of an apparent thing's activities is not the whole itself, but its parts or an external influence on the parts.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The doctrine of mechanism in [[philosophy]] comes in two different flavors. They are both doctrines of [[metaphysics]], but they are different in scope and ambitions: the first is a global doctrine about nature; the second is a local doctrine about humans and their minds, which is hotly contested. For clarity, we might distinguish these two doctrines as [[universal mechanism]] and [[anthropic mechanism]].

{{quote|There is no constant meaning in the history of philosophy for the word Mechanism. Originally, the term meant that cosmological theory which ascribes the motion and changes of the world to some external force. In this view material things are purely passive, while according to the opposite theory (i. e., Dynamism), they possess certain internal sources of energy which account for the activity of each and for its influence on the course of events; These meanings, however, soon underwent modification. The question as to whether motion is an inherent property of bodies, or has been communicated to them by some external agency, was very often ignored. With a large number of cosmologists the essential feature of Mechanism is the attempt to reduce all the qualities and activities of bodies to quantitative realities, i. e. to mass and motion. But a further modification soon followed. Living bodies, as is well known, present at first sight certain characteristic properties which have no counterpart in lifeless matter. Mechanism aims to go beyond these appearances. It seeks to explain all "vital" phenomena as physical and chemical facts; whether or not these facts are in turn reducible to mass and motion becomes a secondary question, although Mechanists are generally inclined to favour such reduction. The theory opposed to this biological mechanism is no longer Dynamism, but Vitalism or Neo-vitalism, which maintains that vital activities cannot be explained, and never will be explained, by the laws which govern lifeless matter.&lt;ref name="CE1913"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Mechanism |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1913 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Catholic_Encyclopedia_(1913)/Mechanism}}&lt;/ref&gt;|"Mechanism" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1913)}}

== Universal mechanism&lt;!--'Universal mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The older doctrine, here called '''universal mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, is the ancient philosophies closely linked with [[materialism]] and [[reductionism]], especially that of the [[atomism|atomists]] and to a large extent, [[stoicism|stoic physics]]. They held that the universe is reducible to completely mechanical principles—that is, the [[motion (physics)|motion]] and collision of [[matter]]. Later mechanists believed the achievements of the [[scientific revolution]] had shown that all phenomena could eventually be explained in terms of 'mechanical' laws, natural laws governing the motion and collision of matter that implied a thorough going [[determinism]]: if ''all'' phenomena could be explained ''entirely'' through the motion of matter under the laws of [[classical physics]], then even more surely than the gears of a clock determine that it must strike 2:00 an hour after striking 1:00, ''all'' phenomena must be completely determined: whether past, present or future. (One of the philosophical implications of modern [[quantum mechanics]] is that this view of determinism is not defensible.)

The French mechanist and determinist [[Pierre Simon de Laplace]] formulated the sweeping implications of this thesis by saying:

{{quote|We may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of the past and the cause of the future. An intellect which at any given moment knew all of the forces that animate nature and the mutual positions of the beings that compose it, if this intellect were vast enough to submit the data to analysis, could condense into a single formula the movement of the greatest bodies of the universe and that of the lightest [[atom]]; for such an intellect nothing could be uncertain and the future just like the past would be present before its eyes.|Pierre Simon Laplace|''A Philosophical Essay on Probabilities''}}

One of the first and most famous expositions of universal mechanism is found in the opening passages of ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' by [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1651). What is less frequently appreciated is that [[René Descartes]] was a staunch mechanist, though today, in the [[philosophy of mind]], he is remembered for introducing the [[mind–body problem]] in terms of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[physicalism]].

Descartes was a [[substance dualist]], and argued that reality was composed of two radically different types of substance: extended [[matter]], on the one hand, and immaterial [[mind]], on the other. Descartes argued that one cannot explain the conscious mind in terms of the spatial dynamics of mechanistic bits of matter cannoning off each other. Nevertheless, his understanding of biology was thoroughly mechanistic in nature:

:"I should like you to consider that these functions (including passion, memory, and imagination) follow from the mere arrangement of the machine’s organs every bit as naturally as the movements of a clock or other automaton follow from the arrangement of its counter-weights and wheels." (Descartes, Treatise on Man, p.108)

His scientific work was based on the traditional mechanistic understanding that animals and humans are completely mechanistic [[automaton|automata]]. Descartes' dualism was motivated by the seeming impossibility that mechanical dynamics could yield mental experiences.

[[Isaac Newton]] ushered in a much weaker acceptation of mechanism that tolerated the antithetical, and as yet inexplicable, [[action at a distance]] of [[gravity]]. However, his work seemed to successfully predict the motion of both celestial and terrestrial bodies according to that principle, and the generation of philosophers who were inspired by Newton's example carried the mechanist banner nonetheless. Chief among them were French [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] and [[Denis Diderot]] (see also: [[French materialism]]).

== Anthropic mechanism&lt;!--'Anthropic mechanism' redirects here--&gt; ==

The thesis in '''anthropic mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is not that everything can be completely explained in mechanical terms (although some anthropic mechanists may ''also'' believe that), but rather that everything ''about human beings'' can be completely explained in mechanical terms, as surely as can everything about clocks or the internal combustion engine.

One of the chief obstacles that all mechanistic theories have faced is providing a mechanistic explanation of the human [[mind]]; Descartes, for one, endorsed [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] in spite of endorsing a completely mechanistic conception of the material world because he argued that mechanism and the notion of a mind were logically incompatible. Hobbes, on the other hand, conceived of the mind and the will as purely mechanistic, completely explicable in terms of the effects of perception and the pursuit of desire, which in turn he held to be completely explicable in terms of the materialistic operations of the nervous system. Following Hobbes, other mechanists argued for a thoroughly mechanistic explanation of the mind, with one of the most influential and controversial expositions of the doctrine being offered by [[Julien Offray de La Mettrie]] in his ''Man a Machine'' (1748).

Today, as in the past, the main points of debate between anthropic mechanists and anti-mechanists are mainly occupied with two topics: the mind — and consciousness, in particular — and [[free will]]. Anti-mechanists argue that anthropic mechanism is incompatible with our commonsense intuitions: in [[philosophy of mind]] they argue that unconscious matter cannot completely explain the phenomenon of consciousness, and in [[metaphysics]] they argue that anthropic mechanism implies determinism about human action, which (they argue) is incompatible with our understanding of ourselves as creatures with [[free will]]. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this position include [[Norman Malcolm]] and
[[David Chalmers]].

Anthropic mechanists typically respond in one of two ways. In the first, they agree with anti-mechanists that mechanism conflicts with some of our commonsense intuitions, but go on to argue that our commonsense intuitions are simply mistaken and need to be revised. Down this path lies [[eliminative materialism]] in [[philosophy of mind]], and [[hard determinism]] on the question of free will. This option is accepted by the eliminative materialist philosopher [[Paul Churchland]]. Some have questioned how eliminative materialism is compatible with the freedom of will apparently required for anyone (including its adherents) to make truth claims.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Jonas, ''The Phenomenon of Life: Toward a Philosophical Biology'' (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 2001/1966), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; The second option, common amongst philosophers who adopt anthropic mechanism, is to argue that the [[argument]]s given for incompatibility are specious: whatever it is we mean by "consciousness" and "free will," they urge, it is fully compatible with a mechanistic understanding of the human mind and will. As a result, they tend to argue for one or another non-eliminativist [[Physicalism|physicalist]] theories of mind, and for [[compatibilism]] on the question of free will. Contemporary philosophers who have argued for this sort of account include [[J. J. C. Smart]] and [[Daniel Dennett]].

===Gödelian arguments&lt;!--'Gödelian argument' and 'Gödelian arguments' redirect here--&gt;===
Some scholars have debated over what, if anything, [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] imply about anthropic mechanism. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a [[Turing machine]], or by the [[Church-Turing thesis]], any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is [[Consistency|consistent]], then Gödel's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

'''Gödelian arguments'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent and powerful enough to recognize its own consistency. Since this is impossible for a Turing machine, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning must be non-mechanical.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument against mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan.

From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====History====
One of the earliest attempts to use incompleteness to reason about human intelligence was by Gödel himself in his 1951 [[Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectureship|Gibbs Lecture]] entitled "Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their philosophical implications".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".

In subsequent years, more direct anti-mechanist lines of reasoning were apparently floating around the intellectual atmosphere. In 1960, [[Hilary Putnam]] published a paper entitled "Minds and Machines," in which he points out the flaws of a typical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Putnam|Putnam, Hilary]], 1960, ''Minds and Machines'' in [[Sidney Hook]], ed., ''Dimensions of Mind: A Symposium''. New York University Press. Reprinted in Anderson, A. R., ed., 1964. ''Minds and Machines''. Prentice-Hall: 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informally, this is the argument that the (alleged) difference between "what can be mechanically proven" and "what can be seen to be true by humans" shows that human intelligence is not mechanical in nature. Or, as Putnam puts it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let T be a Turing machine which "represents" me in the sense that T can prove just the mathematical statements I prove. Then using Gödel's technique I can discover a proposition that T cannot prove, and moreover I can prove this proposition. This refutes the assumption that T "represents" me, hence I am not a Turing machine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Hilary Putnam]] objects that this argument ignores the issue of consistency. Gödel's technique can only be applied to consistent systems. It is conceivable, argues Putnam, that the human mind is inconsistent. If one is to use Gödel's technique to prove the proposition that T cannot prove, one must first prove (the mathematical statement representing) the consistency of T, a daunting and perhaps impossible task. Later Putnam suggested that while Gödel's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. If we are to believe that it is consistent, then either we cannot prove its consistency, or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.&lt;ref&gt;The Gödel Theorem and Human Nature, a talk given by [[Hilary Putnam]] in the Gödel centenary 2006  [http://www.logic.at/goedel2006/abstract.php?putnam]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. R. Lucas]] in ''[[Minds, Machines and Gödel]]'' (1961), and later in his book ''The Freedom of the Will'' (1970), lays out an anti-mechanist argument closely following the one described by Putnam, including reasons for why the human mind can be considered consistent.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas, J. R.]], 1961, "[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/mmg.html Minds, Machines, and Gödel.]" ''Philosophy 36'':112-27.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lucas admits that, by Gödel's second theorem, a human mind cannot formally prove its own consistency, and even says (perhaps facetiously) that women and politicians are inconsistent. Nevertheless, he sets out arguments for why a male non-politician can be considered consistent. These arguments are philosophical in nature and are the subject of much debate; Lucas provides references to responses on his own [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~jrlucas/Godel/referenc.html website].

Another work was done by [[Judson Webb]] in his 1968 paper "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind".&lt;ref&gt;[[Judson Webb|Webb, Judson]], 1968, "Metamathematics and the Philosophy of Mind," ''Philosophy of Science 35'': 156-78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Webb claims that previous attempts have glossed over whether one truly can see that the Gödelian statement ''p'' pertaining to oneself, is true. Using a different formulation of Gödel's theorems, namely, that of [[Raymond Smullyan]] and [[Emil Post]], Webb shows one can derive convincing arguments for oneself of both the truth and falsity of ''p''. He furthermore argues that all arguments about the philosophical implications of Gödel's theorems are really arguments about whether the [[Church-Turing thesis]] is true.

Later, [[Roger Penrose]] entered the fray, providing somewhat novel anti-mechanist arguments in his books, ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]''  (1989) [ENM] and ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'' (1994) [SM]. These books have proved highly controversial.  [[Martin Davis]] responded to ENM in his paper [http://www.cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/penrose.ps "Is Mathematical Insight Algorithmic?" (ps)], where he argues that Penrose ignores the issue of consistency.  [[Solomon Feferman]] gives a critical examination of SM in his paper [http://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/penrose.pdf "Penrose's Gödelian argument" (pdf)].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The response of the scientific community to Penrose's arguments has been negative, with one group of scholars calling Penrose's repeated attempts to form a persuasive Gödelian argument "a kind of intellectual shell game, in which a precisely defined notion to which a mathematical result applies... is switched for a vaguer notion".&lt;ref name=laforte /&gt;

A Gödel-based anti-mechanism argument can be found in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]'', though Hofstadter is widely viewed as a known skeptic of such arguments:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Looked at this way, Gödel's proof suggests – though by no means does it prove! – that there could be some high-level way of viewing the mind/brain, involving concepts which do not appear on lower levels, and that this level might have explanatory power that does not exist – not even in principle – on lower levels. It would mean that some facts could be explained on the high level quite easily, but not on  lower levels at all. No matter how long and cumbersome a low-level statement were made, it would not explain the phenomena in question.
It is analogous to the fact that, if you make derivation after derivation in [[Peano arithmetic]], no matter how long and cumbersome you make them, you will never come up with one for G – despite the fact that on a higher level, you can see that the [[Gödel sentence]] is true.

What might such high-level concepts be? It has been proposed for eons, by various holistically or "soulistically" inclined scientists and humanists that consciousness is a phenomenon that escapes explanation in terms of brain components; so here is a candidate at least. There is also the ever-puzzling notion of free will. So perhaps these qualities could be "emergent" in the sense of requiring explanations which cannot be furnished by the physiology alone
  (''Gödel, Escher, Bach'', p. 708).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rationology.net/eGodel.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Niall Lucy''' (11 November 1956 - 5 June 2014) was an Australian writer and scholar best known for his work in [[deconstruction]].

==Career==
Niall Lucy served as a professor in the School of Media, Culture &amp; Creative Arts at [[Curtin University]], and a former Head of the School of Arts (1998–2003) at [[Murdoch University]]. In 1997 he was a visiting scholar in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at the [[University of Wales, Cardiff]]. He worked mainly in the fields of deconstruction, [[literary theory]] and [[cultural criticism]]. His recent work (much of it collaborative) brings a deconstructive approach to contemporary Australian events and figures.

==Education==
Lucy gained a BA and MA (English) from the [[University of Western Australia]], and a PhD (English) from [[the University of Sydney]].

==Works==
In ''Postmodern Literary Theory: An Introduction'' (1997), Lucy identifies [[postmodernism]] as a continuation (albeit not by conscious or deliberate means) of [[romanticism]], especially in the form of ideas associated with the [[Jena romantics]] in Germany in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Lucy, ''Postmodern Literary Theory: An Introduction'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; His discussion is influenced by the work of French philosophers [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]] and [[Jean-Luc Nancy]]. Lucy argues that postmodernism should be distinguished from [[poststructuralism]], and especially from deconstruction as associated with the work of [[Jacques Derrida]].

Lucy's work is notable for its sense of humour, and for taking popular culture no less seriously than philosophy. The increasing tendency in his later work towards a philosophical engagement with contemporary events is strongly informed by Derrida's ''[[Specters of Marx]]'' and the idea of democracy-to-come, which is the linchpin of Lucy's account of the importance of deconstruction in ''A Derrida Dictionary'' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Niall Lucy, ''A Derrida Dictionary'' (Oxford: Blackwell, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Lucy’s recent work has been collaborative, and directly concerned with contemporary Australian cultural events and figures. His book with Steve Mickler, ''The War on Democracy: Conservative Opinion in the Australian Press'' (2006), pits a Derridean concept of democracy against what the authors argue are the undemocratic interests represented in the work of several prominent Australian media commentators (whom they refer to collectively as “Team Australia”), including [[Miranda Devine]], [[Gerard Henderson]], [[Janet Albrechtsen]] and [[Andrew Bolt]].&lt;ref&gt;Niall Lucy and Steve Mickler, ''The War on Democracy: Conservative Opinion in the Australian Press'' (Nedlands: University of Western Australia Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The book was shortlisted for the Gleebooks Prize in Literary and Cultural Criticism at the 2008 [[New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards]].

Among other recent works, Lucy's co-edited collection (with Chris Coughran), ''Vagabond Holes'' (2009), is a tribute to his late friend, [[David McComb]], lead singer and songwriter for Australian rock band [[The Triffids]], which defies the conventions of a rock biography in its deconstruction of the notion of an autonomous self or identity.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran, eds, ''Vagabond Holes: David McComb and The Triffids'' (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Contributors include [[Nick Cave]], [[Mick Harvey]], [[John Kinsella (poet)|John Kinsella]], [[DBC Pierre]], and Lucy's sister, [[Judith Lucy]].

His book, ''Pomo Oz: Fear and Loathing Downunder'' (2010), engages with (among other issues) debates surrounding secondary-school English teaching in Australia, while taking a deconstructive slant on the [[Bill Henson]] scandal, the [[Children Overboard Affair]] and [[The Chaser]]'s [[The Chaser APEC pranks|prank motorcade at the 2007 APEC Australia summit]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Niall Lucy, ''Pomo Oz: Fear and Loathing Downunder'' (Fremantle: Fremantle Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; A significant section of the book is devoted to a discussion of John Kinsella’s poetry in relation to deconstruction, with reference to Kinsella’s friendship with Derrida. Ranging across diverse topics, and working in multiple styles, the book offers a further elaboration of Lucy’s work on democracy-to-come.

Niall's final book, ''A Dictionary of Postmodernism'' will be published posthumously by Wiley-Blackwell in 2015. The book, edited by [[John Hartley (academic)]], was completed by Niall's friends and colleagues Robert Briggs, [[Claire Colebrook]], [[John Hartley (academic)|John Hartley]], Tony Thwaites, Darren Tofts and [[McKenzie Wark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405150777.html|title=Wiley: Dictionary of Postmodernism - Niall Lucy|work=wiley.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Lucy has been lauded internationally for his work in deconstruction. His ''Debating Derrida'' is described by [[Peggy Kamuf]] as "an excellent guide"&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Kamuf, ''Book of Addresses'' (California: Stanford University Press, 2004), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt; and by Juliana De Nooy as “lucid and pedagogical”.&lt;ref&gt;Juliana De Nooy, ''Derrida, Kristeva and the Dividing Line: An Articulation of Two Theories of Difference'' (New York: Routledge, 1998), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', Anthony Elliot says of ''A Derrida Dictionary'' that it "ranges with considerable flair from [[Hegel]] to [[Geri Halliwell]], fascism to [[Francis Fukuyama]], the philosophy of consciousness to celebrity".&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Elliot, "Circles and Celebs". ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 9 July 2004, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; "It [''A Derrida Dictionary''] is the kind of book whose wit makes one want to read excerpts to colleagues, and it is precisely this lightness of tone that makes Lucy's book so pedagogically useful", a reviewer writes in ''Choice''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Barnett,  "[Review of] A Derrida Dictionary". ''Choice'' 42,1 (Sept. 2004): 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claire Colebrook]] commends ''Postmodern Literary Theory: An Introduction'' as “a critical account of the difference between postmodernism and poststructuralism”.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Colebrook, “Questioning Representation”. ''SubStance'' 29, 2 (2000): 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy’s work is widely cited across many disciplines and in several languages. Among those who refer to his work are [[John D. Caputo]]&lt;ref&gt;John D. Caputo, ''Deconstruction in a Nutshell: A Conversation with Jacques Derrida'' (New York: Fordham University Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hartley (academic)|John Hartley]],&lt;ref&gt;John Hartley, ''A Short History of Cultural Studies'' (London: Sage, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Peggy Kamuf,&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Kamuf, “The University in the World it is Attempting to Think”. ''Culture Machine'' 6 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Keith Jenkins]],&lt;ref&gt;Keith Jenkins, ''Why History? Ethics and Postmodernity'' (London: Routledge, 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[McKenzie Wark]].&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie Wark, ''Gamer Theory'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The critical reception in Australia to his book with Steve Mickler, ''The War on Democracy'', has been divided. Kitty van Vuuren, writing in ''Media International Australia'', says she was “unable to put the book down” and found it to be “lively, sardonic and entertaining”.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Van Vuuren, “[Review of] The War on Democracy". ''Media International Australia'' 126 (February 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In '[[Overland (literary journal)|''Overland'']], Georgina Murray claims the book was "crying out to be written".&lt;ref&gt;Georgina Murray, "Warriors Against Democracy". ''Overland" 188 (September 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, one of the figures whose work is critiqued in ''The War on Democracy'', education journalist Luke Slattery, describes the book as "blood sport" and decries Lucy as "a parish priest in the much-diminished postmodern church".&lt;ref&gt;Luke Slattery, "A Travesty of Logic". ''On Line Opinion'', 9 March 2007; Luke Slattery, "Supposed Defenders of Democracy Err in Choice of Foes". ''The Australian'', 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another figure of critique in the book, columnist [[Christopher Pearson (journalist)|Christopher Pearson]], condemns what he calls the book's "unusually vicious polemic".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Pearson, "Villains Made to Order". ''The Australian'', 11 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amero symbol.svg|thumb|The currency symbol for the hypothetical Amero, by the [[Fraser Institute]] ]]

The '''North American monetary union''' is a theoretical [[economic and monetary union]] of three [[North America]]n countries: [[Canada]], the [[United States|United States of America]] and [[Mexico]].

Implementation would involve the three countries giving up their current currency units (the [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]], the [[Canadian dollar]], and the [[Mexican peso]]) and adopting a new one, created specifically for this purpose (some versions of the theory assume only the United States and Canada would be included). The hypothetical currency for the union is most often referred to as the '''amero'''.&lt;ref name="TACiht"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bennett| first=Drake|title=The Amero Conspiracy|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=2007-11-25|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/world/americas/25iht-25Amero.8473833.html?_r=1|accessdate=2012-08-09|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.Web/product_files/CasefortheAmero.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Case for the Amero: The Economics and Politics of a North American Monetary Union|author=Herbert G. Grubel|year=1999|publisher=The Fraser Institute|accessdate=2007-09-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219141544/http://www.fraserinstitute.org/Commerce.Web/product_files/CasefortheAmero.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is modeled on the common [[European Union]] currency (the [[euro]]).

==Support==
===Canada===
One argument is that it would save up to $3&amp;nbsp;billion in currency transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=W.B.P. Robson and D.E.W. Laidler|year=2002|title=No Small Change: The Awkward Economics and Politics of North American Monetary Integration| work=C.D. Howe Institute Commentary: The Border Papers, Toronto, Ontario|publisher=C.D. Howe Institute|volume=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors also stated that Canada's GDP could rise by up to 33% in a 20-year period given the adoption of a single currency.

The idea of a common currency has historically{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} been unpopular in English-speaking Canada, in comparison to the French-speaking province of Quebec where it has received more support. A 2001 opinion poll found that in Quebec over 50% of respondents favored the idea of a shared currency, while in the rest of Canada a majority of respondents opposed the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leger Marketing Group|title=A Study of How Canadians Perceive Canada-US relations|date=August 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support in other regions===
Lower levels of currency cooperation have been practiced in the Americas before. Some nations such as [[Argentine Peso|Argentina]] and [[Brazilian Real|Brazil]] have at times [[Fixed exchange rate|tied their currency to]] the U.S. dollar. Some of them, such as [[Aruban Florin|Aruba]], [[Bahamian dollar|Bahamas]], [[Barbadian dollar|Barbados]], and the [[Eastern Caribbean dollar|Organisation of the Eastern Caribbean]], still do.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The U.S. dollar is officially accepted alongside local currencies in [[El Salvador]] (since 2001), [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Peru]], [[Honduras]], [[Panama]], [[Bermuda]] and [[Barbados]], although in practice two of these countries (El Salvador and Panama) are fully dollarized.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In 2000, [[Ecuador]] officially adopted the U.S. dollar as its sole currency.  In a few areas of Canada, the U.S. dollar can be accepted as currency alongside the Canadian Dollar, particularly in areas near border crossings. An example of this effect is [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], with large numbers of U.S. tourists (businesses still may not accept U.S. currency depending on their policy). The same is also true for the Canadian Dollar in many U.S. cities bordering Canada.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Criticisms and problems==
{{see also|Optimum currency area}}
Opposition to a North American monetary union exists high up in the governments on both sides of the [[Canada–United States border]]. [[Herb Grubel|Herbert Grubel]], the first proponent of the amero, admits that American officials show no interest in the topic.&lt;ref name="TACiht"/&gt; He concedes that "there wouldn't be very much benefit for the United States" in an amero.&lt;ref name="TACiht"/&gt; Likewise, the Canadian [[Department of Finance (Canada)|Department of Finance]] strongly opposes the creation of a common currency with the United States, citing the loss of economic sovereignty. In briefing documents to former [[Minister of Finance (Canada)|Minister of Finance]] [[Jim Flaherty]], finance officials concluded:&lt;ref name="CCCJtham"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Chase|first=Steven|title=Consider a continental currency: Jarislowsky|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2007-11-22|accessdate=2007-11-28|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071122.wrdollar1122/BNStory/Front|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;A North American common currency would undoubtedly mean for Canada the adoption of the U.S. dollar and U.S. monetary policy. Canada would have to give up its control of domestic inflation and interest rates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Trade-offs===
From the point of view of the Canadian and Mexican governments, a major obstacle to the creation of a unified currency is the sheer dominance of the United States in any such union.

A paper from  [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] puts forward the idea that the United States simply has too many advantages from the ''status quo'' to move toward a single currency.&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://repositories.cdlib.org/gis/29|title=North American Monetary Union: A United States Perspective|author=Benjamin J. Cohen |year=2004|publisher=Global &amp; International Studies Program|volume=Paper 29|accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States dollar already acts as a global currency, meaning any transition to a 'new' currency would risk compromising this position and could cause a shift toward the [[euro]] or [[Japanese yen|yen]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The U.S. dollar is currently being used in over half of all the world's exports, double the total United States foreign trade. The adoption of the amero could threaten the [[seigniorage]] that the U.S. currently gains from its dollar. While seignorage would still be gained from the amero, this would be shared among the [[Bank of Canada]], the [[Federal Reserve]], and the [[Banco de México]]. Therefore, even if the amero were used just as much as the U.S. dollar, the advantages would be shared among two or more countries, and not exclusively held by the United States.

===Differing economies and debt===
Several problems could arise in regards to macroeconomic management. By submitting to a common currency, the countries would lose considerable [[autonomy]] in the management of the currency itself, including the setting of [[interest rate]]s. Amongst the three potential participants, there is considerable difference in policy which would have to be reconciled.

[[Debt]] is a factor affecting currency prices. As of 2010, the debt of the United States continues to increase, while the debt of the Canadian federal government is being reduced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.currency-converter.io/show?amount=1&amp;from=USD&amp;to=CAD&amp;view=5years USD/CAD currency rates evolution over last 5 years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208190107/http://www.currency-converter.io/show?amount=1&amp;from=USD&amp;to=CAD&amp;view=5years |date=2015-02-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a clear advantage for Canadians and it would not be reflected if the currencies were to merge. The importance of commodities also factors into this equation.

A concern with any unified North American currency is the differing economic situations between each country. The [[Eurozone]] is broadly similar being service-based economies&lt;ref&gt;[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-30-08-410/EN/KS-30-08-410-EN.PDF European Economic Statistics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030075229/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-30-08-410/EN/KS-30-08-410-EN.PDF |date=2008-10-30 }}, Fig.2.2.2, Eurostat Statistical Books&lt;/ref&gt; based on high [[public spending]] (compared to the United States), high taxes and wealth being created by the sale of goods and services. North America on the other hand has three distinct economies; one based mainly on agriculture, industry and manufacturing with a demand for free trade ([[Economy of Mexico|Mexico]]), another based on services such as retail, with higher taxes and low public spending ([[Economy of the United States|United States]]), and a third based on services with higher taxes and higher public spending, with a large sector in primary goods such as oil, mining and lumber ([[Economy of Canada|Canada]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Some observers blamed the [[Eurozone crisis]] partly on a lack of effective [[fiscal union]].  The [[Budget of the European Union]] is relatively small compared to the budgets of the Eurozone countries, which are set independently.  Leading up to the crisis, some countries incurred more debt than the unenforced EU guidelines called for.  Due to the centralized monetary union, countries experiencing problems were unable to apply local monetary policy to recover, and destabilized the currency which is also used by more economically healthy countries.  The national budgets and debt levels of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, on the other hand, are also set completely independently, which could cause similar problems in a situation where monetary policy was centralized.

In contrast, the economies of the various states of the United States are strongly integrated.  Internally, the U.S. also has strong [[fiscal federalism]] - all but one of the fifty states have a [[balanced budget amendment]], and the federal budget is large compared to state budgets, resulting in effective federal stabilization of the currency and national economy.

===Political mandate===
In November 2006, former CNN commentator [[Lou Dobbs]] reported that a "[[North American Union]]" was being implemented, without the knowledge and consent of the people who would be affected by the Union.&lt;ref name=Dobbs2006&gt;{{cite web |url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0611/29/ldt.01.html |date=  November 29, 2006 |title= Lou Dobbs Tonight |website= CNN.com, Transcripts }}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode also briefly mentioned various claims about a common currency. The report focused on uncertainty prior to [[Felipe Calderón]] taking office as [[President of Mexico]] in late 2006, but never provided any substantive evidence to support this claim. The report suggested the union would be implemented by 2010,&lt;ref name=Dobbs2006 /&gt; a deadline which came and went without such a union being implemented.

In 2006, [[Conservative Caucus]] Chairman [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]], [[WorldNetDaily|WND]] columnist and author [[Jerome Corsi]], activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]], among others, reportedly formed a coalition against a North American Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadafreepress.com/2006/cover121406.htm|title=Debut of the Amero,|author=Judi McLeod |publisher=Canada Free Press|date=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, 2007, Republican Representatives [[Virgil Goode]] of Virginia, [[Tom Tancredo]] of Colorado, [[Walter B. Jones|Walter Jones]] of North Carolina, and [[Ron Paul]] of Texas were among the 43 federal lawmakers who introduced H. CON. RES. 40, a resolution advocated by the coalition, that expressed: &lt;blockquote&gt;The sense of Congress that the United States should not engage in the construction of a [[NAFTA superhighway|North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Superhighway System]] or enter into a North American Union (NAU) with Mexico or Canada.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Amero coins==
In August 2007, rumors and conspiracy theories began circulating across the Internet regarding alleged [[United States Treasury]]-issued amero coins.

The inspiration behind these rumors may have been the posting of images of medallions created by coin designer Daniel Carr.&lt;ref name="TACiht"/&gt; Carr, who designed the [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Rhode Island]] 2001 [[statehood quarters]], sells medals and tokens of his own design on his commercial website, "Designs Computed" (also known as "DC Coin").&lt;ref name="TACiht"/&gt; Among his designs are a series of gold, silver and copper fantasy issues of amero coins ranging in denomination from one to one thousand.&lt;ref name="TACiht"/&gt; The medallions have the legend "Union of North America" on the back with his company's logo, a stylized "DC",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designscomputed.com/coins/dc-coin_cover.htm |title=Catalog of Minted Items by Daniel Carr |publisher=Designscomputed.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; in small type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amerocurrency.com/amerophotos.html|title=Photos of notional Amero coins|accessdate=2007-12-03|work=AmeroCurrency.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerning his amero designs, he mentions on his website:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My goal with these coins is not to endorse a Union of North America or a common Amero currency. I fully support the [[United States Constitution]], and I would not welcome (in any form) a diminishment of its provisions. I expect that these coins will help make more people aware of the issue and the possible ramifications. I leave it up to others to decide if they are in favor of, or against a North American Union. And I encourage citizens to voice their approval or disapproval of government plans that impact them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dc-coin.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWCATS&amp;Category=8|publisher=DC Coins|title=UNA Amero Pattern Coins|accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unauthorized postings of images taken from his website have been reposted widely across the Internet, often being used as supposed "proof" of the amero coinage. Notably, [[white nationalist]] and former [[Internet radio]] [[talk show]] host [[Hal Turner]] ran a full article on his website about the "amero coin", claiming to have arranged for a [[United States Government]] minted "amero" to be smuggled out of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] by an employee of that organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halturnershow.com/AmeroCoinArrives.html|publisher=Hal Turner Show|title=Amero Coin Arrives|accessdate=2007-09-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115/http://www.halturnershow.com/AmeroCoinArrives.html|archivedate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Turner's assertions of federal minting of ameros, a web site marketing the curio coins released a statement debunking Turner's claims of a government cover up regarding Daniel Carr's amero products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.amerocurrency.com/turnerexposed.html|publisher=AmeroCurrency.com|title=Response to Turner claims of U.S. Government Amero Cover Up|accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[urban legend]] investigating Web site ''[[Snopes]]'' also ran a further counter to Turner's claims, stating "neither the U.S. Mint nor the U.S. Treasury has a hand in creating these 'Ameros'. These coins are merely collectibles offered to the buying public by a private company in the business of manufacturing such curiosities."&lt;ref name="Snopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/business/amero.asp|publisher=Snopes.com|title=Amero Uproar|accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hal Turner claimed that Carr's website had been created in haste in a matter of days expressly to discredit his claim about the coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirrors.wordsforgood.org/educate-yourself.org/lte/halturneramerocoins07sep07.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920090907/http://mirrors.wordsforgood.org/educate-yourself.org/lte/halturneramerocoins07sep07.html|archivedate=2010-09-20|publisher=Educate-Yourself.org (via Internet Archive)|title=Hal Turner's AMERO Coin Story |accessdate=2008-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Carr's designs have been available through his website since 2005,&lt;ref name="wayback-dc-coin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dc-coin.com/ |title=List of archives of www.dc-coin.com |work=Wayback Machine |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022091141/http://www.dc-coin.com/ |archivedate=2016-10-22}} The archive has a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070804142409/http://www.designscomputed.com/coins/ 4 August 2007 copy] of Carr's coin list with the Amero near the bottom, and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20070819075335/http://www.designscomputed.com/coins/amero.html 19 August 2007 copy] of the Amero page itself.&lt;/ref&gt; and according to a [[WHOIS]] search at [[Network Solutions]], the domain "dc-coin.com" was registered by Daniel Carr on September 27, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/results.jsp?domain=dc-coin.com WHOIS domain registration information results for dc-coin.com from Network Solutions&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2008, Hal Turner released a video showing an apparent 20 amero coin, with claims that shipments of the currency had been sent to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9084453302540783461&amp;ei=fM_sSJffKJPuqALQ3-DwBg&amp;q=amero&amp;vt=lf|publisher=Youtube.com|title=Hal Turner Shows NEW Amero Currency|accessdate=2008-10-09}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the coin in Hal Turner's video is identical to a medallion on Daniel Carr's "dc-coin" website, listed as "UNA 2007 20 Ameros, Copper, Satin Finish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dc-coin.com/index.asp?PageAction=VIEWCATS&amp;Category=8|publisher=dc-coin.com|title=UNA Ameri Pattern Coins|accessdate=2008-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the new digital currency or cryptocurrency Amero was announced by the North America Procurement Council (NAPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trillions.biz/news/146436-NAPC_to_Launch_AMERO_Digital_Currency_in_June.html|title=NAPC to Launch Amero Digital Currency in June}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napc.pro|title=North America Procurement Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was inspired by the original concept of the Amero but follows a very different approach. It is designed, as its creators note, as a medium of exchange in commerce between government and business and business-to-business. It has already published a preliminary directory of vendors which have agreed to accept the Amero as payment for goods and services. Further information about the 'new' Amero is available on its own website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amerodigitalcurrency.com|title=Amero Digital Currency Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amero bills==
On December 3, 2008, Hal Turner's blog featured what he claimed were genuine "amero bills". He displayed photographs of purported 20, 50, and 100 amero notes. Turner did not identify how he obtained the images, saying only that "once again, my sources have come through". He claimed that the "new currency is already being printed and quietly distributed around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://halturnershow.blogspot.com/2008/12/urgent-new-amero-paper-currency-exposed.html|publisher=halturnershow.blogspot.com|title=New Amero Paper Currency Exposed|accessdate=2008-12-09|date=2008-12-03 |author=Turner, Hal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web site [[Snopes.com]] suggested Turner was "beating the same tired, apocryphal drum" with his new claim.&lt;ref name="Snopes"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2013}} These images are art from the [[Flickr]] user aleatorysort,&lt;ref name="flickr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/8152235@N02/page2/ |title=aleatorysort (2007-05-08). aleatorysort's photostream.

'''Novalis''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|v|æ|l|ɪ|s}}; {{IPA-de|noˈvaːlɪs|lang}}) was the [[pseudonym]] and [[pen name]] of '''Georg Philipp Friedrich [[Freiherr]] von Hardenberg''' (2 May 1772 – 25 March 1801), a poet,  author, [[mysticism|mystic]], and [[philosopher]] of [[Early German Romanticism]]. Hardenberg's professional work and university background, namely his study of [[mineralogy]] and management of salt mines in Saxony, was often ignored by his contemporary readers. The first studies showing important relations between his literary and professional works started in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Laman, ''James Joyce and German Theory: The Romantic School and All That'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|9781611472844}}, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
[[File:Schloss Oberwiederstedt.jpg|thumb|[[Wiederstedt|Oberwiederstedt]] Manor]]
[[File:Hardenberg-Ns-Wappen.png|thumb|upright=0.5|Coat-of-arms of the Hardenberg family]]
Georg Philipp Friedrich von Hardenberg was born in 1772 at [[Wiederstedt|Oberwiederstedt]] manor (now part of [[Arnstein, Saxony-Anhalt]]), in the [[Harz]] mountains. In the church in Wiederstedt, he was christened Georg Philipp Friedrich. An oil painting and a christening cap commonly assigned to him are Hardenberg's only possessions now extant.

The family seat was a manorial estate. Hardenberg descended from ancient, Lower German nobility with its ancestral seat at [[Nörten-Hardenberg]] since 1287 to this day. Different lines of the family include such important, influential magistrates and ministry officials as the [[Prussia]]n chancellor [[Karl August von Hardenberg]] (1750–1822). He spent his childhood on the family estate and used it as the starting point for his travels into the Harz mountains.

His father, the estate owner and salt-mine manager Heinrich Ulrich Erasmus Freiherr (Baron) von Hardenberg (1738–1814), was a strictly [[pietism|pietistic]] man, member of the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] (Herrnhuter) Church. His second marriage was to Auguste Bernhardine von Böltzig (1749–1818), who gave birth to eleven children: their second child was Georg Philipp Friedrich. The Hardenbergs were a noble family but not rich. Young Georg Philipp was often short of cash, rode a small horse, and sometimes had to simply walk.&lt;ref name=frank&gt;"Dark Fates" by [[Frank Kermode]], ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 5 October 1995 - reproduced in Kermode's collection ''Bury Place Papers'', LRB, London, 2009, {{ISBN|9781873092040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, young Hardenberg was taught by private tutors. He attended the [[Martin Luther|Luther]]an grammar school in [[Eisleben]], where he acquired skills in [[rhetoric]] and ancient literature, common parts of the education of his time. From his twelfth year, he was in the charge of his uncle Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Hardenberg at his stately home in Lucklum.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Gjesdal|first=Kristin|title=Georg Friedrich Philipp von Hardenberg [Novalis]|date=2014|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/novalis/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2014|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies and employment===
Young Hardenberg studied [[legal studies|law]] from 1790 to 1794 at [[University of Jena|Jena]], [[Leipzig University|Leipzig]] and [[University of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]]. He passed his exams with distinction. During his studies, he attended [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]]'s lectures on history and befriended him during his [[tuberculosis|illness]]. He also met [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]] and [[Jean Paul]], and befriended [[Ludwig Tieck]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], and the brothers [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich]] and [[August Wilhelm Schlegel]].

In October 1794, he started working as [[actuary]] for August Coelestin Just, who became not only his friend but, later, also his biographer. The following January, he was appointed [[auditor]] to the salt works at [[Weißenfels]].

===Sophie===
During the time he worked for August Coelestin Just, Novalis met the 12-year-old [[Sophie von Kühn]] (1782–1797), a girl who was, according to accounts, a "perfectly commonplace young girl, neither intelligent nor particularly beautiful."&lt;ref name=frank/&gt; Nonetheless, he fell in love with Sophie, since in the young Georg Philipp's view of the world "nothing is commonplace" because "all, when rightly seen, is [[symbol]]ic."&lt;ref name=frank/&gt; On 15 March 1795, when Sophie was 13 years old, the two became engaged, despite her family's reluctance and the fact that she was already [[tuberculosis|tubercular]].&lt;ref name=frank/&gt;

The early death of Sophie in March 1797, from tuberculosis, affected Novalis deeply and permanently. She was only 15 years old, and the two had not married.

===At the salt mines===
In 1795–1796, Novalis entered the [[Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|Mining Academy of Freiberg]] in [[Saxony]], a leading academy of science, to study [[geology]] under Professor [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] (1750–1817), who befriended him. During Novalis' studies in Freiberg, he immersed himself in a wide range of studies, including [[mining]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[history]] and, not least, [[philosophy]]. It was here that he collected materials for his [[encyclopaedia]] project, ''Das allgemeine Brouillon''. Similar to other German authors of the Romantic age, his work in the mining industry, which was undergoing then the first steps to industrialization, was closely connected with his literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Ziolkowski: ''German Romanticism And Its Institutions'', Princeton University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary and philosophical connections===
In the period 1795–1796, Novalis concerned himself with the scientific doctrine of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], which greatly influenced his worldview. He not only read Fichte's philosophies but also developed his concepts further, transforming Fichte's ''Nicht-Ich'' ([[German language|German]] "not I") to a ''Du'' ("you"), an equal subject to the ''Ich'' ("I"). This was the starting point for Novalis' ''Liebesreligion'' ("religion of love").

Novalis' first fragments were published in 1798 in the ''[[Athenaeum (German magazine)|Athenäum]]'', a magazine edited by the Schlegel brothers, who were also part of the early Romantic movement. Novalis' first publication was entitled ''Blüthenstaub'' (''Pollen'') and saw the first appearance of his pseudonym, "Novalis". In July 1799, he became acquainted with [[Ludwig Tieck]], and that autumn he met other authors of so-called "[[Jena Romanticism]]".

===Julie===
Novalis became engaged for the second time in December 1798. His fiancée was Julie von Charpentier (1776–1811), a daughter of Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Toussaint von Charpentier, a professor in [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]].

From [[Pentecost]] 1799, Novalis again worked in the management of salt mines. That December, he became an assessor of the salt mines and a director. On the 6 December 1800, the twenty-eight-year-old Hardenberg was appointed ''Supernumerar-Amtshauptmann'' for the [[Thuringia|district of Thuringia]], a position comparable to a present-day magistrate.

===Death===
From August 1800 onward, Hardenberg was suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. On 25 March 1801, he died in Weißenfels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  His body was buried in the old cemetery there.

Novalis lived long enough to see the publication only of ''Pollen'', ''Faith and Love or the King and the Queen'' and ''Hymns to the Night''. His unfinished novels ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' and ''The Novices at Sais'', his political speech ''Christendom or Europa'', and numerous other notes and fragments were published posthumously by his friends Ludwig Tieck and Friedrich Schlegel.

==Writing&lt;!--'Magical idealism' and 'Magical Idealism' redirect here--&gt;==

{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}
Young Hardenberg adopted the [[pen name]] '''Novalis''' from his 12th-century ancestors who named themselves ''de Novali'', after their settlement [[Grossenrode]], or ''magna Novalis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1975 Novalis] in the ''Literary Encyclopedia'', The Literary Dictionary Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Novalis, who was deeply read in science, law, philosophy, politics and [[political economy]], started writing quite early. He left an abundance of notes on these fields and his early work displays his ease and familiarity with them. His later works are closely connected to his studies and his profession. Novalis collected everything that he had learned, reflected upon it and drew connections in the sense of an encyclopaedic overview on art, religion and science. These notes from the years 1798 and 1799 are called ''Das allgemeine Brouillon (''literally "general rough draft"), now available in English under the title ''Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kneller|first=Jane|date=2008-09-05|title=Review of Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia: Das Allgemeine Brouillon|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/notes-for-a-romantic-encyclopaedia-das-allgemeine-brouillon/|issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Together with [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]], Novalis developed the fragment as a literary artform. The core of Hardenberg's literary works is the quest for the connection of science and poetry, and the result was supposed to be a "progressive universal poesy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ghdi.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=368|title=GHDI - Document|website=ghdi.ghi-dc.org|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novalis was convinced that philosophy and the higher-ranking poetry have to be continually related to each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=sqKLAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Routledge Companion to Nineteenth Century Philosophy|last=Moyar|first=Associate Professor of Philosophy Dean|last2=Moyar|first2=Dean|date=2010-04-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135151119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the romantic fragment is an appropriate form for a depiction of "progressive universal poesy”, can be seen especially from the success of this new genre in its later reception.

Novalis' whole works are based upon an idea of education: "We are on a mission: we are called upon to educate the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=Iw9JAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Romantic Absolute: Being and Knowing in Early German Romantic Philosophy, 1795-1804|last=Nassar|first=Dalia|date=2013-12-24|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226084237|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has to be made clear that everything is in a continual process. It is the same with humanity, which forever strives towards and tries to recreate a new [[Golden Age]] – a paradisaic Age of harmony between man and nature that was assumed to have existed in earlier times. This Age was described by [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]] and [[Franz Hemsterhuis]], the last of whom was an extremely important figure for the [[German Romantics]].

This idea of a romantic universal poesy can be seen clearly in the romantic triad. This theoretical structure always shows its recipient that the described moment is exactly the moment (''[[kairos]]'') in which the future is decided. These frequently mentioned critical points correspond with the artist's feeling for the present, which Novalis shares with many other contemporaries of his time. Thus a triadic structure can be found in most of his works. This means that there are three corresponding structural elements which are written differently concerning the content and the form.

Hardenberg's intensive study of the works of [[Jakob Böhme]], from 1800, had a clear influence on his own writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books?id=ACdlw1O-tpIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Jena Romanticism and Its Appropriation of Jakob Bšhme: Theosophy, Hagiography, Literature|last=Mayer|first=Paola|date=1999-11-26|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=9780773518520|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mystical worldview, a high standard of education, and the frequently perceptible pietistic influences are combined in Novalis' attempt to reach a new concept of Christianity, faith and God. He forever endeavours to align these with his own view of [[transcendental philosophy]], which acquired the mysterious name "'''magical idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warnes|first=Christopher|date=2006|title=Magical Realism and the Legacy of German Idealism|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20466796|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=101|issue=2|pages=488–498|doi=10.2307/20466796}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing heavily from the critical or [[transcendental idealism]] of [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[J. G. Fichte]] (the earliest form of [[German idealism]]), and incorporates the artistic element central to [[Early German Romanticism]]. The subject must strive to conform the external, natural world to its own will and genius; hence the term "magical".&lt;ref&gt;See David W. Wood's introduction to the entry for "Novalis," ''Notes for a Romantic Encyclopaedia'', Albany: SUNY, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Novalis' emphasis on the term "magic" represents a challenge to what he perceived as the [[disenchantment]] that came with modern rationalistic thinking and therefore functions as a "solution" of sorts to the lamentation in ''Hymnen an die Nacht''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 88 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Krell calls magical idealism "[[thaumaturgic]] idealism."&lt;ref&gt;David Farrell Krell, ''Contagion'', Indianapolis: Indiana State University, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  This view can even be discerned in more religious works such as the ''Spiritual Songs'' (published 1802), which soon became incorporated into Lutheran hymn-books.

Novalis influenced, among others, the novelist and theologian [[George MacDonald]], who translated his 'Hymns to the Night' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.george-macdonald.com/articles/novalis.html|title=Novalis|website=www.george-macdonald.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Novalis, and the [[Early Romanticism]] (''Frühromantik'') movement as a whole, has been recognized as constituting a separate philosophical school, as opposed to simply a literary movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ro/books/about/The_Romantic_Imperative.html?id=xTzc-gasxpUC&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Romantic Imperative|last=Beiser|first=Frederick C.|date=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674011809|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of the distinctness of ''Frühromantik'' philosophy is owed largely, in the English speaking world at least, to the writer [[Frederick Beiser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rush|first=Fred|date=2005|title=Review of The Romantic Imperative: The Concept of Early German Romanticism|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3489014|journal=Mind|volume=114|issue=455|pages=709–713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher and [[Western esotericism|esotericist]] [[Rudolf Steiner]] spoke in various lectures (now published) about Novalis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/NV1851_index.html|title=Novalis|date=2015|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poetry===
In August 1800, eight months after completion, the revised edition of the ''Hymnen an die Nacht'' was published in the ''Athenaeum''. They are often considered to be the climax of Novalis’ lyrical works and the most important poetry of the German early Romanticism.

[[File:Novalis.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet Novalis (1772–1801), portrait by [[Friedrich Eduard Eichens]] from 1845]]The six hymns contain many elements which can be understood as autobiographical. Even though a lyrical "I", rather than Novalis himself, is the speaker, there are many relationships between the hymns and Hardenberg's experiences from 1797 to 1800.

The topic is the romantic interpretation of life and death, the threshold of which is symbolised by the night. Life and death are – according to Novalis – developed into entwined concepts. So in the end, death is the romantic principle of life.

Influences from the literature of that time can be seen. The metaphors of the hymns are closely connected to the books Novalis had read at about the time of his writing of the hymns. These are prominently [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (in the translation by [[August Wilhelm Schlegel|A.W. Schlegel]], 1797) and [[Jean Paul]]’s ''Unsichtbare Loge'' (1793).

The ''Hymns to the Night'' display a universal religion with an intermediary. This concept is based on the idea that there is always a third party between a human and God. This intermediary can either be Jesus – as in Christian lore – or the dead beloved as in the hymns. These works consist of three times two hymns. These three components are each structured in this way: the first hymn shows, with the help of the Romantic triad, the development from an assumed happy life on earth through a painful era of alienation to salvation in the eternal night; the following hymn tells of the awakening from this vision and the longing for a return to it. With each pair of hymns, a higher level of experience and knowledge is shown. Some of the poems notably lament the historical replacement of European [[Paganism]] by [[Christianity]], creating ambiguity about the exact view of the ''Hymns'' on Christianity and [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 76-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prose===
The novel fragments ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' and ''Die Lehrlinge zu Sais (The Novices of Sais)'' reflect the idea of describing a universal world harmony with the help of poetry. The novel '[[Heinrich von Ofterdingen]]' contains the "[[blue flower]]", a symbol that became an emblem for the whole of German Romanticism. Originally the novel was supposed to be an answer to Goethe’s ''Wilhelm Meister'', a work that Novalis had read with enthusiasm but later on judged as being highly unpoetical. He disliked the victory of the economical over the poetic.

The speech called ''Die Christenheit oder Europa'' was written in 1799, but was first published in 1826. It is a poetical, cultural-historical speech with a focus on a political utopia with regard to the Middle Ages. In this text Novalis tries to develop a new Europe which is based on a new poetical [[Christendom]] which shall lead to unity and freedom. He got the inspiration for this text from [[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]’s ''[[On Religion|Über die Religion]]'' (1799). The work was also a response to the French Enlightenment and Revolution, both of which Novalis saw as catastrophic and irreligious. It anticipated, then, the growing German and Romantic theme of anti-Enlightenment visions of European spirituality and order.

==Influence==
[[Walter Pater]] includes Novalis's quote, ''"Philosophiren ist dephlegmatisiren, vivificiren"'' ("to philosophize is to throw off apathy, to become revived")&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Laman, ''James Joyce and German Theory: "The Romantic School and All That"'', (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 2004), 37.&lt;/ref&gt; in his conclusion to ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance''. Novalis' poetry and writings were also an influence on [[Hermann Hesse]].

20th-century German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] uses a Novalis fragment, "Philosophy is really homesickness, an urge to be at home everywhere" in the opening pages of ''The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Fundamental-Concepts-Metaphysics-Finitude-Solitude/dp/0253214297|title=The Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics: World, Finitude, Solitude|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|date=2001-03-01|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253214294|edition= Reprint|location=Bloomington, Ind|language=English|translator-last=McNeill|translator-first=William|translator-last2=Walker|translator-first2=Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novalis was an influence on [[Rudolf Steiner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Significance-Novalis-Lecture-Rudolf-Steiner/dp/B004MCDCD4|title=The Significance of Novalis - A Lecture By Rudolf Steiner - A TAZO EDITION|last=Steiner|first=Dr Rudolf|last2=Mansell|first2=Rick|date=2008|publisher=Rosenkreutz Institute|editor-last=Tazo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The libretto of [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' contains strong allusions to Novalis' symbolic language, especially the dichotomy between the Night and the Day that animates his ''Hymns to the Night.''

Novalis was also an influence on [[George MacDonald]], and so indirectly on [[C. S. Lewis]], the [[Inklings]], and the whole modern [[fantasy]] genre. [[Jorge Luis Borges|Borges]] refers often to Novalis in his work.

[[File:Novalisplaque.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Novalis house plaque, [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]].]]

Novelist [[Penelope Fitzgerald]]'s last work, ''[[The Blue Flower]]'', is a historical fiction about Novalis, his education, his philosophical and poetic development, and his romance with Sophie.

The [[krautrock]] band [[Novalis (band)|Novalis]], beside taking their name from him, adapted or used directly poems by Novalis as lyrics on their albums.

The American avant-garde filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]] made the film ''First Hymn to the Night – Novalis'' in 1994. The film was issued on Blu-ray and DVD by the [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion Collection]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/722-by-brakhage-an-anthology-volumes-one-and-two By Brakhage: An Anthology, Volumes One and Two], Criterion&lt;/ref&gt;

In tribute to his writings, Novalis records are produced by AVC Audio Visual Communications AG, Switzerland.

==Collected works==
[[File:Weißenfels, Klosterstraße 24-20151105-001.jpg|thumb|''Novalis Museum'' at [[Weissenfels]]]]
Novalis' works were originally issued in two volumes by his friends [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] (2 vols. 1802; a third volume was added in 1846). Editions of Novalis' collected works have since been compiled by [[C. Meisner]] and [[Bruno Wille]] (1898), by [[E. Heilborn]] (3 vols., 1901), and by [[J. Minor]] (3 vols., 1907). ''Heinrich von Ofterdingen'' was published separately by [[J. Schmidt]] in 1876.

Novalis's ''Correspondence'' was edited by [[J. M. Raich]] in 1880. See [[R. Haym]] ''Die romantische Schule'' (Berlin, 1870); [[A. Schubart]], ''Novalis' Leben, Dichten und Denken'' (1887); [[C. Busse]], ''Novalis' Lyrik'' (1898); [[J. Bing]], ''Friedrich von Hardenberg'' (Hamburg, 1899), E. Heilborn, ''Friedrich von Hardenberg'' (Berlin, 1901).

The German-language, six-volume edition of Novalis works ''Historische-Kritische Ausgabe - Novalis Schriften'' (HKA) is edited by Richard Samuel, Hans-Joachim Mähl &amp; Gerhard Schulz. It is published by Verlag W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart, 1960–2006.

Churchland's work is in the school of [[analytic philosophy]] in [[western philosophy]], with interests in [[epistemology]] and the [[philosophy of science]], and specific principal interests in the [[philosophy of mind]] and in [[neurophilosophy]] and [[artificial intelligence]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  His work has been described as being influenced by the work of [[W. V. O. Quine]], [[Thomas Kuhn]], [[Russell Hanson]], [[Wilfred Sellars]], and [[Paul Feyerabend]]&lt;ref name = KeeleyBio06/&gt; as well as by [[Karl Popper]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Along with his wife, Churchland is a major proponent of [[eliminative materialism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Ramsey, William | year = 2013 | orig-year = 2003 | chapter = Eliminative Materialism |  format = revision of 16 April 2013, based on 8 May 2003 original | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor = Zalta, Edward N.|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/materialism-eliminative/|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=11 February 2017 | quote = [Quote:] In more recent history, eliminative materialism has received attention from a broader range of writers, including many concerned not only with the metaphysics of the mind, but also the process of theory change, the status of semantic properties, the nature of psychological explanation and recent developments in cognitive science. Much of this attention has been fostered by the husband-wife team of Paul and Patricia Churchland, whose writings have forced many philosophers and cognitive scientists to take eliminativism more seriously.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the belief that{{quote|everyday, common-sense, [[folk psychology|‘folk’ psychology]], which seeks to explain human behavior in terms of the beliefs and desires of agents, is actually a deeply flawed theory that must be eliminated in favor of a mature cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name = ZawidzkiDPMbio04/&gt;}} 
where by folk psychology is meant everyday mental concepts such as beliefs, feelings, and desires, which are viewed as theoretical constructs without coherent definition, and thus destined to be obviated by a scientific understanding of human nature.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} From the perspective of Zawidzki, Churchland's concept of eliminativism is suggested as early as his book ''Scientific Realism and the Plasticity of Mind'' (1979), with its most explicit formulation appearing in a ''Journal of Philosophy'' essay, "Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes" (1981, see [[#Written works]] section below).&lt;ref name = ZawidzkiDPMbio04/&gt;

Churchland holds that beliefs are not ontologically real; that is, he maintains that a future, fully matured [[neuroscience]] is likely to have no need for "beliefs" (see [[propositional attitudes]]), in the same manner that modern science discarded such notions as legends or witchcraft.{{according to whom|date=February 2017}}{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} According to Churchland, such concepts will not merely be ''reduced'' to more finely grained explanation and retained as useful proximate levels of description, but will be strictly ''eliminated'' as wholly lacking in correspondence to precise objective phenomena, such as activation patterns across [[neural networks]].{{cite quote|date=February 2017}} He points out that the history of science has seen many posits once considered real entities, such as [[phlogiston]], caloric, the [[luminiferous ether]], and [[Vitalism|vital forces]], thus eliminated.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Moreover, in ''The Engine of Reason, The Seat of the Soul'' Churchland hypothesizes that consciousness might be explained in terms of a [[recurrent neural network]] with its hub in the [[intralaminar nucleus]] of the [[thalamus]], and feedback connections to all parts of the cortex.{{full citation needed|date=February 2017}} He acknowledges that this proposal will likely be found in error with regard to the neurological details, but states his belief that it is on the right track in its use of recurrent neural networks to account for consciousness.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} This has been described, notably,{{by whom|date=February 2017}} as a [[reductionism|reductionist]] rather than eliminativist account of consciousness.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Personal life==
Churchland is the husband of philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]], and it has been noted that, "Their work is so similar that they are sometimes discussed, in journals and books, as one person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacFarquhar, Larissa|date=February 12, 2007 | title=Two Heads: A marriage devoted to the mind-body problem|journal=[[The New Yorker]] | url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/12/two-heads | access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Reviews [at CUP] / ‘This is a very ambitious book. Beginning with the premise of scientific realism (explained clearly in the first six pages), Churchland aims at little less than a ‘transvaluation of all values’. If some of Churchland’s more glowing descriptions sound rather like The Tao of Science, that is probably all to the good; the consequences drawn are important, vivid, and much better calculated to give life to the philosophical issues than aridly abstract discussions … I recommend the reading of this book to scientific realists and to diehard empiricists alike.’ Bas C. Van Fraassen Source: The Canadian Journal of Philosophy / ‘I heartily recommend [Churchland’s] book to all who are interested in the philosophy of mind.’ J. J. C. Smart Source: The Australasian Journal of Philosophy / ‘Once in a great while a book appears that makes us want to stand up and cheer. Churchland has written just such a book … The most delightful and intriguing sections of the book are those in which Churchland shows how we might expand our perceptual and introspective consciousness, and come to see the physical world and ourselves through the categories provided by science.’ Stephen P.

== History ==
Jimmy Carter appointed the eleven original members of the commission in July of 1979 and the Senate confirmed [[Morris B. Abram]] as the chairman of the commission on September 29, 1979.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The commissioners were sworn in by Judge [[David L. Bazelon]] at the White House on January 1, 1980 and proceeded to hold the first meeting that day. Six additional commissioners were sworn in as replacements were needed. The commission worked independently from January 1980 to March 31, 1983 when its authority expired. The meeting files, correspondences, and unpublished papers from the commission are currently held in the Bioethics Research Library Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Multiple government formed organizations continued to fulfill the commission's purposes after its expiration, most specifically the [[Bioethical Medical Advisory Committee]] which was created in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bioethics.georgetown.edu/library-materials/digital-collections/us-bioethics-commissions/|title=U.S. Bioethics Commissions|website=Georgetown Bioethics Research Library|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rosarius Mary Hagius''' (1673–1757) was a minor Maltese mediaeval philosopher who specialised mainly in metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Little is known as yet about the private life of Hagius. This is unfortunate because, from his extant works, it can clearly be seen that he possessed a superior mind, and quite dexterous in both philosophy and theology. Hagius was a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, and a Master of Theology. He taught philosophy and theology for three decades at most of [[Malta]]’s institutions of higher education, especially at the Dominican ''Collegium'' of Portus Salutis at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. His method and style, both of teaching and of writing, were decidedly in the line of Aristotelic-Thomist [[Scholasticism]]. He died on March 14, 1757, and was buried in the church of Portus Salutis.

==Extant works==
All of Hagius’ works are in Latin, and held at the [[National Library of Malta]] at [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]. Unfortunately, no manuscript of Hagius has ever been transliterated, much less translated into any modern language, or even freshly read and studied. Though all of his works basically deal with theological subjects, Hagius consistently examines them from a philosophical point of view, seeking to give sound philosophical basis to his arguments.

Two manuscripts which had formerly been attributed to Hagius are certainly not his. These are ''Tractatus De Sacramento Eucharistiæ'' ("A Study on the Sacrament of Eucharist''; 1710),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 152}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tractatus De Adorando SSme Trinitatis Misterio'' ("A Study on the Worship given to the Most Holy Mystery of the Trinity''; 1711).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hagius’ extant authentic works are the following

* 1710 – ''Tractatus De Pœnitentiæ'' ("A Study on the Sacrament of Confession"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32B#3 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is not simply a commentary on [[Thomas Aquinas]]’s doctrines, as one might expect, but rather an original exposition by Hagius. Nonetheless, it is Scholastic in nature.
* 1715 – ''Tractatus De Iusticia et Jure'' ("A Study on Justice and Law"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32B#1 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written under the guidance of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] lector Vincent Farrugia. The work deals with justice and positive law from [[Thomas Aquinas]]’ point of view.
* 1716 – ''Tractatus De Religione'' ("A Study on Religion"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32A#1 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the major intellectual source of the work is [[Thomas Aquinas]], it is more of a free-hand exposition by Hagius on religious worship, and the relationship with the divine. The manuscript includes four parts: ''De devotione'' ("On piety"), ''De oratione'' ("On prayer"), ''De sacrificio Missæ'' ("On the sacrifice of the Mass"), and ''De Voto'' ("On Vows").
* 1717 – ''Tractatus De Ultimo Fine'' ("A Study on the Ultimate Goal"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32#1 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is basically a commentary on some doctrines of [[Thomas Aquinas]] regarding the ultimate end and aim of man’s existence.
* 1718/19 – ''Tractatus De Virtutibus In Communi'' ("A Study on Virtues in General"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32#2 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, pp. 249f}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagius writes that the work was composed under the special guidance of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher [[Henry Ercole]]. It is basically a commentary of some of [[Thomas Aquinas]]’ doctrines. In fact, the manuscript itself is divided into five ‘Books’, each corresponding to the relevant parts of Aquinas’ ''Summa Theologiæ''.
* 1719 – ''Tractatus De Vitiis et Peccatis'' ("A Study on Vices and Sins"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32#3 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the preceding one, this work was composed under the guidance of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] philosopher [[Henry Ercole]]. Similarly, since it is a commentary of some of [[Thomas Aquinas]]’ doctrines, it is divided into sections corresponding to the relevant parts of Aquinas’ ''Summa Theologiæ''.
* 1719 – ''Brevis Tractatus De Legibus'' ("A Short Study on Laws"); unnumbered back to back folios.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the two former works, this was composed with the assistance of [[Henry Ercole]] too. It is an examination of all aspects, albeit in brief, of positive law.
* 1720 – ''Tractatus De Fide, Spe et Charitate'' ("A Study on Faith, Hope and Charity"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 59#3 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work deals with the three theological virtues from a Scholastic point of view.
* 1722 – ''De Effectu Excommunicatinis'' ("On the Effect of Excommunication"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32B#4 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 142}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an interesting work. It is not a commentary of [[Thomas Aquinas]], as one might expect, but rather an original study by Hagius. Though the method used is clearly that common to [[Scholasticism]], Hagius ventures to break off from the beaten track and explore themes which were usually not dealt with very frequently by Scholastics. The work is a collection of nine ‘Books’. An alternative title to the composition, entered at the head of the manuscript, is ''De quarto effectu Excommunicationis'' ("On the Four Effects of Excommunication").
* 1723 – ''Tractatus De Sacramento Matrimonii'' ("A Study on the Sacrament of Matrimony"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32B#5 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is a fairly straightforward exposition of the doctrine on matrimony according to the traditional style and view-point of Aristotelic-Thomist [[Scholasticism]].
* 1740 – ''Tractatus de Sacra Scriptura'' ("A Study on Holy Scripture"); 331 back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32A#3 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other manuscripts in the collection, Hagius’ handwriting here is far from neat. This might suggest that, though positively inscribed by Hagius, this extant document is not a final version of the work. In fact, the manuscript is illegible at times. The work is a highly detailed and extensive study on many technicalities related to the writing and composition of the Bible.
* ''Undated'' – ''Tractatus De Indulgentiis'' ("A Study on Indulgencies"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 32A/2 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the work is undated, it must have been composed around the first half of the 18th century. Basically it is a fierce attack on heretic doctrines concerning indulgencies.
* ''Undated'' – ''Tractatus De Divina Gratia'' ("A Study on Divine Grace"); unnumbered back to back folios, and marked as MS. 59#2 at the [[National Library of Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, p. 126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work must have been composed around 1719/20. It deals with divine grace from a purely Scholastic point of view.

'''Sonoma Mountain Zen Center''' (or, '''Genjoji''') is a [[Soto Zen]] practice center located on {{convert|80|acre|ha|-1}} in the mountainous region of [[Sonoma County]] in [[California]]—near [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]]—carrying on the tradition and lineage of [[Shunryu Suzuki]]. Founded by [[Jakusho Kwong]] and his wife Laura Kwong in 1973, Kwong-[[Rōshi|roshi]] is the current guiding teacher of the Zen center. Offering residential training, Sonoma Mountain Zen Center also offers a practice regimen for members of the surrounding area and elsewhere who are not residents.

==About==
Sonoma Mountain Zen Center was established by [[Jakusho Kwong]] and his wife Laura Kwong in 1973. According to the book ''Opening the Mountain'', "Bill and Laura Kwong had moved to [[Mill Valley]] and began a little 'put away zendo.' It took place in a neighborhood hall. Every morning, mats, cushions, and altar were put away so other uses of the room could happen. In 1973 the Kwongs and their four sons moved one county north. Classes Bill taught at [[Sonoma State University]] gave birth to Sonoma Mountain Zen Center."&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Davis, 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; A self-sustaining institution, the Zen center supports itself through members donations, proceeds from its Zen Dust bookstore, and by offering rooms for rental.&lt;ref&gt;Holender, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Author Sarah Ban Breathnach described the center in her book ''A Man's Journey to Simple Abundance'':

"''Near the top of the mountain, the road dips, bends, then snakes through a small grove of redwoods. The dense tree canopy blocks all ambient light, so that when you emerge on the other side of the grove, you feel as though you've passed through a portal into another world. It's a fitting way to approach Sonoma Mountain Zen Center, because people there view reality just a little bit differently from the way most of us do."&lt;ref&gt;Ban Breathnach, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary [[metaphysics]], '''temporal parts''' are the parts of an object that exist in time. A temporal part would be something like "the first year of a person's life", or "all of a table from between 10:00 a.m. on June 21, 1994 to 11:00 p.m. on July 23, 1996". The term is used in the debate over the persistence of material objects. Objects typically have parts that exist in space—a human body, for example, has ''spatial parts'' like hands, feet, and legs.  Some metaphysicists believe objects have ''temporal parts'' as well.

Originally it was argued that those who believe in temporal parts believe in [[perdurantism]], that persisting objects are wholes composed entirely of temporal parts. This view was contrasted with [[endurantism]], the claim that objects are wholly present at any one time (thus not having different temporal parts at different times). This claim is still commonplace, but philosophers like [[Ted Sider]] believe that even endurantists should accept temporal parts.

==Definition==
Not everyone was happy with the definition by analogy: some philosophers, such as [[Peter van Inwagen]], argued that—even given the definition by analogy—they still had no real idea what a temporal part was meant to be (1981: 133), whilst others have felt that whether temporal parts existed or not is merely a verbal dispute ([[Eli Hirsch]] holds this view).

Gallois surveys some of the attempts to create a more specific definition (Gallois 1998: 256). The early attempts included identifying temporal parts with [[ordered pairs]] of times and objects, but it seems relatively unproblematic that temporal parts exist given the definition and ordered pairs seem unsuitable to play the role that perdurantists demand, such as being parts of persisting wholes—how can a set be a part of a material object? Later perdurantists identified persisting objects with events, and as ''events'' having temporal parts was not problematic (for example, the first and second halves of a football match), it was imagined that persisting ''objects'' could have temporal parts. There was a reluctance from many to ''identify'' objects with events, and this definition has long since fallen out of fashion.

Of the definitions closest to those commonly used in the literature, the earliest was Thomson:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''x'' is a cross-sectional temporal part of ''y'' =&lt;small&gt;df&lt;/small&gt; (∃''T'')[''y'' and ''x'' exist through ''T'' &amp; no part of ''x'' exists outside ''T'' &amp; (∀''t'')(''t'' is in ''T'' ⊃ (∀''P'')(''y'' exactly occupies ''P'' at ''t'' ⊃ ''x'' exactly  occupies ''P'' at ''t''))] (Thomson 1983: 207).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later, Sider tried to combat the fears of endurantists who could not understand what a temporal part is by defining it in terms of "part at a time" or "parthood at a time", a relation that the endurantist should accept, unlike parthood ''simpliciter''—which an endurantist may say makes no sense, given that all parts are had ''at a time''. (However, McDaniel argues that even endurantists should accept that notion [McDaniel (2004) 146-7]). Sider gave the following definition, which is widely used:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''x'' is an ''instantaneous temporal part'' of ''y'' at instant ''t'' =&lt;small&gt;df&lt;/small&gt; (i) ''x'' is a part of ''y''; (ii) ''x'' exists at, but only, at ''t''; and (iii) ''x'' overlaps every part of ''y'' that exists at ''t''. (Sider 2001: 60).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sider also gave an alternative definition that is compatible with [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], using the tensed operators "WILL" and "WAS":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''x'' is an ''instantaneous temporal part'' of ''y'' =&lt;small&gt;df&lt;/small&gt; (i) ''x'' is a part of ''y''; (ii) ''x'' overlaps every part of ''y''; (iii) it is not the case that WILL (''x'' exists); (iv) it is not the case that WAS (''x'' exists). (Sider 2001: 71).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While Sider's definition is most commonly used, Zimmerman—troubled by the demand for ''instants'' (which may not exist in a [[Gunk (mereology)|gunk]]y space-time that is such that every region has a sub-region)—gives the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''x'' is a temporal part of ''y'' throughout ''T'' =&lt;small&gt;df&lt;/small&gt; (i) ''x'' exists during and only during ''T''; (ii) for every subinterval ''T''* of ''T'', there is a ''z'' such that (a) ''z'' is a part of ''x'', and (b) for all ''u'', ''u'' has a part in common with ''z'' during ''T''* if and only if ''u'' has a part in common with ''y'' during ''T''*; and (iii) ''y'' exists at times outside of ''T''. (Zimmerman 1996: 122)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The argument from temporary intrinsics==
Temporal parts are sometimes used to account for change. The problem of change is just that if an object x and an object y have different properties, then by [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Law]], one ought to conclude that they are different. For example, if a person changes from having long hair to short hair, then the temporal-parts theorist can say that change is the difference between the temporal parts of a temporally extended object (the person). So, the person changes by having a temporal part with long hair, and a temporal part with short hair; the temporal parts are different, which is consistent with Leibniz's Law.

However, those who reject the notion that ordinary objects, like people, have temporal parts usually adopt a more common-sense view. They say that an object has properties at times. In this view, the person changes by having long hair at ''t'', to short hair at ''t'''. To them, there is no contradiction in thinking an object is capable of having different properties at different times.

An argument widely held to favor the concept of temporal parts arises from these points (Sider, 2001): [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]]' argument from temporary intrinsics, which he first advanced in ''[[On the Plurality of Worlds]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12236763|title=On the plurality of worlds|last=1941-2001.|first=Lewis, David K. (David Kellogg),|date=1986-01-01|publisher=B. Blackwell|oclc=12236763}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The outline of the argument is as follows:

:P1: There are intrinsic properties, i.e., properties had by an object independently of anything in the world.

:P2: If every property had by an object is had two times, then there are no intrinsic properties.

:C1: Therefore, not every property had by an object is had two times. Objects have some of their properties intrinsically, i.e., ''simpliciter''.

:P3: But only temporal parts can have their properties ''simpliciter''.

:C2: Therefore, there are temporal parts. (For this to follow, it is required that there be objects).

Premise P1 is an intuitive premise; generally we distinguish between properties and relations. An ''intrinsic property'' is just a property that something has independently of anything else; an ''extrinsic property'' is had only in relation to something. An example of an extrinsic property is "fatherhood": something is a father only if that something is a male and has a child. An example of an alleged intrinsic property is "shape".

According to Lewis (Sider, 2001), if we know what "shapes" are, we know them to be properties, not relations. However, if properties are had to times, as endurantists say, then no property is intrinsic. Even if a ball is round throughout its existence, the endurantist must say "for all times in which the ball exists, the ball is round, i.e., it is round at those times; it has the property 'being round at a time'." So, if all properties are had to times, then there are no intrinsic properties, (premise P2).

However, if we think that Lewis is right and some properties are intrinsic, then some properties are not had to times—they are had ''simpliciter'' (premise C1).

It might be said that premise P3 is more controversial. For instance, suppose a timeless world is possible. If that were so, then in that world, even if there were intrinsic properties, they would not be had by temporal parts—since by definition a timeless world has no temporal dimension, and therefore in such a world there cannot be temporal parts. However, our world is ''not'' timeless, and the possibility of timeless worlds is questionable, so it seems reasonable to think that in worlds with a temporal dimension, only temporal parts can have properties ''simpliciter''.

This is so because temporal parts exist only at an instant, and therefore it makes no sense to speak of them as having properties at a time. Temporal parts have properties, and have a temporal location. So if person A changes from having long hair to having short hair, then that can be paraphrased by saying that there is a temporal part of A that has long hair ''simpliciter'' and another that has short hair ''simpliciter'', and the latter is after the former in the temporal sequence; that supports premise P3.

Premise C2 follows, so long as one is not considering empty worlds—if such worlds are even possible. An empty world doesn't have objects that change by having a temporal part with a certain property and another temporal part with a certain other property.

Premise P1, the key premise of the argument, can be coherently denied even if the resulting view—the abandonment of intrinsic properties—is counterintuitive. There are, however, ways to support the argument if one accepts relationalism about space-time.

The American journalist [[H. L. Mencken]] was scathing in his criticism of the book, which he dismissed as an unimportant "foot-note to all existing systems".&lt;ref&gt;[[H. L. Mencken|Mencken, H.

Inwood writes that Vaihinger's theory "involves familiar, though not necessarily insurmountable, difficulties". He finds it open to criticism on the grounds that it involves a covert appeal to a non-pragmatic concept of truth. He also notes that the theory implies that claims about the utility of holding doctrines and even the theory itself are no more than useful fictions.&lt;ref name="Inwoodarticle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Inwood, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8350">"'''The Problem of Social Cost'''" (1960) by [[Ronald Coase]], then a faculty member at the [[University of Virginia]], is an article dealing with the economic problem of [[externalities]]. It draws from a number of English [[legal case]]s and [[statute]]s to illustrate Coase's belief that legal rules are only justified by reference to a [[cost–benefit]] analysis, and that [[nuisance]]s that are often regarded as being the fault of one party are more symmetric conflicts between the interests of the two parties. If there are sufficiently low costs of doing a transaction, legal rules would be irrelevant to the maximization of production.  Because in the real world there are costs of bargaining and information gathering, legal rules are justified to the extent of their ability to allocate rights to the most efficient right-bearer. 

Along with an earlier article, “[[The Nature of the Firm]]”, "The Problem of [[Social Cost]]" was cited by the Nobel committee when Coase was awarded the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 1991. The article is foundational to the field of [[law and economics]], and has become the most frequently cited work in all of legal scholarship.{{sfnp|Merrill|Smith|2017|p=32}}

==Summary==
Coase argued that if we lived in a world without [[transaction costs]], people would bargain with one another to produce the most efficient distribution of resources, regardless of the initial allocation. This is superior to allocation through litigation.&lt;ref name="Alloc"&gt;{{Harv|Coase|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coase used the example of a [[nuisance]] case named ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'', where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]'' (1879) 11 Ch D 852&lt;/ref&gt; Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that the doctor had to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial [[Contract|bargain]] about who moves that reaches the same outcome of productive activity.

However, many welfare-maximizing reallocations are often forgone because of the transaction costs involved in bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Coase|1960|p=IV, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the sweetmaker may have many neighbors who claim "nuisance" — some legitimate and some not, that the firm would have to sort through, and some of those neighbors who do claim nuisance may try to hold out for excessive compensation. In these cases, the transaction costs eat away, and ultimately eclipse, the price signals that would have led to the most efficient distribution of resources.

In cases like these with potentially high transaction costs, the law ought to produce an outcome similar to what would result if the transaction costs were eliminated. Hence courts should be guided by the most [[efficiency (economics)|efficient]] solution.

The ultimate thesis is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Coase|1960|p=V, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Coase|1960|p=VIII, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument forms the basis of the [[Coase Theorem]] as labeled by [[George Stigler]].

==Theoretical challenges==
[[Guido Calabresi]] in his book ''[[The Costs of Accidents]]'' (1970)&lt;ref&gt;''The Cost of Accidents'' (1970), 135–403&lt;/ref&gt; argues that it is still efficient to hold companies liable that produce greater wealth.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite journal |last=Calabresi |first= |authorlink= |year=1968 |title=Transaction Costs, Resource Allocation and Liability Rules—A Comment |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=67–73 [p. 71–73] |doi=10.1086/466644 |url= http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4752&amp;context=fss_papers|accessdate= |quote= |first1=Guido }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the real world, where people cannot negotiate costlessly, there may be collective action problems of those who caused a nuisance, for instance by smoke emissions from a factory to many neighbouring farms, and so getting together to negotiate effectively can be difficult against a single polluter because of coordination problems.  If it is efficient for the farmers to pay the factory to reduce its emissions, some of those farmers may hold off paying their fair share, hoping to get a free ride. The factory may be in a better position to know what measures to take to reduce harm, and can be the cheapest avoider, illustrating Coase's argument.

==Cases and statutes==
Coase uses three main examples in his article to attempt to illustrate his points. The first is a fictional cattle herder and a farmer, but the second is the case ''[[Sturges v Bridgman]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1960) 3 JLE 1, 8-11, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt; and the third is the [[Railway (Fires) Act 1905]].&lt;ref&gt;(1960) 3 JLE 1, 30–34&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from these main examples, the following cases are referred to.

{{Certainty sidebar}}

A '''theory''' is a [[contemplation|contemplative]] and [[reason|rational]] type of [[abstraction|abstract]] or generalizing thinking, or the results of such thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4y4DAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=gRlsPCgq1L&amp;dq=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;pg=PT10#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20theory%20is%20a%20contemplative%20and%20rational%20type%20of%20abstract%20or%20generalizing%20thinking,%20or%20the%20results%20of%20such%20thinking&amp;f=false|title=Human Motivation, Metaphors, Theories, and Research|last=Reviews|first=C.

The word has its roots in [[ancient Greek]], but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings.

Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McMurray|first1=Foster |title=Preface to an Autonomous Discipline of Education |journal=Educational Theory |date=July 1955 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=129–140 |doi = 10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x |accessdate=3 March 2017 |url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1741-5446.1955.tb01131.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}} A theory can be a [[body of knowledge]], which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory [[Conceptual model|models]]. To theorize is to develop this body of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=Gary |title=Education and theory : strangers in paradigms |year=2007 |publisher=Open Univ. Press |location=Maidenhead |isbn=9780335211791 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}}

As already in Aristotle's definitions, theory is very often contrasted to "[[praxis (process)|practice]]" (from Greek ''[[Wiktionary:praxis|praxis]]'', πρᾶξις) a Greek term for ''doing'', which is opposed to theory because pure theory involves no doing apart from itself.{{reference needed|date=October 2018}} A classical example of the distinction between "theoretical" and "practical" uses the discipline of medicine: [[medical theory]] involves trying to understand the [[Causality|causes]] and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy. These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked.{{efn|1= See for example [[Hippocrates]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory Praeceptiones, Part 1].  {{webarchive |url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140912175614/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0251:text=Praec.:section=1&amp;highlight=medical%2Ctheory |date = September 12, 2014 }} }}

In modern [[science]], the term "theory" refers to [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], a well-confirmed type of explanation of [[nature]], made in a way [[Consistency|consistent]] with [[scientific method]], and fulfilling the [[Scientific theory#Characteristics of theories|criteria]] required by [[modern science]]. Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] support for, or empirically contradict ("[[Falsifiability|falsify]]") it. Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schafersman |first=Steven D. |title=An Introduction to Science |url = http://www.geo.sunysb.edu/esp/files/scientific-method.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to more common uses of the word "theory" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word ''[[hypothesis]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Medicine|first1=National Academy of Sciences, Institute of|title=Science, evolution, and creationism|date=2008|publisher=National Academies Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0309105862|page=11|edition=|url=http://nationalacademies.org/evolution/TheoryOrFact.html|accessdate=26 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable [[conjecture]]s, and from [[scientific laws]], which are descriptive accounts of how nature behaves under certain conditions.

== Ancient uses ==
The English word ''theory'' derives from a technical term in [[philosophy]] in [[Classical Greece|Ancient Greek]]. As an everyday word, ''[[theoria]]'', {{lang|grc|θεωρία}}, meant "a looking at, viewing, beholding", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to [[contemplation|contemplative]] or [[speculative reason|speculative]] understandings of [[nature (philosophy)|natural things]], such as those of [[natural philosopher]]s, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans.{{efn|1=The word ''theoria'' occurs in [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]], for example, that of [[Plato]]. It is a statement of how and why particular facts are related. It is related to words for {{lang|grc|θεωρός}} "spectator", {{lang|grc|θέα}} ''thea'' "a view" + {{lang|grc|ὁρᾶν}} ''horan'' "to see", literally "looking at a show". See for example [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=qewr&amp;lang=greek dictionary entries at Perseus website].}} English-speakers have used the word ''theory'' since at least the late [[16th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|theory|accessdate=2008-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern uses of the word ''theory'' derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and [[reason|rational]] explanation of the general [[nature (philosophy)|nature]] of things.

Although it has more mundane meanings in Greek, the word {{lang|grc|θεωρία}} apparently developed special uses early in the recorded history of the [[Greek language]]. In the book ''From Religion to Philosophy'', [[F. M. Cornford|Francis Cornford]] suggests that the [[Orphics]] used the word ''theoria'' to mean "passionate sympathetic contemplation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From religion to philosophy: a study in the origins of western speculation |last=Cornford |first=Francis Macdonald |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=November 8, 1991 |isbn=978-0-691-02076-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pythagoras]] changed the word to mean a passionate sympathetic contemplation of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence. Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory. Thus, it was Pythagoras who gave the word ''theory'' the specific meaning that led to the classical and modern concept of a distinction between theory (as uninvolved, neutral thinking) and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Bertrand Russell |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|History of Western Philosophy]] |year=1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle's terminology, as already mentioned, contrasts theory with ''praxis'' or practice, and this contrast remains today. For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different. Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as [[nature (philosophy)|nature]], so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create. On the other hand, ''praxis'' involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends. Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of ''praxis'' or doing.{{efn|1= 
The [[A Greek–English Lexicon|LSJ]] cites two passages of Aristotle as examples, both from the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and involving the definition of [[natural science]]: [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D11%3Asection%3D1064a 11.1064a17], "it is clear that natural science (φυσικὴν ἐπιστήμην) must be neither practical (πρακτικὴν) nor productive (ποιητικὴν), but speculative (θεωρητικὴν)" and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0052%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D1025b 6.1025b25], "Thus if every intellectual activity [διάνοια] is either practical or productive or speculative (θεωρητική), physics (φυσικὴ) will be a speculative [θεωρητική] science." So Aristotle actually made a three way distinction between practical, theoretical and productive or technical—or between doing, contemplating or making. All three types involve thinking, but are distinguished by what causes the objects of thought to move or change.}}

== Theories formally and scientifically ==
{{Main|Theory (mathematical logic)}}
Theories are [[analysis|analytical]] tools for [[understanding]], [[explanation|explaining]], and making [[prediction]]s about a given subject matter. There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the [[art]]s and [[science]]s. A formal theory is [[syntax (logic)|syntactic]] in nature and is only meaningful when given a [[semantics|semantic]] component by applying it to some content (e.g., [[fact]]s and relationships of the actual historical world as it is unfolding). Theories in various fields of study are expressed in [[natural language]], but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the [[formal language]] of [[mathematical logic]]. Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of [[reason|rational thought]] or [[logic]].

Theory is constructed of a set of [[sentence (linguistics)|sentences]] that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration. However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory. Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another. This is, in ordinary language, where statements such as "He is a terrible person" cannot be judged as true or false without reference to some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of who "He" is and for that matter what a "terrible person" is under the theory.&lt;ref name="curry"&gt;Curry, Haskell, ''Foundations of Mathematical Logic''&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes two theories have exactly the same [[explanatory power]] because they make the same predictions. A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or [[observational equivalence|observationally equivalent]], and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference.

The [[metatheory|form of theories]] is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in [[model theory]]. When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are [[closure (mathematics)|closed]] under application of certain procedures called [[rules of inference]]. A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of [[axioms]] (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference. A [[theorem]] is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference. Theories used in applications are [[abstraction]]s of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems. Obvious examples include [[arithmetic]] (abstracting concepts of number), [[geometry]] (concepts of space), and [[probability]] (concepts of randomness and likelihood).

[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] shows that no consistent, [[recursively enumerable]] theory (that is, one whose theorems form a recursively enumerable set) in which the concept of [[natural numbers]] can be expressed, can include all [[truth|true]] statements about them. As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories. (Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.) This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge.

===Underdetermination===
{{Main|Underdetermination}}
A theory is ''underdetermined'' (also called ''indeterminacy of data to theory'') if a rival, inconsistent theory is at least as consistent with the evidence. Underdetermination is an [[epistemology|epistemological]] issue about the relation of [[evidence]] to conclusions.

A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a [[hypothesis]].

===Intertheoretic reduction and elimination===
{{Main|Intertheoretic reduction}}
If a new theory better explains and predicts a phenomenon than an old theory (i.e., it has more [[explanatory power]]), we are [[Theory of justification|justified]] in believing that the newer theory describes reality more correctly. This is called an ''intertheoretic reduction'' because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one. For instance, our historical understanding about ''sound'', "light" and ''heat'' have been reduced to ''wave compressions and rarefactions'', ''electromagnetic waves'', and ''molecular kinetic energy'', respectively. These terms, which are identified with each other, are called ''intertheoretic identities.'' When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely.

When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an ''intertheoretic elimination.'' For instance, the [[superseded scientific theories|obsolete scientific theory]] that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of [[caloric fluid]] was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it. Also, the theory that [[phlogiston]] is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen.

===Theories vs. theorems===
Theories are distinct from [[theorem]]s. A ''theorem'' is [[formal proof|derived]] deductively from [[axiom]]s (basic assumptions) according to a [[formal system]] of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms. ''Theories'' are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world. They are '[[rigor]]ously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation. Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made. An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.

==Scientific theories==
{{Main|Scientific theory}}
In science, the term "theory" refers to "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been [[Reproducibility|repeatedly confirmed]] through [[observation]] and [[experiment]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6024&amp;page=2 National Academy of Sciences], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/news/press_room/evolution/qanda.shtml AAAS Evolution Resources]&lt;/ref&gt; Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources ([[consilience]]).

The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] with respect to those phenomena. Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge. Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing [[technology]] or curing [[disease]].

===Definitions from scientific organizations===
The [[United States National Academy of Sciences]] defines scientific theories as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The formal scientific definition of "theory" is quite different from the everyday meaning of the word. It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.  Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially. For example, no new evidence will demonstrate that the Earth does not orbit around the sun (heliocentric theory), or that living things are not made of cells (cell theory), that matter is not composed of atoms, or that the surface of the Earth is not divided into solid plates that have moved over geological timescales (the theory of plate tectonics)...One of the most useful properties of scientific theories is that they can be used to make predictions about natural events or phenomena that have not yet been observed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11876&amp;page=11 National Academy of Sciences] (2008), ''Science, Evolution, and Creationism.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world, based on a body of facts that have been repeatedly confirmed through observation and experiment. Such fact-supported theories are not "guesses" but reliable accounts of the real world. The theory of biological evolution is more than "just a theory." It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease. Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress. But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact.&lt;ref name="AAAS Evolution Resources"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Note that the term ''theory'' would not be appropriate for describing untested but intricate hypotheses or even [[Scientific modelling|scientific models.]]

=== Philosophical views===
The [[logical positivist]]s thought of scientific theories as ''deductive theories''—that a theory's content is based on some [[formal system|formal system of logic]] and on basic [[axioms]]. In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a [[logical consequence]] of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory.&lt;ref name="curry"/&gt; This is called the [[received view of theories]].

In the [[semantic view of theories]],  which has largely replaced the received view,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Suppe |first1=Frederick |year=1998 |title=Understanding Scientific Theories: An Assessment of Developments, 1969-1998 |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=67 |pages=S102–S115 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/Suppe_2000.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/392812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Halvorson |first1=Hans |year=2012 |title=What Scientific Theories Could Not Be |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=183–206 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~hhalvors/teaching/phi520_f2012/halvorson2012.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2013 |doi=10.1086/664745}}&lt;/ref&gt; theories are viewed as [[scientific models]]. A [[Scientific model|model]] is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a "model of reality"), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country. In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria. (See [[Scientific theory#Theories as models|Theories as models]] for further discussion.)

===In physics===
In [[physics]] the term ''theory'' is generally used for a mathematical framework—derived from a small set of basic [[postulates]] (usually symmetries, like equality of locations in space or in time, or identity of electrons, etc.)—which is capable of producing experimental predictions for a given category of physical systems. One good example is [[classical electromagnetism]], which encompasses results derived from [[gauge symmetry]] (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called [[Maxwell's equations]]. The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed "laws of electromagnetism", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them. Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations. Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested.

=== Regarding the term ''theoretical'' ===
Acceptance of a theory does not require that all of its major predictions be tested{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, if it is already supported by sufficiently strong evidence. For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult. As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term "theoretical." These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/21457-what-is-a-law-in-science-definition-of-scientific-law.html|title=What Is a Law in Science?|accessdate=January 1, 2017|work=Live Science |first=Alina|last=Bradford|date=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical theories ==
{{Main|Philosophical theory}}
A theory can be either ''descriptive'' as in science, or ''prescriptive'' ([[normative ethics|normative]]) as in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kneller|first1=George Frederick|title=Introduction to the philosophy of education|date=1964|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OQhAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:UOM39015026974538|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of [[idea]]s. At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through [[empiricism|empirical observation]].

A field of study is sometimes named a "theory" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject. These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field. Some commonly known examples include [[set theory]] and [[number theory]]; however [[literary theory]], [[critical theory]], and [[music theory]] are also of the same form.

=== Metatheory ===
{{Main|Metatheory}}
One form of philosophical theory is a ''metatheory'' or ''meta-theory''. A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories. In other words, it is a theory about theories. [[Statement (logic)|Statements]] made in the metatheory about the theory are called [[metatheorem]]s.

== Political theories ==
{{Main|Political theory}}
A political theory is an [[ethics|ethical]] theory about the law and government. Often the term "political theory" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about [[politics]].

== Jurisprudential theories ==
{{Main|Jurisprudence|Law}}
In social science, [[jurisprudence]] is the philosophical theory of law. Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution.

}}'''Tiantong Zongjue''' ({{zh|s=天童宗珏|w=}}; {{CJKV|j=Tendō Sōkaku}}), was a Chinese [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Song Dynasty]]. He was born in [[Hezhou]], but left home to practice Buddhism at the age of sixteen. His ordination took place two years later. [[Zuzhao Daohe]] of the [[The Five Houses of Chán|Yunmen School]] was his first teacher. However, Daohe retired and was replaced by [[Zhenxie Qingliao]] of the [[Caodong]]/[[Sōtō]] School, who became the teacher that gave Zongjue [[dharma transmission]]. In 1132, Zongjue became the [[abbot]] of Yuelin Temple where he served for 23 years. After this period, his abbacy switched to Mt. Xuedou. He remained there for four years before becoming the abbot of Tiantong Monastery near the modern city of [[Ningbo]] in 1159.&lt;ref name=Fer&gt;{{citation|last=Ferguson|first=Andrew E.|title=Zen's Chinese heritage: the masters and their teachings|year=2000|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|438}} He was replacing the former abbot, the famous [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]], who died there in 1157.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from this final temple, where Zongjue died in 1162, that he took his name.&lt;ref name=Fer/&gt;{{rp|438}} Tiantong temple was the same monastery where [[Eihei Dogen]] studied under [[Tiantong Rujing]] before bringing the teaching back to [[Japan]] and founding the [[Sōtō|Sōtō School]].&lt;ref name=Fer/&gt;{{rp|454}}

'''Timbuktu Manuscripts''' (or '''Tombouctou Manuscripts''') is a blanket term for the large number of historically important manuscripts that have been preserved for centuries in private households in [[Timbuktu]], [[Mali]]. The collections include manuscripts about art, medicine, philosophy, and science, as well as copies of the [[Quran]]. The number of manuscripts in the collections has been estimated as high as 700,000.&lt;ref name="ngn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reclaiming the Ancient Manuscripts of Timbuktu|journal=National Geographic News|last=Rainier|first=Chris|date=May 27, 2003|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/05/0522_030527_timbuktu.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscripts were written in [[Arabic]] and local languages like [[Songhay languages|Songhay]] and [[Tuareg languages|Tamasheq]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/world/africa/07mali.html?pagewanted=all]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129103027/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/world/africa/07mali.html?pagewanted=all |date=January 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dates of the manuscripts ranged between the late 13th and the early 20th centuries (i.e., from the Islamisation of the [[Mali Empire]] until the decline of traditional education in [[French Sudan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tombouctoumanuscripts.org/about/project/ |title=Project – Tombouctou Manuscripts Project |publisher=Tombouctoumanuscripts.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their subject matter ranged from scholarly works to short letters. The manuscripts were passed down in Timbuktu families and were mostly in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;"Towards an omnilingual word retrieval system for ancient manuscripts". ''Pattern Recognition'' Volume 42, Issue 9, September 2009, Pages 2089–2105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the manuscripts remain unstudied and uncatalogued, and their total number is unknown, affording only rough estimates. A selection of about 160 manuscripts from the Mamma Haidara Library in Timbuktu and the Ahmed Baba collection were digitized by the ''Tombouctou Manuscripts Project'' in the 2000s.

With the demise of Arabic education in Mali under French colonial rule, appreciation for the medieval manuscripts declined in Timbuktu, and many were being sold off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uir.unisa.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10500/3686/fundamina%20goolam%20nuut%20Rena.pdf?sequence=1 |format=PDF |title=THE TIMBUKTU MANUSCRIPTS – REDISCOVERING A WRITTEN SOURCE OF AFRICAN LAW IN THE ERA OF THE  AFRICAN RENAISSANCE |publisher=Uir.unisa.ac.za |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine related the account of an [[imam]] who picked up four of them for $50 each. In October 2008 one of the households was flooded, destroying 700 manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Walt&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walt|first1=Vivienne|title=Lost Treasures of Timbuktu|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1924486,00.html|accessdate=4 March 2015|work=Time|date=September 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Digitizing ancient documents.jpg|thumb|left|Digitizing ancient documents at the Ahmed Baba Institute of Higher Learning and Islamic Research, 2007]]
In 1970, [[UNESCO]] founded an organization which included among its tasks preservation of the manuscripts, but it went unfunded until 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sum.uio.no/research/mali/timbuktu/cedrab/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725060040/http://www.sum.uio.no/research/mali/timbuktu/cedrab/index.html |date=July 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Harvard University professor [[Henry Louis Gates]] visited Timbuktu for his [[PBS]] series ''Wonders of the African World''. The series raised public and academic awareness of the manuscripts, which led to a pool of funding opening up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.loc.gov/intldl/malihtml/about.html |title=Islamic Manuscripts from Mali - About the Collection - (Global Gateway from the Library of Congress) |publisher=International.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Timbuktu Manuscripts Project'' was a project of the [[University of Oslo]] running from 1999 - 2007, the goal of which was to assist in physically preserving the manuscripts, digitize them and building an electronic catalogue, and making them accessible for research.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.sum.uio.no/timbuktu/ |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010024917/http://www.sum.uio.no/timbuktu/ |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |title=Libraries of Timbuktu }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the government of [[Luxembourg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17480&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715204006/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=17480&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-15 |title=Timbuktu Manuscripts Project Continues with Preservation Study Tours |publisher=Portal.unesco.org |date=2004-11-13 |accessdate=2015-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the [[Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation]] (NORAD), the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Norwegian Council for Higher Education's Programme for Development Research and Education]] (NUFU), and the United States' [[Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation]]. Among the results of the project are: reviving the ancient art of [[bookbinding]] and training a solid number of local specialists; devising and setting up an electronic database to catalogue the manuscripts held at the Institut des Hautes Études et de Recherche Islamique – Ahmad Baba (IHERI-AB); digitizing a large number of manuscripts held at the IHERIAB; facilitating scholarly and technical exchange with manuscript experts in Morocco and other countries;&lt;ref&gt;''Les Chemins du Savoir / Masālik al-Maʿrifa: Manuscrits de Tombouctou: patrimoine partagé / al-turāth al-mushtarak min khilāl makhṭūṭāt Tinbuktū''.

Since the end of this project, the cooperation of [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg|Grand-Duché]] de Luxembourg has funded a new project called ''Timbuktu Manuscripts''. This project aims at protecting and promoting Timbuktu Manuscripts, for economic, social and cultural development of the area. It is implemented by the [[Lux-Development]] agency and the goals are:

#a better conservation of the manuscripts (100 listed manuscripts, 10 described manuscripts, 2 digitalized manuscripts, 10 restored and protected manuscripts)
#a better scientific utilisation of the manuscripts
#use of manuscripts to promote economic, social and cultural development of the area

Since the events in the [[Northern Mali Conflict|North of Mali in 2012]], the project MLI/015 works with its main partners in [[Bamako]] on result 1. These key partners are the IHERI-AB ([[Ahmed Baba Institute|Institut des Hautes Etudes et de Recherche Islamique Ahmed Baba]]) and the SAVAMA DCI ([[Association de Sauvegarde et de Mise en Valeur des Manuscrits et de Défense de la Culture Islamique]]). Beginning of 2013, they had completed an important work of describing 10,000 manuscripts through standardized registration forms.

The ''Timbuktu Manuscripts Project'' is a separate project run by the [[University of Cape Town]]. In a partnership with the [[government of South Africa]], which contributed to the Timbuktu trust fund, this project is the first official cultural project of the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]]. It was founded in 2003 and is ongoing. They released a report on the project in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajol.info/index.php/tvl/article/view/29826 |title=Towards a conceptualization of the study of Africa's indigenous manuscript heritage and tradition &amp;#124; Minicka &amp;#124; Tydskrif vir letterkunde |publisher=Ajol.info |date=2008-03-05 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as preserving the manuscripts, the Cape Town project also aims to make access to public and private libraries around Timbuktu more widely available.  The project's online database is accessible to researchers only. In 2015 it was announced that the Timbuktu trust fund would close after receiving no more funds from the South African government.&lt;ref name="tl_sand"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/politics/2015/01/01/sands-of-indifference-bury-mbeki-s-timbuktu-dream | title=Sands of indifference bury Mbeki's Timbuktu dream | publisher=Times Live | accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book about Timbuktu, published in 2008, contains a chapter with some discussions of a few of the texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Jeppie|first1=Shamil|last2=Diagne|first2=Souleymane Bachir|title=The Meanings of Timbukt|date=2008|publisher=[[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)|HSRC]]|location=Cape Town|isbn=978-0-7969-2204-5|url=http://www.hsrcpress.ac.za/product.php?productid=2216&amp;freedownload=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Digital images of thirty-two manuscripts from the private Mamma Haïdara Library are available from the [[United States Library of Congress]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.loc.gov/intldl/malihtml/malihome.html |title=Islamic Manuscripts from Mali Collection: Home |publisher=International.loc.gov |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subset of these are also accessible from the United Nations' [[World Digital Library]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/search/gallery?ql=eng&amp;ct=Tombouctou |title=Letter to the warring Tribes |publisher=Wdl.org |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journalistic coverage==
A movie about the Timbuktu Manuscript Project, ''The Ancient Astronomers of Timbuktu'', was released in 2009, with funding from the [[Ford Foundation]] and [[Harry Oppenheimer Fellowship Award|Oppenheimer Memorial Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribesoftimbuktu.com/index.php |accessdate=January 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502022947/http://www.scribesoftimbuktu.com/index.php |archivedate=May 2, 2010 |title=The Ancient Astronomers of Timbuktu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, the French/German cultural TV channel [[Arte|ARTE]] produced a feature-length film about Timbuktu's manuscript heritage: [https://web.archive.org/web/20090912151942/http://www.arte.tv/fr/semaine/244,broadcastingNum=1016150,day=5,week=38,year=2009.html ''Tombouctou: les manuscrits sauvés des sables | Timbuktus verschollenes Erbe: vom Sande verweht''],&lt;ref&gt;directed by Lutz Gregor / Gruppe 5. The full film can be viewed online: [http://www.lutz-gregor.com/filmseiten/timbuktus-verschollenes-erbe-teil-1-2009/ Part 1] | [http://www.lutz-gregor.com/filmseiten/timbuktus-verschollenes-erbe-teil-2-2009/ Part 2] | [http://www.lutz-gregor.com/filmseiten/timbuktus-verschollenes-erbe-teil-3-2009/ Part 3].&lt;/ref&gt;
Another film on the subject was also released in 2009, entitled "Manuscripts of Timbuktu. The film was made by South African director [[Zola Maseko]], executive produced by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] and distributed by [[California Newsreel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsreel.org/video/THE-MANUSCRIPTS-OF-TIMBUKTU |title=California Newsreel - THE MANUSCRIPTS OF TIMBUKTU |publisher=Newsreel.org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BBC Four has produced a documentary called "The Lost Libraries of Timbuktu."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hkb0z|title=The Lost Libraries of Timbuktu|publisher=BBC4|date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}} Although unavailable at BBC, the movie is available at others online video platforms, as [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVmHqIyVf4s "Youtube"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a book about the manuscripts and the efforts to save them in the midst of the assault and occupation of northern Mali by Islamists jihadis, was published. The book, ''The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu" by [[Joshua Hammer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.simonandschuster.com/The-Bad-Ass-Librarians-of-Timbuktu/Joshua-Hammer/9781476777405|title=The Bad-Ass Librarians of Timbuktu|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|date=2016-04-19|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781476777405|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides vivid details about the collection of the manuscripts into libraries, and subsequent efforts to remove them to safety during the dangerous conflict, in which the Islamist jihadis threatened to destroy them.

In 2017, Charlie English published ''The Storied City : The Quest for Timbuktu and the Fantastic Mission to Save Its Past'' which tells in alternating chapters the history of European expeditions (1795 – 1860) in  search of the mystical city and the Herculean rescue efforts undertaken by Haidara and others to save the manuscripts from destruction by the jihadis (2012).

Many of the manuscripts were reported destroyed in January 2013, along with many other monuments of medieval Islamic culture in Timbuktu, by the Islamist rebels of [[Ansar Dine]] in the [[Northern Mali conflict (2012–present)|Northern Mali conflict]].&lt;ref name=Harding&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/28/mali-timbuktu-library-ancient-manuscripts |title=Timbuktu mayor: Mali rebels torched library of historic manuscripts |date=January 28, 2013 |accessdate=January 28, 2013 |last=Harding |first=Luke |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ahmed Baba Institute]] and a library, both containing thousands of manuscripts, were said to have been burnt as the Islamists retreated from Timbuktu.&lt;ref name=Harding/&gt; Journalists, however, found that at least one of the libraries was largely undamaged, and that only a few small piles of ash were present, suggesting that at least some of the documents survived.

[[Aboubacry Moussa Lam]] was a signatory to an appeal to preserve the Timbuktu Manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Timbuktu Manuscripts in DANGER! |url=http://www.bu.edu/wara/timbuktu/ |website=West African Research Association |publisher=Boston University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former Malian presidential aide, as well as several other people involved with preserving the manuscripts, said that the documents had been evacuated into a safe location in 2012 before the fighters invaded Timbuktu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walt |first=Vivienne |url=http://world.time.com/2013/01/28/mali-timbuktu-locals-saved-some-of-their-citys-ancient-manuscripts-from-islamists/ |title=Mali: Timbuktu’s Ancient Manuscripts Are Safe, Preservationists Say &amp;#124; TIME.com |publisher=World.time.com |date=2013-01-28 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  U.S. based book preservation expert Stephanie Diakité and Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara,&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-librarian-who-saved-timbuktus-cultural-treasures-from-al-qaeda-1460729998 |title=The Librarian who saved Timbuktu’s cultural treasures from Al Qaeda |date=April 15, 2016 |accessdate=August 14, 2016 |last=Hammer |first=Joshua |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; curator of one of the most important libraries of Timbuktu, a position handed down in his family for generations, organized the evacuation of the manuscripts to Bamako in the south of Mali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/28/world/africa/timbuktu-manuscripts/index.html |title=Saved from Islamists, Timbuktu's manuscripts face new threat - CNN.com |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2013-05-28 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timbuktu has a long tradition of celebrating and honoring family manuscript collections. It is traditional for a family member to “swear publicly that he will protect the library for as long as he lives.” &lt;ref name="Yochi Dreazen 2013"&gt;Yochi Dreazen, “The Brazen Bibliophiles of Timbuktu: How a Team of Sneaky Librarians Duped Al Qaeda and Saved Some of the Ancient World’s Greatest Artifacts,” The New Republic (April 2013), 34.&lt;/ref&gt; During the evacuation process, Haidara relied on local families to hide the Ahmed Baba Institute’s manuscript collection in their homes before the texts were ultimately transported to Bamako.&lt;ref name="Yochi Dreazen 2013"/&gt; The evacuation was supported by international organizations, such as the [[Prince Claus Fund]] for Culture and Development, whose initial commitment was followed by financial support from other organisations such as the [[Doen Foundation]] and [[Ford Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.princeclausfund.org/en/activities/more-than-95-of-the-manuscripts-evacuated-from-timbuktu-in-time.html |title= More than 95% of the manuscripts evacuated from timbuktu in time - Prince Claus Fund |publisher=|date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel Kader thanked SAVAMA-DCI and their partners in a letter for enabling the evacuation of the manuscripts to the cities in the south of the country and supporting their storage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://t160k.org/letter-from-abdel-kader-haidara/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627221305/http://t160k.org/letter-from-abdel-kader-haidara/ |date=June 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Timbuktu-139084.jpg|thumb|Manuscripts of the Ahmed Baba Centre]]
However, once in the south the manuscripts faced new dangers: mold and humidity. Stephanie Diakité and Dr. Abdel Kader Haidara began a campaign to raise money for the preservation of the books including a [[crowd-funding]] campaign  called "Timbuktu Libraries in Exile,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=y |url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/timbuktu-libraries-in-exile |title=Timbuktu Libraries in Exile |publisher=Indiegogo |date=2013-06-20 |accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is currently hosted by the crowdfunding site [https://t160k.org/campaign/libraries-in-exile/ T160K.org]. Whereas many institutions have provided funding, equipment and/or training, the leading role in all  the  proceedings  is  played  by  the  local  people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russo |first= Maria Luisa|date= January 2017 |title=Contemporary librarianship and special collections issues: a case study in manuscript collections of Timbuktu and other Malian cities |url=http://leo.cineca.it/index.php/jlis/article/view/12136 |journal= JLIS.it|volume=8 |issue=1 |pages= 39–49|doi=10.4403/jlis.it-12136 |access-date=2017-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vladimir Semionovich Spirin''' ([[Russian (language)|Russian]]: Владимир Семёнович Спирин) (born May 5, 1929 - died May 17, 2002) was a [[Russia]]n [[philologist]], [[sinologist]], [[historian]], lecturer of [[Saint Petersburg State University]], researcher at [[Saint Petersburg]]'s branch of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], [[Saint Petersburg]] [[Russia]], [[Candidate of Sciences]] (equiv. [[Ph.D.]]). His primary scientific interests resided in the field of classical [[Chinese philology]] and [[Chinese philosophy]].

== Biography ==
Dr. Spirin graduated in 1952 from the East Asian Studies Department at the [[Saint Petersburg State University]] and started to work as a researcher at [[Saint Petersburg]]'s (then [[Leningrad]]) branch of the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences]], where he worked until his death. Since 1957, he had been a member of the research group that worked on description of [[Dunhuang manuscript]]s, preserved in Russia (other members were Dr. Lev Menshikov, S.A. Schcolyar, etc.) In the 1960s, during the time of the Cultural Revolution, he conducted studies in China for nine months. He defended his doctoral thesis (Candidate of Sciences, Philosophy) in 1970, under the title of "On Methodological Problems of Studying the Classic Chinese Philosophy: In Relation to the Analysis of Text Structures". Since 1977 and until 1990s, he taught the Classic Chinese Philosophy to philosophy students at the [[Saint Petersburg State University]], as an invited lecturer.

His main area of research had been methodological problems of studying classic Chinese texts. He developed an original structural approach to the texts, and discovered various types of textological structures in the classic Chinese culture. His method of graphic description of textual structures, providing simplicity and easy visualization, according to some researchers, reminds graphic methods of logical description such as Lambert's lines or Eiler's circles, as well as the implementation of graphic description in thermodynamics by Clapeyron. Spirin's work strongly influenced the study of Chinese culture in Russia, especially the younger generation of sinologists, working in Moscow (based in [[Leningrad]] he was not in permanent direct contact with these researchers). For example, according to A. Kobzev, Spirin's structural semiotic approach was intensively used by A.Karapetiantz. Spirin also influenced such Russian researchers as A.Kobzev, A.Krushinsky, M.Isayeva, V.Dorofeeva-Lichtman, etc.

Craig joined the faculty of [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]] in 1980, where he taught philosophy of religion for the next seven years. In 1982 Craig received an invitation to debate [[Kai Nielsen (philosopher)|Kai Nielsen]] at the [[University of Calgary]], Canada, on the question of [[God's existence]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and has since then debated many philosophers, scientists, and biblical scholars.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |last=Stafforini |first=Pablo |date=August 18, 2016 |title=William Lane Craig: A Complete List of Debates |url=http://www.stafforini.com/blog/william-lane-craig-a-complete-list-of-debates/ |dead-url=no |website=Pablo's Miscellany |publisher=Pablo Stafforini |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611042017/http://www.stafforini.com/blog/william-lane-craig-a-complete-list-of-debates/ |archive-date=June 11, 2017 |access-date=October 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a one-year stint at [[Westmont College]]&lt;ref name="rf-cv"/&gt; on the outskirts of [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], Craig moved in 1987 with his wife and two young children back to Europe,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} where he pursued research for the next seven years as a visiting scholar at the [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] ([[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]]) in Belgium.{{sfn|Robinson|Baggett|2016|p=212}} Out of that period of research issued seven books, among them ''God, Time, and Eternity'' (2001).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1994, Craig joined the Department of Philosophy and Ethics at [[Talbot School of Theology]] in suburban [[Los Angeles]] as a [[Research Professor]] of Philosophy, a position he currently{{as of when|date=September 2018}} holds,&lt;ref name="Faculty Profile"/&gt; and he went on to become a Professor of Philosophy at [[Houston Baptist University]] in 2014.

==Research==

===Kalam cosmological argument===
{{see also|Kalam cosmological argument}}
Craig has worked extensively on a version of the [[cosmological argument]] called the ''[[Kalam cosmological argument]]''.{{sfnm |1a1=Cowan |1a2=Spiegel |1y=2009 |1pp=268–269&lt;!-- "The Kalam argument originated with Arabic philosophers in the Middle Ages but has recently been taken up by Christian philosophers, especially William Lane Craig and J.P. Moreland." --&gt; |2a1=Jackson |2y=2014 |2p=19&lt;!-- "One person who has studied the kalam cosmological argument extensively is the modern philosopher William L. Craig (1949–)" --&gt; |3a1=Peterson |3a2=Hasker |3a3=Reichenbach |3a4=Basinger |3y=2013 |3pp=86–89 |4a1=Reichenbach |4y=2017&lt;!-- "[The Kalām cosmological argument] has a venerable history, especially in the Islamic ''mutakalliman'' tradition. Although it had numerous defenders through the centuries, it received new life in the recent voluminous writings of William Lane Craig." --&gt; |5a1=Williams |5y=2013 |5p=89&lt;!-- "William Lane Craig has revived the kalam argument in the late 20th century, discussing it in the light of modern scientific cosmology." --&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Who's Who: Modern Authors: William Lane Craig (Entry 2) |url=http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/whos-who/modern-authors/william-lane-craig/ |website=Philosophy of Religion.info |access-date=16 October 2016&lt;!--|quote=Craig is best known for his extensive work on the kalam cosmological argument, and has also published material on the philosophy of time and on divine foreknowledge.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Kalam'' has a venerable history in [[medieval]] [[Islamic]] philosophy, Craig updated the argument to interact with contemporary scientific and philosophical developments.{{whose quote}} Craig's research resulted in renewed contemporary interest in the argument, and in cosmological arguments in general; the philosopher [[Quentin Smith]] states: "a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig's defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher’s contemporary formulation of an argument for God's existence."{{sfn|Smith|2007|p=183}}

Craig formulates his ''Kalām Cosmological Argument'' in the following manner:
# Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence.
# The universe began to exist.
# Therefore, the universe has a cause of its existence.&lt;ref&gt;Craig outlines this argument and seven others for the existence of God in {{cite magazine |last=Craig |first=William Lane |year=2013 |title=Does God Exist? |url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/99/Does_God_Exist |magazine=Philosophy Now |issue=99 |location=London |issn=0961-5970 |access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his later literature, Craig sometimes uses a more modest version of the first premise, in order to bypass certain issues:
# If the universe began to exist, then the universe has a cause of its beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=The ''Kalam'' Cosmological Argument |url=https://www.reasonablefaith.org/writings/popular-writings/existence-nature-of-god/the-kalam-cosmological-argument/ |website=Reasonable Faith |access-date=September 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophically, Craig uses two traditional arguments to show that [[temporal finitism|time is finite]]: he argues that the existence of an [[actual infinite]] is [[metaphysical possibility|metaphysically impossible]], and that forming an actual infinite through successive addition is metaphysically impossible.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|p=103}}

Granting the strict logical consistency of [[Georg Cantor|post-Cantorian]], [[axiomatic set theory|axiomatized infinite set theory]], Craig concludes that the existence of an actually infinite number of things is metaphysically impossible due to the consequential absurdities that arise.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|pp=106–107}} Craig illustrates this point using the example of [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]. In Hilbert's hypothetical fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms, one can add an additional guest in room #1 by moving the guest in room #1 to room #2, the guest in room #2 into room #3, the guest in room #3 into room #4 and continue the shifting of rooms out to infinity. Craig points out that it is absurd to add an additional guest to a fully occupied hotel and the absurd result that the hotel has the same number of guests, infinity, both before after adding the additional guest.{{sfn|Oppy|1995}} Stating that the mathematical conventions stipulated to ensure the logical consistency of this type of [[transfinite arithmetic]] have no [[ontology|ontological]] force, Craig concludes that finitism is most plausibly true, which means that the series of past events in the universe must be finite, so it must have had a beginning.{{sfn|Reichenbach|2013}}

Craig says that just as it is impossible, despite the proponents of "[[supertask|super-tasks]]", to count to infinity, so it is metaphysically impossible to count down from infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=May 17, 2009 |title=Pruss on Forming an Actual Infinite by Successive Addition |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/pruss-on-forming-an-actual-infinite-by-successive-addition |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806091418/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/pruss-on-forming-an-actual-infinite-by-successive-addition |archive-date=May 18, 2009 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig says that an inversion of the story of [[Tristram Shandy]] is a counter-intuitive absurdity that could result from the formation of an actual infinite. Craig claims that if the universe were eternal, an infinite number of events would have occurred before the present moment, which he says is impossible.{{sfn|Craig|1979}}

One of Craig's contributions to the kalam cosmological argument is his reference to [[astrophysics]] in support of the universe's beginning, namely the [[expansion of the universe]] and [[thermodynamics]].{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|p=125}}

Craig says that the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] [[Big Bang]] model predicts a [[cosmic singularity]], which marks the origin of the universe in the finite past.{{sfn|Craig|1992}} Craig says that competing models which do not imply an origin of the universe have either proved to be untenable (such as the [[steady state model]] and [[vacuum fluctuation]] models) or implied the beginning of the universe they were designed to avoid ([[oscillating universe|oscillating models]], [[inflationary model]]s, [[quantum gravity|quantum gravity models]]). Craig says that the Borde-[[Alan Guth|Guth]]-[[Alexander Vilenkin|Vilenkin]] theorem of 2003 requires that any universe which has on average been in a state of [[cosmic expansion]] cannot be [[eternity|eternal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Jacqueline |date=May 29, 2012 |title=In the Beginning Was the Beginning |url=http://now.tufts.edu/articles/beginning-was-beginning |website=Tufts Now |location=Medford, Massachusetts |publisher=Tufts University |access-date=May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig believes that recent discoveries about the expansion of the universe and [[relativity theory]] support his view that thermodynamic properties of the universe show it is not eternal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Existence of God Part 11 |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s4-11 |website=Defenders Podcast |publisher=Reasonable Faith |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=The End of the World |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-end-of-the-world |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231023/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-end-of-the-world |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig says that postulating a [[multiverse]] of worlds in varying thermodynamic states encounters the problem of [[Boltzmann brains]]—that it becomes highly probable for any observer that the universe is only an illusion of his own brain, a [[solipsism|solipsistic]] conclusion Craig says no [[rational]] person would embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=September 30, 2012 |title=Invasion of the Boltzmann Brains|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/invasion-of-the-boltzmann-brains |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806180622/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/invasion-of-the-boltzmann-brains |archive-date=August 6, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on these arguments, Craig concludes that the premise that the universe began to exist is more [[plausibility|plausible]] than not, and conjoined with premise 1, the beginning of the universe implies the existence of a cause. Craig claims that, due to its nature, the cause must be an uncaused, beginningless, changeless, timeless, spaceless, [[matter|immaterial]] being of enormous power, which he refers to as [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=Must the Beginning of the Universe Have a Personal Cause? |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231439/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/must-the-beginning-of-the-universe-have-a-personal-cause-a-rejoinder |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine omniscience===
One of the central questions raised by the classical doctrine of [[omniscience|divine omniscience]] is the compatibility of divine foreknowledge and [[free will]]:
# If God foreknows the occurrence of some event E, does E happen necessarily?{{sfn|Craig|1990}}
# If some event E is contingent, how can God foreknow E's occurrence?{{sfn|Viney|1989}}
 
According to Craig, the first question raises the issue of [[theological fatalism]]. He attempts to reduce this problem to the problem of logical fatalism, which holds that if it is true that E will happen, then E will happen necessarily. He challenges theological fatalists to show how the addition of God's knowing some future-tense statement to be true adds anything essential to the problem over and above that statement's being true.{{sfn|Zagzebski|2011}}

Craig says that theological fatalists have misunderstood "temporal necessity", or the necessity of the past, and that the impossibility of [[backward causation]] does not imply that one cannot have a sort of [[counterfactual]] power over past events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=January 7, 2008 |title=Molinism and Free Will |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-and-free-will |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625065855/http://www.reasonablefaith.org:80/molinism-and-free-will |archive-date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig surveyed the rejection of parallel fatalistic arguments in fields other than theology or philosophy of religion.  He reviews discussions of backward causation,{{sfn|Craig|2000b|pp=83–88}}[[time travel]],{{sfn|Craig|2000b|pp=89–96}} the [[special theory of relativity]], [[precognition]],{{sfn|Craig|2000b|pp=97–104}} and [[Newcomb's paradox]] to conclude that fatalistic reasoning has failed.{{sfn|Craig|1987}}

The second question arising from divine foreknowledge of future [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingents]] concerns the means by which God knows such events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Participants: Craig, William Lane |url=http://www.closertotruth.com/participant/William-Lane-Craig/24 |website=Closer to Truth |publisher=Kuhn Foundation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108064505/http://www.closertotruth.com/participant/William-Lane-Craig/24 |archive-date=November 8, 2011 |access-date=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Craig says that the question presupposes a tensed or [[A-theory of time]], for on a tenseless or [[B-theory of time]] there is no ontological distinction between past, present, and future, so that contingent events which are future relative to us are no more difficult for God to know than contingent events which are, relative to us, past or present.  Distinguishing between perceptualist and [[conceptualist]] models of divine cognition, Craig says that models which construe God's foreknowledge of the future along perceptualist lines (God foresees what will happen) are difficult to reconcile with a tensed theory of time (though one might say that God perceives the present truth-values of future contingent propositions). He does not similarly challenge a conceptualist model which construes God's knowledge along the lines of innate ideas.{{sfn|Craig|2009}}

The doctrine of middle knowledge is one such conceptualist model of divine cognition which Craig has explored.  Formulated by the [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Luis de Molina]], the doctrine of middle knowledge holds that logically prior to his decree to create a world God knew what every possible creature he might create would freely do in any possible set of circumstances in which God might place him.  On the basis of his knowledge of such [[counterfactuals]] of free will&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=Does Correspondence Preclude the Truth of Counterfactuals of Freedom?|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/does-correspondence-preclude-the-truth-of-counterfactuals-of-freedom |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512231438/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/does-correspondence-preclude-the-truth-of-counterfactuals-of-freedom |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his knowledge of his own decree to create certain creatures in certain circumstances, along with his own decision how he himself shall act, God automatically knows everything that will actually and contingently happen, without any perception of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=September 24, 2007 |title=Middle Knowledge |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/middle-knowledge |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130122852/http://www.reasonablefaith.org:80/middle-knowledge |archive-date=January 30, 2015 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig has become a proponent of [[Molinism]], supporting middle knowledge and also applying it to a wide range of theological issues, such as [[divine providence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=April 19, 2010 |title=Molinism vs. Calvinism |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-vs-calvinism |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140625031418/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-vs-calvinism |archive-date=June 25, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[predestination]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=Molinism and Divine Election |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-and-divine-election |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512214853/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-and-divine-election |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[biblical inspiration]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=A Molinist Perspective on Biblical Inspiration |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/a-molinist-perspective-on-biblical-inspiration |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221112/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/a-molinist-perspective-on-biblical-inspiration |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[perseverance of the saints]],{{sfn|Craig|1991}} Christian particularism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=Middle Knowledge and Christian Particularism |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/middle-knowledge-and-christian-particularism |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221926/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/middle-knowledge-and-christian-particularism |archive-date=May 12, 2014 |access-date=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[problem of evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=June 7, 2015 |title=Molinism and the Problem of Evil |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/molinism-and-the-problem-of-evil |interviewer-last=Harris |interviewer-first=Kevin |website=Reasonable Faith |type=podcast |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine eternity===
Craig's earlier work on the kalam cosmological argument and on divine omniscience intersected significantly with the philosophy of time and the nature of divine eternity.{{sfn|Craig|Sinclair|2009|pp=184–185}}

Craig examines arguments aimed at showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal.{{sfn|Craig|2000c}} He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but says that the arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive.{{sfn|Craig|1996}} By contrast, he gives two arguments in favor of divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality.{{sfn|Craig|2009}} Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.{{sfn|Craig|1998a}}

Craig says that there is one way of escape from these arguments, which is to accept a B-Theory of time.{{sfn|Craig|2000a}} Craig concludes that one's theory of time is a watershed issue for one's doctrine of divine eternity.{{sfn|Craig|2001c|p=115}}

In ''The Tensed Theory of Time'' (2000) and ''The Tenseless Theory of Time'' (2000), Craig examines the arguments for and against the A- and B-Theories of time respectively.

Elements of Craig's philosophy of time differentiates between time itself and our measures of it (a classical [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] theme), and includes an analysis of spatial "tenses" to the location of the "I-now", his defense of [[presentism (philosophy of time)|presentism]], his analysis of McTaggart's paradox{{sfn|Oaklander|2002}} as an instance of the problem of temporary intrinsics, his defense of a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity, and his formulation of a tensed [[possible worlds]] semantics.{{sfn|Craig|2001c|pp=51–66}}

Craig presents a doctrine of divine eternity and God's relationship to time. Defending [[Leibniz]]'s argument against God's enduring for infinite time prior to creating the universe, and appealing to the kalam cosmological argument, Craig says that God exists timelessly and temporally since the moment of creation.{{sfn|Helm|2011|pp=220ff}} Craig says that [[cosmic time]], which registers the age of the universe, is the measure of God's time. The universe is, Craig concludes, God's clock.{{sfn|Craig|2001a}}

===Resurrection of Jesus===
Craig's two volumes ''The Historical Argument for the Resurrection of Jesus'' (1985) and ''Assessing the New Testament Evidence for the Historicity of the Resurrection of Jesus'' (3rd ed., 2002) are said by the Christian reviewers [[Gary Habermas]] and Christopher Price to be among the most thorough investigations of the event of [[resurrection of Jesus|Jesus' resurrection]].{{sfn|Habermas|1988}}{{verification needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Price |first=Christopher |year=2005 |title=Review of ''The Son Rises: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus'' by William L. Craig |url=http://christiancadre.org/member_contrib/cp_reviews.html#assessing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103062844/http://christiancadre.org/member_contrib/cp_reviews.html |publisher=Christian Colligation of Apologetics Debate Research &amp; Evangelism |archive-date=November 3, 2012 |access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2018}} In the former volume, Craig describes the [[history]] of the discussion, including [[David Hume]]'s arguments against the identification of [[miracles]]. The latter volume is an [[exegesis|exegetical]] study of the [[New Testament]] material pertinent to the [[resurrection]].

Craig summarizes the relevant evidence under three major heads:{{sfn|Craig|2008|p=360}}

# The [[tomb of Jesus]] was found empty by a group of [[female disciples of Jesus|his female followers]] on the Sunday after his [[crucifixion]].{{sfn|Craig|2001b}}
# Various individuals and groups experienced appearances of Jesus alive after his death. 
#The earliest [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]] came to believe that God had raised [[Jesus]] from the dead despite strong predispositions to the contrary.

Craig's discussion of the evidence for each of these events includes a defense of the traditions of [[entombment|Jesus' burial]] by [[Joseph of Arimathea]], a close exegesis of the Pauline doctrine of the [[resurrection body]], and an investigation of [[pagan]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] notions of resurrection from the dead.{{sfn|Craig|1985}}

Craig argues that the best explanation of these three events is that God raised Jesus from the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Perman |first=Matt |date=September 12, 2007 |title=Historical Evidence for the Resurrection |url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/historical-evidence-for-the-resurrection |website=Desiring God |access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejects alternative theories such as [[Gerd Lüdemann]]'s [[hallucination]] hypothesis as lacking explanatory scope, explanatory power, and sufficient historical knowledge to support the psychoanalysis Lüdemann performs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=Visions of Jesus: A Critical Assessment of Gerd Lüdemann's Hallucination Hypothesis |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/visions-of-jesus-a-critical-assessment-of-gerd-ludemanns |website=Reasonable Faith |access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig's historical case for the resurrection employs standard historical practices for weighing [[history|historical]] hypotheses concluding that the resurrection is a better match to the available historical data.{{sfn|McGrew|McGrew|2009|p=617}} Specifically, Craig argues, that if one does not begin with the assumption that there is no God, there is a higher probability of the resurrection hypothesis than of its negation, so the resurrection hypothesis is improbable only if one begins with unsupported assumptions.{{sfn|Craig|1986}} Craig also notes that a miraculous explanation of the evidence is increased when one locates the resurrection of Jesus in the context of Jesus' ministry and personal statements.{{sfn|Craig|1998b}} This context, Craig argues, provides the interpretive key to the meaning of Jesus' resurrection as the divine vindication of the allegedly [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] statements for which [[trial of Jesus|Jesus was tried]] and executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=The Resurrection of Jesus |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-resurrection-of-jesus |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001120140/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-resurrection-of-jesus |archive-date=October 1, 2017 |access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divine aseity===
Craig is currently{{as of when|date=September 2018}} focused on the challenge posed by [[platonism]] to [[divine aseity]] or self-existence.{{sfn|Craig|2014}}{{verification needed|date=September 2018}} Craig rejects the view that God creates [[abstract objects]]{{sfn|Moreland|Craig|2003|pp=506–507}} and defends [[nominalism|nominalistic]] perspectives on abstract objects.{{sfn|Craig|2012a}} Stating that the [[Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis]] is the chief support of platonism,{{sfn|Liggins|2008}} Craig criticizes [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s [[naturalized epistemology]] and [[confirmational holism]], and also rejects the metaontological criterion of [[ontological commitment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=October 28, 2012 |title=Can We Refer to Things That Are Not Present? |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/can-we-refer-to-things-that-are-not-present |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170714005601/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/can-we-refer-to-things-that-are-not-present |archive-date=July 14, 2017 |access-date=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig favors a neutral logic, according to which the formal quantifiers of [[first-order logic]], as well as the informal quantifiers of ordinary language, are not ontologically committing.{{sfn|Craig|2012b}} He also advocates a deflationary theory of reference, according to which referring is a [[speech act]] rather than a word-world relation, so that singular terms may be used in true sentences without commitment to corresponding objects in the world.{{sfn|Båve|2009}} If one stipulates that first-order [[Quantifiers (logic)|quantifiers]] are being used as devices of ontological commitment, then Craig adverts to [[fictionalism]], in particular pretense theory,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} according to which statements about abstract objects are expressions of make-believe, imagined to be true, though literally false.{{sfn|Nichols|Stich|1999}}

===Other views===
Craig is a critic of [[metaphysical naturalism]],{{sfn|Craig|Moreland|2000}} [[New Atheism]],{{sfn|Copan|Craig|2009}} and [[prosperity theology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=March 28, 2010 |title=Lightning Strikes Again |url=https://www.reasonablefaith.org/lightning-strikes-again |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522103904/http://www.reasonablefaith.org:80/lightning-strikes-again |archive-date=May 22, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a defender of [[Reformed epistemology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=December 30, 2008 |title=Religious Epistemology MP3 Audio by William Lane Craig |url=http://apologetics315.blogspot.com/2008/12/religious-epistemology-mp3-audio-by.html |website=Apologetics 315 |access-date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that being a confessing Christian is not compatible with practicing [[homosexuality]].{{sfn|Craig|2003|pp=129–144}}{{page range too broad|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zaimov |first=Stoyan |date=April 9, 2013 |title=Christian Apologist Says Church 'Losing Battle' Against Hate Label for Homosexuality Stance |url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-apologist-says-church-losing-battle-against-hate-label-for-homosexuality-stance-93566/ |website=The Christian Post |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |title=A Christian Perspective on Homosexuality |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/a-christian-perspective-on-homosexuality |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206173226/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/a-christian-perspective-on-homosexuality |archive-date=December 6, 2016 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=May 19, 2008 |title=Christian Homosexuals? |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/christian-homosexuals |website=Reasonable Faith |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig maintains that the theory of [[evolution]] is compatible with Christianity.{{sfn|Stewart|2007}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=February 20, 2012 |title=Evolutionary Theory and Theism |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/evolutionary-theory-and-theism |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002070406/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/evolutionary-theory-and-theism |archive-date=October 2, 2017 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig has an agnostic position on the creation account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |year=2009 |title=William Lane Craig's View on Creation and Evolution |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSc92EDm5gU |website=YouTube |access-date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctrine of Creation |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/s8 |website=Reasonable Faith |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218203121/https://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/s8 |archive-date=December 18, 2015 |access-date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{nonspecific|date=September 2018}} He is a fellow of the [[Discovery Institute]]'s [[Center for Science and Culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=William Lane Craig |url=http://www.discovery.org/p/85 |publisher=Discovery Institute |access-date=December 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a fellow of the [[International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Society Fellows |url=http://www.iscid.org/fellows.php |publisher=International Society for Complexity, Information, and Design |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019104148/http://www.iscid.org/fellows.php |archive-date=September 28, 2018 |access-date=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[divine command theory|divine command theorist]], Craig believes God had the moral right to command the killing of the [[Canaanites]] if they refused to leave their land, as depicted in the [[Book of Deuteronomy]].{{sfnm |1a1=Copan |1a2=Flannagan |1y=2014 |1pp=81–82 |2a1=Howson |2y=2011 |2p=11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Craig |first=William Lane |date=August 8, 2011 |title=The 'Slaughter' of the Canaanites Re-visited |url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-slaughter-of-the-canaanites-re-visited |website=Reasonable Faith |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to some controversy. The prominent atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] has repeatedly refused to debate Craig, and has given what he calls Craig's defense of genocide as one of his reasons.&lt;ref name="dawkins2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |author-link=Richard Dawkins |date=October 20, 2011 |title=Why I Refuse to Debate with William Lane Craig |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/oct/20/richard-dawkins-william-lane-craig |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="came2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=Came |first=Daniel |date=October 22, 2011 |title=Richard Dawkins's Refusal to Debate Is Cynical and Anti-Intellectualist |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/22/richard-dawkins-refusal-debate-william-lane-craig |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Dawkins himself came under attack for refusing to debate with William Lane Craig, with fellow atheist Daniel Came saying: {{quote|'The absence of a debate with the foremost apologist for Christian theism is a glaring omission on your CV and is of course apt to be interpreted as cowardice on your part. I notice that, by contrast, you are happy to discuss theological matters with television and radio presenters and other intellectual heavyweights like Pastor Ted Haggard of the National Association of Evangelicals and Pastor Keenan Roberts of the Colorado Hell House.'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/8511931/Richard-Dawkins-accused-of-cowardice-for-refusing-to-debate-existence-of-God.html&lt;/ref&gt;}} He later devoted an article in the Guardian to his refusal, declaring it 'anti-intellectualist' and 'patronising', whilst slating the whole [[New Atheism]] movement for 'replacing one form of irrationality with another.' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/oct/22/richard-dawkins-refusal-debate-william-lane-craig&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig has also proposed an [[Apollinarianism|Apollinarian]] Christology in which the divine logos stands in for the human soul of Christ and completes his human nature.{{sfn|Moreland|Craig|2003|p=608}}

==Reception==
According to [[Nathan Schneider]], "[many] professional philosophers know about him only vaguely, but in the field of philosophy of religion, [Craig's] books and articles are among the most cited".&lt;ref name="Schneider 2013"/&gt; [[Sam Harris]] has described Craig as "the one Christian apologist who seems to have put the fear of God into many of my fellow atheists."&lt;ref name="Schneider 2013"/&gt;

Some scholars, such as Wes Morriston of the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], have challenged some of Craig's views, such as the Kalam Cosmological argument,{{sfn|Morriston|2013}} the foundation of God for morality,{{sfn|Morriston|2012}} the alleged genocide of the Canaanites,{{sfn|Morriston|2009}} as well as Craig's views on actual infinites,{{sfn|Morriston|2018}} his fine-tuning argument,{{sfn|Jantzen|2014}} and his arguments for the resurrection of Jesus.{{sfn|Law|2011}}
