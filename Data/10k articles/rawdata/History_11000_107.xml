The '''Colonial Conference of 1897''' was a conference between the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and the 11 [[self-governing colony|self-governing]] [[British colony|colonies]] of the [[British Empire]]. The conference was convened in London by Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] in 1897 on the occasion of Diamond Jubilee of [[Queen Victoria]]. Chamberlain's intention was to draw the self-governing colonies into closer co-operation with the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=imp/&gt;

Delegates were sent to the conference by Canada, [[Newfoundland Colony]], New Zealand the Australian self-governing colonies of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]], and the South African colonies of [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] and the [[Colony of Natal]].&lt;ref name=imp/&gt;

Chamberlain proposed the creation of a permanent Imperial Council made up of delegates from the colonies to act as an Empire-wide parliament with the power to bind the colonies on imperial matters but this was rejected by the colonies due to fears of loss of autonomy. Chamberlain also propose that colonies increase their contributions to the [[Royal Navy]] but only some colonies agreed to increase their contributions and no permanent arrangement was agreed to.&lt;ref name=imp&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of European imperialism|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313262578|pages=136–137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chamberlain also proposed a [[customs union]] between the colonies and Britain while Canada proposed [[Imperial preference|preferential trade]] but no decision was made by the delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colonial Conference|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qxsRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JZUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6172,322193&amp;dq=colonial+conference&amp;hl=en|accessdate=27 December 2014|newspaper=Sydney Mail|date=10 July 1897|publisher=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imp2&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of European imperialism|year=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0313262578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC|page=138|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ʾAḥmad Ibn Yaḥyā al-Balādhurī'''  ({{lang-ar|أحمد بن يحيى بن جابر البلاذري}}) was a 9th-century Muslim historian. One of the eminent [[Middle Eastern]] historians of his age, he spent most of his life in [[Baghdad]] and enjoyed great influence at the court of the caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]]. He traveled in [[Syria]] and [[Iraq]], compiling information for his major works.

His full name was Ahmad Bin Yahya Bin Jabir Al-Baladhuri  ({{lang-ar|أحمد بن يحيى بن جابر البلاذري}}), Balazry Ahmad Bin Yahya Bin Jabir Abul Hasan&lt;ref name="salaam.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/biography/viewentry.php?id=460 Salaam Knowledge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; or Abi al-Hassan Baladhuri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/en/chap2.php Answering-Ansar.org :: Fadak; The property of Fatima al-Zahra [as&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125224232/http://www.answering-ansar.org/answers/fadak/en/chap2.php |date=2007-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived at the court of the [[caliph]]s [[al-Mutawakkil]] and [[Al-Musta'in]] and was tutor to the son of [[al-Mutazz]]. He died in 892 as the result of a drug called ''[[baladhur]]'' (hence his name).&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; (''Baladhur'' is ''Semecarpus anacardium'', known as the "marking nut"; medieval Arabic and Jewish writers describe it as a memory-enhancer).&lt;ref name="Bos"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/619709 Bos, Gerrit: " 'Baladhur' (Marking-Nut): A Popular Medieval Drug for Strengthening Memory", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'', University of London, Vol. 59, No. 2 (1996), pp. 229-236] (full-text via JSTOR; article's first page available for all)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
{{wikisource author}}
His chief extant work, a condensation of a longer history, ''[[Kitab Futuh al-Buldan]]''  (فتوح البلدان), "Book of the Conquests of Lands", translated by [[Phillip Hitti]] (1916) and [[Francis Clark Murgotten]] (1924) in ''The Origins of the Islamic State'', tells of the wars and conquests of the Arabs from the 7th century, and the terms made with the residents of the conquered territories. It covers the conquests of lands from Arabia west to Egypt, North Africa, and Spain and east to Iraq, Iran, and Sind.

His history, in turn, was much used by later writers. ''[[Ansab al-Ashraf]]''  (أنساب الأشراف, “Lineage of the Nobles”), also extant, is a biographical work in genealogical order devoted to the Arab aristocracy, from Muhammad and his contemporaries to the Umayyad and Abbāsid caliphs. It contains histories of the reigns of rulers.&lt;ref&gt;"Balādhurī, al-." ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

His discussions of the rise and fall of powerful dynasties provide a political moral. His commentaries on methodology are sparse, other than assertions of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e283?_hi=5&amp;_pos=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Little is known of Antiochus' life, but his works, of which only fragments remain, enjoyed a high reputation because of their accuracy. He wrote a ''History of Sicily'' from the earliest times to 424 BC, which was used by [[Thucydides]], and the ''Colonizing of Italy'', frequently referred to by [[Strabo]] and [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

[[File:Broadwater Farm Riot, Day 2, 004sm.jpg|thumb|400px|Broadwater Farm riot: the next day]]
The '''Broadwater Farm [[riot]]''' occurred around the [[Broadwater Farm|Broadwater Farm estates]] area of [[Tottenham]], [[North London]], on 6 October 1985.

The events of the day were dominated by two deaths. The first was that of Cynthia Jarrett, an [[British African-Caribbean community|African-Caribbean]] woman who died the previous day due to [[heart failure]] during a police search at her home. It was one of the main triggers of the riot in a context where tension between local black youth and the largely white [[Metropolitan Police]] was already high due to a combination of local issues and the aftermath of [[Brixton riot (1985)|another riot]] which had occurred in the [[Brixton]] area of London the previous week following the shooting of a black woman ([[Cherry Groce|Dorothy 'Cherry' Groce]]) during another police search.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/28/newsid_2540000/2540397.stm|title=1985: Riots in Brixton after police shooting|publisher=BBC News|date=28 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/sep/30/brixton-riots-1985-archive|title=From the archive: Riots in Brixton after police shooting|author=Gareth Parry, Susan Tirbutt and David Rose|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=30 September 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28248588|title=Police blamed over 1985 Cherry Groce Brixton shooting|publisher=BBC News|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2486315&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/1/newsid_2486000/2486315.stm|title=1985: Riots erupt in Toxteth and Peckham|publisher=BBC News|date=1 October 1985|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, the [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], Sir [[Bernard Hogan-Howe]], apologised "unreservedly" for the shooting and the time it had taken to say "sorry" following an inquest into the death of Dorothy "Cherry" Groce, whose shooting by the Metropolitan Police triggered the riots. The jury inquest blamed the Metropolitan Police for failures that contributed to Groce's death.&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2486315/&gt; The second death was that of [[Police Constable|PC]] [[Keith Blakelock]], the first police officer since 1833 to be killed in a riot in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Newman|Newman, K.]] [http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/files/POLICE0001/speeches/1986%20Sir%20Kenneth%20Newman.pdf ''Police-Public Relations: The Pace of Change: Police Foundation Lecture 1986''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721071915/http://www.police-foundation.org.uk/files/POLICE0001/speeches/1986%20Sir%20Kenneth%20Newman.pdf |date=21 July 2011 }}, The [[Police Foundation]], 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death of Cynthia Jarrett==
At 13:00 hrs on 5 October 1985, a young [[British African-Caribbean community|black]] man, Floyd Jarrett, who lived about a mile from the Farm, was arrested by [[Metropolitan Police Force|police]], having been stopped in a vehicle with an allegedly suspicious [[Vehicle Excise Duty|car tax disc]].&lt;ref name="Thompson, K 1988"&gt;Thompson, K. Under siege: racial violence in Britain today (1988) Penguin Books Ltd 978-0140523911&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to nearby Tottenham police station and charged with theft and assault (he was later acquitted of both charges). Five and a half hours later, D.C. Randle and three other officers decided to search his mother's home, also close by. Forty-nine-year-old Mrs Jarret immediately collapsed and died from a heart attack during disputed circumstances.&lt;ref name="Brain, T. 2010"&gt;Brain, T. (2010) A history of policing in England and Wales from 1974: a turbulent journey. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; During the coroner's inquest into Mrs Jarret's death, her daughter, Patricia claimed to have seen D.C. Randle push her mother whilst conducting the search inside their house, causing her to fall. Randle denied this allegation.&lt;ref name="Thompson, K 1988"/&gt;

Cynthia Jarrett's death sparked outrage from some members of the black community against the conduct of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]].  There was a widespread belief that the police were [[institutionally racist]].  A black woman, [[Cherry Groce]], had been shot by police a week earlier in Brixton.  Four years earlier, the [[Scarman Report]] into the [[1981 Brixton riot]] criticised police.
In particular, the local council leader, [[Bernie Grant]], later condemned the search and urged the local police chiefs to resign immediately as their behaviour had been "out of control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Policeman killed in riot|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1985/oct/07/ukcrime.garethparry|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 October 1985|location=London|first1=Gareth|last1=Parry|first2=Andrew|last2=Rawnsley|first3=John|last3=Ezard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Day of disturbances==
There was a demonstration the following day outside Tottenham [[police station]] by a small crowd of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184655/http://www.met.police.uk/history/broadwater_farm.htm|title=Metropolitan Police Service - History of the Metropolitan Police Service|date=30 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Violence between police and youths escalated during the day.  [[Riot control|Riot police]] tried to clear streets using [[baton charge]]s.  The youths in the conflict used bricks and [[petrol bomb]]s.  The evening TV news claimed there were shots at the police, two officers, PC Stuart Patt, another unnamed officer, being treated for gunshot wounds. Three journalists (Press Association reporter Peter Woodman, BBC sound recordist Robin Green, and cameraman Keith Skinner) were also claimed to have been hit. Cars were set on fire and barricades made.  The main conflict took place on the estate itself, with police officers and rioters injured and dozens of rioters arrested.

==Murder of PC Blakelock==
{{main|Murder of Keith Blakelock}}

At 9.30pm, Police and London Fire Brigade responded to reports of a fire on the elevated level of Tangmere House; this block consisted of a shopping level with flats and maisonettes above. The location itself was some distance away from the main body of rioting, and as such was being policed by units who were less well-equipped and -prepared in terms of disorder training. The [[London Fire Brigade]] came under attack as did the 'serial' of police, including Blakelock, who were there to assist. The rioting was too intense for police not trained in riot control and they and the firefighters withdrew, chased by rioters. Blakelock tripped, fell, and was surrounded by a mob with [[machete]]s, [[knife|knives]] and other weapons, who killed him in an attempt to decapitate him. PC Richard Coombes suffered a serious facial injury from one of the attackers when he made efforts to rescue his colleague. The rioting tailed off during the night as rain fell and news of the death spread.

==Aftermath==
Police maintained a substantial presence on the estate for several months, arresting and questioning 400 people. The disturbances led to changes in police tactics and equipment, and efforts to re-engage with the community.  [[Bernie Grant]], then leader of the Labour-controlled Haringey Council, later elected as Labour MP for Tottenham, was widely condemned for reportedly saying, "the police got a bloody good hiding" (although the actual statement was "the youth think they gave the police a bloody good hiding.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/25/uk.labour|title=Politics, race and the fight to inherit|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2000|accessdate=17 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, the local council invested in the estate to improve some of the problems which were seen as factors in the rioting. By 2016 and although there is still contention with the police, the area has improved.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

The riot prompted the Metropolitan Police to devise the [[Gold-silver-bronze command structure]] for responding to sudden major incidents. Among the difficulties with the police response was that orders had to be communicated through numerous ranks, and it was never clear who was in operational charge.

==Trials==
Six people (three juveniles and three adults) were charged with the murder of Blakelock. The juveniles all had their cases dismissed after the judge ruled the conditions in which they had been held were so inappropriate that their interrogation was inadmissible - conditions included being questioned naked except for a blanket, and being questioned without a guardian.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[[The Guardian]] – [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jan/18/ukcrime.race Article of  detailing trial evidence], 18 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Three adults, [[Winston Silcott]], Engin Raghip and Mark Braithwaite, were convicted of murder and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] despite no witnesses and no forensic evidence.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt; The Tottenham Three are Innocent Campaign and the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign pressed for a retrial. On 25 November 1991, all three defendants were cleared by the [[Court of Appeal]] when an [[Electrostatic detection device|ESDA]] test demonstrated police notes of interrogations (the only evidence) had been tampered with.&lt;ref name="Brain, T. 2010"/&gt; Braithwaite and Raghip were released after four years in prison. Silcott remained in prison for the separate murder of another man, Tony Smith. He was released on licence in 2003 after serving eighteen years for that crime. The officer in charge of the interrogation was cleared of [[perjury]].

In July 2013, Nicholas Jacobs was charged with the murder of PC Blakelock. Four other men arrested at the same time were not charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/jul/23/keith-blakelock-murder-broadwater-farm | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Vikram | last=Dodd | title=PC Keith Blakelock: man charged with murder at Broadwater Farm riots | date=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 April 2014, Jacobs was cleared of all charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-26960690 | work=BBC News | title=PC Keith Blakelock: Nicholas Jacobs cleared of killing officer | date=9 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inquest==
At the inquest into the death of Cynthia Jarrett her daughter, Patricia, alleged that her mother had been pushed over by Detective Constable Michael Randle, which he denied. The inquest found that Jarrett had died accidentally. No police officers were charged or disciplined for her death.

===Broadwater Farm memo controversy 1985===

In 1985, [[Oliver Letwin]] and [[Hartley Booth]] co-authored a memo as members of then-Prime Minister Thatcher's policy unit in response to Broadwater Farm in London urging "Thatcher to ignore reports that rioting in mainly black urban areas was the result of social deprivation and racism."&lt;ref name="NYT_2015_12_dec" /&gt; Broadwater Farm riot was part of a series of riots sparked by the shooting of the mother of [[Michael Groce]] —  both [[Afro-Caribbean]] in a mainly Afro-Caribbean neighbourhood — by the [[Metropolitan Police]] on 28 September 1985 in the mainly Afro-Caribbean [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] neighbourhood, sparked a [[1981 Brixton riot|second]] riot in Brixton.&lt;ref name=BBC2540397/&gt;&lt;ref name=GuardArch85Brix/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC28248588/&gt; Over the next weeks and months riots broke out in [[Peckham]],&lt;ref name=BBC2486315/&gt; [[1985 Toxteth riots|Toxteth]] and at the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, North London. In 1985 Letwin was then considered to be a "young star" of the Conservative Party. The memo scorned suggestions by senior cabinet ministers to set up a £10m communities programme to tackle inner-city problems by helping blacks start businesses as suggested by [[David Young, Baron Young of Graffham|David Young]], refurbishing public housing council blocks as suggested by [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]] and "establishing training programs for low-income youth." Letwin claimed it would not ameliorate the situation but would do little more than "subsidise Rastafarian arts and crafts workshops" stating that black "entrepreneurs will set up in the disco and drug trade".&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_dec_30"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/30/oliver-letwin-blocked-help-for-black-youth-after-1985-riots | title=Oliver Letwin blocked help for black youth after 1985 riots: Cameron's policy chief makes apology over advice to Thatcher that assistance would benefit 'disco and drug trade' and Rastafarian crafts | publisher=The Guardian | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015 | author=Travis, Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 1985 paper was released under the [[Thirty-year rule|30 years rule]] into the public record through the National Archives on 30 December 2015, a chastened Letwin apologised on the same day for "the offence caused".&lt;ref name="NYT_2015_12_dec"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/world/europe/oliver-letwin-riots.html?_r=0 | title=Release of 1985 Race Riots Memo Prompts Apology From Cameron Aide | publisher=New York Times | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015 | author=Erlanger, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian_2015_dec_30" /&gt; The memo argued that the riots were caused by bad behaviour not social conditions:

{{quote|"Lower-class, unemployed white people lived for years in appalling slums without a breakdown of public order on anything like the present scale; in the midst of the depression, people in Brixton went out, leaving their grocery money in a bag at the front door, and expecting to see groceries there when they got back...Riots, criminality and social disintegration are caused solely by individual characters and attitudes. So long as bad moral attitudes remain, all efforts to improve the inner cities will founder."|Oliver Letwin, Hartley Booth Policy Broadwater Farm memo to Prime Minister Thatcher 1985 (released to the public domain on 30 December 2015)&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-35192265 | title=Letwin apologises over 1985 Broadwater Farm riot memo | publisher=BBC | date=30 December 2015 | accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9014">'''Burrows Cave''' is the name given to an alleged cave site in a disputed location in Southern [[Illinois]] supposedly discovered by Russell E. Burrows. Burrows says it contained a number of artifacts. Through the many inconsistencies that evolve around Russell E. Burrows' story of discovery and its findings, the cave and its contents are considered a [[hoax]] by mainstream archaeologists and some fringe archaeologists.

==Location==
During the time of the discovery, it was thought that the alleged cave must have been located in [[Richland County, Illinois|Richland County]] somewhere near the town [[Olney, Illinois]] where Burrows resided at the time. Burrows claimed that he did not want to give away the location of the cave because he believed that the cave would be robbed of its ancient treasures.

==Discovery==
Burrows says he discovered the cave while hiking along the hillside miles away from the [[Ohio River]], where he later claims that he was searching for buckles from the [[American Civil War|Civil War era]] and pioneer horseshoes with his metal detector. Burrows says that he came across a hole into which he fell that led him into the mysterious cave full of priceless ancient artifacts. The cave was said to have contained numerous archaeological artifacts, including carvings, coins, and other items. Many of the purported artifacts are said to have inscriptions in various ancient languages such as [[Phoenician language|Phoenecian]]&lt;!-- Keep as is. Do not keep changing back to Numidian–see talk page --&gt; and [[Iberian language|Iberian]]&lt;!-- Ibereque is either, not English or doesn't exist) --&gt;, but the inscriptions are generally meaningless.

==Cave as "tomb"==
Burrows claims that the cave is a tomb holding the artifacts and remains of 13 crypts. To date, nobody outside Burrows's immediate circle has claimed to have been inside the cave, and many of the so-called artifacts have been revealed as forgeries. The cave and its artifacts are widely considered to be a hoax or fraud,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LDxgE6EpE8EC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Russell+Burrows+Hoax#v=onepage&amp;q=Russell%20Burrows%20Hoax&amp;f=false |title=Haunting the Prairie: A Tourists Guide to the Weird and Wild Places of Illinois|via=Google Books |publisher=Black Oak Media |date= 2010-01-01|accessdate=2014-01-20|isbn=9780979040146 |author1=Kleen |first1=Michael|page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gE4P1bhDCB4C&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=Russell+Burrows+Hoax |title=Weird Illinois: Your Travel Guide to Illinois' Local Legends and Best Kept Secrets |author1= Troy Taylor|author2= Mark Moran|author3=Mark Sceurman |via= Google Books |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company |page=38 |accessdate=2014-01-20|isbn=9780760759431 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Burrows and the cave were one of the subjects of the second season "Grand Canyon Treasure" episode  of ''[[America Unearthed]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/america-unearthed/videos/america-unearthed-grand-canyon-treasure |title=America Unearthed: Grand Canyon Treasure Full Episode - America Unearthed |publisher=HISTORY.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/1/post/2013/12/review-of-america-unearthed-s02e05-grand-canyon-treasure.html |title=Review of America Unearthed S02E05: "Grand Canyon Treasure" |publisher=JasonColavito.com |date=2013-12-29 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the show ''Holy Grail in America'', both produced by the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]].

Thomas Emerson, the Illinois state archaeologist and former head of the [[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]] warned that the claims being made by Burrows cave proponents were sensational, and not backed by solid evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=Centralia Morning Sentinel | title=Marion County to appear in America Unearthed episode | date=Dec 21, 2013 | author=Rutland, Reece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no evidence of the cave and its existence, many archaeologists quickly dismissed Burrows and the alleged cave.

==Phoenician ship scenario==
Until about 1993, the predominant Burrows Cave scenario involved [[Phoenicia|Phoenecian]] and [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] (North African) colonists. Part of the evidence for this involved a stone tablet supposedly depicting a Phoenician vessel. [[Frank Collin|Frank Joseph]], one of the key figures involved with the cave, reproduced this in his book ''The Lost Treasure of King Juba: The Evidence of Africans in America before Columbus'' alongside an image of an actual Phoenician vessel that had been used by an associate of Burrows who had originally identified it as Phoenician. In doing so he cropped the image from the Burrows stone making the paddle end of a steering oar unidentifiable but leaving the steering oars that are shown on what he calls (and the artist depicts) as the prow of the boat. 

The anthropologist and geographer [[George F. Carter]], a supporter of the concept of [[trans-cultural diffusion]], commented on the image saying 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The 'author' did not recognize the paired oars, and hung an 'impossible' oar over the bow. All others equally botched up. Fanciful stern pieces...Oar over bow - crude fakery by an ignoramus in the world of ships."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Wilson  | first = Joseph AP | authorlink =  | title = The Cave Who Never Was: Outsider Archaeology and Failed Collaboration in the USA  |journal = [[Public Archaeology (journal)|Public Archaeology]]  | volume = 11  | issue = 2 | pages = 75–93  | year = 2012  | url = http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/ref/10.1179/1465518712Z.0000000007 | doi = 10.1179/1465518712Z.0000000007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dating==
The image used to identify the ship as Phoenician actually is dated to around 700 BCE, but Joseph described it as dated 170 BCE, possibly because around this time Burrows Cave was being portrayed as the destination of [[Mauretania]]ns, including "exiled Romans, Africans, Celts, Christians and Jews"&lt;ref&gt;Meador, S. 2004.

'''Conrad Moffat Black, Baron Black of Crossharbour''',&lt;ref name="parlbio"/&gt; [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KCSG]] (born 25 August 1944) is a Canadian-born British former [[newspaper publisher]] and author.  In 2007, Black was convicted on four counts of fraud in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Chicago. While two of the criminal fraud charges were dropped on appeal, a conviction for felony fraud and obstruction of justice were upheld in 2010 and he was re-sentenced to 42 months in prison and a fine of $125,000.

Black controlled [[Sun-Times Media Group|Hollinger International]], once the world's third-largest English-language newspaper empire,&lt;ref&gt;Financial Post: [http://business.financialpost.com/2012/05/24/conrad-black-moves-to-end-hollinger-ccaa/ "Conrad Black moves to end Hollinger CCAA"]&lt;/ref&gt; which published ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (UK), ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' (U.S.), ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' (Israel), ''[[National Post]]'' (Canada), most of the leading newspapers in Australia and Canada and hundreds of community newspapers in North America, before controversy erupted over the sale of some of the company's assets.

==Early life and family==
Black was born in [[Montreal]], Quebec, to a well-to-do family originally from [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. His father, [[George Montegu Black II|George Montegu Black, Jr.]], a [[Chartered Accountant]], became the president of [[Canadian Breweries Limited]], an international brewing [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] that had earlier absorbed Winnipeg Breweries. Conrad Black's mother was the former Jean Elizabeth Riley, a daughter of Conrad Stephenson Riley, whose father founded [[The Great-West Life Assurance Company]], and a great-granddaughter of an early co-owner of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} His father was a shareholder in the Daily Telegraph.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Biographer George Toombs said of Black's motivations: "He was born into a very large family of athletic, handsome people. He wasn't particularly athletic or handsome like they were, so he developed a different skill – wordplay, which he practiced a lot with his father."&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; Black has written that his father was "cultured [and] humorous" and that his mother was a "natural, convivial, and altogether virtuous person."&lt;ref name=Life&gt;Black, C. (1993). ''A Life in Progress''. Key Porter Books; {{ISBN|1-55013-520-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of his older brother George Montegu Black III (Monte), Black has written that he was "one of the greatest natural athletes I have known", and that though "generally more sociable than I was, he was never a cad or even inconstant, or ever an ungenerous friend or less than a gentleman.".&lt;ref name=Monte&gt;[http://nationalpost.com/opinion/conrad-black-remembering-my-older-brother-monte "Remembering my older brother Mario Monte"], ''National Post'', 22 October 2011. Retrieved 11 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The Black family maintains a family plot at Mt. Pleasant Cemetery in Toronto where Black's parents and brother are buried along with his good friend and his wife's former husband, journalist, poet and broadcaster, [[George Jonas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountpleasantgroup.com/Search/Search-Results?search=black|title=Mount Pleasant Group|website=www.mountpleasantgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GJBio"&gt;{{cite web|title=George Jonas Biography|url=http://www.georgejonas.ca/biography|website=georgejonas.ca|publisher=George Jonas.ca|accessdate=5 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006145105/http://www.georgejonas.ca/biography|archivedate=October 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Black was first educated at [[Upper Canada College]] (UCC), during which time, at age eight, he invested his life savings of $60 in one [[Share (finance)|share]] of [[General Motors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,173529,00.html|title=Headline Maker|publisher=TIME|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six years later, he was expelled from UCC for selling stolen exam papers. He then attended [[Trinity College School]] in Port Hope, where he lasted less than a year, being expelled for [[Insubordination|insubordinate behaviour]]. He did successfully complete the year as an extramural student.

Black went on to a small, now defunct, private school in Toronto called Thornton Hall, continuing on to post-secondary education at [[Carleton University]] (History, 1965). He attended Toronto's [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] of [[York University]], but his studies ended after he failed his first year exams.&lt;ref name="bower"/&gt; He completed a law degree at [[Université Laval]] (Law, 1970), and in 1973 completed a [[Master of Arts]] degree in History at [[McGill University]].&lt;ref name="Conrad Black: Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/black_conrad/timeline.html|title=Conrad Black: Timeline|publisher=CBC News|date=23 June 2009|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's thesis at McGill would become the first half of his first book of Quebec premier [[Maurice Duplessis]]. Black had been granted access to Duplessis' papers, housed in Duplessis' former residence in [[Trois-Rivières]],&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Newman, P. (1983). ''The Establishment Man.'' Seal Books; {{ISBN|0-7704-1839-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which included "figures from the famous [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] Caisse Electorale (the party war chest), a copy of the Leader of the Opposition's tax returns, [and] gossip from bishops,"&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt; as well as {{quote|historically significant letters from Cardinal [[Jean-Marie-Rodrigue Villeneuve]] and [[Paul-Émile Léger]], Governor General Field Marshal Alexander, Lord Beaverbrook, Canadian and French Prime Ministers and Eminent Canadian and American finance ministers side-by-side with hand-written, ungrammatical requests for jobs with the Quebec Liquor Board, unpaid bills, the returns of his ministers who were cheating on their taxes, a number of scribbled notes for Assembly speeches, tidbits of political espionage, compromising photographs, [and] a ledger listing the political contributions of every tavern-keeper in the province.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;}}Black subsequently had the principal items from the papers copied and microfilmed, and he donated copies to [[McGill University|McGill]], [[York University|York]], and [[University of Windsor|Windsor]] universities.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

===Marriages===
Black's first marriage was in 1978 to Joanna Hishon of [[Montreal]], who worked as a secretary in his and his brother Montegu's brokerage office. The couple had two sons and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepeerage.com|title=The Peerage|publisher=The Peerage|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They separated in 1991. Their divorce was finalized in 1992; that same year Black married British-born journalist [[Barbara Amiel]]. Black described Amiel, in the first volume of his autobiography as "beautiful, brilliant, ideologically a robust spirit" and "chic, humorous and preternaturally sexy". Courtroom evidence revealed that the couple exchanged over 11,000 emails.&lt;ref name="Guard"/&gt; In a February 2011, public Valentine's Day greeting, Black wrote:

{{quote|I have been persecuted and Barbara was under no obligation to share fully in the life-enhancing and undoubtedly character-building experience of sharing that fate with me completely. But she has, and no one can know, and it is beyond my power adequately to express here, what her constancy has meant to me. For more than four years before I was sent to prison, she toiled with me against the heavy odds generated by the legal and media onslaught. She endured an avalanche of abuse directed at her (although she wasn't accused of anything) as extravagant, flakey, apt to bolt, domineering, and what Kafka called "nameless crimes". For the next 29 months, she led a lonely life in Florida, in a climate that aggravated her medical problems. And once or twice every week, she got up at 3 a.m. to drive over four hours to see me.&lt;ref name=Valentine&gt;[http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/02/12/conrad-black-nineteen-years-with-my-perfect-valentine/ "Nineteen years with my perfect Valentine"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130129152240/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2011/02/12/conrad-black-nineteen-years-with-my-perfect-valentine/ |date=29 January 2013 }}, ''National Post'', 12 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Religion===
"My family", Black wrote in 2009, "was divided between [[atheism]] and agnosticism, and I followed rather unthinkingly and inactively in those paths into my twenties." By his early thirties he "no longer had any confidence in the non-existence of God." Thereafter, he "approached Rome at a snail's pace," and began to study the writings of Roman Catholic thinkers such as [[St. Augustine]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Cardinal Newman]], and [[Jacques Maritain]].&lt;ref name="snail"&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/faith-and-character/faith-and-character/how-i-woke-up-from-spiritual-slumber-and-inched-at-a-snails-pace-to-rome.html "How I woke up from spiritual slumber and inched at a snail's pace to Rome"], ''The Catholic Herald'', 11 September 2009. Retrieved 11 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Having accepted the possibility of miracles and thus of the [[Resurrection of Christ]], Black was received into the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on 18 June 1986 by Cardinal [[Gerald Emmett Carter]], Archbishop of Toronto, at the Cardinal's residence. He had a dispensation to receive the sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church, from Cardinals [[Paul-Émile Léger|Léger]] and Carter, starting in 1974.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

Black developed a close friendship with Carter and relied on him as a spiritual advisor. On Carter's death, Black wrote: {{quote|In the 25 years I knew him, his judgment and personality were always sober but never solemn; and never, not at his most beleaguered and not on the verge of death, did he show a trace of despair. He was intellectual but practical, spiritual but not sanctimonious or utopian, proud but never arrogant. He must have had faults, but I never detected any. He was a great man, yet the salt of the earth.&lt;ref name=Carterobit&gt;[https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/faith-and-character/faith-and-character/a-dear-wise-constant-friend.html "A dear, wise, constant friend"], ''Catholic Education Resource Centre'', 12 April 2003. Retrieved 11 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2001, Black was invested as a Knight Commander of the [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]], a Papal order of chivalry awarded by Pope John Paul II and delivered by Cardinals Carter and [[Aloysius Ambrozic]]. He has written that his faith helped him endure his imprisonment in the United States.&lt;ref name="Serenity"&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/damianthompson/100009179/conrad-black-i-have-found-serenity-through-catholicism-in-jail/ "Conrad Black: I have found serenity through Catholicism in jail"], ''The Daily Telegraph.'' 10 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Black is also a major shareholder in ''The Catholic Herald'',&lt;ref name="Serenity"/&gt; and was the vice-president of Léger's charity from 1972 to 1990.&lt;ref name=Matter&gt;Black, C. (2011). ''A Matter of Principle.'' McCelland &amp; Stewart; {{ISBN|978-0-7710-1670-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
=== Early business ventures ===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2017}}
Black became involved in a number of businesses, mainly publishing newspapers, starting when he was still in university. In 1966, Black bought his first newspaper, the ''Eastern Townships Advertiser'' in Quebec. Following the foundation as an investment vehicle of the [[Ravelston Corporation Limited|Ravelston Corporation]] by the Black family in 1969, Black, together with friends [[David Radler]] and Peter G. White, purchased and operated the ''[[The Record (Sherbrooke)|Sherbrooke Record]]'', the small English language daily in [[Sherbrooke]], Quebec. In 1971, the three formed Sterling Newspapers Limited, a holding company that acquired several other small Canadian regional daily and weekly newspapers, including the ''[[Prince Rupert Daily News]]'' and the [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island]], ''[[Journal-Pioneer]]''.

===Corporate ownership through holding companies===
George Black died in June 1976, ten days after his wife, leaving Conrad Black and his older brother, Montegu, a 22.4% stake in [[Ravelston Corporation]], which by then owned 61% voting control of [[Argus Corporation]], an influential holding company in Canada. Argus controlled large stakes in five Canadian corporations: [[Hollinger Mines]], [[Standard Broadcasting]], [[Dominion Stores (historical)|Dominion Stores]], [[Domtar]] and [[Massey-Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;Francis, D. (1986). ''Controlling Interest&amp;nbsp;– Who Owns Canada''. Macmillan of Canada; {{ISBN|0-7715-9744-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollinger controlled Labrador Mining and Exploration and had a large stake in Noranda Mines. Black succeeded his father as a director of Dominion Stores and Standard Broadcasting, owner of radio stations CFRB (Toronto), CJAD (Montreal) and television station CJOH (Ottawa). Conrad Black became a director of the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=CIBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cibc.com/ca/pdf/investor/99-anl-rpt.pdf|format=PDF|title=Innovation: CIBC Annual Report 1999|website=Cibc.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through his father's position at Canadian Breweries, and his status as a co-founder of Ravelston, Black gained early association with two of Canada's most prominent businessmen: [[John A. McDougald|John A. "Bud" McDougald]] and [[E. P. Taylor]], the first two presidents of Argus. Following McDougald's death in 1978, Black paid $18 million to McDougald's widow and her sister for control of Ravelston and thereby, control of Toronto-based Argus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Newman|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interviews with the two sisters in their retirement homes in Florida were aired 21 September 1980 in the episode of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s ''[[The Canadian Establishment]]'', entitled "Ten Toronto Street". This episode covered the period during which Conrad Black became president of Argus Corporation following the death of McDougald. Black's new associate, Nelson M. Davis became chairman. [[Patrick Watson (producer)|Patrick Watson]], the host and narrator of series interviewed the two widows in their Florida retirement homes.&lt;ref name="Watson_Establishment_1980"&gt;{{citation|title=Ten Toronto Street|series=The Establishment|date=21 September 1980|work=National Film Board|author=Patrick Watson|location=Ottawa, Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black recorded that the widows "understood and approved every letter of every word of the agreement".&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt; Other observers admired Black for marshaling enough investor support to win control without committing a large block of personal assets.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt; He brought in new partners to replace Mrs. McDougal and her sister Mrs. W. Eric Philips.&lt;ref&gt;[[Argus Corporation#cite note-:0-2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Argus assets were already troubled, and others did not fit Black's long-term vision. Black resigned as Chairman of [[Massey Ferguson]] company on 23 May 1980, after which Argus donated its shares to the employees pension funds (both salaried and union).&lt;ref name=star/&gt; Hollinger Mines was then turned into a holding company that initially focused on resource-based businesses.&lt;ref name="Francis"/&gt;

In 1981 Norcen Energy, one of his companies, acquired a minority position in Ohio-based [[M. A. Hanna Company|Hanna Mining Co.]] In a filing with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), a disclosure was made to the effect that Norcen took "an investment position" in Hanna. The filing did not include a disclosure that Norcen's board planned to seek majority control. Black subsequently was charged by the SEC with filing misleading public statements. These charges were later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gale Directory of Company Histories: M. A. Hanna Company|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/m-a-hanna-company|quote=...in 1981, Canadian financier Conrad Black of Norcen Energy Resources, Ltd., initiated a year-long takeover battle. Black's purchase of a large block of Hanna stock in October 1981 quickly captured the attention of Hanna chairman Robert F. Anderson and other members of the board. After a relatively brief, but heated federal hearing, Black and Hanna made a standstill agreement that gave Black 20 percent of Hanna in exchange for $90 million. Black became a director, and the last descendant of an M. A. Hanna &amp; Company partner, George M. Humphrey II, resigned from his position as senior vice president by 1984.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dominion pension dispute===
In 1984, the Dominion Stores Board of which Montegu Black was the chairman, with the prior consent of the Ontario Pension Commission,  withdrew over $56&amp;nbsp;million from the Dominion workers' [[Pension fund|pension plan]] surplus which the management had generated. The company said it considered the surplus the rightful property of the employer (Dominion Stores Ltd.), as the shareholders would have to pay for any shortfall if the assets had been less successfully invested. The Dominion employees' union the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] protested, a public outcry ensued, and the case went to court. The [[Supreme Court of Ontario]] ruled against the company, and ordered the company to return the money to the pension fund, claiming that though the most recent language in the plan suggested the employer had ownership of the surplus, the original intention was to keep the surplus in the plan to increase members' benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adjustment.ca/example.shtml?x=96|title=Canadian Labour Congress: Dominion Food Stores|publisher=Adjustment.ca|accessdate=18 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the pension dispute was settled in equal shares between the shareholders and the plan members.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;

===Industrial holdings shifted to publishing===
Over time, Black focused formerly diverse activities of his companies on newspaper publishing. Argus Corporation, was one of Canada's most important conglomerates, though apart from Standard Broadcasting, it had less than 25% of the stock of the companies in which it was invested, and four fifths of its own stock did not vote. Black had negotiated the acquisition of that stock from Power Corporation chairman Paul G. Desmarais in 1979 to become, as put it a 'real proprietor'. Black supervised the divesting of interests in manufacturing, retailing, broadcasting and ultimately oil, gas and mining. Canadian writer [[John Ralston Saul]] argued in 2008, "Lord Black was never a real 'capitalist' because he never created wealth, only dismantled wealth. His career has been largely about stripping corporations. Destroying them."&lt;ref&gt;Gessell, Paul [http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=9715b6f8-36f5-4dbe-bda7-074dc7fb2a33 "Saul's Ottawa 'Truths{{' "}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012123615/http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=9715b6f8-36f5-4dbe-bda7-074dc7fb2a33 |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''The Ottawa Citizen'', 18 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist and writer [[George Jonas]], the former husband of Black's wife, Barbara Amiel, contends that Hollinger made its "investors... billions [of dollars]".&lt;ref name=Jonas&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/news/Conrad+Black+cheese+eating+Labrador+countless+vituperative+flights+fancy/3195569/story.html "Conrad Black, a cheese-eating Labrador and countless vituperative flights of fancy"], ''National Post'', 24 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black bought Quebec City's Le Soleil, Le Droit of Ottawa, and Le Quotidien of Chicoutimi from Jacques G. Francoeur.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Francœur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth and divestment of press holdings===
In 1986, [[Andrew Knight (journalist)|Andrew Knight]], then editor of ''[[The Economist]]'', advised Black an investment could be made in the ailing [[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]] Group (London, U.K.), and Black was able to gain control of the Group for £30 million.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt; By this investment, Black made his first entry into British press ownership. Five years later, he bought ''The Jerusalem Post'', and by 1990, his companies ran over 400 newspaper titles in North America, the majority of them small community papers.  For a time from this date he headed the third-largest newspaper group in the Western World.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3276689.stm "Conrad Black: Where did it all go wrong"], bbc.co.uk, 27 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Control of Australia's leading newspapers, the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age, and Australian Financial Review, albeit in a minority stockholding, was acquired in 1992. Initially in association with Sydney billionaire [[Kerry Packer]] and future Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. In 1994 Black and Radler bought Chicago's second newspaper, the [[Chicago Sun-Times|Sun-Times]].

Hollinger had bought a 23% stake in the Southam newspaper chain in 1992&lt;ref name="Conrad Black: Timeline"/&gt; from TORSTAR, publisher of the [[Toronto Star]]. Black and Radler acquired the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' in 1994. Hollinger International shares were listed on New York Stock Exchange in 1996, at which time the company boosted its stake in Southam to a control position.&lt;ref name="Matter"/&gt; Becoming a public company trading in the U.S. has been called "a fateful move, exposing Black's empire to America's more rigorous regulatory regime and its more aggressive institutional shareholders."&lt;ref name=star&gt;Olive, David [https://www.thestar.com/special/article/190670 "A Conrad Black timeline"], ''Toronto Star'', 11 March 2007; retrieved 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Black, Hollinger launched the ''[[National Post]]'' in Toronto in 1998.  This newspaper was sold throughout the country in direct competition with the [[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]. From 1999 to 2000 Hollinger International sold several newspapers in five deals worth a total of CDA $3 billion, a total that included millions of dollars in "non-compete agreements" for Hollinger insiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Black Trial: The deal breakers|url=http://www.macleans.ca/business/companies/article.jsp?content=20070730_107327_107327|publisher=Maclean's|author=Jason Kirby|author2=John Intini|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813043358/http://www.macleans.ca/business/companies/article.jsp?content=20070730_107327_107327|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fate of Hollinger===
Institutional investor [[Tweedy, Browne]] opposed the payment of non-compete fees to Hollinger Management in connection with the sales and requested a special committee look into the compensation of management the day before the annual meeting in May 2003.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.autodafe.co/|title=Auto da fe|last=Stein|first=Adrian and Olga|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black agreed citing such fees were standard procedure in the newspaper industry, had been requested by buyers and had been properly disclosed. The special committee and its counsel, former Chairman of the SEC [[Richard C. Breeden|Richard Breeden]], discovered that [[David Radler]] had misled the Hollinger directors, including Black about the extent of his own participation in some of the related party transactions to sell otherwise unclaimed community newspapers in the US and also that two of the smaller transactions involving non-compete payments had not been signed by the vendors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Breeden involved the US Attorney in Chicago, and Radler, after about 18 months, would promise to plead guilty to one count of fraud and to provide evidence against Black and others in exchange for a light sentence in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/david-radler-begins-prison-sentence/article18445652/|title=David Radler begins prison sentence|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black made an agreement with Breeden, shortly after the unsigned status of the two non-compete agreements came to light, by which he would remain as Chairman, but temporarily vacate the position of Chief Executive, pending verification that he, Black, had known nothing of these problems, which were handled by the company's counsel, and occurred in Radler's American Publishing division.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Black and Breeden were in negotiations, sponsored by [[Henry Kissinger|Henry A. Kissinger]], who was a Director of Hollinger, when the special committee, without warning, sued Black and others civilly. Black counter-sued, and included a libel suit in Canada. The libel settlement was by far the largest in Canadian history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/black-to-receive-substantial-libel-settlement-1.1098095|title=Black to receive 'substantial' libel settlement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hollinger group of companies was effectively dismantled as a result of the cascade of criminal and civil lawsuits that followed, in relation to sales of papers and intellectual property to third parties, most alleging misrepresentation and some alleging false or deliberately misleading accounts having been presented.&lt;ref name="BeasleyEtAl"&gt;{{cite book|author=Beasley, M.S., [[Frank A Buckless]], S.M.

Black resigned from the board of Hollinger in 2005, many of Hollinger International's assets ended up being sold at prices significantly lower than those contemplated by incomplete talks while Black was with the company.&lt;ref name=Auto&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170203083415/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.125.1106&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Auto Da Fé: Conrad Black, Corporate Governance, and the End of Economic Man"], ''Books in Canada'', December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 2000s, it was clear that Black had accurately anticipated the decline in profitability of print media assets and sought to divest those types of assets held by Hollinger before their value was irrevocably diminished. The criminal sanctions on Black not overturned were for removing 13 boxes of paper from his office a few days before he had to move offices, and under the gaze of security cameras he has installed, and for receiving US $285,000 as a non-compete payment that was approved by the independent director and publicly disclosed, but where the company secretary had neglected, in what the trial judge considered to be a clerical oversight, to have signed by the parties.&lt;ref name="Auto"/&gt;

==Lifestyle==
Born to a wealthy family, Black acquired the family home and {{Convert|7|acre|ha}} of land in Toronto's exclusive [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]] neighbourhood after his parents' deaths in 1976. Black and first wife Joanna Hishon maintained homes in Palm Beach, Toronto and London. After he married Barbara Amiel, he acquired a luxury Park Avenue apartment in New York. When the latter was sold in 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice seized net proceeds of $8.5&amp;nbsp;million, pending resolution of court actions.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Justice.

According to biographer [[Tom Bower]], "They flaunted their wealth."&lt;ref name=bower&gt;Bower, Tom: ''Conrad &amp; Lady Black&amp;nbsp;– Dancing on the Edge'' (London: HarperPress, 2006),&lt;/ref&gt; Black's critics suggested that it was Black's second wife, Amiel, who pushed him towards a life of opulence. Black has always denied that he spent more than his income and position justified. He has called claims that his wife charged personal expenses to a corporate account, including US$2,463  ([[Pound sterling|£]]1,272) for handbags, $2,785 for opera tickets, and $140 for Amiel's "jogging attire"&lt;ref name="Guard"&gt;Clark, Andrew: [http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,2035283,00.html "At some level, he's still asking the same question as he was when he was seven or eight&amp;nbsp;– who am I?"], ''The Guardian'', 16 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; fiction and has pointed out that they were never alleged at trial.

Black was convicted on four counts in [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] in Chicago on 13 July 2007. He was sentenced to serve 6½ years in federal prison and to pay Hollinger $6.1&amp;nbsp;million, in addition to a fine of US$125,000. Appeals resulted in two of Black's three criminal fraud charges being vacated, and his conviction for obstruction of justice was upheld. Black was initially found guilty of diverting funds for personal benefit from money due to Hollinger International, and of other irregularities. The alleged embezzlement occurred when the company sold certain publishing assets. He was also found guilty of one charge of obstruction of justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6897991.stm "Conrad Black convicted of fraud"], bbc.co.uk, 13 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the initial verdict, Black was fined $125,000 and sentenced to 6½ years in prison, serving a total of 37 months after two fraud charges were overturned by the [[7th Circuit Court of Appeals]], leaving one fraud charge and one obstruction of justice charge, and the improper receipt of $285,000, which was disclosed and approved but incompletely documented, and civil penalties from the SEC. The 6½ year sentence was reduced to 42 months.&lt;ref&gt;Ameet Sachdev [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-10-29/business/ct-biz-1030-conrad-black-20101029_1_honest-services-appeals-court-honest-services-fraud "Appeals court upholds Conrad Black's conviction on fraud, obstruction charges but guilty verdicts on two other fraud counts are vacated"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', 29 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The $6.1 million fine to the SEC was reduced to $4.1 million in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/business-23728144 "Conrad Black fined and banned by US"], bbc.com, 16 August 2013; accessed 3 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled 8–0 with one recusal, instructing the 7th Circuit to review all four of Black's convictions including the obstruction of justice charge, finding that the definition of [[honest services fraud]] used in Judge St. Eve's (the trial judge) charge to the jury in Black's case was too broad, "unconstitutionally vague",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/court+sets+aside+appeals+court+ruling+conrad+black+case/3195446/story.html|title=Court sets aside appeals court ruling in Conrad Black case|first=Sheldon|last=Alberts|website=www.nationalpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ruling the law could apply only to cases where bribes and [[kickback (bribery)|kickback]]s had changed hands and ordered the US 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago to review three fraud convictions against Black in light of the Supreme Court's new definition.

Black's legal representatives, led by [[Miguel Estrada]], advised the court they would not provide the requisite accounting{{Why|date=December 2016}} and would thus not be interested in petitioning the court further on the matter. Black was under no compulsion to make this disclosure as he had initiated the appeal for a bail variation of his own volition. His next court appearance, where he might reapply for permission to return to Canada, was set for 20 September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.macleans.ca/2010/08/06/conrad-black-drops-bid-to-return-to-canada Conrad Black drops bid to return to Canada – Need to know], Macleans.ca; 6 August 2010; accessed 26 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 2010, the US 7th Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed the dismissal of two of the three vacated fraud accounts and retained one and the obstruction count. The court ruled that he must be re-sentenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://financialpostbusiness.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/black-cta7-remand.pdf|format=PDF|title=UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

On 17 December 2010, Black lost an appeal as to fact and law on his remaining convictions for fraud and obstruction of justice. The three judge panel did not explain its reasoning.

Lipsky asked why Black was denied a retrial by jury as to whether he had committed pecuniary fraud after the Supreme Court unanimously found that Judge St. Eve's instructions to the jury were "incorrect", which led to two of the three fraud counts ultimately being vacated. In the end, one fraud conviction and a count of obstruction were allowed to stand.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Lipsky, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304314404576411574167553068 "A head-scratching verdict against Conrad Black"], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 28 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black's motion that the last remaining counts of conviction be vacated due to prosecutorial misconduct and his claim that he had been denied the right to have the defense counsel of his choice were denied in February 2013, along with his request for an evidentiary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conrad Black loses bid to void guilty verdict|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/02/20/conrad_black_loses_bid_to_void_guilty_verdict.html|accessdate=20 February 2013|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=20 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black continues to maintain his innocence, and has likened the United States justice system to that of North Korea. Black has publicly stated that he is proud to have been "sent to prison for crimes I would never dream of committing, for having fought it out as well as anyone could, and for making the best I could of a bad situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/conrad-black-dismisses-convictions-likens-u-s-to-north-korea-1.1007116|title=Conrad Black lashes out in feisty interview|website=Ctvnews.ca|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incarceration===
Until 21 July 2010,&lt;ref name=release/&gt; Black was incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution (Low Security) in [[Sumter County, Florida]],&lt;ref name="BOPpage"&gt;[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Conrad&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Black&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=29&amp;y=12 Conrad Black profile], [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]; retrieved 6 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a part of the [[Coleman Federal Correctional Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Agence France-Presse|url=http://www.canada.com/news/Eight+injured+riot+Conrad+Black+prison/1218912/story.html|title=Eight injured in riot at Conrad Black's Prison|publisher=Canada.com|date=26 January 2009|accessdate=18 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523125010/http://www.canada.com/news/Eight+injured+riot+Conrad+Black+prison/1218912/story.html|archive-date=23 May 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce, Julian.

Following his release, Black wrote a column for Canada's ''National Post'' on his time in prison. Black described U.S. inmates as an "ostracized, voiceless legion of the walking dead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/31/conrad-black-my-prison-education|title=Conrad Black: My prison education|website=Fullcomment.nationalpost.com|accessdate=3 April 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708034228/http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/07/31/conrad-black-my-prison-education|archivedate=8 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black did not return to the Federal Correctional Institution in [[Coleman, Florida]]. On 6 September 2011, he was sent to a different Florida federal correction facility, this one in [[Federal Correctional Institution, Miami|Miami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black won't return to Florida prison|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/article/1048263--black-won-t-return-to-florida-prison?bn=1|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=2 September 2011|first=Amanda|last=Kwan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released from prison on 4 May 2012. Although he became a citizen of the United Kingdom in 2001 and became a British peer, he chose to live in his native Canada after his prison term was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/conrad-black-released-from-florida-prison/article2422565|title=Conrad Black released from Florida prison|author=D'Aliesio, Renata|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=4 May 2012|location=Toronto|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507230015/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/conrad-black-released-from-florida-prison/article2422565/|archive-date=7 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was granted a one-year temporary resident permit to live in Canada in March 2012 when he was still serving his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/just-how-special-is-lord-blacks-residency-permit/article2420924|title=Just how special is Lord Black's residency permit?|author=Chase, Steven|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2 May 2012|accessdate=4 May 2012|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his release from prison, Black was deported to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/05/04/conrad-black-returns-to-toronto-after-serving-jail-time-in-u-s|title=Conrad Black returns to Toronto after serving jail time in U.S.|author=Staff|work=[[National Post]]|date=4 May 2012|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black has been barred from entering the United States for 30 years though that could be appealed at any time.

===Removal from the Order of Canada and Queen's Privy Council for Canada===
Black was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] in 1990. In 2011, after Black returned to prison due to the failure of his appeal, [[Rideau Hall]], the seat of the Chancellery of Honours, confirmed that the honour accorded to Black was under review by the order's Advisory Council, which has the power to recommend "[[Removal from the Order of Canada|the termination of a person's appointment to the Order of Canada]] if the person has been convicted of a criminal offence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Campion-Smith|first=Bruce|title=Conrad Black could be stripped of Order of Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1054001--conrad-black-could-be-stripped-of-order-of-canada?bn=1|accessdate=15 September 2011|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the review process started, Black submitted a written application in defence of keeping his place in the Order of Canada, but failed in his efforts to persuade the Advisory Council he should appear before them to defend his case orally. Black took the matter to the [[Federal Court of Canada]], which ruled that the council had no obligation to change its regular review process (which allows for written submissions only) simply to accommodate Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1277026--conrad-black-loses-order-of-canada-hearing-bid-federal-court-won-t-interfere?asid=94419050|location=Toronto, ON|title=Conrad Black loses Order of Canada hearing bid -- federal court won't interfere|work=The Star|date=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black attempted to appeal the court's decision without success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Allison|title=Conrad Black keeps fighting to make personal plea to keep Order of Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1281834--conrad-black-keeps-fighting-to-make-personal-plea-to-keep-order-of-canada|accessdate=2 November 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=2 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2012 interview, Black intimated that he would rather resign from the order than be removed: "I would not wait for giving these junior officials the evidently almost aphrodisiacal pleasure of throwing me out. I would withdraw," he told CBC's Susan Ormiston. "In fact, I wouldn't be interested in serving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pagliaro|first=Jennifer|title=Conrad Black will resign Order of Canada rather than have it terminated|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/1278376--conrad-black-will-resign-order-of-canada-rather-than-have-it-terminated|accessdate=26 October 2012|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governor General of Canada, [[David Johnston]], announced Black's removal from the Order of Canada and his expulsion from the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] in January 2014. Johnston had been recommended to do so by the Advisory Council of the Order of Canada and the Canadian Prime Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Termination of Appointment to the Order of Canada|url=http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=15498|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conrad Black stripped of Order of Canada|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conrad-black-stripped-of-order-of-canada-1.2519299|accessdate=31 January 2014|newspaper=CBC News|date=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Black may also no longer employ the [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominal initials]] ''OC'' and ''PC''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conrad Black stripped of the Order of Canada|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/conrad-black-stripped-of-the-order-of-canada/article16644365|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=31 January 2014|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations by the Ontario Securities Commission and Canada Revenue Agency==
In July 2013, the [[Ontario Securities Commission]] restarted its case against Black and two other former Hollinger executives, John Boultbee and Peter Atkinson. The regulator sought to have them banned from trading in the province's capital markets or sitting on a public board of directors. The case alleged violations of the ''Securities Act (Ontario)''. The case had been postponed pending the exhaustion of Black's appeals of his U.S. fraud convictions. The securities case alleges that Black and his two fellow directors created a scheme was to use the sale of several Hollinger newspapers in order to "divert certain proceeds from [Hollinger International] to themselves through contrived 'non-competition' payments".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Black applied to have the proceedings dismissed on the grounds that he was already voluntarily refraining from being an officer or director of an Ontario corporation and undertaken to ask the approval of the OSC if he ever desired to become a director or officer of an Ontario public company. In February 2015 the OSC placed a permanent ban on Black being a director or officer of a publicly traded company in Ontario, but declined to restrict his right to trade. Black referred to the case in his column in the National Post on March 8, 2015, stating that the OSC did not come to the subject with clean hands, having "vaporized" hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder's equity in 2005 when it blocked Black's bid to privatize Hollinger Inc., pushing that company into bankruptcy and a total loss for the shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/opinion/conrad-black-of-that-osc-ruling|title=Conrad Black: Of that OSC ruling...|date=7 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/02/27/osc-slaps-permanent-ban-on-conrad-black.html|title=OSC slaps permanent ban on Conrad Black|website=Thestar.com|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2014, the [[Tax Court of Canada]] ruled that Black owed the Canadian government taxes on $5.1-million of income accrued in 2002.&lt;ref name=taxcourt&gt;{{cite news|title=Conrad Black owes $5.1-million in back taxes, court rules|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/conrad-black-owes-51-million-in-back-taxes-court-rules/article16427540/|accessdate=21 January 2013|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=21 January 2013|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-May 2016, it was revealed that the CRA had intervened to prevent the sale and lease-back, with a buy-back option, of Black's home on Park Lane Circle. After discussion, the sale-lease back proceeded and Black provided other assets as security pending the settlement or adjudication of the CRA claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/conrad-blacks-toronto-mansion-sells-for-14-million/article30720630/|title=Conrad Black’s Toronto mansion sells for $14-million|date=30 June 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Peerage controversy and citizenship==
{{Main|Black v Chrétien}}In 2001, British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] advised Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to confer on Black a [[life peerage]] with the title of ''Baron Black of Crossharbour''.{{#tag:ref|With, not part of the main title, the [[territorial designation]], of Crossharbour in the [[London Borough]] of [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]''. This entitles him to the standard official style of "Lord Black".|group= n}}&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=56379|date=5 November 2001|page=12995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He would sit as a Conservative peer, and his name had been put forward by the then-Conservative leader [[William Hague]]. Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] advised the Queen not to appoint Black a peer, citing the [[Canadian titles debate|Nickle Resolution]] of 1919 and a long history since then of objections to Canadian citizens accepting British peerages. Black at the time held both Canadian and British citizenship. Black pointed out that the Nickle Resolution referred to Canadian resident citizens, not dual citizens living in the U.K and was not binding, but when Prime Minister Blair said the Queen would prefer not to choose between the conflicting recommendations of two prime ministers of countries of which she was the monarch, Black asked that the matter be deferred. He litigated in Canada, claiming that Chrétien had no jurisdiction to create a class of citizen in another country, consisting of one person (as there were other dual citizens in the House of Lords), ineligible to receive an honour in that country for services deemed to have been rendered in that country, because of the personal objections of the Canadian Prime Minister of the day. Later in 2001, after the Ontario Superior Court and Court of Appeal had ruled that they had no jurisdiction in this area, Black renounced his Canadian citizenship, remaining a United Kingdom citizen, which allowed him to accept the peerage without further controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/conrad-black-to-renounce-canadian-citizenship-1.255288|title=Conrad Black to renounce Canadian citizenship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black sat as a life peer on the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] benches until 2007, when he withdrew from the conservative group of peers following his conviction in the United States. He is currently a [[Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|non-affiliated peer]]. In an interview with BBC reporter [[Jeremy Paxman]] in 2012, Black stated that he could return to the [[House of Lords]] as a voting member. Comparing himself to [[Nelson Mandela]], Black said a criminal conviction does not prohibit him from sitting, since the House of Lords has no restriction on such a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tu Thanh Ha|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/conrad-black-says-he-could-still-sit-in-the-uk-house-of-lords/article4630790|title=Conrad Black says he could still sit in the U.K. House of Lords|publisher=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been on leave of absence from the House of Lords since June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Conrad Black stripped of two honours by his native Canada|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/01/conrad-black-stripped-honours-canada|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="parlbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-black-of-crossharbour/2182|title=Lord Black of Crossharbour profile|work=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Peter Mansbridge]] in May 2012, Black said he would consider applying for Canadian citizenship "within a few years", when he hoped the matter would no longer be controversial and he could "make an application like any other person who has been a temporary resident. It is not clear when or if he would be accepted, but has been a temporary for over five years with a full work permit.

==Books and other publications==
Black has written an autobiography and three substantial biographies of controversial 20th-century figures, plus a full-scale history of Canada:
* ''Duplessis'':&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|0-7710-1530-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black re-worked his 1973 Master's thesis on [[Maurice Duplessis]] into a rehabilitative biographical re-examination of the controversial long-serving Quebec premier, published in 1977.

** Black continues to contribute regular features to the ''National Post'', the newspaper he founded in 1998 and sold in 2001. In an article there, Black indicated that his next book will describe how his business empire was destroyed while court-protected managers enriched themselves and eradicated shareholder value. He says, "The judiciary and regulators in both countries are complicit in these events. They will have much to answer for. This is the real story, and I will publish it soon."&lt;ref&gt;Nationalpost.com&lt;/ref&gt; This came to pass in his book ''[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12410425-a-matter-of-principle?ac=1&amp;from_search=true A Matter of Principle]''
** In the November 2008 issue of ''Spear's'' magazine, Black wrote a diary piece from prison&lt;ref&gt;Black, Conrad.

** On 5 March 2009, Black contributed a piece to the online version of the conservative magazine ''[[National Review]]'' (NRO). Called ''Roosevelt and the Revisionists'' and based on his earlier biography of Roosevelt, it argued that FDR's New Deal was intended to save capitalism, and deserved conservative support. In her 9 March critique of this piece on NRO, author [[Amity Shlaes]] observed, "I will be co-hosting, with Dean Thomas Cooley of NYU/Stern, a ''Second Look'' conference on March 30 to permit scholars to present the multiple studies that suggest the New Deal and Great Depression are worth taking a look at from every angle.

Woven throughout the book, Black did not hide his contempt toward the prosecutors, and the people and media who he perceived betrayed him and harbored bias against him. Black reserved the most indignation toward the prosecutors who he believed mounted a campaign to destroy him. The book also discussed his views on politics, corporate governance, and the U.S. justice system and its need of reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/books/a-matter-of-principle-by-conrad-black/article2168792|title=Conrad Black comes out zinging|author=Bell, Douglas|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=16 September 2011|accessdate=23 February 2012|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
As a historian of place, Flores is "one of the best this country has produced," according to acclaimed author Annie Proulx.  "His work ranks with that of Thoreau, William Bartram, Aldo Leopold, John Muir, Peter Matthiessen."&lt;ref&gt;''Caprock Canyonlands'', Twentieth Anniversary Edition, ix.&lt;/ref&gt;  Douglas Brinkley calls him "a master of the American West and a personal hero."

Flores' latest book, ''Coyote America,'' has been widely praised as "terrific," "fascinating," "absorbing," and "brilliant."  ''Natural History'' proclaims "The coyote stories in this book are among the best, and Flores is a master storyteller."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Coyote-America-Natural-Supernatural-History/dp/0465052991/ref=pd_rhf_dp_p_img_2?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0R6F5C0J4HJJWAKPNK3P&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Elliott West has called Flores "one of the most respected environmental historians of his generation"&lt;ref&gt;''The Natural West'', back cover&lt;/ref&gt; and William Kittredge concurs, stating that Flores belongs in "the ranks of first-string Western American writers."  "Engaging and provocative," "personal, passionate, and scholarly,"&lt;ref&gt;https://kuecprd.ku.edu/~upress/cgi-bin/978-0-7006-2227-6.html&lt;/ref&gt; Flores' work draws broad praise, including from author William deBuys, who calls ''Horizontal Yellow'' "one of the best books about place you'll ever read.".&lt;ref&gt;''Horizontal Yellow'', back cover&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dark Ages reenactment''' is generally considered a sub-branch of [[Medieval reenactment]] focussing on the 1st millennium AD beginning with the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] and ending with the [[High Middle Ages]].

The term 'Dark Ages' is much used. Some groups define it as the period between the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], and the establishment of the main European Christian kingdoms - approx. 400 - 750 AD (CE), whereas others include the Viking period as well (extending as far as 1066 AD). Some people call the later half of this period "Early Medieval".

Most reenactment groups focus on a smaller time period, sometimes restricting their interest to a particular century, or even a specific decade, depending on how authentic the reenactment and encampment is intended to be. Typically Dark Ages reenactment groups focus on a specific time period and culture within this range, such as [[Vendel Age]] Vikings or the [[Picts]].

The largest Dark Age event in the UK is the [[Battle of Hastings]] [[Battle of Hastings reenactment|Reenactment]].

The establishment of a '''''{{lang|la|dominium maris baltici}}''''' ({{IPA-la|doˈminium ˈmaris balˈtitʃi|lang}}, "[[Baltic Sea]] dominion") was one of the primary political aims of the [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish]] and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Swedish]] kingdoms in the [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] and [[Early Modern era|early modern era]]s.&lt;ref name="FLETCHER1890"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

==Etymology==
The term, which is commonly used in historiography, was probably coined in 1563 by the king and grand duke of the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]], [[Sigismund II Augustus]], referring to the hegemonial ambitions of his adversaries in the [[Livonian War]].&lt;ref name="Roberts1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Roberts|title=The Swedish Imperial Experience 1560–1718|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4gekq8pCcC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=27 April 1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27889-8|pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written reference stems from the Dutch-Swedish treaty of 5 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) / 15 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|N.S.]]) April 1614, concluded in [[The Hague]].&lt;ref name="Roberts1984"/&gt;&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Treaty of The Hague, 5 (15) April 1614, article VIII of the Dutch version: "[...] sijne Koninghlijcke Majesteyt ende de Croon Sweeden, in haere Hoogheydt, Regalien, Rechten, Dominio Maris Baltici [...]" ("the sovereignty, regalia, rights, dominium maris baltici [...] of His Royal Majesty and the Swedish Crown", i.e. [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]]). printed in DuMont: Recueil des traitez d'alliance tome V, 1728, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wars over the Baltic==
Several European powers regarded the [[Baltic Sea]] as of vital importance.&lt;ref name="PlatzöderVerlaan1996"/&gt; It served as a source of important materials and as a growing market for many commodities.&lt;ref name="PlatzöderVerlaan1996"/&gt; So large did the importance of the region loom that it became of interest even to powers that did not have direct access to it, such as [[Austria]] and [[France]].&lt;ref name="PlatzöderVerlaan1996"/&gt; For several centuries, Sweden and Denmark would attempt to gain total control of the sea, a policy which other local and international powers opposed.&lt;ref name="BrandMüller2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PlatzöderVerlaan1996"/&gt; Historians have described the control of the Baltic as one of the main goals of Denmark's and Sweden's policies.&lt;ref name="DuchhardtOrtlieb1998"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scandinavian (Nordic) powers, who sensed opportunity in the power vacuum created by the weak or non-existent naval power of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland–Lithuania]], adopted expansionist policies which fostered conflict over the Baltic.&lt;ref name="BrandMüller2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts1984-18"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Roberts|title=The Swedish Imperial Experience 1560–1718|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4gekq8pCcC&amp;pg=PA18|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=27 April 1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27889-8|pages=18}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Denmark and Sweden used their control of parts of the Baltic to fuel their militaries.&lt;ref name="BrandMüller2007"/&gt; Each claimed the Baltic as their own, and promised to protect foreign shipping.&lt;ref name="BrandMüller2007"/&gt; While the Nordic powers vied with one another over control, they both agreed that it should be the domain of one of them, not of an "outsider" like Poland or Russia.&lt;ref name="Roberts1984"/&gt; The Scandinavian powers tried to prevent the rise of their opposition through diplomatic treaties, which forbade other powers like Russia or Germany to build navies, and through military actions, whether targeting opponent naval forces, or through taking control of the Baltic ports.&lt;ref name="Roberts1984"/&gt; In one of the most notable actions to retain its monopoly over the Baltic, Denmark in 1637 destroyed, without declaration of war, the nascent [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy]].&lt;ref name="Roberts1984"/&gt;

The numerous wars fought for the ''dominium maris baltici'' are often collectively referred to as the [[Northern Wars]].&lt;ref name="MayRosecrance2010"&gt;
{{cite book|author1=Ernest R. May|author2=Richard Rosecrance|author3=Zara Steiner|title=History and Neorealism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmdNJUQhd74C&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=30 November 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-13224-4|page=95}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Denmark had the upper hand, but eventually it lost ground to Sweden.&lt;ref name="Jansson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maija Jansson|title=Realities of representation: state building in early modern Europe and European America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FXOwc_10m-8C&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=7 June 2011|date=6 March 2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-7534-8|page=136}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Denmark nor Sweden managed to realize thorough military and economic control of the Baltic, though Sweden during [[Swedish Empire|her time as an empire]] came closest to that aim before the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700–1721.&lt;ref name="PlatzöderVerlaan1996"&gt;

===Danish ''dominium maris baltici''===
[[File:Haupthandelsroute Hanse.png|thumb|Main trading routes of the Hanseatic League]]

Historiography uses the term ''dominium maris baltici'' either in a narrower sense as a new Swedish concept of the Early Modern era, closely tied to the [[Swedish Empire]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=Geschichte Skandinaviens|first=Harm G.|last=Schröter|publisher=C.H.Beck|year=2007|isbn=3-406-53622-0|page=40|language=German}}
&lt;/ref&gt; or in a wider sense including the preceding Danish hegemony in the southern Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name=Bohn30&gt;Bohn, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

Denmark had subdued the southern Baltic coast from Holstein to Pomerania in the 12th century, but lost control in the 13th century after her defeat by German and Hanse forces in the [[Battle of Bornhöved (1227)]], retaining just the [[principality of Rügen]]. Thereafter, the [[Hanseatic League]] became the dominant economic power in the Baltic Sea.&lt;ref name=Bohn30/&gt; [[Robert Bohn]] credits [[Valdemar IV of Denmark|Valdemar IV "Atterdag" of Denmark]] (reigned 1340–1375) as the first Danish king to pursue a policy of establishing a Danish ''dominium maris baltici'', aiming at adding to Denmark's naval dominance an economical hegemony at the expense of the Hanseatic League.&lt;ref name=Bohn30/&gt; To achieve this aim, Valdemar sold [[Danish Estonia]] to the [[Teutonic Order state]] in 1346, consolidating his finances and raising an army from the revenue.&lt;ref name=Bohn30/&gt; After initial territorial gains, Valdemar [[Battle of Visby|conquered]] the Hanseatic town of [[Visby]] ([[Gotland]]) in 1361, resulting in a war decided in favour of the League in the [[Treaty of Stralsund (1370)|peace of Stralsund]] in 1370, which marked the climax of Hanseatic power.&lt;ref name=Bohn31&gt;Bohn, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Atterdag's daughter and ''de facto'' successor, [[Margaret I of Denmark|Lady Margaret]], managed to concentrate the crowns of Denmark, [[medieval Norway|Norway]] and [[Kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]] in her [[Copenhagen]]-centered [[Kalmar Union]] from 1397.&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, pp. 32–34&lt;/ref&gt; In 1429, Kalmar king [[Eric of Pomerania]] started to raise the [[Sound Dues]] from merchants entering or leaving the Baltic Sea, allowing the Copenhagen court to benefit from the Baltic Sea trade profits without engaging in economic adventures itself.&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Sound Dues, imposed until 1857 and constituting a primary source of income for the Royal treasury, quickly became a contentious issue, which brought Denmark into conflict with the Hanseatic League and the neighboring powers.&lt;ref&gt;Bohn, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

After the break-up of the Kalmar Union in the early 16th-century, the [[Kingdom of Sweden]] became [[Denmark–Norway]]'s primary rival for hegemony in the Baltic Sea. [[Christian IV of Denmark]]'s victory in the [[Kalmar War]] in 1613 marked the last instance of a successful defense of a Danish ''dominium maris baltici'' against Sweden; subsequent wars ended in Sweden's favor of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The period of Danish intervention in the [[Thirty Years' War]] of 1618–1648 (''Kejserkrigen'' of 1625–1629) is also considered{{by whom|date=November 2013}} part of the wars for the ''dominium maris baltici''&lt;ref name=Olesen383&gt;Olesen, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;—in this war, however, the opponent was not the Swedish king, but the ambitious [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]], who temporarily planned to establish the Empire as a naval power in the Baltic. He assigned this task to [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]], leading to a concerted action by Denmark and Sweden in the [[Battle of Stralsund (1628)|defense of Stralsund]]. The Danish defeat in the [[Battle of Wolgast]] (1628) and the subsequent [[Treaty of Lübeck]] in 1629, however, removed Denmark from the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Olesen394&gt;Olesen, p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swedish ''dominium maris baltici''===

After Sweden had become independent from the Kalmar union, she became Denmark's major rival for the ''dominium maris baltici''. The first war ascribed to this conflict is the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] (1563–1570, associated with the [[Livonian War]]), which between 1611 and 1613 followed the above-mentioned [[Kalmar War]].&lt;ref name=Olesen383/&gt; Major Swedish successes followed the capture of [[Riga]] in 1621&lt;ref name=Olesen386&gt;{{cite book|title=Gemeinsame Bekannte: Schweden und Deutschland in der Frühen Neuzeit|editor1-first=Ivo|editor1-last=Asmus|editor2-first=Heiko|editor2-last=Droste|editor3-first=Jens E.|editor3-last=Olesen|first=Jens E.|last=Olesen|chapter=Christian IV og dansk Pommernpolitik|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin-Hamburg-Münster|year=2003|isbn=3-8258-7150-9|language=Danish|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Treaty of Stettin (1630)|Swedish landing in Pomerania in 1630]].&lt;ref name=Olesen394/&gt; The gains in the [[Torstenson War]],&lt;ref name=Olesen383/&gt; a theater of the [[Thirty Years' War]], humiliated Denmark, and the subsequent [[Peace of Westphalia]] confirmed Sweden's status as a European great power ([[Swedish Empire|''stormaktstiden'']]). Swedish control of the Baltic was not thorough, however, since the [[maritime power]]s, especially the [[Dutch Republic]], continued to be economically and militarily present and pursued their [[European balance of power|balance of power policy]] also in respect to Denmark and Sweden. The [[Second Northern War]],&lt;ref name=Olesen383/&gt; the [[Scanian War]]&lt;ref name=Olesen383/&gt; and the [[peace of Travendal|first stage]] of the [[Great Northern War]]&lt;ref name=Olesen383/&gt; left Sweden's ''dominium maris baltici'' intact, yet it was finally ended by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721. Sweden had sought to secure her ''dominium maris baltici'' by turning many towns (e.g. Riga, Narva, Wismar) into fortresses, often under the aegis of [[Erik Dahlbergh]].&lt;ref&gt;Wahrmann, pp. 36–38&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Thirty Years' War, Sweden collected customs (''Licenten'') from merchant vessels on the Baltic Sea, in Swedish as well as in non-Swedish ports.&lt;ref&gt;Wahrmann, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; These customs were calculated as a certain percentage of the value of transported goods, and once payment took place in any port, the respective receipt was valid for the whole ''dominium maris baltici''.&lt;ref&gt;Wahrmann, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The failure of the Scandinavian powers to take control of the Baltic, and steadfast refusal of other powers – local and international – to recognize their claims, is seen as one of the factors that led to the development of the "[[freedom of the seas]]" principle in [[international law]].&lt;ref name="PlatzöderVerlaan1996"/&gt;

'''Dropmire'''  is a [[surveillance#By the United States government|surveillance]] program by the United States' [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) aimed at surveillance of foreign embassies and diplomatic staff, including those of [[NATO]] allies. The program's existence was revealed in June 2013 by [[whistleblower]] [[Edward Snowden]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/30/nsa-leaks-us-bugging-european-allies New NSA leaks show how US is bugging its European allies], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 June 2013.

Earlier in June 2013, ''The Guardian'' had reported that the NSA spied on diplomats during the [[2009 G-20 London Summit]], but no precise program name was revealed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/16/gchq-intercepted-communications-g20-summits GCHQ intercepted foreign politicians' communications at G20 summits], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 17 June 2013.

Diplomatic spying by the United States had been revealed as far back as 2010, when it was revealed that US agencies had spied on the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]] – at the time, it was not known that this had been done as part of a systematic program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/wikileaks-cables-hillary-clinton-ban WikiLeaks cables: Hillary Clinton meets Ban Ki-moon after spying revelations], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 Dec 2010.

'''Evenor''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Εὐήνωρ}}) is the name of a character from the myth of [[Atlantis]] and of several historical figures.

==Myth==
In the ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'', a work of the Greek philosopher [[Plato]], a man named Evenor is described as the ancestor of the kings who ruled the legendary island of [[Atlantis]]. According to the account given by Plato's character Critias, Evenor was among the original inhabitants of Atlantis born from the earth ([[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthons]]). He lived with his wife Leucippe on a low hill in the centre of the island, about fifty [[stadia (length)|stadia]] from the sea. The couple had one daughter, Cleito. When Cleito reached marriageable age, her parents died, but the god [[Poseidon]] slept with her and she became mother of five pairs of twin sons. Her oldest son, Atlas, became the first king of Atlantis, with the other sons as subordinate governors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Plat.+Criti.+113c 113c&amp;ndash;114c].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

One Evenor was a [[Greece|Greek]] painter who flourished around 420 BC, the father and teacher of the better-known painter [[Parrhasius (painter)|Parrhasius]] of [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Philip Smith |editor=[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] |encyclopedia=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] |title=Evenor |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1192.html |accessdate=2007-11-30 |year=1867 |volume=2 |pages=84 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907205940/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1192.html |archivedate=2007-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was a Greek [[surgery|surgeon]] and medical author who lived in or before the 3rd century BC and apparently wrote about fractures and [[joint dislocation]]s; if he is the same as an Evenor quoted by [[Pliny the Elder]], he also wrote about the medicinal properties of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=William Alexander Greenhill |editor=William Smith |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |title=Evenor |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1192.html |accessdate=2007-11-30 |year=1867 |volume=2 |pages=84 |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=Boston |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907205940/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1192.html |archivedate=2007-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Plin.+Nat.+20.73 20.73], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Plin.+Nat.+21.105 21.105].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horatio Bardwell Cushman''' (August 13, 1820 – October 18, 1904) was an [[United States|American]] historian. He is known for writing a ''History of the Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Natchez Indians.'' The book is well known source for [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]], and [[Natchez people|Natchez]] Indian history.

==Personal life==

Cushman was born on August 13, 1820 in Oktibbeha County, Mississippi. He was the son of missionaries who worked at [[Mayhew, Mississippi]]. Cushaman, as a child, witnessed the Choctaw Indians' removal from 1831 to 1833. During the American Civil War, Cushman served as a private in the 43rd Mississippi Infantry. After the War in 1868, Cushman moved to Texas near the Red River where the Choctaw Nation was found. In 1884, Cushman began writing his Choctaw and Chickasaw history. He spent six years researching for the book. It was first printed in 1899. He died on October 18, 1904 and was buried in Greenville, Texas.

The '''House of Stuart''', originally '''Stewart''', was a European [[royal house]] that originated in Scotland. The dynasty's patrilineal, putatively [[Bretons|Breton]] ancestors had held the office of [[High Steward of Scotland]] since [[Walter FitzAlan]] in around 1150, after arriving by way of [[Norman England]]. The royal Stewart line was founded by [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] (a maternal grandson of [[Robert the Bruce]]), whose descendants were Kings and Queens of Scots from 1371 until the union with England in 1707. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], was brought up in France, where she adopted the French spelling of the name, ''Stuart''. Her son, [[James VI of Scotland]], inherited the thrones of England and Ireland upon the death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1603. Except for the period of the Commonwealth, 1649–1660, the Stuarts were monarchs of [[the British Isles]] and its [[British Empire|growing empire]], until the death of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in 1714.{{refn|While the [[Earl of Galloway|Earls of Galloway]] are the senior surviving line of the Stuarts, they descend from a line which originated from the second son of [[Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland]]. Thus, they are not members of the Stewart/Stuart royal line, but they are part of the [[peerage]].|group=note}}

In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603. James VI of Scotland then inherited the realms of Elizabeth I of England, becoming James&amp;nbsp;I of England and Ireland in the [[Union of the Crowns]]. Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688, two Stuart queens ruled the isles: [[Mary II of England|Mary II]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]. Both were the Protestant daughters of [[James II of England|James VII and II]] by his first wife. Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who would be brought up a Roman Catholic and would precede his half-sisters; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters. But neither had any children who survived to adulthood, so under the terms of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] and the [[Act of Security 1704]], the crown passed to the [[House of Hanover]] on the death of Queen Anne in 1714.

During the reign of the Stuarts, Scotland developed from a relatively poor and feudal country into a prosperous, modern and centralised state.{{clarify|date=August 2014}} They ruled during the transitive period in European history between the [[Middle Ages]], via the [[Renaissance]], to the midpoint of the [[early modern period]]. Monarchs such as [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] were known for sponsoring exponents of the [[Northern Renaissance]] such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], among others. After the Stuarts reigned over all of Great Britain, the arts and sciences continued to develop; [[William Shakespeare]] wrote many of his best known plays during the [[Jacobean era]], while institutions such as the [[Royal Society]] and the [[Royal Mail]] were established during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

== Origins ==

=== Etymology ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
The name "Stewart" derives from the political position of office similar to a governor, known as a ''[[Steward (office)|steward]]''. It was originally adopted as the family surname by [[Walter Stewart, 3rd High Steward of Scotland]], who was the third member of the family to hold the position. Prior to this, family names were not used, but instead they had [[patronym]]s defined through the father; for example the first two High Stewards were known as ''[[Fitz]]''Alan and FitzWalter respectively. The gallicised spelling was first borne by [[John Stewart of Darnley]] after his time in the French wars. During the 16th century, the French spelling ''Stuart'' was adopted by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], when she was living in [[Kingdom of France|France]]. She sanctioned the change to ensure the correct pronunciation of the [[Scots Language|Scots]] version of the name ''Stewart'', because retaining the letter 'w' would have made it difficult for French speakers, who followed the Germans in usually rendering "w" as /v/. The spelling ''Stuart'' was also used by her second husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]; he was the father of [[James VI and I]], so the official spelling ''Stuart'' for the British royal family derives from him.

=== Background ===
The ancestral origins of the Stuart family are obscure—their probable ancestry is traced back to [[Alan FitzFlaad]], a [[Breton people|Breton]] who came over to Great Britain not long after the [[Norman conquest]].&lt;ref name="stewartorigins"&gt;{{cite web |title=J.H. Round: The Origin of the Stewarts: Part 1|url=http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/sources/round/stewarts1.shtml|publisher=MedievalGenealogy.org.uk}} Retrieved on 13 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan had been the hereditary steward of the [[Bishop of Dol|Bishop]] of [[Dol-de-Bretagne|Dol]] in the [[Duchy of Brittany]];&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;Bartlett, ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings, 1075–1225'', 544.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan had a good relationship with the ruling [[Norman Dynasty|Norman]] monarch [[Henry I of England]] who awarded him with lands in [[Shropshire]].&lt;ref name="bartlett" /&gt; The FitzAlan family quickly established themselves as a prominent [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] noble house, with some of its members serving as [[High Sheriff of Shropshire]].&lt;ref name="bartlett" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lieber, ''Encyclopædia Americana'', 30.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the great-grandson of Alan named [[Walter FitzAlan]] who became the first hereditary [[High Steward of Scotland]], while his brother William's family would go on to become [[Earl of Arundel|Earls of Arundel]].

When the civil war in the [[Kingdom of England]], known as [[The Anarchy]], broke out between legitimist claimant [[Empress Matilda|Matilda, Lady of the English]] and her cousin who had usurped her, [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]], Walter had sided with Matilda.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, '' The Anarchy of King Stephen's Reign'', 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Another supporter of Matilda was her uncle [[David I of Scotland]] from the [[House of Dunkeld]].&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; After Matilda was pushed out of England into the [[Count of Anjou|County of Anjou]], essentially failing in her legitimist attempt for the throne, many of her supporters in England fled also. It was then that Walter followed David up to the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], where he was granted lands in [[Renfrewshire]] and the title for life of Lord High Steward.&lt;ref name="king" /&gt; The next monarch of Scotland, [[Malcolm IV of Scotland|Malcolm IV]], made the High Steward title a hereditary arrangement. While High Stewards, the family were based at [[Dundonald, South Ayrshire]] between the 12th and 13th centuries.

The sixth High Steward of Scotland, [[Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland|Walter Stewart]] (1293–1326), married [[Marjorie Bruce|Marjorie]], daughter of [[Robert the Bruce]], and also played an important part in the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] gaining further favour. Their son [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert]] was heir to the [[House of Bruce]], the Lordship of Cunningham and the Bruce lands of [[Bourtreehill]]; he eventually inherited the Scottish throne when his uncle [[David II of Scotland|David II]] died childless in 1371.

In 1503, [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] attempted to secure peace with [[Kingdom of England|England]] by marrying [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]]'s daughter, [[Margaret Tudor]]. The birth of their son, later [[James V of Scotland|James V]], brought the House of Stewart into the line of descent of the [[House of Tudor]], and the English throne. Margaret Tudor later married [[Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus]], and their daughter, [[Margaret Douglas]], was the mother of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]]. In 1565, Darnley married his half-cousin [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], the daughter of [[James V of Scotland|James V]]. Darnley's father was [[Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox]], a member of the [[Stewart of Darnley]] branch of the House. Lennox was a descendant of [[Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland]], also descended from [[James II of Scotland|James II]], being Mary's [[heir presumptive]]. Thus Darnley was also related to Mary on his father's side and because of this connection, Mary's heirs remained part of the House of Stuart. Following [[John Stewart of Darnley]]'s ennoblement for his part at the [[Battle of Baugé]] in 1421 and the grant of lands to him at [[Aubigny-sur-Nère|Aubigny]] and [[Concressault]], the Darnley Stewarts' surname was gallicised to ''Stuart''.

Both Mary, Queen of Scots, and Lord Darnley had strong claims on the English throne, through their mutual grandmother, Margaret Tudor. This eventually led to the accession of the couple's only child [[James VI and I|James]] as King of Scotland, England, and Ireland in 1603. However, this was a [[Personal Union]], as the three Kingdoms shared a monarch, but had separate governments, churches, and institutions. Indeed, the personal union did not prevent an armed conflict, known as the [[Bishops' Wars]], breaking out between England and Scotland in 1639. This was to become part of the cycle of political and military conflict that marked the reign of [[Charles I of England]], Scotland and Ireland, culminating in a series of conflicts known as the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]]. The trial and execution of Charles I by the English Parliament in 1649 began 11 years of republican government known as the [[English Interregnum]]. Scotland initially recognised the late King's son, also called [[Charles II of England|Charles]], as their monarch, before being subjugated and forced to enter Cromwell's Commonwealth by [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|General Monck]]'s occupying army. During this period, the principal members of the House of Stuart lived in exile in [[mainland Europe]]. The younger Charles returned to Britain to assume his three thrones in 1660 as "[[Charles II of England]], Scotland and Ireland", but would date his reign from his father's death eleven years before.

In feudal and dynastic terms, the Scottish reliance on French support was revived during the reign of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whose own mother was French. His sister [[Henrietta Anne Stuart|Henrietta]] married into the French royal family. Charles II left no legitimate children, but his numerous illegitimate descendants included the [[Duke of Buccleuch|Dukes of Buccleuch]], the [[Duke of Grafton|Dukes of Grafton]], the [[Duke of Saint Albans|Dukes of Saint Albans]] and the [[Duke of Richmond|Dukes of Richmond]].

[[File:0 Monument funéraire des derniers Stuarts - Basilique St-Pierre - Vatican (1).JPG|thumb|right|upright 1.3|[[Monument to the Royal Stuarts]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] – Work of [[Antonio Canova]].]]
These French and Roman Catholic connections proved unpopular and resulted in the downfall of the Stuarts, whose mutual enemies identified with Protestantism and because [[James II of England|James VII and II]] offended the Anglican establishment by proposing tolerance not only for Catholics but for Protestant Dissenters. The [[Glorious Revolution]] caused the overthrow of King James in favour of his son-in-law and his daughter, [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]]. James continued to claim the thrones of England and Scotland to which he had been crowned, and encouraged [[Jacobite risings|revolts]] in his name, and his grandson [[Charles Edward Stuart|Charles]] (also known as Bonnie Prince Charlie) led an ultimately [[Jacobite rising of 1745|unsuccessful rising in 1745]], ironically becoming symbols of conservative [[Radicalism (historical)|rebellion]] and [[Romanticism]]. Some blame the identification of the Roman Catholic Church with the Stuarts for the extremely lengthy delay in the passage of [[Catholic emancipation]] until Jacobitism (as represented by direct Stuart heirs) was extinguished; however it was as likely to be caused by entrenched anti-Catholic prejudice among the Anglican establishment of England. Despite the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] intentions of tolerance to be extended to [[Kingdom of Ireland|Irish subjects]], this was not the preference of Georgian Tories and their failure at compromise played a subsequent role in the present division of Ireland.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

== Present-day ==
The Royal House of Stuart became extinct with the death of Cardinal [[Henry Benedict Stuart]], brother of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], in 1807. [[Franz, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Francis of Bavaria]] is the current senior heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/07/nking107.xml |title=Act repeal could make Franz Herzog von Bayern new King of England and Scotland |accessdate=22 June 2008 |first=Richard |last=Alleyne |author2=de Quetteville, Harry |date=7 April 2008 |work=[[Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Charles II had a number of illegitimate sons whose surviving [[Descendants of Charles II of England|descendants in the male line]] include [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 11th Duke of Richmond]]; [[Henry FitzRoy, 12th Duke of Grafton]]; [[Murray Beauclerk, 14th Duke of St Albans]]; and [[Richard Scott, 10th Duke of Buccleuch]]. In addition, James II's illegitimate son, [[James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick]], founded the [[House of FitzJames]] comprising two branches, one in France and one in Spain.  The last of the French branch died in 1967; the senior heir of James II's male line descendants is [[Jacobo Hernando Fitz-James Stuart, 16th Duke of Peñaranda de Duero]].

=== Monarchs of Great Britain and Ireland ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}
These monarchs used the title "King/Queen of Great Britain", although that title had no basis in law until the [[Acts of Union 1707]] came into effect on 1 May 1707. Legally, they each [[personal union|simultaneously occupied two thrones]], as "King/Queen of England" and "King/Queen of Scotland".

{{for|the food "hundun"|Wonton}}
'''Hundun''' ({{zh|c=混沌|p=Hùndùn|w=Hun-tun|l= muddled confusion}}) is both a "legendary faceless being" in [[Chinese mythology]] and the "primordial and central [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]]" in [[Chinese creation myth|Chinese cosmogony]], comparable with the [[World egg]].

==Linguistics==
''Hundun'' 混沌 was semantically extended from a mythic "primordial chaos; nebulous state of the universe before heaven and earth separated" to mean "unintelligible; chaotic; messy; mentally dense; innocent as a child".

In modern [[Written Chinese]], ''hùndùn'' "primordial chaos" is 混沌, but [[Chinese classic texts]] wrote it either 渾沌 ( in the Daoist classic ''Zhuangzi'', etc.) or 渾敦 (''Zuozhuan''). ''Hùn'' "chaos; muddled; confused" is written either ''hùn'' [[Wikt:混|混]] "abundantly flowing; turbid water; torrent; mix up/in; confuse; muddle through; drift along; thoughtless; senseless" or ''hún'' [[Wikt:渾|渾]] ([[Simplified Chinese character]] [[Wikt:浑|浑]]) "sound of running water; muddy; muddled; turbid; concealed; confused; dull; stupid; unsophisticated; whole; all over". These two are interchangeable graphic variants readable as ''hún'' 混 "muddy; dirty; filthy" (e.g., [[Mandarin slang]] ''húndàn'' 渾蛋/混蛋 "filthy egg"; bastard; scumbag") and ''hùn'' 渾 "nebulous; stupid" (''hùndùn'' 渾沌). ''Dùn'' "dull; confused" is written either ''dùn'' [[Wikt:沌|沌]] "dull; confused; stupid" or ''dūn'' [[Wikt:敦|敦]] "thick; solid; generous; earnest; honest; sincere".

Isabelle Robinet outlines the etymological origins of ''hundun''.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Semantically, the term ''hundun'' is related to several expressions, hardly translatable in Western languages, that indicate the void or a barren and primal immensity – for instance, ''hunlun'' 混淪, ''hundong'' 混洞, ''kongdong'' 空洞, ''menghong'' 蒙洪, or ''hongyuan'' 洪元. It is also akin to the expression "something confused and yet complete" (''huncheng'' 混成) found in the ''Daode jing'' 25, which denotes the state prior to the formation of the world where nothing is perceptible, but which nevertheless contains a cosmic seed. Similarly, the state of ''hundun'' is likened to an egg; in this usage, the term alludes to a complete world round and closed in itself, which is a receptacle like a cavern (''dong'' 洞) or a gourd (''hu'' 壺or ''hulu'' 壺盧). (2007:524) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:Wonton 1.JPG|thumb|A shrimp [[wonton]]]]
Most [[Chinese characters]] are written using "[[radical (Chinese character)|radicals]]" or "semantic elements" and "[[phonetic]] elements". ''Hùndùn'' 混沌 is written with the "water radical" 水 or 氵and phonetics of ''kūn'' 昆 and ''tún'' 屯. ''Hùndùn'' "primordial chaos" is [[cognate]] with [[wonton|Huntun]] (''húntun'', 餛飩, 馄饨) "wonton; dumpling soup" written with the "eat radical" 食. Note that the English [[loanword]] ''[[wonton]]'' is borrowed from the [[Cantonese]] pronunciation ''wan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;tan&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''. Mair suggests a fundamental connection between ''hundun'' and ''wonton'': "The undifferentiated soup of primordial chaos. As it begins to differentiate, dumpling-blobs of matter coalesce. … With the evolution of human consciousness and reflectiveness, the soup would have been adopted as a suitable metaphor for chaos."&lt;ref&gt; Mair, V. "Wandering on the way: Early Daoist tales and parables of Chuang Tzu". New York: Bantam Books, 1994, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; This last assertion appears unsupported however, since wonton soup is not attested in Chinese sources dating earlier than the Han dynasty, &lt;ref&gt; Eberhard, W. "Local Cultures of South and East China", 1968, Brill, p.440&lt;/ref&gt; although the linguistic connection of the soup to the larger concept certainly appears real. &lt;ref&gt; Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Anderson, E. "The Food of China", 1988, Yale, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Girardot, N.J. "Myth and meaning in early Taoism", 1983, University of California Press, pp.29-38 &lt;/ref&gt;

''Hundun'' 混沌 has a graphic variant ''hunlun'' 混淪 (using ''lún'' 淪/沦 "ripples; eddying water; sink down", see the ''Liezi'' below), which etymologically connects to the mountain name [[Kunlun Mountain (mythology)|Kunlun]] 崑崙 (differentiated with the "mountain radical" 山). Robinet (2007:525) says, "Kunlun and ''hundun'' are the same closed center of the world."
 
Girardot &lt;ref&gt;Girardot, N.J. "Myth and meaning in early Taoism", 1983, University of California Press, p.25 &lt;/ref&gt; quotes the Chinese philologist Lo Mengci 羅夢冊 that reduplicated words like ''hundun'' "suggest cyclic movement and transformation", and speculates. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Ritually mumbling the sounds of ''hun-tun'' might, therefore, be said to have a kind on incantatory significance that both phonetically and morphologically invokes the mythological and ontological idea of the Tao as the ''creatio continua'' process of infinitely repeated moments of change and new creation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]'' does not enter ''dun'' 沌 (which apparently lacked a pre-Han [[Seal script]]). It defines ''hun'' 混 as ''fengliu'' 豐流 "abundantly flow", ''hun'' 渾 as the sound of ''hunliu'' 混流 "abundantly-flowing flow" or "seemingly impure", ''dun'' 敦 as "anger, rage; scolding" or "who", and ''lun'' 淪 as "ripples; eddies" or "sink into; disappear".

English ''chaos'' is a better translation of ''hundun'' in the classical sense of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|''Chaos'' or ''Khaos'']] in [[Greek mythology]] meaning "gaping void; formless primordial space preceding creation of the universe" than in the common sense of "disorder; confusion". The latter meaning of ''hundun'' is synonymous with Chinese ''luàn'' [[Wikt:亂|亂]] (Simplified [[Wikt:乱|乱]]) "chaos; disorder; upheaval; confusion; turmoil; revolt; indiscriminate; random; arbitrary". Their [[compound (linguistics)|linguistic compound]] ''hùnluàn'' 混亂 (lit. "chaos-chaos") "chaos; disorder; confusion" exemplifies the "synonym compound" category in Chinese [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]].

==Early textual usages==
In the Chinese written record, ''hundun'' first appears in classics dating from the [[Warring States period]]. The following summary divides them into Confucianist, Daoist, and other categories, and presents them in roughly chronological order, with the caveat that many early textual dates are uncertain.

===Confucian texts===
''Hundun'' only occurs in one Confucian classic, the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' commentary to the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals|Chunqiu]]''. Most early Confucianist ancient texts (''[[Lunyu]]'', ''[[Shujing]]'', ''[[Yijing]]'', etc.) do not even use ''hun'', with four exceptions. One, the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mengzi]]'', uses ''hun'' in its original meaning "sound of flowing water". Mencius explains why Confucius praised water, "There is a spring of water; how it gushes out!" (tr. Legge 1872 2:324). The other three use ''hun'' as what Girardot (1983:119) calls "a term of opprobrium and condemnation related to the suppression of the "barbarians" or the "legendary rebels"." 
The ''[[Shijing]]'' (237) mentions Hunyi 混夷 "ancient [[Hunni]] tribe in [[Turan]]". When [[King Wen of Zhou]] opened up the roads, "The hordes of the Keun [sic] disappeared, Startled and panting. (tr. Legge 1872 4:441). The ''Chunqiu'' mentions the Luhun 陸渾 tribe of the [[Rong people|Rong]] 戎 people, "the Jung of Luh-hwăn" (tr. Legge 1872 5:293, 667). The ''Zuozhuan'' commentary to the ''Chunqiu'' notes they were originally from western [[Gansu]] and forced into northern [[Henan]].

Another ''Zuozhuan'' context refers to Hundun 渾敦 as a worthless son of the [[Yellow Emperor]], one of the mythical ''Sixiong'' 四凶 "Four Fiends" banished by [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]].
&lt;blockquote&gt; The ancient emperor Hung [Hwang-te] had a descendant devoid of ability [and virtue]. He hid righteousness from himself, and was a villain at heart; he delighted in the practice of the worst vices; he was shameless and vile, obstinate, stupid, and unfriendly, cultivating only the intimacy of such as himself. All the people under heaven called him Chaos. … When Shun became Yaou's minister, he received the nobles from the four quarters of the empire, and banished these four wicked ones, Chaos, Monster, Block, and Glutton, casting them out into the four distant regions, to meet the spite of the sprites and evil things. (tr. Legge 1872 5:283)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The other "fiends" are Qiongqi 窮奇, Taowu 梼杌, and [[Taotie]] 饕餮. Legge notes this passage "is worthy of careful study in many respects."

Girardot (1983:129) contrasts these rare Confucian usages of ''hundun'' pejoratively suggesting the forces thwarting civilization, "the "birds and beasts," barbarian tribes, banished ministers, and legendary rebels)" with the common Daoist usages in a "paradise lost theme".

===Daoist texts===
''Hundun'' commonly occurs in classics of philosophical Daoism. The ''[[Daodejing]]'' does not mention ''hundun'' but uses both ''hun'' graphic variants. One section (49, Mair translation) uses ''hun'' 渾 "bemuddle": "The sage is self-effacing in his dealings with all under heaven, and bemuddles his mind for the sake of all under heaven."&lt;ref&gt;Lao Tzu, "Tao Te Ching: The Classic Book of Integrity and the Way". Translated by Mair, V. 1990, Bantam, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Three others (14, 15, 25) use ''hun'' 混 "bound together," "muddled," and "featureless": 
*"These three cannot be fully fathomed, Therefore, They are bound together to make unity."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p.74&lt;/ref&gt;
*"plain, as an unhewn log, muddled, as turbid waters, expansive, as a broad valley"&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p.76&lt;/ref&gt;
*"There was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth."&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (ca. 3rd-2nd centuries BCE) has a famous parable involving emperors ''Hundun'' 渾沌, ''Shu'' [[Wikt:儵|儵]] "a fish name; abrupt; quick", and ''Hu'' [[Wikt:忽|忽]] "ignore; neglect; sudden". Girardot (1983:89) cites [[Marcel Granet]] that Shu and Hu synonymously mean "suddenness; quickness" and "etymologically appear to be linked to the images of lightning and thunder, or analogously, flaming arrows." The "[[Heavenly Questions]]" chapter of the ''[[Chu Ci]]'' uses Shu and Hu as one name: "Where are the hornless dragons which carry bears on their backs for sport? Where is the great serpent with nine heads and where is the Shu-Hu?" (tr. Hawkes 1985:128)
&lt;blockquote&gt;The emperor of the South Sea was called Shu [Brief], the emperor of the North Sea was called Hu [Sudden], and the emperor of the central region was called Hun-tun [Chaos]. Shu and Hu from time to time came together for a meeting in the territory of Hun-tun, and Hun-tun treated them very generously. Shu and Hu discussed how they could repay his kindness. "All men," they said, "have seven openings so they can see, hear, eat, and breathe. But Hun-tun alone doesn't have any. Let's trying boring him some!" Every day they bored another hole, and on the seventh day Hun-tun died. (7, tr. Watson 1968:97)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two other ''Zhuangzi'' contexts use ''hundun''. Chapter 11 has an allegory about [[Hong Meng]] 鴻蒙 "Big Concealment" or "Silly Goose", who "was amusing himself by slapping his thighs and hopping around like a sparrow", which Girardot (1983:110) interprets as shamanic dancing comparable with the ''Shanhaijing'' below. Hong Meng poetically reduplicates ''hunhun-dundun'' 渾渾沌沌 "dark and undifferentiated chaos" in describing Daoist "mind-nourishment" meditation. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"You have only to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body, spit out hearing and eyesight, forget you are a thing among other things, and you may join in great unity with the deep and boundless. Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless, and the ten thousand things one by one will return to the root – return to the root and not know why. Dark and undifferentiated chaos – to the end of life none will depart from it. But if you try to know it, you have already departed from it. Do not ask what its name is, do not try to observe its form. Things will live naturally and of themselves." (tr. Watson 1968:122) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Chapter 12 tells a story about the Confucian disciple [[Disciples of Confucius#Zi-gong|Zigong]] becoming dumbfounded after meeting a Daoist sage. He reported back to Confucius, who denigrated ''Hundun Shi zhi shu'' 渾沌氏之術 "the arts of Mr. Chaos [Hundun]":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"He is one of those bogus practitioners of the arts of Mr. Chaos. He knows the first thing but doesn't understand the second. He looks after what is on the inside but doesn't look after what is on the outside. A man of true brightness and purity who can enter into simplicity, who can return to the primitive through inaction, give body to his inborn nature, and embrace his spirit, and in this way wander through the everyday world – if you had met one like that, you would have had real cause for astonishment. As for the arts of Mr. Chaos, you and I need not bother to find out about them." (12, tr. Watson 1968:136) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Huainanzi]]'' has one occurrence of ''hundun'' 渾沌 in a cosmological description.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Heaven and earth were perfectly joined [''tung-t'ung'' 洞同], all was chaotically unformed [''hun-tun wei p'u'' 渾沌為樸]; and things were complete [''ch'eng'' 成] yet not created. This is called [the time or condition] of the Great One. [''t'ai-i'' 太一]. All came from this unity which gave to each thing its differences: the birds, fish, and beasts. This is called the lot [or division, ''fen'' 分] of things. (14, tr. Girardot 1983:134) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Three other ''Huainanzi'' chapters use ''hun'', for example, the compound ''hunhun cangcang'' 渾渾蒼蒼 "pure and unformed, vast and hazy".
&lt;blockquote&gt;The world was a unity without division into classes nor separation into orders (lit: a disorganised mass): the unaffectedness and homeliness of the natural heart had not, as yet, been corrupted: the spirit of the age was a unity, and all creation was in great affluence. Hence, if a man with the knowledge of I [羿 A mythical person of great powers] appeared, the world had no use for him. (2, tr. Morgan 1934:46) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Liezi]]'' uses ''hunlun'' 渾淪 for ''hundun'', which is described as the confused state in which ''[[qi]]'' 氣 "pneuma; breath", ''xing'' 形 "form; shape", and ''zhi'' 質 "matter; substance" have begun to exist but are still merged as one.
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a Primal Simplicity, there was a Primal Commencement, there were Primal Beginnings, there was a Primal Material. The Primal Simplicity preceded the appearance of the breath. The Primal Beginnings were the breath beginning to assume shape. The Primal Material was the breath when it began to assume substance. Breath, shape and substance were complete, but things were not yet separated from each other; hence the name "Confusion." "Confusion" means the myriad things were confounded and not yet separated from each other. (1, tr. Graham 1960:18-19) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other texts===
The ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' collection of early myths and legends uses ''hundun'' 渾敦 describing a ''[[shen (Chinese "spirit; god")|shen]]'' 神 "spirit; god" on [[Tian]] Shan 天山 "Heaven Mountain".
&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a god here who looks like a yellow sack. He is scarlet like cinnabar fire. He has six feet and four wings. He is Muddle Thick. He has no face and no eyes. He knows how to sing and dance. He is in truth the great god Long River. (2, tr. Birrell 2000:226) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This "great god Long River" translates Di Jiang 帝江 "Emperor [[Yangtze River]]"{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}, which is identified with Huang Di 黄帝 "[[Yellow Emperor]]"{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}. [[Toshihiko Izutsu]] (1967 2:19, cited by Girardot 1983:82) suggests that singing and dancing here and in ''Zhuangzi'' refers to shamanic trance-inducing ceremonies, "the monster is said to be a bird, which is most probably an indication that the shamanistic dancing here in question was some kind of feather dance in which the shaman was ritually ornamented with a feathered headdress."

The ''Shen yi jing'' 神異經 "Classic of Divine Wonders" records a later variation of Hundun mythology. It describes him as a divine dog who lived on Mt. Kunlun, the mythical mountain at the center of the world.
&lt;blockquote&gt;It has eyes but can't see, walks without moving; and has two ears but can't hear. It has the knowledge of a man yet its belly is without the five internal organs and, although having a rectum, it doesn't evacuate food. It punches virtuous men and stays with the non-virtuous. It is called. Hun-tun.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Quoting the [[Zuozhuan]], Hun-tun was Meng-shih's untalented son. He always gnaws his tail, going round and round. Everyone ridiculed him. (tr. Girardot 1983:188) 

A poem in the [[Tang Dynasty]] collection [[Hanshan (poet)|Hanshan]] refers to the ''Zhuangzi'' myth and reminisces about ''Hundun''.
&lt;blockquote&gt; How pleasant were our bodies in the days of Chaos, Needing neither to eat or piss! Who came along with his drill And bored us full of these nine holes? Morning after morning we must dress and eat; Year after year, fret over taxes. A thousand of us scrambling for a penny, We knock our heads together and yell for dear life. (78, tr. Watson 1970:77) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Note the addition of two holes (anus and penis) to the original seven (eyes, ears, nostrils, and mouth).

==Interpretations==
''Hundun'' myths have a complex history, with many variations on the "primordial chaos" theme and associations with other legends.

The sociologist and historian [[Wolfram Eberhard]] analyzed the range of various ''hundun'' myths in his book (1968:438-446) on local cultures in South and East China. He treated it as a [[World egg]] mythic "chain" from the southern Liao culture, which originated in the [[Sichuan]] and [[Hubei]] region.
#''Hundun'' creation myths involving humanity being born from a "thunder-egg" or lump of flesh, the son of an emperor, the [[Thunder god]] represented as a dog with bat wings, localized with the [[Miao people]] and Tai peoples.
#''The animal Lei'' (the rare character combines the "dog radical" 犭with a ''lei'' 雷 "thunder" phonetic) "is a creature like a lump, without head, eyes, hands, or feet. At midnight it produces noises like thunder." (1968:440)
#''The hundun dumplings'', etymologically connected with "round", "unorganized; chaotic", and perhaps the "round mountain" Kunlun.
#''The world-system huntian'' 渾天 in ancient [[Chinese astronomy]] conceptualized the universe as a round egg and the earth as a yolk swimming within it.
#''The sack and the shooting of the god'' connects sack-like descriptions of ''hundun'', perhaps with "sack" denoting "testicles", legends about [[Shang Dynasty]] king [[Wu Yi (ruler)|Wu Yi]] who lost a game of chess with the god Heaven and suspended a sack filled with blood and shot arrows at it, and later traditions of shooting at human dolls.
#''[[Pangu]]'' 盤古 is the mythological creator of the universe, also supposedly shaped like a sack, connected with dog mythologies, and who grew into a giant in order to separate Heaven and Earth. 
#''Heaven and earth as marital partners'' within the world-egg refers to the theme of [[Sky father]] and Earth [[Mother goddess]].
#''Zhongli'' 重黎 or 融黎 is identified with [[Zhu Rong (god)|Zhu Rong]] 祝融 "god of fire", which is a mythology from the southern state [[Chu (state)|Chu]], with variations appearing as two gods Zhong and Li.
#''Zhongli'' 重黎 clan, which has variant writings, originated in the [[Ba (state)]], near present-day [[Anhui]]. 
#''The brother-sister marriage'' is a complex of myths explaining the origins or mankind (or certain families), and their first child is usually a lump of flesh, which falls into pieces and populates the world. In later mythology, the brother [[Fu Xi]] and sister [[Nüwa]], who lived on Mt. Kunlun, exemplify this marriage.

Norman J. Girardot, professor of Chinese religion at [[Lehigh University]], has written articles and a definitive book on ''hundun''. He summarizes this mythology as follows.
#The ''hun-tun'' theme in early Taoism represents an ensemble of mythic elements coming from different cultural and religious situations. 
#The symbolic coherence of the ''hun-tun'' theme in the Taoist texts basically reflects a creative reworking of a limited set of interrelated mythological typologies: especially the cosmic egg-gourd, the animal ancestor-cosmic giant, and primordial couple mythologies. The last two of these typologies are especially, although not exclusively, linked to what may be called the deluge cycle of mythology found primarily in southern local cultures. 
#While there may also be a cultural connection between the southern deluge cycle and the cosmogonic scenario of the cosmic egg (i.e., via the "thunder-egg," "origin of ancestors [culture hero] from egg or gourd," and "origin of agriculture and mankind from gourd" myths), the fundamental linkage for all these typologies is the early Taoist, innovative perception of a shared symbolic intention that accounts for, and supports, a particular cosmogonic, metaphysical, and mystical vision of creation and life. (1983:209)

Interpretations of ''Hundun'' have expanded from "primordial chaos" into other realms. For instance, it is a keyword in ''[[Neidan]]'' "Chinese [[internal alchemy]]". Robinet (2007:525) explains, "Alchemists begin their work by "opening" or "boring" ''hundun''; in other words, they begin from the Origin, infusing its transcendent element of precosmic light into the cosmos in order to reshape it."

==In popular culture==
The ''[[Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness]]'' television series features a rhinoceros villain named Hundun. Characters of the same name are also featured in ''[[The Legend of Korra (video game)|The Legend of Korra'' video game]]'' as the primary antagonist and the gauntlet mode of ''Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate''. In the 2013 movie Pacific Rim, a Kaiju that attacks Manila is named Hundun.

An '''inkhorn term''' is any [[loanword|foreign borrowing]] (or a word created from existing word roots by an English speaker) into English deemed to be unnecessary or overly pretentious.

== Etymology ==

An inkhorn is an [[inkwell]] made out of [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]. It was an important item for many scholars and soon became symbolic of writers in general. Later, it became a byword for fussy or pedantic writers.

{{ quote
| And ere that we will suffer such a prince,&lt;br /&gt;So kind a father of the commonweal,&lt;br /&gt;To be disgracèd by an inkhorn mate
| ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'', [[William Shakespeare]]
}}

== Adoption ==
Controversy over inkhorn terms was rife from the mid-16th to the mid-17th century, during the transition from [[Middle English]] to [[Modern English]].  It was also a time when English competed with Latin as the main language of science and learning in England, having already displaced French.&lt;ref&gt;(227) ''A Biography of the English Language'', 2nd. Ed. C.M. Millward&lt;/ref&gt; Many new words were being introduced into the language by writers, often self-consciously borrowing from [[Classical literature]]. Critics regarded these words as useless, usually requiring knowledge of Latin or [[Greek language|Greek]] to be understood.  They also contended that there were words with identical meaning already in English.  Some of the terms did indeed seem to fill a [[semantic gap]] in English (often technical and scientific words) whereas others coexisted with native ([[Germanic languages|Germanic]]) words with the same or similar meanings and often supplanted them. The phrase "inkhorn term" appeared as early as 1553.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]], ''The Arte of Rhetorique'', 1553: "Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that wee neuer affect any straunge ynkehorne termes, but to speake as is commonly receiued:" (modernized spelling: "Among all other lessons this should first be learned, that we never affect any strange inkhorn terms, but to speak as is commonly received:"),[http://www.ric.edu/faculty/rpotter/inkhorn.html Original texts from the inkhorn debate]&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Thomas Elyot]] and [[George Pettie]] were enthusiastic borrowers of new words whereas [[Thomas Wilson (rhetorician)|Thomas Wilson]] and [[John Cheke]] argued against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.oed.com/aspects-of-english/english-in-time/early-modern-english-an-overview/|title=Early modern English – an overview|website=Oxford English Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheke wrote:

{{ quote
| I am of this opinion that [[Anglish|our own tung should be written cleane and pure]], unmixt and unmangeled with borowing of other tunges; wherein if we take not heed by tiim, ever borowing and never paying, she shall be fain to keep her house as bankrupt.
}}

Many of these so-called inkhorn terms, such as ''dismiss'', ''celebrate'', ''encyclopedia'', ''commit'', ''capacity'' and ''ingenious'', stayed in the language and are commonly used. Many other [[neologism]]s faded soon after they were first used; for example ''expede'', which is now all but obsolete, although the synonymic derivative ''expedite'' and the similar word ''impede'' survive. Faced with the influx of these new words from foreign languages, some writers{{who|date=November 2018}} tried to either resurrect older English words (''gleeman'' for ''musician'' – see [[Glee (music)|glee]], ''sicker'' for ''certainly'', ''inwit'' for ''conscience'', ''yblent'' for ''confused'') or create wholly new words from [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] roots (''endsay'' for ''conclusion'', ''yeartide'' for ''anniversary'', ''foresayer'' for ''prophet'').

== Legacy ==
{{see|Linguistic purism in English}}
Few of these words created in opposition to inkhorn terms remained in common usage and the writers who disdained the use of [[Latinate]] words often could not avoid using other words of foreign origin. Although the inkhorn controversy was over by the end of the 17th century, many writers have attempted to return to what they saw as the purer roots of the language. [[William Barnes]] created a whole lexicon of words such as ''starlore'' for ''astronomy'' and ''speechcraft'' for ''grammar'' but his words were not widely accepted.

[[George Orwell]] famously analysed and criticised the socio-political impact of the usage of such words:

{{ quote
| Bad writers, and especially scientific, political, and sociological writers, are nearly always haunted by the notion that Latin or Greek words are grander than Saxon ones, and unnecessary words like expedite, ameliorate, predict, extraneous, deracinated, clandestine, subaqueous, and hundreds of others constantly gain ground from their [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]] opposite numbers.
| George Orwell, ''[[Politics and the English Language]]''

Loccenius was given the title ''[[Rikshistoriograf]]'' in 1651.&lt;ref name="KühlmannGruyter2010"/&gt; In the 1650s he moved from the study of Swedish medieval law to writing on the general history of Sweden.

'''John of Biclaro''', '''Biclar''', or '''Biclarum''' (''circa'' 540 - after 621), also ''Iohannes Biclarensis'', was a [[Visigoth]] [[chronicle]]r. He was born in [[Lusitania]], in the city of ''Scallabis'' (modern [[Santarém, Portugal|Santarém]] in [[Portugal]]).  He was also bishop of [[Girona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium''. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1991) vol. 3, p. 1062&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
He was educated at [[Constantinople]], where he devoted between 7-17 years to the study of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. 

== Career ==

=== Imprisonment ===
When he returned to his homeland, he was imprisoned for several years in [[Barcelona]]. [[Isidore of Seville]] ascribes this to his refusal to join the [[Arianism|Arian Church]] of the Visigothic realm in [[Hispania]].

Modern historians note that other contemporary Iberian sources, including John's own ''Chronicle'' do not attest a Visigothic campaign of persecution of Catholics until the revolt of [[Hermenegild]] divided Visigothic loyalties. The Visigothic persecutions of dissenters and [[Jews]] may be a more recent Catholic myth. Indeed, John wrote that, in 578, "[[Leovigild]] had peace to reside with his own people."{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}

A more likely reason for John's detention was his lengthy stay at Constantinople, with the possibility that he might be a spy for the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governors in the far south of Iberia. An enforced stay in Barcelona certainly put him out of possible treasonous contact with the Byzantines. John does imply that Arians received favorable treatment under Leovigild, once, in connection with the Arian council convened by Leovigild in 580, where Catholic bishops were ignored.

=== Monastery ===
After Leovigild's death in 586, John was released and founded a [[Benedictine monastery]] at ''Biclaro'' (the exact site is undetermined), where he presided as [[abbot]] and finished his ''Chronicle'' (in 590), before he was appointed Catholic [[Bishop]] of [[Girona]] under the new episcopal government.

=== Bishop ===
John took part in the synods of [[Zaragoza]] (592), of Barcelona (599), and of [[Terrassa|Egara (''Municipium Flavium Egara'')]] (614). His chronicle, which is a continuation (from 567) of the chronicle of [[Victor of Tunnuna]], in Africa (''Chronicon continuans Victorem Tunnunensem''), reaches to the year 590.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Conquerors and Chroniclers of Early Medieval Spain|last = Wolf|first = Kenneth Baxter|publisher = Liverpool University Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0-85323-554-6|location = Google Books|pages = 2|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5B05kwHFOnMC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=Victor+of+Tunnuna&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K-LDGSnUKL&amp;sig=dv5AD0nBjFfGHSCIVO48JjOQEsU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mw8eVJuMDM-6ogTH04G4Dw&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=biclaro&amp;f=false|accessdate = Sep 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was printed as early as 1600. It is the most complete and reliable authority on Leovigild's stormy reign, and on the Visigothic conversion from Arianism to Catholicism.

Three other chronicles cover parts of the Visigothic rule of Hispania: the bishop [[Hydatius]], bishop [[Isidore of Seville]], both of the doctrinally unified Catholic Visigothic establishment, and the fragmentary but apparently secular Chronicle of Zaragoza.

A bishop of [[Girona]] known as ''Johannes Gerundensis'' ("John of Girona") seems to have been a successor of the chronicler, though some have identified him with the chronicler.

==Biography==
Gjerde was born in [[Waterloo, Iowa]], and grew up in [[Cedar Falls, Iowa]], the youngest of three children in a family of Norwegian immigrants. His father, Waldemar Gjerde, was a professor of education at the [[University of Northern Iowa]], but died when Jon Gjerde was young; his mother was a schoolteacher. Gjerde himself attended the University of Northern Iowa, and graduated in 1975 with a double major in history and philosophy and religion. He went on to graduate studies in history at the [[University of Minnesota]], earning a master's degree in 1978 and a Ph.D. in 1982.

|date= April 2009
|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching at the University of Minnesota, the [[University of Wisconsin]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]], Gjerde joined the UC Berkeley faculty in 1985. He was tenured in 1989. Gjerde served as resident director of the Scandinavian Study Center in [[Lund, Sweden]] from 1991 to 1992. He served as  chair of the history department at UC Berkeley from 2001 to 2004, was named interim dean of social sciences in 2006 and was confirmed as dean in 2007.   Like his father, he died in his 50s of a heart attack; he died in [[Albany, California]]. The Jon and Ruth Gjerde Graduate Student Endowment was established to benefit the UC Berkeley History Department.&lt;ref name="anwar"/&gt;

Gjerde's research concerned European [[immigration]] to the [[Midwestern United States]] and European immigrants in the midwest. Among other accolades, Gjerde won three Theodore Saloutos Memorial Book awards for his writings on immigration and agricultural history. He was most commonly associated with his two prizewinning books, ''From Peasants to Farmers: The Migration from Belestrand, Norway, to the Upper Middle West'' (1989) and ''The Minds of the West: Ethnocultural Revolution in the Rural Middle West, 1830–1917'' (1997)

== History ==
[[File:Entrevue de l'expedition de M. Kotzebue avec le roi Tammeamea dans l'ile d'Ovayhi, Iles Sandwich.jpg|thumb|200px|left|King Kamehameha's court at Kailua-Kona, receiving [[Otto von Kotzebue]] in 1816]]
The community was established by King [[Kamehameha I]] to be his seat of government when he was chief of Kona before he consolidated rule of the archipelago in 1795. It was later designated as the capital of the newly unified [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The capital was later moved to [[Lāhainā, Hawai'i|Lāhainā]], and then to [[Honolulu]]. 

[[Ancient Hawaiian aquaculture|Royal fishponds]] at [[Honokōhau Settlement and Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park|Kaloko-Honokōhau National Historical Park]] were the hub of unified [[Hawaiian culture]]. The town later functioned as a retreat of the Hawaiian royal family. Up until the late 1900s, Kailua-Kona was primarily a small fishing village.&lt;ref name="Doughty"&gt;Doughty, Andrew.

'''Kosovo Ballet''' was established in 1972. Since its inception, there have been two main generations of the company. They are known as the "First Generation" and the "Second Generation", which is also known as the new generation. The First Generation refers to the founding members of Kosovo Ballet who performed with the company until its forced disbanding. The Second Generation refers to the group of dancers who trained under Ahmet Brahimaj to reform Kosovo Ballet following the Yugoslav Wars.

==First Generation==

Ballet dancers from the First Generation were educated at the Secondary School of Ballet in [[Skopje]], under the direction of [http://dancefestskopje.com.mk/eng/unesko.asp Tatjana Petkovska]. Following their graduation, 25 dancers from this class returned to [[Pristina]] where they formed the official first generation of The Kosovo Ballet within the [[National Theatre of Kosovo]].&lt;ref name="Baleti i Kosovës"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baletikosoves.com/about.html|title=About|last=Baleti i Kosovës|publisher=Baleti i Kosovës|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company would go on to perform throughout former [[Yugoslavia]],  at the ''Ballet Biennale'' in [[Ljubljana]], and the ''Summer Games'' in [[Dubrovnik]]. Unfortunately the company was forcibly disbanded in 1991 due to ongoing violence and the threat of ethnic cleansing from the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

Members of the first generation included: Ahmet Brahimaj, Rustem Selca, Asma Mulla, Selajdin Kice, Gani Loshi, and Jonuz Beqiraj. They performed under the direction of [[:sq:Abdurrahman Nokshiqi|Abdurrahman Nokshiqi]]. Due to the lack of female ballet dancers, five female ballet dancers from Skopje joined the company (including Nexhmije Meha Selma and Sabrije Spahiu Shkreli), as well as two ballet dancers from Kosovo (Enver Elshani and Jashar Berisha).  

During this period, Kosovo Ballet worked many guest artists from around the world. These dancers included, England: Vanda Ibra, Suzan Lejk and Xhoana Xhenkins; Poland: Joana Andziak, Lidija Tomashevska and Ana Stavnjak; Romania: Lilana Benudau; Belgrade: Vjollca Curri; and The Philippines: Marja Bertlan.

==Second Generation==

In 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seyward-darby/looking-within-kosovo-ballet_b_1696887.html|title=Setting The Stage: The Kosovo National Ballet (PHOTOS)|last=Darby|first=Seyward|date=2012-07-24|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with the conclusion of the Yugoslav Wars, Ahmet Brahimaj&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.balkaneu.com/kosovos-ballet-institutional-ties-albanias-ballet/|title=Kosovo’s Ballet, no institutional ties with Albania’s Ballet|website=www.balkaneu.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the decision to rebuild the company. Pursuing this endeavor, he established the first High School of Ballet in collaboration with Prenk Jakova; the Secondary Musical School, and began to recruit young people. Five years later, the first class of this school graduated under his directorship.&lt;ref name="Historiku i Baletit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Teatri Kombëtar|title=Historiku i Baletit|url=http://www.teatrikombetar.eu/?id=4|accessdate=24 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, these dancers comprise the core ensemble of Kosovo Ballet as the company's Second Generation.

==Repertoire==

Following its re-establishment, the company worked closely with the Albanian choreographer Gjergj Prevazi to stage four of his modern dance works: ''Tranzicioni II'' (''Transition II''), ''S'po dëgjohet gong'' (''Can't hear the gong''), ''Kontrast'' (''Contrast'') and ''Performance''. The company worked extensively with Elton Cefa to build up its repertoire of classical ballets. Under his guidance, the company performed excerpts from ''Don Quixote'', ''Giselle'', ''Le Corsaire'', and ''Swan Lake.'' A fortuitous relationship with the Bulgarian prima-ballerina Sylvia Tomov started the production of full-length classical ballets for the company, in this instance ''Sleeping Beauty''.

Additional acclaimed works within the company's repertoire include:

Sergey Sergeev's staging of ''Carmen''

Konstantin Uralsky's ''More Than Two to Tango''

Arian Ibërshimi's ''The Paganini Rhapsody'' and ''Ping Pong Spectrum''

This is a descriptive '''list of art from the [[Stone Age]]''', the period of [[prehistory]] characterised by the widespread use of [[stone tool]]s. This page contains, by sheer volume of the artwork discovered, a very incomplete list of the works of the painters, sculptors, and other artists who created what we now call prehistoric art. For fuller lists see [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]], [[Art of the Middle Paleolithic]], and [[:Category:Prehistoric art]] and its many sub-categories.

[[File:Five Myr Climate Change.svg|400px|thumb|5 million year history, representing the Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) LR04 Benthic Stack]]
'''Marine Isotope Stage 11''' or '''MIS 11''' is a [[Marine Isotope Stage]] in the [[geologic temperature record]], covering the [[interglacial]] period between 424,000 and 374,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Lisiecki2005"&gt;{{cite web|doi=10.1029/2004PA001071|url=http://www.lorraine-lisiecki.com/LR04_MISboundaries.txt|title=A Pliocene-Pleistocene stack of 57 globally distributed benthic δ18O records|author1=Lisiecki,Lorraine E.|author2=Raymo, Maureen E.|authorlink2=Maureen Raymo|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the [[Hoxnian Stage]] in Britain.

Interglacial periods which occurred during the [[Pleistocene]] are investigated to better understand present and future climate. Thus, the present interglacial, the [[Holocene]], is compared with MIS 11 or [[Marine Isotope Stage 5]].

== Characteristics ==
MIS 11 represents the longest and warmest interglacial interval of the last 500 kyr. In fact, it shows the highest-amplitude deglacial warming in the last 5 Myr  and possibly lasted twice the other interglacial stages. MIS 11 is characterized by overall warm sea-surface temperatures in high latitudes, strong [[thermohaline circulation]], unusual  blooms of calcareous [[plankton]] in high latitudes, higher [[sea level]] than the [[Current sea level rise|present]], [[coral reef]] expansion resulting in enlarged accumulation of neritic carbonates, and overall poor pelagic carbonate preservation and strong dissolution in certain areas. MIS 11 is considered the warmest interglacial period of the last 500,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=W.R. |last=Howard |title=A warm future in the past |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6641 |pages=418–9 |year=1997 |doi= 10.1038/41201|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v388/n6641/full/388418a0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concentration of {{CO2}}==
[[Carbon dioxide]] concentration during MIS 11 was possibly similar to that documented in the [[pre-industrial]] period, but not especially high when compared to other interglacial periods (for example, {{CO2}} concentration was probably higher during MIS 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Raynaud |first=D. |last2=Barnola |first2=J.M. |last3=Souchez |first3=R. |last4=Lorrain |first4=R. |last5=Petit |first5=J.R. |last6=Duval |first6=P. |last7=Lipenkov |first7=V.Y. |title=Palaeoclimatology: the record for marine isotopic stage 11 |journal=Nature |volume=436 |issue=7047 |pages=39–40 |date=July 2005  |pmid=16001055 |doi=10.1038/43639b }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a peculiar feature of MIS 11 is that an early {{CO2}} peak, usually associated to the deglaciation in response to increasing temperatures, is not detected.

Seemingly, the long-lasting interglacial conditions that are documented during MIS 11 depend on the peculiar interplay between  {{CO2}} concentration and insolation. In fact, during periods of both [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] and [[precession]] minima, even small variations in total [[insolation]] might lead the control of climate to greenhouse gasses, in particular {{CO2}}.

==Carbonate productivity==
In [[neritic|shallow-water]] environments, the development of several major reef systems (such as the [[Great Barrier Reef]]) accompanied increased reef carbonate production. Calcium carbonate production peaked in subpolar and subtropical oceans, reflecting a shift in plankton ecology from [[diatom]]s to calcareous plankton due to changes in seawater temperatures, which were apparently warmer at low latitudes. The increased production of carbonate in either [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and mid-latitude open-ocean environments may partly explain the high rates of carbonate sediments dissolution during MIS 11 throughout ocean basins, such as the Indian and Pacific. Indeed, increases in regional carbonate productivity can be only explained by increased carbonate dissolution in other (source) areas. Another explanation for the presence of barrier-reef tracts at low latitudes during MIS 11 is that tropical continental shelves were (at least partly) flooded in response to a major marine transgression (see below).

Moreover, the collapse of at least one major ice sheet has to be inferred in order to produce similar high sea-levels, nevertheless, the stability of these ice sheets is one of the main questions in climate-change research: in fact, controversial geologic evidences suggest that present-day polar ice sheets might have been disrupted (or drastically shrunk) during previous Pleistocene interglacials.

The increased sea level requires reduction in modern polar ice sheets and is consistent with the interpretation that both the [[West Antarctica]] and the [[Greenland]] ice sheets were absent, or at least greatly reduced, during MIS 11. Sedimentary deposits from Greenland suggest a near-complete [[deglaciation]] of south Greenland, and a subsequent sea level rise of 4.5 to 6  metres of sea-level-equivalent volume during MIS 11, around 410,000 to 400,000  years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v510/n7506/full/nature13456.html|title=South Greenland ice-sheet collapse during Marine Isotope Stage 11|doi=10.1038/nature13456|journal=Nature|pages=525–528|date=June 25, 2014|volume=510|author1=Alberto V.

Ullman |pmid=24965655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomical features==
In contrast to most other interglacials of the late Quaternary, MIS 11 cannot be straightforwardly explained and modelled solely within the context of [[Milankovitch]] forcing mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=R.A. |last2=MacDonald |first2=G.J. |title=Glacial Cycles and Astronomical Forcing |journal=Science |volume=277 |issue= |pages= 215–218|year=1997 |doi=10.1126/science.277.5323.215 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/277/5323/215.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to various studies, the MIS 11 interglacial period was longer than the other interglacial stages. The sustained interglacial warmth may have lasted as long as it did, because orbital eccentricity was low and the amplitude of the precessional cycle diminished, resulting in several fewer cold substages during this period and perhaps also induced abrupt climate change at MIS 12–11 transition, the most intense of the past 500 kyrs.
It is notable that MIS 11 developed just after one of the most “heavy” Pleistocene δ{{chem|18|O}} glacials (MIS 12). According to some authors, MIS 12 is likely to represent a “minimum” within the 400-kyr cyclicity (which is apparently “stretched” into ca. 500-kyr cycles in the Pleistocene), same as the MIS 24/MIS 22 complex (ca. 900 ka; Wang et al., 2004). In support of this inference is the observation that these dramatic glacial intervals are coincident with periods of major climate reorganisation, namely the “Mid-Brunhes Event” (Jansen et al., 1986) and the “Mid-Pleistocene Revolution” (Berger &amp; Jansen, 1994), respectively. 
In view of its pattern of astronomically-driven insolation, MIS 11 may be the best analogue for the near future insolation situation. A 2-D Northern Hemisphere climate model used to simulate climate evolution over MIS 11, MIS 5 and into the future implied that the climatic features and length of MIS 11 may be comparable to the present-future interglacial in the absence of anthropogenic forcing. This consideration has led some authors to the conclusion that the current interglacial period (begun 10 kyr) would have continued for approximately 20–25 kyrs even in the absence of anthropogenic forcing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Nikolay Kapterev.jpg|thumb|Nikolay Kapterev]]
'''Kapterev, Nikolai Fyodorovich''' (8 July 1847 – 31 December 1917) was a church historian, professor at the Church Academy, and corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Imperial Academy of Sciences]]. He is especially known for his publications refuting the theory of the Russian State Church regarding the causes of the [[raskol|Schism]] of 1666–67. Many of his works are being referred to by the [[Old Believers]] when explaining and defending their point of view of the Schism in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

Nikolai F. Kapterev started his study at the Church Institute of Zvenigorod and continued his studies at the Vnifansky Church Academy. At this Academy he took his first degree, after having written a thesis on worldly assistants of Archbisshops in ancient Russia. Then he was employed as a teacher at the history department of the Moscow Church Academy. At this time he did intensive research work in archives. In 1883 he started publishing his monography "The character of Russia's relationship with the orthodox East in the 16th and 17th century." In fact, he planned to write his second thesis on this subject. In this monography the author, referring to this elaborate research in archives, came to the conclusion that "the Russians... had... reasons to have a suspicious attitude towards the Greek piety of that time and even to Greek Orthodoxy itself" and that "[[Patriarch Nikon]] should not have had so much faith in the Greek who arrived to Moscow and who advised him to correct our old rites and books." For that time, this was a sensational statement to make. Only after interference of Ioaniky, the metropolite of Moscow, Kapterev's monography could be published. Kapterev was granted a Doctor's degree, and in 1885 his monography was published in book form. Professor N.I. Subbotin (1827–1905), a defender of the "official" Russian Orthodoxy, informed the Chairman of the Holy Synod, K.P. Pobedonostsev, against Kapterev and his publication and his Doctor's degree was cancelled by the Holy Synod.

In 1887 Kapterev started publishing "Patriarch Nikon as a Church reformer and his opponents" in the "Orthodox Digest." These publications met with fierce attacks of Prof. Subbotin, which were refuted by Kapterev, who pointed out many errors and deliberate falsities in Subbotin's argumentation. Kapterev tried to take his Doctor's degree, presenting this publication as a thesis, but this was declined by the Holy Synod. This may become understandable, given the fact that Kapterev actually destroyed the scientific basis of the theory on the Schism of 1666-67, held by the official Russian Orthodox Church. He proved that the rites, anathemized as a result of the Church reforms, such as the sign of the Cross with two fingers, the twice hallelujah, etc.), were in fact rites of the ancient universal Christian Church and that the new rites (the sign of the Cross with three fingers, thrice hallelujah, etc.) appeared among the Greek in the 15th-16th century.

In Russian academic circles the scientific achievements of Kapterev were highly esteemed; in 1888 was awarded with the Small Uvarov Prize of the Imperial Academy of Sciences for his "The character of Russia's relationship with the orthodox East in the 16th and 17th century." At the same time there appeared other publications, developing Kapterev's scientific research on Russian Church history. In 1891 he published "The relationship of Dosifei, Patriarch of Jerusalem, with the Russian government," for which he was finally granted a Doctor's degree. In 1896 he was granted the degree of "Ordinary Professor," in 1898 he became "Meritorious Professor." After the Bill of 1905 many publications were issued which until then had not passed censorship. In 1906 Kapterev published "The Czar and the Moscow Councils of the 16th and 17th century," in 1909-1912 followed a fundamental investigation in two volumes "Patriarch Nikon and [[Alexis of Russia|Czar Aleksei Mikhailovich]]," in which Kapterev points out the causes having led to the Church reforms. This publication was met with great appreciation by the progressive part of Russian society. In 1910 Kapterev was elected Corresponding Member of the Imperial Academy of Sciences.

Kapterev was also politically active: from 1912 till 1917 he was a member of the [[State Duma]] as a deputy of a progressive party.

In spite of some accusations of partiality, Kapterev did not belong to any Old Believer's church of denomination. In fact, the Old Believers do not agree with all of Kapterev's conclusions, especially those concerning [[Avvakum Petrov|Archpriest Avvakum]], towards Kapterev had a rather negative attitude.

'''Normandy''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɔr|m|ə|n|d|i}}; {{lang-fr|Normandie}}, {{IPA-fr|nɔʁmɑ̃di|pron|Fr-Normandie.ogg}}, [[Norman language|Norman]]: ''Normaundie'', from [[Old French]] ''Normanz'', plural of ''Normant'', originally from the word for "northman" in several [[Scandinavian languages]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Norman | publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Norman | access-date= 1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the 18 [[regions of France]], roughly referring to the historical [[Duchy of Normandy]].

Normandy is divided into five administrative [[Departments of France|departments]]: [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], [[Eure]], [[Manche]], [[Orne]], and [[Seine-Maritime]]. It covers {{convert|30627|km2}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://195.7.104.1/normandy/gb/01bienv/index.html Administrative Normandy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501135826/http://195.7.104.1/normandy/gb/01bienv/index.html |date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising roughly 5% of the territory of [[metropolitan France]]. Its population of 3.37&amp;nbsp;million accounts for around 5% of the population of France. The inhabitants of Normandy are known as [[Normans]],&lt;ref name="Denonym" /&gt; and the region is the historic homeland of the [[Norman language]].

The historical region of Normandy comprised the present-day region of Normandy, as well as small areas now part of the departments of [[Mayenne]] and [[Sarthe]]. The [[Channel Islands]] ([[Metropolitan French|French]]: ''Îles Anglo-Normandes'') are also historically part of Normandy; they cover 194&amp;nbsp;km²&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.capbreizh.com/pratique/anglo-normandes/anglo-normandes.htm |title=Découvertes touristiques Cap Breizh – Les îles Anglo-Normandes |author=Michel Badet |date=29 May 2010 |publisher=capbreizh.com |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and comprise two [[bailiwick]]s: [[Guernsey]] and [[Jersey]], which are British [[Crown dependencies]] over which [[British monarchy|Queen]] [[Elizabeth II]] reigns as [[Duke of Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/royalstyle_uk.htm#Normandy|title=Provides the full title of the British Monarch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normandy's name comes from the settlement of the territory by mainly [[Danes|Danish]] and [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[Viking]]s ("[[Norsemen|Northmen]]") from the 9th century, and confirmed by treaty in the 10th century between King [[Charles the Simple|Charles III of France]] and the Viking ''[[Earl|jarl]]'' [[Rollo]]. For a century and a half following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Normandy and England were linked by Norman and [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers.

Archaeological finds, such as [[cave painting]]s, prove that humans were present in the region in [[prehistoric times]].

[[Celts]] (also known as [[Belgae]] and [[Gauls]]) invaded Normandy in successive waves from the 4th to the 3rd century BC. When [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Gaul, there were nine different Celtic tribes living in Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ridel/histnorm/Gaulois1.htm |title=César et les Gaulois |publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]] of Normandy was achieved by the usual methods: [[Roman roads]] and a policy of urbanisation. [[Classicist]]s have knowledge of many [[Gallo-Roman]] [[villa]]s in Normandy.

In the late 3rd century, barbarian raids devastated Normandy. Coastal settlements were raided by [[Saxons|Saxon]] pirates. Christianity also began to enter the area during this period. In 406, [[Germanic tribes]] began invading from the east, while the Saxons subjugated the Norman coast. As early as 487, the area between the [[River Somme]] and the River [[Loire]] came under the control of the [[Franks|Frankish]] lord [[Clovis I|Clovis]].

The [[Vikings]] started to raid the Seine valley during the middle of the 9th century. As early as 841, a Viking fleet appeared at the mouth of the Seine, the principal route by which they entered the kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neveux|first1=Francois|title=The Normans: The conquests that changed the face of Europe|isbn=978-0-7624-3371-1|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; After attacking and destroying monasteries, including one at [[Jumièges]], they took advantage of the power vacuum created by the disintegration of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire to take northern France. The [[Duchy of Normandy|fiefdom of Normandy]] was created for the Viking leader Hrólfr Ragnvaldsson, or [[Rollo]] (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had besieged Paris but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]], [[Charles the Simple]], through the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory which he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name "Normandy" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. "[[Norsemen|Norseman]]") origins. To this day, in Norwegian language the word ''nordmann'' (pron. norman) denotes a Norwegian person.

The descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's native Gallo-Roman inhabitants. They became the [[Normans]] – a [[Norman language|Norman]]-speaking mixture of [[Norsemen]] and indigenous [[Franks]], [[Celts]] and [[Romans]].

Rollo's descendant [[William the Conqueror|William]], became king of England in 1066 after defeating [[Harold Godwinson]], the last of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kings]], at the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the [[fiefdom]] of Normandy for himself and his descendants.

===Norman expansion===
[[File:Normans possessions 12century-fr.png|thumb|Norman possessions in the 12th century]]
Besides the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] and the subsequent subjugation of [[Cambro-Norman|Wales]] and [[Norman Ireland|Ireland]], the Normans expanded into other areas. Norman families, such as that of [[Tancred of Hauteville]], [[Rainulf Drengot]] and [[Guimond de Moulins]] played important parts in the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquest of southern Italy]] and the [[Crusades]].

The [[Drengot family|Drengot]] lineage, de Hauteville's sons [[William Iron Arm]], [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], and [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger the Great Count]] progressively claimed territories in southern Italy until founding the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1130. They also carved out a place for themselves and their descendants in the [[Crusader states]] of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Holy Land]].

The 14th-century explorer [[Jean de Béthencourt]] established a [[Kingdom of the Canary Islands|kingdom]] in the [[Canary Islands]] in 1404. He received the title King of the Canary Islands from Pope [[Pope Innocent VII|Innocent VII]] but recognized [[Henry III of Castile]] as his overlord, who had provided him aid during the conquest.

===13th to 17th centuries===
[[File:Joan of arc burning at stake.jpg|thumb|[[Joan of Arc]] burning at the stake in the city of [[Rouen]], painting by [[Jules Eugène Lenepveu]]]]
In 1204, during the reign of [[John of England|John Lackland]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]]. Insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained however under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognized the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of their ancient fiefdom.

The ''Charte aux Normands'' granted by [[Louis X of France]] in 1315 (and later re-confirmed in 1339) – like the analogous [[Magna Carta]] granted in England in the aftermath of 1204 – guaranteed the liberties and privileges of the province of Normandy.

French Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1345–1360 and again in 1415–1450. Normandy lost three-quarters of its population during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie| title = The French Peasantry: 1450-1660| url = https://books.google.com/?id=VT9rIMQFt2MC&amp;pg=PA32| year = 1987| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-05523-0| page = 32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward prosperity returned to Normandy until the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. When many Norman towns ([[Alençon]], [[Rouen]], [[Caen]], [[Coutances]], [[Bayeux]]) joined the [[Protestant Reformation]], battles ensued throughout the province. In the Channel Islands, a period of [[Calvinism]] following the Reformation was suppressed when [[Anglicanism]] was imposed following the [[English Civil War]].

[[Samuel de Champlain]] left the port of [[Honfleur]] in 1604 and founded [[Acadia]]. Four years later, he founded [[Quebec City|Québec City]]. From then onwards, Normans engaged in a policy of expansion in North America. They continued the exploration of the [[New World]]: [[René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] travelled in the area of the [[Great Lakes]], then on the [[Mississippi River]]. [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] and his brother [[Lemoyne de Bienville]] founded [[Louisiana]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[New Orleans]]. Territories located between [[Quebec|Québec]] and the [[Mississippi Delta]] were opened up to establish [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. Colonists from Normandy were among the most active in [[New France]], comprising [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].

[[Honfleur]] and [[Le Havre]] were two of the principal [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] ports of France.

===Modern history===
Although agriculture remained important, industries such as weaving, metallurgy, sugar refining, ceramics, and shipbuilding were introduced and developed.

In the 1780s, the economic crisis and the crisis of the ''[[Ancien Régime]]'' struck Normandy as well as other parts of the nation, leading to the [[French Revolution]]. Bad harvests, technical progress and the effects of the [[Eden Agreement]] signed in 1786 affected employment and the economy of the province. Normans laboured under a heavy fiscal burden.

In 1790 the five departments of Normandy replaced the former province.

13 July 1793, the Norman [[Charlotte Corday]] assassinated [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]].

The Normans reacted little to the many political upheavals which characterized the 19th century. Overall they warily accepted the changes of régime ([[First French Empire]], [[Bourbon Restoration]], [[July Monarchy]], [[French Second Republic]], [[Second French Empire]], [[French Third Republic]]).

There was an economic revival (mechanization of textile manufacture, first trains...) after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792–1815).

And new economic activity stimulated the coasts: seaside tourism. The 19th century marks the birth of the first beach resorts.

[[File:NormandySupply edit.jpg|thumb|right|Allied invasion of Normandy, [[D-Day]], 1944]]
During the Second World War, following the [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice of 22 June 1940]], continental Normandy was part of the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German occupied zone of France]]. The Channel Islands were [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by German forces]] between 30 June 1940 and 9 May 1945. The town of [[Dieppe]] was the site of the unsuccessful [[Dieppe Raid]] by Canadian and British armed forces.

[[Allies of World War II|The Allies]], in this case involving Britain, the United States, Canada and [[Free France]], coordinated a massive build-up of troops and supplies to support a large-scale invasion of Normandy in the [[D-Day landings]] on 6 June 1944 under the code name [[Operation Overlord]]. The Germans were dug into fortified emplacements above the beaches. [[Caen]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Carentan]], [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]], which continued until the closing of the so-called [[Falaise pocket|Falaise gap]] between [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]] and [[Mont Ormel]]. The liberation of [[Le Havre]] followed. This was a significant turning point in the war and led to the restoration of the French Republic.

The remainder of Normandy was liberated only on 9 May 1945 at the end of the war, when the [[Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands|Channel Island occupation]] effectively ended.

Between 1956 and 2015 Normandy was divided into two [[Regions of France|administrative regions]]: [[Lower Normandy]] and [[Upper Normandy]]; the regions were merged into one single region on 1 January 2016. [[Upper Normandy]] (''Haute-Normandie'') consisted of the French ''[[département in France|departments]]'' of [[Seine-Maritime]] and [[Eure]], and [[Lower Normandy]] (''Basse-Normandie'') of the ''[[Département in France|departments]]'' of [[Orne]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], and [[Manche]].

==Geography==

[[File:Jonquerets-de-Livret- batiment du Pressoir.JPG|thumb|A typical Norman [[Thatching|thatched]] building. This is now a village hall]]

The historical Duchy of Normandy was a formerly independent [[duchy]] occupying the lower [[Seine]] area, the [[Pays de Caux]] and the region to the west through the [[Pays d'Auge]] as far as the [[Cotentin Peninsula]].

Western Normandy belongs to the [[Armorican Massif]], whereas the major part of the region belongs to the [[Paris Basin]]. [[France]]'s oldest rocks crop out in Jobourg&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etab.ac-caen.fr/discip/geologie/precamb/lahagueEcalgrain/ecalgrain.htm Bay of Écalgrain and Bay of Cul-Rond''] Website Lithothèque de Normandie.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Cotentin]] peninsula. The region is bordered along the northern coasts by the English Channel. There are granite [[cliff]]s in the west and limestone cliffs in the east. There are also long stretches of beach in the centre of the region. The ''[[bocage]]'' typical of the western areas caused problems for the invading forces in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]]. A notable feature of the landscape is created by the [[meander]]s of the Seine as it approaches its estuary.

The highest point is the Signal d'Écouves (417m) in the Massif armoricain.

Normandy is sparsely forested:&lt;ref&gt;''Normandie'', Bonneton, Paris 2001 {{ISBN|2-86253-272-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 12.8% of the territory is wooded, compared to a French average of 23.6%, although the proportion varies between the departments. Eure has most cover (21%) while Manche has least (4%), a characteristic shared with the Islands.

* The [[bailliage]] of [[Guernsey]]

The [[Channel Islands]] are considered culturally and historically a part of Normandy. However, they are British [[Crown Dependency|Crown Dependencies]], and are not part of the modern French region of Normandy,

Although the British surrendered claims to mainland Normandy, France, and other French possessions in 1801, the monarch of the United Kingdom retains the title Duke of Normandy in respect to the Channel Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{main article|Politics of Normandy}}
[[File:Caserne Jeanne d'Arc.jpg|thumb|Historic photograph of the ''Caserne Jeanne d'Arc'' in Rouen, today seat of the Norman regional assembly]]
The modern region of Normandy was created by the territorial reform of French Regions in 2014 by the merger of [[Lower Normandy]], and [[Upper Normandy]]. The new region took effect on 1 January 2016, after the [[French regional elections, 2015|regional elections in December 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2014/12/17/la-carte-a-13-regions-definitivement-adoptee_4542278_823448.html|title=La carte à 13 régions définitivement adoptée|date=17 December 2014|agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]|publisher=[[Le Monde]]|language=French|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government ===
The [[Regional Council (France)|Regional Council]] has 102 members who are elected under a system of [[proportional representation]]. The [[Executive (government)|executive]] consists of a president and vice-presidents. [[Hervé Morin]] from the Centre party was elected president of the council in January 2016.

==Economy==

Much of Normandy is predominantly agricultural in character, with cattle breeding the most important sector (although in decline from the peak levels of the 1970s and 1980s). The ''[[bocage]]'' is a patchwork of small fields with high hedges, typical of western areas. Areas near the [[Seine]] (the former [[Upper Normandy]] region) contain a higher concentration of industry. Normandy is a significant [[cider]]-producing region, and also produces [[calvados (spirit)|calvados]], a distilled cider or [[apple brandy]]. Other activities of economic importance are dairy produce, [[flax]] (60% of production in France), [[horse breeding]] (including two French national stud farms), fishing, [[seafood]], and tourism. The region contains three French [[nuclear power station]]s.
There is also easy access to and from the UK using the ports of [[Cherbourg]], [[Caen]] ([[Ouistreham]]), [[Le Havre]] and [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://normandyproperty.com/ Houses and properties for sale]. Normandy Property. Retrieved on 19 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
In January 2006 the population of Normandy (including the part of [[Perche]] which lies inside the [[Orne]] ''[[departments of France|département]]'' but excluding the [[Channel Islands]]) was estimated at 3,260,000 with an average population density of 109 inhabitants per km², just under the French national average, but rising to 147 for [[Upper Normandy]].

[[File:HalftimberedHousesRouen2.JPG|thumb|Half-timbered houses in Rouen]]
{{See also|Norman toponymy}}
The main cities (population given from the 1999 census) are [[Rouen]] (518,316 in the metropolitan area), the capital since 2016 of the province and formerly of Upper Normandy; [[Caen]] (420,000 in the metropolitan area) and formerly the capital of Lower Normandy; [[Le Havre]] (296,773 in the metropolitan area); and [[Cherbourg]] (117,855 in the metropolitan area).

==Culture==

===Flag===
The traditional provincial [[flag of Normandy]], ''gules, two leopards passant or'', is used in both modern regions. The historic three-leopard version (known in the Norman language as ''les treis cats'', "the three cats") is used by some associations and individuals, especially those who support reunification of the regions and cultural links with the Channel Islands and England. Jersey and Guernsey use three leopards in their national symbols. The three leopards represents the strength and courage Normandy has towards the neighbouring provinces.

The unofficial anthem of the region is the song "[[Ma Normandie]]".

===Language===
{{main article|Norman language}}
The Norman language, a [[languages of France|regional language]], is spoken by a minority of the population on the continent and the islands, with a concentration in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in the far West (the [[Cotentinais]] dialect), and in the [[Pays de Caux]] in the East (the [[Cauchois dialect]]). Many place names demonstrate the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] influence in this [[Oïl languages|Oïl language]]; for example ''-bec'' (stream), ''-fleur'' (river), ''[[-hou]]'' (island), ''-tot'' (homestead), ''-dal'' or ''-dalle'' (valley) and ''-hogue'' (hill, mound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/france/contribution.html|title=The Vikings in Normandy: The Scandinavian contribution in Normandy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; French is the only [[official language]] in continental Normandy and English is also an official language in the Channel Islands.

===Architecture===
[[File:Dauville Hotel Normandie.jpg|thumb|A Norman style construction in [[Deauville]]]]
{{Main article|Architecture of Normandy}}

Architecturally, Norman cathedrals, abbeys (such as the [[Abbey of Bec]]) and castles characterise the former duchy in a way that mirrors the similar pattern of [[Norman architecture]] in England following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066.

Domestic architecture in upper Normandy is typified by [[Half-timbered construction|half-timbered]] buildings that also recall vernacular English architecture, although the farm enclosures of the more harshly landscaped Pays de Caux are a more idiosyncratic response to socio-economic and climatic imperatives. Much urban architectural heritage was destroyed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944 – post-war urban reconstruction, such as in Le Havre and Saint-Lô, could be said to demonstrate both the virtues and vices of [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Brutalism|brutalist]] trends of the 1950s and 1960s. Le Havre, the city rebuilt by [[Auguste Perret]], was added to Unesco’s World Heritage List in 2005.

[[Vernacular architecture]] in lower Normandy takes its form from [[granite]], the predominant local building material. The Channel Islands also share this influence – [[Chausey]] was for many years a source of quarried granite, including that used for the construction of [[Mont Saint-Michel]].

The south part of [[Bagnoles-de-l'Orne]] is filled with bourgeois villas in ''[[Belle Époque]]'' style with polychrome façades, bow windows and unique roofing. This area, built between 1886 and 1914, has an authentic “Bagnolese” style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time. The Chapel of Saint Germanus (''Chapelle Saint-Germain'') at [[Querqueville]] with its [[trefoil]] floorplan incorporates elements of one of the earliest surviving places of Christian worship in the Cotentin – perhaps second only to the Gallo-Roman baptistry at [[Port-Bail]]. It is dedicated to [[Germanus of Normandy]].

===Gastronomy===
[[File:Vachesnormandes.jpg|thumb|[[Normande Cattle|Normande cow]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
Parts of Normandy consist of rolling countryside typified by pasture for dairy cattle and apple orchards. A wide range of dairy products are produced and exported. Norman cheeses include [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]], [[Livarot cheese|Livarot]], [[Pont-l'Évêque cheese|Pont l'Évêque]], [[Brillat-Savarin cheese|Brillat-Savarin]], [[Neufchâtel (cheese)|Neufchâtel]], [[Petit suisse (cheese)|Petit Suisse]] and [[Boursin (cheese)|Boursin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fromages.org/fdn/fdn_histoire_en.html |title=Norman cheeses: History |publisher=fromages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normandy butter and Normandy cream are lavishly used in gastronomic specialties.
[[File:Reflets de France Cidre.jpg|thumb|[[Cider]] from Normandy&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fish and seafood are of superior quality in Normandy.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Turbot and oysters from the Cotentin Peninsula are major delicacies throughout France. Normandy is the chief [[oyster]]-cultivating, scallop-exporting, and mussel-raising region in France.

Normandy is a major [[cider]]-producing region (very little wine is produced). [[Perry]] is also produced, but in less significant quantities. Apple brandy, of which the most famous variety is [[calvados (spirit)|calvados]], is also popular. The mealtime ''trou normand'', or "Norman hole", is a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the appetite and make room for the next course, and this is still observed in many homes and restaurants. ''[[Pommeau]]'' is an ''[[apéritif]]'' produced by blending unfermented cider and apple brandy. Another aperitif is the ''[[Kir (cocktail)|kir]] normand'', a measure of [[crème de cassis]] topped up with cider. ''[[Bénédictine]]'' is produced in [[Fécamp]].

Apples are also widely used in cooking: for example, ''moules à la normande'' are [[mussel]]s cooked with apples, cream and cheese, ''bourdelots'' are apples baked in pastry, partridges are flamed with reinette apples, and localities all over the province have their own variation of apple tart, that is more popular named tan tan tan tan, because the people can't say the correct name "Tarte Tatin", a classic pastry dish from the region is [[Norman Tart]] a [[pastry]]-based variant of the apple tart.

Other regional specialities include ''[[tripes à la mode de Caen]]'', ''[[andouille]]s'' and ''andouillettes'', [[salade cauchoise]], salt meadow (''pré salé'') lamb, seafood (mussels, [[scallop]]s, lobsters, mackerel…), and ''[[teurgoule]]'' (spiced rice pudding).

Normandy dishes include duckling ''à la rouennaise'', sautéed chicken ''yvetois'', and goose ''en daube''. Rabbit is cooked with [[morel]]s, or ''à la havraise'' (stuffed with truffled pigs' trotters). Other dishes are sheep's trotters ''à la rouennaise'', casseroled veal, larded calf's liver braised with carrots, and veal (or turkey) in cream and mushrooms.

Normandy is also noted for its pastries. It is the birthplace of [[brioche]]s (especially those from [[Évreux]] and [[Gisors]]) and also turns out ''douillons'' (pears baked in pastry), ''craquelins'', ''roulettes'' in Rouen, ''fouaces'' in Caen, ''fallues'' in [[Lisieux]], ''sablés'' in Lisieux. Confectionery of the region includes [[Rouen]] apple sugar, Isigny caramels, [[Bayeux]] mint chews, Falaise berlingots, [[Le Havre]] marzipans, [[Argentan]] ''croquettes'', and Rouen [[macaroons]].

Normandy is the native land of [[Taillevent]], cook of the kings of France [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] and [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]. He wrote the earliest French cookery book named ''Le Viandier''. ''[[Confiture de lait]]'' was also made in Normandy around the 14th century.

===Literature===
[[File:Wace illustration Roman de Rou 1824.jpg|thumb|[[Wace]] presents his ''[[Roman de Rou]]'' to Henry II, Illustration 1824]]
{{See also|Anglo-Norman literature|Gesta Normannorum Ducum}}
The dukes of Normandy commissioned and inspired epic literature to record and legitimise their rule. [[Wace]], [[Orderic Vitalis]] and [[Stephen of Rouen]] were among those who wrote in the service of the dukes. After the division of 1204, French literature provided the model for the development of literature in Normandy. [[Olivier Basselin]] wrote of the Vaux de Vire, the origin of literary ''[[vaudeville]]''. Among notable Norman writers in French are [[Jean Marot]], [[Rémy Belleau]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], and [[Remy de Gourmont]], and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. The Corneille brothers, [[Pierre Corneille|Pierre]] and [[Thomas Corneille|Thomas]], born in Rouen, were great figures of French classical literature.

David Ferrand (1591–1660) in his ''Muse Normande'' established a landmark of Norman language literature. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the workers and merchants of [[Rouen]] established a tradition of polemical and satirical literature in a form of language called the ''parler purin''. At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as [[George Métivier]], which sparked a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland. In exile in Jersey and then Guernsey, [[Victor Hugo]] took an interest in the vernacular literature. ''[[Les Travailleurs de la mer]]'' is a well-known novel by Hugo set in the Channel Islands. The boom in insular literature in the early 19th century encouraged production especially in La Hague and around Cherbourg, where Alfred Rossel, Louis Beuve and [[Côtis-Capel]] became active. The typical medium for literary expression in Norman has traditionally been newspaper columns and almanacs. The novel ''Zabeth'' by André Louis which appeared in 1969 was the first novel published in Norman.

===Painting===

Normandy has a rich tradition of painting and gave to France some of its most important artists.
 
In the 17th century some major French painters were Normans like [[Nicolas Poussin]], born in [[Les Andelys]] and [[Jean Jouvenet]].

[[Romanticism]] drew painters to the Channel coasts of Normandy. [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] crossed the Channel from Great Britain, attracted by the light and landscapes. [[Théodore Géricault]], a native of Rouen, was a notable figure in the Romantic movement, its famous ''[[Le Radeau de la Méduse|Radeau de la Méduse]]'' being considered come the breakthrough of pictorial romanticism in France when it was officially presented at the 1819 Salon. The competing Realist tendency was represented by [[Jean-François Millet]], a native of La Hague. The landscape painter [[Eugène Boudin]], born in Honfleur, was a determining influence on the impressionnists and was highly considered by Monet.

[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, Un après-midi à l'Ile aux Cerises, Rouen, oil on canvas, 50 x 61.2 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], ''Un après-midi à l'Ile aux Cerises, Rouen'', oil on canvas, 50 x 61.2 cm]]
Breaking away from the more formalised and classical themes of the early part of the 19th century, Impressionist painters preferred to paint outdoors, in natural light, and to concentrate on landscapes, towns and scenes of daily life.

Leader of the movement and father of modern painting, [[Claude Monet]] is one of the best known Impressionists and a major character in Normandy's artistic heritage. His [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|house and gardens]] at [[Giverny]] are one of the region's major tourist sites, much visited for their beauty and their water lilies, as well as for their importance to Monet's artistic inspiration. Normandy was at the heart of his creation, from the paintings of Rouen's cathedral to the famous depictions of the cliffs at [[Etretat]], the beach and port at [[Fécamp]] and the sunrise at [[Le Havre]]. It was ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'', Monet's painting of Le Havre, that led to the movement being dubbed [[Impressionism]]. After Monet, all the main [[avant-garde]] painters of the 1870s and 1880s came to Normandy to paint its landscapes and its changing lights, concentrating along the Seine valley and the Norman coast.

Landscapes and scenes of daily life were also immortalised on canvas by artists such as [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]], [[Gustave Courbet]], the Honfleur born Eugène Boudin, [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. While Monet's work adorns galleries and collections all over the world, a remarkable quantity of Impressionist works can be found in galleries throughout Normandy, such as the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Rouen]], the Musée Eugène Boudin in [[Honfleur]] or the [[Musée Malraux|André Malraux Museum]] in [[Le Havre]].

[[Maurice Denis]], one of the leaders and theoricists of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]] movement in the 1890s, was a native of Granville, in the Manche department.

The ''[[Société Normande de Peinture Moderne]]'' was founded in 1909 by [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]], [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], Yvonne Barbier and Eugène Tirvert. Among members were [[Raoul Dufy]], a native of Le Havre, [[Albert Marquet]], [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Maurice Utrillo]]. Also in this movement were the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], considered one of the father of modern art, also natives of Normandy. [[Jean Dubuffet]], one of the leading French artist of the 1940s and the 1950s was born in Le Havre.

===Religion===
[[File:Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rouen Cathedral]]]]

Christian missionaries implanted [[monastic communities]] in the territory in the 5th and 6th centuries. Some of these missionaries came from across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. The influence of [[Celtic Christianity]] can still be found in the [[Cotentin]]. By the terms of the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Rollo, a Viking pagan, accepted Christianity and was baptised. The Duchy of Normandy was therefore formally a Christian state from its foundation. The [[cathedral]]s of Normandy have exerted influence down the centuries in matters of both faith and politics. [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] of England, did [[penance]] at the cathedral of [[Avranches Cathedral|Avranches]] on 21 May 1172 and was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of [[Thomas Becket]]. [[Mont Saint-Michel]] is a historic [[pilgrimage]] site.

Normandy does not have one generally agreed [[patron saint]], although this title has been ascribed to Saint [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], and to [[Saint Ouen]]. Many saints have been revered in Normandy down the centuries, including:
* [[St. Aubert|Aubert]] who's remembered as the founder of [[Mont Saint-Michel]]
* [[Saint Marcouf|Marcouf]] and [[Laud of Coutances|Laud]] who are important saints in Normandy
* [[Helier]] and [[Samson of Dol]] who are evangelizers of the Channel Islands
* [[Thomas Becket]], an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] whose parents were from Rouen, who was the object of a considerable cult in mainland Normandy following his martyrdom
* [[Joan of Arc]] who was [[martyr]]ed in Rouen, and who is especially remembered in that city
* [[Thérèse de Lisieux]] whose birthplace in [[Alençon]] and later home in Lisieux are a focus for religious pilgrims.
* [[Germanus of Normandy]]

Since the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] there is no established church in mainland Normandy. In the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Church of England]] is the [[established church]].

The '''Ormside Bowl''' is an [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] double-bowl in [[gilding|gilded]] silver and bronze, with glass, perhaps [[Northumbria]]n,  dating from the mid-8th century which was found in 1823, possibly buried next to a [[Viking]] warrior in [[Great Ormside]], [[Cumbria]], though the circumstances of the find were not well recorded. If so, the bowl was probably looted from [[York]] by the warrior before being buried with him on his death. The bowl is one of the finest pieces of Anglo-Saxon silverwork found in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.yorkmuseumstrust.org.uk/collections/search/item/?id=538&amp;search_query=c2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9b3Jtc2lkZStib3ds |title=Ormside Bowl |publisher=[[York Museums Trust]] |accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The bowl is a double-shelled cup made from 2 pieces [[rivet]]ed together with dome-headed rivets and beaded collars. The surface of the bowl is decorated with a [[Repoussé and chasing|chased repousse technique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotlandsplaces.gov.uk/search_item/index.php?service=RCAHMS&amp;id=84867 |title='dumfriesshire' |author=L E Webster and J Backhouse |date=1991 |work=ScotlandsPlaces |publisher= |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometime after it was originally made the bowl was converted into a drinking vessel.&lt;ref name="PostHole"/&gt;

===Inner bowl===
The inner cup is made from [[gilt-bronze]]&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt; and is riveted with studs of blue glass and silver.&lt;ref name="PostHole"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theposthole.org/read/article/28 |title="A Private Audience with the Cawood Sword and other Viking Treasures": A review of the talk at the Yorkshire Museum |author=Katie Marsden |date=23 February 2009 |work=The Post Hole (Issue 4) |publisher= |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base plate of the internal bowl features 16 circular pieces of glass within a ring of [[cloisonné|cloisons]] and five further rivets, of which the central is missing. The gilding on the bowl was added after the other decoration.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt; The inner bowl could have been made in [[York]] as a blue-glass stud matching the bowl's was found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/ba/ba59/feat2.shtml |title=The glory that was York |author=Dominic Tweddle |authorlink=Dominic Tweddle |date=June 2001 |work= ''[[Council for British Archaeology|British Archaeology]]'' (Issue 59) |publisher=[[Council for British Archaeology]] |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outer bowl===
The outer shell is made from [[silver-gilt]], the rim once had a U-sectioned strip of ungilded silver although this has now mostly been lost. This strip was originally attached using 4 clips in the shape of animal heads although 2 of these have also been lost.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;
The bowl's gilt-silver exterior is decorated with [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon style]] [[interlace (art)|interlaced]] fabulous creatures amid Continental style vines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtimelines.org.uk/world/british_isles/england/AD410-1066/continent |title=Anglo-Saxon  England and the Continent |author= |date=2006 |work=worldtimelines.org.uk |publisher=The British Museum |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the frontal gaze of some of the creatures on the bowl is a common occurrence in carvings of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Treasure Annual Report 2001 |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Department for Culture, Media and Sport |location= |isbn= |page=43 |chapter=Early Medieval Artefacts |url=http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Catalogpp041068.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100512161923/http://www.culture.gov.uk/images/publications/Catalogpp041068.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decorations show plants, grapes, fruit, animals and birds in both naturalistic and grotesque style.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;
Another beaded band is riveted on in four places outside the rim. These rivets have square mountings, in one of which a piece of blue glass survives. The external base plate features five domed rivets. The interlaced [[cruciform]] decoration between these rivets has been made using a [[repoussé]] technique. The bowl may also once have had a footring made from gilded wire.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;

===Comparisons===
The Ormside bowl is similar in aspects of its style to several bowls from the [[St Ninian's Isle Treasure]] but is closer in style to the [[Witham bowl]], a lost early eighth century hanging-bowl found in the [[River Witham]]. The decoration on the bowl has been compared to the [[St Petersburg Bede]], [[Barberini Gospels]], [[Gandersheim Casket]] and [[Rupertus Cross]].&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;
The conical bosses on the base of the bowl resemble features of the [[Kildalton Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/251204/details/islay+kildalton+chapel+burial+ground+kildalton+great+cross/ |title=Islay, Kildalton Chapel Burial Ground, Kildalton Great Cross |author= |date=1 August 2007  |work=Scotland's national collection of buildings, archaeology and industry |publisher=Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The embossed and fine-lined filigreed designs on the bowl have been compared to those of the [[Wye Down pendant]] and the [[Book of Durrow]] leading to it being dated in 1958 by G. Haseloff to 650–700,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=G. HASELOFF |year=1958 |title=Fragments of a bowl Hanging-Bowl from Bekesbourne, Kent and Some Ornamental Problems |journal=Med. Archaeol. |publisher= |volume=II |issue= |pages= |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol02/2_072_103.pdf |doi= |pmid= |pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though this now seems too early.

==Discovery==
[[File:St_James_Church,Ormside_-_geograph.org.uk_-_237258.jpg|thumb|right|[[St James' Church, Great Ormside|St James' Church in Great Ormside]]]]
The bowl was found buried in 1823 in what is now [[St James' Church, Great Ormside|St James' Churchyard in Great Ormside]].&lt;ref name="ILN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Master Works Revealed: The Ormside Bowl and Sutton Hoo Standard |url=http://www.iln.org.uk/iln_years/year/images/1952/1952ormbowl.jpg |format=jpg |newspaper=The Illustrated London News |date=26 January 1952 |page=148|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bowl was amongst the first objects donated to the [[Yorkshire Philosophical Society]] in 1823, before the construction of the Yorkshire Museum in 1829-30. It latterly formed part of the permanent collection of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Donations to the Museum |date=1824 |journal=Report of the Council of the Yorkshire Philosophical Society for 1823 |publisher=Yorkshire Philosophical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=COLLECTION ITEM: ORMSIDE BOWL |url=https://www.yorkmuseumstrust.org.uk/collections/search/item/?id=538&amp;search_query=bGltaXQ9MTYmc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9b3Jtc2lkZStib3dsJkdzJTVCb3BlcmF0b3IlNUQ9JTNFJTNEJkdzJTVCdmFsdWUlNUQ9JkdlJTVCb3BlcmF0b3IlNUQ9JTNDJTNEJkdlJTVCdmFsdWUlNUQ9JkZOPQ%3D%3D |publisher=[[York Museums Trust]] |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 the burial of a Viking warrior was found in the same churchyard. This burial, including a sword, is now in the [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in [[Carlisle]] where it forms an important part of their early medieval collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tulliehouse.co.uk/node/504 |title=Vikings in Cumbria |author= |date= |work=Tullie House website |publisher= |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vc"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/ormside-st-james/ |title=St James, Ormside |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Church of England |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David M. Wilson]] does not consider the bowl to have actually been buried with the Viking warrior, and instead assumes it was really found inside the church, as he considers the bowl to be too fragile to have survived burying.&lt;ref name="Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde"/&gt;

==Public display==
In 1951 the bowl was cleaned and treated in the laboratory of the [[British Museum]], including the removal of a silver patch so that all of the metalworking detail could be seen. It was then exhibited at the York Festival before returning briefly for exhibition in the British Museum in 1952.&lt;ref name="ILN"/&gt;

It was on display in the 1980s as the centerpiece of the Anglo-Saxon gallery, surrounded by swords and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Report: The Yorkshire Museum |journal=British Archaeology Monthly |date=September 1987 |volume=3 |pages=24-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bowl was temporarily displayed again in the British Museum in 2010. This was the first time a regional museum has shown its collection at the British Museum and [[Margaret Hodge]] the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport|Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] encouraged everybody to view the exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100301/debtext/100301-0003.htm|title=Topical Questions|house=House of Commons|date=1 March 2010|column=652}}&lt;/ref&gt; It returned to the Yorkshire Museum for its reopening on [[Yorkshire Day]] of the same year after a £2m refurbishment of the galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/5022865.A_heritage_to_treasure/ |title=A heritage to treasure |author=Steve Pratt |date=23 February 2010 |work=The Northern Echo |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |accessdate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228133708/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/5022865.A_heritage_to_treasure/ |archivedate=28 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2017 the bowl formed part of a touring exhibition titled 'Viking: Rediscover the Legend' and is displayed alongside the [[Bedale Hoard]], the [[Vale of York hoard]] and the [[Cuerdale hoard]], with the tour starting at the Yorkshire Museum in May 2017 with subsequent displays at the [[Atkinson Art Gallery and Library]] in Southport, [[Aberdeen Art Gallery]], [[Norwich Castle Museum]], and the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/15282835.Face_to_face_with_the_Vikings/ |author1=Lewis, S. |title=Face to face with the Vikings |date=12 May 2017 |publisher=[[York Press]] |accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.minsterfm.com/news/local/2291242/a-new-understanding-of-the-vikings/ |title=A new understanding of the Vikings |publisher=[[Minster FM]] News |date=18 May 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pan-Arabism''', or simply '''Arabism''', is an ideology espousing the unification of the countries of North Africa and West Asia from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Arabian Sea]], referred to as the [[Arab world]]. It is closely connected to [[Arab nationalism]], which asserts that the Arabs constitute a single nation. Its popularity was at its height during the 1950s and 1960s. Advocates of pan-Arabism have often espoused [[Arab socialism|socialist]] principles and strongly [[Anti-Western sentiment|opposed]] [[Western countries|Western]] political involvement in the Arab world.{{dubious|date=September 2017}}  It also sought to empower Arab states against outside forces by forming alliances and – to a lesser extent – economic co-operation.&lt;ref name="Continuum"/&gt;

==Origins and development==
{{Politics of the Arab League}}
The origins of pan-Arabism are often attributed to [[Jurji Zaydan]] (1861–1914) and his [[al-Nahda|Nahda]] (Revival) movement. He was one of the first intellectuals to espouse pan-Arabism as a cultural nationalist force. Zaydan had critical influence on acceptance of a modernized version of the Quranic Arabic language ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]) as the universal written and official language throughout the Arab world, instead of adoption of [[Arabic dialects|local dialects]] in the various countries. Zaydan wrote several articles during the early 20th century which emphasized that Arabic-speaking regions stretching from the Maghreb to Persian Gulf constitute one people with a shared national consciousness and that this linguistic bond trumped religious, racial and specific territorial bonds, inspired in part by his status as a [[Levant|Levantine]] Christian emigre in 19th century Egypt. He also popularized through his historical novels a secular understanding of Arab history encompassing the pre-Islamic and Islamic periods into a shared history that all Arabs could claim as their own. As a political project, Pan-Arabism was first pressed by [[Sharif Hussein ibn Ali]], the [[Sharif of Mecca]], who sought independence for the [[Arabian Peninsula|Mashreq]] Arabs from the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the establishment of a unified Arab state in the Mashreq. In 1915 and 1916, the [[Hussein-McMahon Correspondence]] resulted in an agreement between the [[United Kingdom]] and the Sharif that if the Mashreq Arabs revolted successfully against the Ottomans, the United Kingdom would support claims for Mashreq Arab independence. In 1916, however, the [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] between the United Kingdom and France determined that parts of the Mashreq would be divided between those powers rather than forming part of an independent Arab state. When the Ottoman Empire surrendered in 1918, the United Kingdom refused to keep to the letter of its arrangements with Hussein,&lt;ref&gt;''Contemporary Politics in the Middle East'', Beverly Milton-Edwards, Polity Press, 2006, p. 57-59&lt;/ref&gt; and the two nations assumed guardianship of Mesopotamia, [[Lebanon]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and what became modern Syria. Ultimately, Hussein became King of only [[Hijaz]], in the then less strategically valuable south, but lost his [[Caliphate]] throne when the kingdom was sacked by the [[Najd]]i [[Ikhwan]] forces of the [[House of Saud|Saudites]] and forcefully incorporated into the newly created Kingdom of [[Saudi Arabia]].

A more formalized pan-Arab ideology than that of Hussein was first espoused in the 1930s, notably by [[Syrian people|Syrian]] thinkers such as [[Constantin Zureiq]], [[Sati' al-Husri]], [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], and [[Michel Aflaq]]. Aflaq and al-Arsuzi were key figures in the establishment of the [[Ba'ath Party|Arab Ba’ath (Renaissance) Party]], and the former was for long its chief ideologist, combining elements of [[Marxism|Marxist]] thought with a [[nationalism]] to a considerable extent reminiscent of nineteenth-century European romantic nationalism. It has been said that Arsuzi was fascinated with the Nazi ideology of "racial purity" and impacted [[Aflaq]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Syrian Arab Republic: a handbook'', Anne Sinai, Allen Pollack, 1976, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sVzEipGCy9oC&amp;pg=PA141 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pan-Arabism and Arab nationalism: the continuing debate by Tawfic Farah, Publisher Westview Press, 1987, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abdullah I of Jordan]] dreamed of uniting [[Syria]], Palestine, and Jordan under his leadership in what he would call [[Greater Syria]]. He unsuccessfully proposed a plan to this effect to the [[United Kingdom]], which controlled Palestine at that time. The plan was not popular among the majority of Arabs and fostered distrust among the leaders of the other Middle Eastern countries against Abdallah. The distrust of [[Abdullah I of Jordan#Expansionist aspirations|Abdallah's expansionist aspirations]] was one of the principal reasons for the founding of the [[Arab League]] in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]].  "Arab League." Sela.  ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  147-150.&lt;/ref&gt; Once [[Abdullah I of Jordan#Assassination|Abdallah was assassinated]] by a [[Palestinian nationalist]] in 1951, the vision of Greater Syria was dropped from the Jordanian agenda.&lt;ref name="Continuum"&gt;"Arab Unity." ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. [[Avraham Sela]]. New York: Continuum, 2002.  pp. 160–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although pan-Arabism began at the time of [[World War I]], [[Egypt]] (the most populous and arguably most important Arabic-speaking country) was not interested in pan-Arabism prior to the 1950s. Thus, in the 1930s and 1940s, [[Egyptian nationalism]] – not pan-Arabism – was the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian political activists. James Jankowski wrote about Egypt at the time,
{{quote|What is most significant is the absence of an Arab component in early Egyptian nationalism. The thrust of Egyptian political, economic, and cultural development throughout the nineteenth century worked against, rather than for, an 'Arab' orientation. ... This situation—that of divergent political trajectories for Egyptians and Arabs—if anything increased after 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, James. "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism" in Rashid Khalidi, ed. ''The Origins of Arab Nationalism''. New York: Columbia University Press, 1990, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Attempts at Arab union==
It was not until [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] that [[Arab nationalism]] (in addition to [[Arab socialism]]) became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world,&lt;ref&gt;For more information, see Aburish, Said K. (2004), Nasser, the Last Arab, New York City: St. Martin's Press, {{ISBN|978-0-312-28683-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before Nasser, Egypt, which had been ruled by Britain since 1882, was more in favor of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan-Arab ideology. Egyptians often did not identify themselves primarily as Arabs, and it is revealing that when the Egyptian nationalist leader [[Saad Zaghlul]] met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, claiming that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one." Makropoulou, Ifigenia. [http://www.ekem.gr/archives/2007/01/pan_arabism_wha.html Pan - Arabism: What Destroyed the Ideology of Arab Nationalism?]. Hellenic Center for European Studies. January 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; usually articulated vis-à-vis [[Zionism]] in the neighbouring state of Israel.

[[Image:Gamal Abdel Nasser (c. 1960s).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Under [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], pan-Arabism dominated politics in the 1950s and 1960s]]
There have been several attempts to bring about a pan-Arab state by many well-known Arab leaders, all of which ultimately resulted in failure. British Foreign Minister [[Anthony Eden]] called for Arab unity during the 1940s, and was followed by specific proposals from pro-British leaders, including King [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah of Transjordan]] and Prime Minister [[Nuri al-Said]] of Iraq, but Egyptian proposals for a broader grouping of independent Arab states prevailed with the establishment of the League of Arab States, a regional international organization, in 1945. In large part representing the popularity Nasser had gained among the masses in the Arab world following the Suez crisis, the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR) in 1958 was the first case of the actual merger of two previously-independent Arab countries. Hastily formed under President Nasser's leadership but on the initiative of Syrian leaders who feared a takeover by communists or "reactionaries" and hoped to lead the new entity, the UAR was a unitary state, not a federal union, with its critics seeing this as hardly more than a small country being annexed by a larger one. It lasted until 1961, when Syrian army officers carried out a coup d'état and withdrew from the union. As politicians felt pressured by the wide public to espouse the idea of unity, Egypt, Syria and Iraq entered into an abortive agreement in 1963 to form the United Arab Republic, which was to be "federal in structure, leaving each member state its identity and institutions."&lt;ref name="Continuum" /&gt; By 1961, Egypt had become the only remaining member but continued to call itself "the UAR" (thereby implying it was open for unification with other Arab countries), but it eventually renamed itself the "Arab Republic of Egypt" in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"United Arab Republic (UAR)."  Sela.  ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''.  873-874.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1958, a [[Hashemite]]-led rival, the [[Arab Federation]], was founded between [[Jordan]] and [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]]. Tensions with the UAR and the [[14 July Revolution]] made the Arab Federation collapse after only six months. Another attempt, the [[United Arab States]], existed as a confederation between the United Arab Republic, Arab Federation and the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]], but it dissolved in 1961.

Two later attempts represented the enthusiasm of [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar Gaddafi]], the [[Federation of Arab Republics]], which lasted five years, and the [[Arab Islamic Republic]], which never emerged in practice. Aside from the forcible unification of much of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] by the Saudi rulers of Najd during the 1920s, the [[History of the United Arab Emirates#Federation of Emirates|unity of seven Arab emirates]] that form the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Yemeni unification|the unification of North Yemen and South Yemen]] stand today as rare examples of actual unification. The current Syrian government is and the former government of Iraq was led by rival factions of the [[Ba'ath Party]], which continues to espouse pan-Arabism and is organized in several other countries.{{when|date=June 2016}}

==Decline==
[[File:Arab League member states (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|States and territories in the [[Arab League]]]]
The Arab defeat by [[Israel]] in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and the inability of pan-Arabist governments to generate economic growth severely damaged the credibility of pan-Arabism as a relevant ideology.  "By the mid-1970s," according to ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East'', "the idea of Arab unity became less and less apparent in Arab politics, though it remained a wishful goal among the masses."&lt;ref name="Continuum" /&gt;

Egyptians' attachment to pan-Arabism was particularly questioned after the Six-Day War. Nasser had overplayed his hand in trying to form a pan-Arab hegemony under himself. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives, and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Camp David Accords]] between [[Egypt]] and Israel in 1978 further fractured the Arabic-speaking countries. Nasser's successor [[Anwar Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with Israel, revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. The terms ''Arab'', ''Arabism'', and ''Arab unity'' became conspicuously absent.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, pp. 264–65, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1980s, pan-Arabism began to be eclipsed by both nationalist and [[Islamism|Islamist]] ideologies.

Egyptian critics of Arab nationalism contend that it has worked to erode and relegate native Egyptian identity by superimposing only one aspect of Egypt's culture. Those views and sources for collective identification in the Egyptian state are captured in the words of a [[Linguistic anthropology|linguistic anthropologist]] who conducted fieldwork in Cairo:

{{quote|Historically, Egyptians have considered themselves as distinct from 'Arabs' and even at present rarely do they make that identification in casual contexts; ''il-'arab'' [the Arabs] as used by Egyptians refers mainly to the inhabitants of the Gulf states... Egypt has been both a leader of pan-Arabism and a site of intense resentment towards that ideology. Egyptians had to be made, often forcefully, into "Arabs" [during the Nasser era] because they did not historically identify themselves as such. Egypt was self-consciously a nation not only before pan-Arabism but also before becoming a colony of the British Empire. Its territorial continuity since ancient times, its unique history as exemplified in its pharaonic past and later on its [[Coptic language]] and culture, had already made Egypt into a nation for centuries. Egyptians saw themselves, their history, culture and language as specifically Egyptian and not "Arab."&lt;ref&gt;Haeri, Niloofar. ''Sacred language, Ordinary People: Dilemmas of Culture and Politics in Egypt''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. 2003, pp. 47, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A '''participatory information service''' consists of an information provider which helps receivers to find answers to their questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Information services and digital literacy: in search of the boundaries of knowing|last = Huvila|first = Isto|publisher = Elsevier|year = 2012|isbn = 1780633491|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to collaborative services, " that (...) ask for the direct and active involvement of all the interested actors, final users included, [to be performed]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Designing services with innovative methods|last = Miettinen Satu|first = Koivisto Mikko|publisher = University of Art and Design|year = 2009|isbn = 9525018423|location = Helsinki|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of participatory information services is due to global societal and economic changes of this century: the [[Internet]] era, the [[Information Age|information age]] and the [[Learning organization]]. The availability of resources, such as personal data and general information, together with ICT tools ([[Information and communications technology|Information and Communication Technologies]]) have created a perfect match for sharing knowledge through the web involving users and/or consumers participation.

The difference between an [[information service]] and a ''participatory'' information service is that the former one is a service that provides information to a user. In this process, the [[information flow]] is one-way. Whereas, the latter one is based on the culture of participation and the information flow is two-ways.

Wikipedia is a good example of participatory information service. On the one hand, ''The Team Wikipedia'' manages the platform by providing instructions about writing or modifying articles,  approving the contents and publishing them on the website. On the other hand, every user can create a new article and/or edit an existing one in a climate of high degree of mutual trust and relational qualities.

'''''The Pax Britannica Trilogy''''' comprises three books of history written by [[Jan Morris]], formerly James Morris. The books cover the [[British Empire]], from the earliest days of the [[East India Company]] to the troubled years of independence and nineteen sixties post-colonialism. The books were written and published over a ten-year period, beginning in 1968 with ''Pax Britannica: The Climax of Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalogue.bl.uk/primo_library&lt;/ref&gt;

==General description of the books==
Rather than concentrate on particular events the author, while providing detail and background information to the important moments and acts of the Empire in approximate chronological order, chose to present instead an overall impression of empire and its effects on nations and peoples from all sides of the debate.&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelectern.blogspot.co.uk/2007/08/pax-britannica-trilogy-james-morris.html|title=The Lectern: "The Pax Britannica Trilogy"  James Morris|publisher=thelectern.blogspot.co.uk|accessdate=2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The books in chronological order are;
*''Heaven’s Command: An Imperial Progress'' (1973)
*''Pax Britannica: The Climax of Empire'' (1968)
*''Farewell the Trumpets: An Imperial Retreat'' (1978)

A '''promontory fort''' is a [[fortification|defensive structure]] located above a steep cliff, often only connected to the mainland by a small neck of land, thus using the topography to reduce the [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] needed. Although their dating is problematic, most seem to date to the [[Iron Age]]. They are mainly found in [[Brittany]], [[Ireland]], the [[Orkney Islands]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/a2m/iron_age/cc_menu.htm|title=Access to Monuments|author=|date=|website=www.historic-cornwall.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
[[File:DunbegDingleDet.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to Dunbeg Fort]]
Only a few Irish promontory forts have been [[excavations|excavated]] and most date to the [[Iron Age]], though some, like Dunbeg ([[County Kerry]]) might have originated in the [[Bronze Age]]. Others, like [[Dalkey Island]] ([[County Dublin]]) contain imported Eastern Mediterranean [[pottery]] and have been reoccupied and changed in the early [[medieval]] period. Some, like [[Doonmore]] (near Dingle, County Kerry) are associated with the middle ages. Dunbeg contains an early medieval [[corbel]]led stone hut ([[clochan]]).

==Isle of Man==
On the Isle of Man promontory forts are found particularly on the rocky slate [[headlands]] of the south.  Four out of more than 20 have been excavated and several, especially in [[Santon (parish)|Santon]], can be visited using the [[Raad ny Foillan]] coastal footpath. All have a [[Rampart (fortification)|rampart]] on their vulnerable landward side, and excavations at [[Cronk ny Merriu]] have shown that access to the fort was via a strongly built gate.

The [[Norsemen|Scandinavians]] who arrived in Mann in the eighth and ninth centuries [[AD]] sometimes re-used these Iron Age promontory forts, often obliterating the old domestic quarters with their characteristic rectangular houses; the fine example at Cronk ny Merriu has been used as the basis of the reconstruction in the [[House of Manannan]] museum in [[Peel, Isle of Man|Peel]].

==Devon &amp; Cornwall==
[[File:The Rumps - geograph.org.uk - 1520908.jpg|thumb|right|[[The Rumps]] in North Cornwall]]
[[Promontory Forts of Cornwall|Promontory forts]] can be found all along the coast of [[Penwith]]. [[Maen Castle]], near to [[Land's End]] is one of the oldest, having been dated to around 500 [[Before Christ|BC]]. They are also found in other districts, e.g. [[The Rumps]] near Padstow and [[Dodman Point]] on the southern Cornish coast. In Devon, The Aran Islands, [[Burgh Island]] and [[Bolt Tail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape|mnumber=440918|mname=|accessdate=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are located on the south coast and [[Embury Beacon]] and [[Hillsborough, Devon|Hillsborough]] on the north coast.
The famous site at [[Tintagel]] may be a rare example of promontory fort whose occupation continued into the post Roman and from there into later periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/tintagel-castle/history-and-research/history/|title=- English Heritage|author=|date=|website=www.english-heritage.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brittany==
[[Caesar]]'s ''[[de Bello Gallico]]'' describes the [[Veneti (Gaul)|Veneti]] in southern [[Armorica]] – a powerful sea-faring people allied with the southern British during the war of 56 BC – as living in clifftop [[oppidum|oppida]]. Their capital was ''Darioritum''  on the Morbihan bay, now modern [[Vannes]]/Gwened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]], ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' [[Wikisource:The Gallic War (Caesar)/Book 3#8|3:8]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Veneti were linguistically British: they spoke [[Breton language|Breton]], which was derived from [[Cornish language|Cornish]], and they once ruled Cornwall and Devon. They had close trade ties.{{clarification needed|date=November 2015}} When they were attacked by the Romans in [[Brittany]], [[Julius Caesar]] reports that Cornwall sent them military aid.

'''Richard Burn''' (1709 – November 12, 1785) was an English [[legal writer]].

==Education and career==
Burn was born in [[Winton, Cumbria|Winton]], [[Kirkby Stephen]], [[Westmorland]].  He matriculated at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]] in 1729. He was not awarded his B.A. until 1735, three years after he left the university to accept a position as schoolmaster at [[Kirkby Stephen]] in Westmorland. Burn then entered the [[Church of England]], and in 1736 became [[vicar]] of Orton in Westmorland. He was a [[justice of the peace]] for the counties of Westmorland and [[Cumberland]], and devoted himself to the study of law. In 1762, after Burn had attained notoriety as a legal scholar, the [[University of Oxford]] awarded him an honorary [[LL.D]]. He was appointed chancellor of the [[diocese of Carlisle]] in 1765, an office which he held until his death.  He died, aged 86, in [[Orton, Eden|Orton]].{{sfn|Cooper|1886}}

==Writings==
Burn's ''Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer'', first published in 1755, was for many years the standard authority on the law relating to justices of the peace. It has passed through some 30 editions, half of which appeared after Burn's death. His ''Ecclesiastical Law'' (1760), a work of much research, was the foundation upon which were built many modern commentaries on ecclesiastical law.{{sfn|Cooper|1886}}

Burn's other publications include: ''Digest of the Militia Laws'' (1760), ''History of the Poor Laws: with observations'' (1764), and ''A New Law Dictionary'' (2 vols., 1792). The last-named work, published after the author's death by his son, was an update of [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''.{{sfn|Cooper|1886}}

Burn was a noted [[antiquarian]]. He collaborated with [[Joseph Nicolson (antiquarian)|Joseph Nicolson]] to compile ''The History and Antiquities of the Counties of Westmorland and Cumberland'', published in 1777. The two-volume work relates information concerning the families, customs, architecture, and political and religious history of the two counties, and continues to be of great interest to family and local historians.

==Personal life==

Byrd served in the West Virginia House of Delegates from 1947 to 1950, and the West Virginia State Senate from 1950 to 1952. Initially elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1952, Byrd served there for six years before being elected to the Senate in 1958. He rose to become one of the Senate's most powerful members, serving as secretary of the [[Senate Democratic Caucus]] from 1967 to 1971 and—after defeating his longtime colleague, [[Ted Kennedy]]—as [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Whip]] from 1971 to 1977. Over the next three decades, Byrd led the Democratic caucus in numerous roles depending on whether his party held control of the Senate, including [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Minority Leader]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] and President pro tempore emeritus.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; As President pro tempore—a position he held four times in his career—he was third in the [[United States presidential line of succession|line of presidential succession]], after the Vice President and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]].

Serving three different tenures as Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations]] enabled Byrd to steer a great deal of federal money toward projects in West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Woodward, Calvin |url=http://www.register-herald.com/archives/byrd-s-passions-poetry-power-and-home-state-pork/article_7f94bdd3-2199-5f5e-9d7c-920cae75a5a9.html |title=The Associated Press: Byrd's passions: Poetry, power and home-state pork |publisher=Google |date=June 28, 2010 |accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics derided his efforts as [[pork (politics)|pork barrel spending]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100628/ap_on_re_us/us_byrd_s_legacy |title=Pork or progress?

He filibustered against the [[1964 Civil Rights Act]] and supported the [[Vietnam War]], but later renounced racism and segregation, and spoke in opposition to the [[Iraq War]]. Renowned for his knowledge of Senate precedent and [[parliamentary procedure]], Byrd wrote a four-volume history of the Senate in later life.

Near the end of his life, Byrd was in declining health and was hospitalized several times.  He died on June 28, 2010, and was buried at [[Columbia Gardens Cemetery]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].

====Children====
Robert Byrd had two daughters (Mona Byrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore), six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO"/&gt;

===Ku Klux Klan===
In the early 1940s, Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to create a new chapter of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in [[Sophia, West Virginia]].&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP061905"/&gt;

According to Byrd, a Klan official told him, "You have a talent for leadership, Bob&amp;nbsp;... The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation." Byrd later recalled, "Suddenly lights flashed in my mind! Someone important had recognized my abilities! I was only 23 or 24 years old, and the thought of a political career had never really hit me. But strike me that night, it did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Byrd |first=Robert C. |date=2005 |title=Robert C.

In December 1944, Byrd wrote to [[racial segregation|segregationist]] [[Mississippi]] Senator [[Theodore G. Bilbo]]:

{{quote|I shall never fight in the armed forces with a negro by my side&amp;nbsp;... Rather I should die a thousand times, and see [[Old Glory]] trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds.|Robert C. Byrd, in a letter to Sen. Theodore Bilbo (D-MS), 1944&lt;ref name="WP061905"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Katznelson |first= Ira |title= When Affirmative Action Was White: An Untold History Of Racial Inequality In Twentieth-century America |publisher= Norton |year= 2005 |page=81 |isbn=0-393-05213-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1946, Byrd wrote a letter to a [[Grand Wizard]] stating, "The Klan is needed today as never before, and I am anxious to see its rebirth here in West Virginia and in every state in the nation."&lt;ref&gt;King, Colbert I.: [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/2002/03/02/sen-byrd-the-view-from-darrells-barbershop/4d78d270-f993-4336-b08c-4c83852157ef/ ''Sen. Byrd: The view from Darrell's barbershop''], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; However, when running for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1952, he announced "After about a year, I became disinterested, quit paying my dues, and dropped my membership in the organization. During the nine years that have followed, I have never been interested in the Klan." He said he had joined the Klan because he felt it offered excitement and was [[anti-communist]].&lt;ref name="WP061905"/&gt;

Byrd later called joining the KKK "the greatest mistake I ever made."&lt;ref name=slatebyrd /&gt; In 1997, he told an interviewer he would encourage young people to become involved in politics but also warned, "Be sure you avoid the Ku Klux Klan. Don't get that [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] around your neck. Once you've made that mistake, you inhibit your operations in the political arena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Democrats' Lott |url =https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1040607367889016753 |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his last autobiography, Byrd explained that he was a KKK member because he "was sorely afflicted with tunnel vision—a jejune and immature outlook—seeing only what I wanted to see because I thought the Klan could provide an outlet for my talents and ambitions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Robert C. Byrd: Child of the Appalachian Coalfields |author=Byrd, Robert C. |publisher=West Virginia University Press |location=Morgantown |year=2005 |isbn= 1-933202-00-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Byrd also said in 2005, "I know now I was wrong. Intolerance had no place in America. I apologized a thousand times&amp;nbsp;... and I don't mind apologizing over and over again. I can't erase what happened."&lt;ref name="WP061905"/&gt;

==Early career==
Byrd worked as a gas station attendant, a grocery store clerk, a [[shipyard]] [[welder]] during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], and a butcher before he won a seat in the [[West Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1946, representing [[Raleigh County, West Virginia|Raleigh County]] from 1947 to 1950.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; Byrd became a local celebrity after a radio station in [[Beckley, West Virginia|Beckley]] began broadcasting his "fiery fundamentalist lessons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Holley|first1=Joe|title=Sen.

In 1951, Byrd was among the official witnesses of the execution of Harry Burdette and Fred Painter, which was the first use of the [[electric chair]] in West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Trail, West Virginia, February 1998 Programs|publisher=West Virginia Division of Culture and History|date=February 1, 1998|url=http://www.wvculture.org/hiStory/timetrl/ttfeb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 the state abolished capital punishment, with the last execution having occurred in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/west-virginia-0]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continued education===
[[File:Byrd jfk.gif|thumb|right|Byrd and JFK at his 1963 commencement ceremony]]
Early in his career Byrd attended [[Mountain State University|Beckley College]], [[Concord University|Concord College]], [[University of Charleston|Morris Harvey College]], [[Marshall University|Marshall College]], and [[George Washington University Law School]],&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO"/&gt; and joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=November 20, 2008|title=Frater Robert Byrd Celebrates 91st Birthday|url=http://www.tke.org/news/2008/11/20/frater-robert-byrd-celebrates-91st-birthday|newspaper=Tau  Epsilon|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd began night classes at [[American University]] [[Washington College of Law]] in 1953, while a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He earned his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] ''cum laude'' a decade later,&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO"/&gt; by which time he was a [[U.S. Senator]]. President [[John F. Kennedy]] spoke at the commencement ceremony on June 10, 1963 and presented the graduates their diplomas, including Byrd. Byrd completed law school in an era when undergraduate degrees were not a requirement. He later decided to complete his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]], and in 1994 he graduated ''[[Latin honors|summa cum laude]]'' from [[Marshall University]].&lt;ref name="111809_CNN_Byrd"/&gt;

==Congressional service==
In 1952, Byrd was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[West Virginia's 6th congressional district]],&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; succeeding [[E. H. Hedrick]], who retired from the House to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of West Virginia|Governor]]. Byrd was re-elected twice from this district, anchored in [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] and also including his home in Sophia, serving from January 3, 1953 to January 3, 1959.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; Byrd defeated [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[W. Chapman Revercomb]] for the [[United States Senate]] in 1958. Revercomb's record supporting civil rights had become an issue, playing in Byrd's favor.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; Byrd was re-elected to the Senate eight times. He was West Virginia's junior senator for his first four terms; his colleague from 1959 to 1985 was [[Jennings Randolph]], who had been elected on the same day as Byrd's first election in a special election to fill the seat of the late Senator [[Matthew Neely]].

While Byrd faced some vigorous Republican opposition in his career, his last serious electoral opposition occurred in 1982 when he was challenged by freshman Congressman [[Cleve Benedict]]. Despite his tremendous popularity in the state, Byrd ran unopposed only once, in 1976. On three other occasions – in 1970, 1994 and 2000 – he won all 55 of West Virginia's counties. In his re-election bid in 2000, he won all but seven [[precinct]]s. Congresswoman [[Shelley Moore Capito]], the daughter of one of Byrd's longtime foes, former governor [[Arch A. Moore Jr.|Arch Moore Jr.]], briefly considered a challenge to Byrd in 2006 but decided against it.  Capito's district covered much of the territory Byrd had represented in the U.S. House.

In the 1960 Democratic presidential election primaries, Byrd – a close Senate ally of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – endorsed and campaigned for [[Hubert Humphrey]] over front-runner [[John F. Kennedy]] in the state's crucial [[primary election|primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawrence|first=William H.|title=Politics: New Campaign Tactics Emerge; West Virginia's Popularity Contest Now Takes On Deeper Meaning for the National Campaign|work=The New York Times|date=May 1, 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kennedy won the state's primary and eventually the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=Michael|title=John F.

===Public service records===
[[File:Robert C. Byrd – 1967.jpg|thumb|200px|Byrd early in his Senate career]]
Byrd was elected to a record ninth consecutive full Senate term on November 7, 2006. He became the [[List of United States Congressmen by longevity of service#Senate time|longest-serving]] senator in American history on June 12, 2006, surpassing [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]] with 17,327 days of service.&lt;ref name="TheHill_longevity"&gt;{{cite news | title=Byrd poised to break Thurmond's record | author=Jonathan Allen | publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] | date=May 31, 2006 | url=http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/053106/news2.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614190120/http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/053106/news2.html| archivedate=June 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, 2009, Byrd became the longest-serving member in congressional history, with 56 years, 320 days of combined service in the House and Senate, passing [[Carl Hayden]] of Arizona.&lt;ref name="news.aol.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="111809_CNN_Byrd"&gt;{{cite news | title=West Virginia's Byrd becomes the longest-serving member of Congress | author=Tom Cohen |publisher=CNN | date=November 18, 2009 | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/11/18/robert.byrd.congress.record/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Byrd had held the record for the [[List of United States Congressmen by longevity of service#Senate time|longest unbroken tenure]] in the Senate (Thurmond resigned during his first term and was re-elected seven months later). He is the only senator ever to serve more than 50 years. Including his tenure as a state legislator from 1947 to 1953, Byrd's service on the political front exceeded 60 continuous years. Byrd, who never lost an election, cast his 18,000th vote on June 21, 2007, the most of any senator in history.&lt;ref name="111809_CNN_Byrd" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Another milestone for Sen.

Upon the death of former Florida Senator [[George Smathers]] on January 20, 2007, Byrd became the last living United States Senator from the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Senators Who Have Cast More than 10,000 Votes | publisher=[[United States Senate]] Democratic Policy Committee Vote Information Office | date=January 3, 2009 | url=http://senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/10000_or_more_votes.htm U.S. Senate | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Having taken part in the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the union, Byrd was the last surviving senator to have voted on a bill granting [[U.S. state|statehood]] to a U.S. territory. At the time of Byrd's death, fourteen sitting or former members of the Senate had not been born when Byrd's tenure in the Senate began, President [[Barack Obama]] among them.

===Filibuster of the Civil Rights Act of 1964===
[[File:Byrd meeting with Ford.jpg|thumb|right|Majority Whip Byrd meeting with President [[Gerald Ford]]]]
Byrd was a member of the wing of the Democratic Party that opposed federally-mandated desegregation and civil rights. However, despite his early career in the [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]], Byrd was linked to such senators as [[John C. Stennis]], [[J. William Fulbright]] and [[George Smathers]], who based their segregationist positions on their view of [[states' rights]] in contrast to senators like [[James Eastland]], who held a reputation as a committed racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kaufman |first=Burton Ira |date=2006 |title=The Carter Years |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=jIzooiFd6IoC&amp;pg=PA170 |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Facts On File |page=170 |isbn=978-0-8160-5369-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd joined with [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senators to [[filibuster]] the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]],&lt;ref name="cra64"&gt;{{Cite journal | title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 | publisher=Find Us Law | url=http://finduslaw.com/civil_rights_act_of_1964_cra_title_vii_equal_employment_opportunities_42_us_code_chapter_21 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In 2005, Byrd told ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that his membership in the [[Baptist]] church led to a change in his views. In the opinion of one reviewer, Byrd, like other Southern and border-state Democrats, came to realize that he would have to temper "his blatantly [[racial segregation|segregationist]] views" and move to the Democratic Party mainstream if he wanted to play a role nationally.&lt;ref name="WP061905"/&gt;

=== Vietnam ===
In February 1968, Byrd questioned General [[Earle Wheeler]] during the latter's testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. During a White House meeting between President Johnson and congressional Democratic leaders on February 6, Byrd stated his concern for the ongoing Vietnam conflict, citing the U.S.'s lack of intelligence, preparation, underestimating of the morale and vitality of the Viet Cong, and overestimated how backed Americans would be by the South Vietnam government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Last Great Senator: Robert C.

===1968 Presidential election===
During the 1968 [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1968|Democratic Party presidential primaries]], Byrd supported the incumbent President Johnson. Of the challenging [[Robert F. Kennedy]], Byrd said, "Bobby-come-lately has made a mistake. I won't even listen to him. There are many who liked his brother—as Bobby will find out—but who don't like him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur|last=M. Schlesinger|page=858|title=Robert Kennedy and His Times|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn= 978-0395248973|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership roles===
[[File:DemSenateLeadersDesk.jpg|thumb|right|Drawer of the Senate desk used by Democratic leaders, including Byrd]]

Byrd served in the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded [[George Smathers]] as secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; He unseated [[Ted Kennedy]] in 1971 to become [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|majority whip]], or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; Smathers recalled that, "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, here was Bob up here calling on the phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching [[Lyndon Johnson]]." Byrd himself had told Smathers that " I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim."&lt;ref&gt;George A. Smathers. United States Senator from Florida, 1951–1969. "Interview #6: Senate Democratic Leadership." Tuesday, September 19, 1989. Interviewed by Donald A. Ritchie https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/resources/pdf/Smathers_interview_6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Byrd was the "favorite son" Presidential candidate in West Virginia's primary. His easy victory gave him control of the delegation to the Democratic National Convention. Byrd had the inside track as majority whip but focused most of his time running for majority leader, more so than for re-election to the Senate, as he was virtually unopposed for his fourth term. By the time the vote for majority leader came, his lead was so secure that his lone rival, Minnesota's [[Hubert Humphrey]], withdrew before the balloting took place. From 1977 to 1989 Byrd was the leader of the Senate Democrats, serving as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|majority leader]] from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, and as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|minority leader]] from 1981 to 1987.&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt;

====Appropriations Committee====
Byrd was well known for steering federal dollars to West Virginia, one of the country's poorest states. He was called the "King of [[pork barrel|Pork]]" by [[Citizens Against Government Waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Citizens Against Government Waste: Byrd Droppings |publisher=[[Citizens Against Government Waste]] |url=http://www.cagw.org/site/PageServer?pagename=news_byrddroppings |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

He passed that mark in 1991, and funds for highways, dams, educational institutions, and federal agency offices flowed unabated over the course of his membership. More than 30 existing or pending federal projects bear his name. He commented on his reputation for attaining funds for projects in West Virginia in August 2006, when he called himself "Big Daddy" at the dedication for the Robert C. Byrd Biotechnology Science Center.&lt;ref&gt;

====Parliamentary expertise====
Byrd also was known for using his knowledge of [[parliamentary procedure]]. Byrd frustrated Republicans with his encyclopedic knowledge of the inner workings of the Senate, particularly prior to the [[Reagan Revolution]]. From 1977 to 1979 he was described as "performing a procedural tap dance around the minority, outmaneuvering Republicans with his mastery of the [[Rules of the United States Senate|Senate's arcane rules]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sheryl Gay Stolberg | title=DISPUTE IN THE SENATE: THE PLAYERS; Behind the Scenes, an Army of Senate Aides Takes On the Filibuster Fight | date=May 20, 2005 | work=The New York Times | url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C13FD3F5D0C738EDDAC0894DD404482 | access-date=February 12, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520192426/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20C13FD3F5D0C738EDDAC0894DD404482 | archive-date=May 20, 2013 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, majority leader Byrd [[Motion (parliamentary procedure)|moved]] a [[Call of the house|call of the Senate]], which was adopted by the majority present, in order to have the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate|Sergeant-at-Arms]] arrest members not in attendance.

====President pro tempore====
As the longest-serving Democratic senator, Byrd served as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] four times when his party was in the majority:&lt;ref name="CONG_BIO" /&gt; from 1989 until the Republicans won control of the Senate in 1995; for 17 days in early 2001, when the Senate was evenly split between parties and outgoing Vice President [[Al Gore]] broke the tie in favor of the Democrats; when the Democrats regained the majority in June 2001 after Senator [[Jim Jeffords]] of [[Vermont]] left the Republican Party to become an independent; and again from 2007 to his death in 2010, as a result of the [[United States Senate elections, 2006|2006 Senate elections]]. In this capacity, Byrd was third in the line of presidential succession at the time of his death, behind Vice President [[Joe Biden]] and House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]].

===Scholarships and TAH History Grants===
In 1969, Byrd launched a Scholastic Recognition Award; he also began to present a savings bond to valedictorians from high schools—public and private—in West Virginia. In 1985 Congress approved the nation's only merit-based scholarship program funded through the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]], a program which Congress later named in Byrd's honor. The [[Robert C. Byrd Honors Scholarship Program]] initially comprised a one-year, $1,500 award to students with "outstanding academic achievement" who had been accepted at a college or university. In 1993, the program began providing four-year scholarships.&lt;ref name="byrd_education"/&gt;

In 2002 Byrd secured unanimous approval for a major national initiative to strengthen the teaching of "traditional American history" in K-12 public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | author=Miriam E.

===Senate historian===
[[File:Byrd baker book 1.jpg|thumb|right|Byrd and [[Richard A. Baker (historian)|Dr. Richard Baker]], the Senate historian]]
Television cameras were first introduced to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on March 19, 1979, by [[C-SPAN]]. Unsatisfied that Americans only saw Congress as the House of Representatives, Byrd and others pushed to televise Senate proceedings to prevent the Senate from becoming the "invisible branch" of government, succeeding in June 1986.

To help introduce the public to the inner workings of the legislative process, Byrd launched a series of one hundred speeches based on his examination of the [[Roman Republic]] and the intent of the Framers. Byrd published a four-volume series on Senate history: ''The Senate: 1789–1989: Addresses on the History of the Senate''.&lt;ref&gt;
[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]], 1989–94&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume won the Henry Adams Prize of the Society for History in the Federal Government as "an outstanding contribution to research in the history of the Federal Government." He also published ''The Senate of the Roman Republic: Addresses on the History of Roman Constitutionalism''.&lt;ref&gt;
Government Printing Office, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Byrd received the [[American Historical Association]]'s first [[Theodore Roosevelt]]-[[Woodrow Wilson]] Award for Civil Service; in 2007, Byrd received the [[Friend of History Award]] from the [[Organization of American Historians]]. Both awards honor individuals outside the academy who have made a significant contribution to the writing and/or presentation of history.  In 2014, [http://www.byrdcenter.org/ The Byrd Center for Legislative Studies] began assessing the archiving of Senator Byrd's electronic correspondence and floor speeches in order to preserve these documents and make them available to the wider community.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, M.

On July 19, 2007, Byrd gave a 25-minute speech in the Senate against [[dog fighting]], in response to the indictment of football player [[Michael Vick]].&lt;ref&gt;
Byrd called dog fighting a "brutal, [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] event motivated by barbarism of the worst sort and cruelty of the worst, worst, worst sadistic kind.

For 2007, Byrd was deemed the fourteenth-most powerful senator, as well as the twelfth-most powerful Democratic senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Power Rank Standings | publisher=Power Rankings | url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/power_card.tt?id=622 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712145141/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/power_card.tt?id=622 | archivedate=July 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 19, 2008, Byrd endorsed [[Barack Obama]] (D-[[Illinois]]). One week after the West Virginia Democratic Primary, in which [[Hillary Clinton]] defeated Obama by 41 to 32 percent,&lt;ref&gt;

On January 26, 2009, Byrd was one of three Democrats to vote against the confirmation of [[Timothy Geithner]] as [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] (along with [[Russ Feingold]] of [[Wisconsin]] and [[Tom Harkin]] of [[Iowa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress – 1st Session |publisher=[[United States Senate]] |url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00015 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

On February 26, 2009, Byrd was one of two Democrats to vote against the [[District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009]], which if it had become law would have added a voting seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for the [[District of Columbia]] and add a seat for [[Utah]], explaining that he supported the intent of the legislation, but regarded it as an attempt to solve with legislation an issue which required resolution with a Constitutional amendment.  (Democrat [[Max Baucus]] of [[Montana]] also cast a "nay" vote.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 111th Congress – 1st Session | publisher=[[United States Senate]] | url=http://senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Although his health was poor, Byrd was present for every crucial vote during the December 2009 Senatorial healthcare debate; his vote was necessary so Democrats could obtain [[cloture]] to break a Republican filibuster. At the final vote on December 24, 2009, Byrd referenced recently deceased Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], a devoted proponent, when casting his vote: "Mr. President, this is for my friend Ted Kennedy! Aye!"&lt;ref&gt;

==Political views==

===Race===
[[File:Robert Byrd Majority Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Byrd as Majority Leader]]

Byrd initially compiled a mixed record on the subjects of race relations and desegregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Draper |first=Robert |date=July 31, 2008 |title=Old as the Hill |url=https://www.gq.com/story/senator-robert-byrd-congress |newspaper=GQ |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While he initially voted against civil rights legislation, in 1959 he hired one of the Capitol's first black congressional aides, and he also took steps to integrate the [[United States Capitol Police]] for the first time since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].&lt;ref name="Old as the Hill"&gt;[https://www.gq.com/story/senator-robert-byrd-congress ''Old as the Hill'']&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, Byrd explicitly renounced his earlier views favoring [[racial segregation]].&lt;ref name=slatebyrd&gt;{{cite news| title = What About Byrd?| publisher = Slate| date = December 18, 2002| url =http://www.slate.com/id/2075662| accessdate =September 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sen.

Byrd also said that his views changed dramatically after his teenage grandson was killed in a 1982 traffic accident, which put him in a deep emotional valley. "The death of my grandson caused me to stop and think," said Byrd, adding he came to realize  that African-Americans love their children as much as he does his.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-span.org/capitolhistory/ram/byrd.ram|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928192148/http://www.c-span.org/capitolhistory/ram/byrd.ram|archivedate=September 28, 2006 |title=C-SPAN |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During debate in 1983 over the passage of the law creating the [[Martin Luther King Jr. Day]] holiday, Byrd grasped the symbolism of the day and its significance to his legacy, telling members of his staff "I'm the only one in the Senate who '''''must''''' vote for this bill".&lt;ref name="Old as the Hill"/&gt;

Byrd was the only senator to vote against confirming both [[Thurgood Marshall]] and [[Clarence Thomas]] to the [[United States Supreme Court]], the only two [[African-American]] nominees. In Marshall's case, Byrd asked [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to look into the possibility that Marshall had either connections to [[Communism|communists]] or a communist past.&lt;ref&gt;

He called Thomas's comments a "diversionary tactic" and said "I thought we were past that stage." Regarding [[Anita Hill]]'s [[sexual harassment]] charges against Thomas, Byrd supported Hill.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Robert.

On March 29, 1968, Byrd criticized a [[Memphis, Tennessee]] protest: "It was a shameful and totally uncalled for outburst of lawfulness undoubtedly encouraged to some considerable degree, at least, by his [Dr. King's] words and actions, and his presence. There is no reason for us to believe that the same destructive rioting and violence cannot, or that it will not, happen here if King attempts his so-called [[Poor People's March]], for what he plans in Washington appears to be something on a far greater scale than what he had indicated he planned to do in Memphis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thurgood Marshall: Supreme Court Justice|page=168|first=Joseph|last=Nazel|year=1993|publisher=Holloway House Publishing Company|isbn=978-0870675843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 4, 2001 interview with [[Tony Snow]], Byrd said of race relations:

{{quote|They're much, much better than they've ever been in my life-time&amp;nbsp;... I think we talk about race too much. I think those problems are largely behind us&amp;nbsp;... I just think we talk so much about it that we help to create somewhat of an illusion. I think we try to have good will. My old mom told me, 'Robert, you can't go to heaven if you hate anybody.' We practice that. There are [[white niggers]]. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time, if you want to use that word. We just need to work together to make our country a better country, and I'd just as soon quit talking about it so much.&lt;ref name="CNN030401"&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/04/byrd.slur/ Top Senate Democrat apologizes for slur]," [[CNN]], March 4, 2001. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130629084024/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/03/04/byrd.slur/ |date=June 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byrd's use of the term "white nigger" created immediate controversy. When asked about it, Byrd responded,
 
{{quote|I apologize for the characterization I used on this program&amp;nbsp;... The phrase dates back to my boyhood and has no place in today's society&amp;nbsp;... In my attempt to articulate strongly held feelings, I may have offended people.&lt;ref name="CNN030401"/&gt;}}

For the 2003–2004 session, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.naacp.org/page/-/washington%20bureau/108thCongress.pdf|title=NAACP |format=PDF |accessdate=May 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; rated Byrd's voting record as being 100% in line with the NAACP's position on the thirty-three Senate bills they evaluated. Sixteen other senators received that rating. In June 2005, Byrd proposed an additional $10,000,000 in federal funding for the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial]] in Washington, D.C., remarking that, "With the passage of time, we have come to learn that his [[I Have a Dream speech|Dream]] was the [[American Dream]], and few ever expressed it more eloquently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/2005_june/06_27_2005.html |title=Robert Byrd Senate Office |publisher=Byrd.senate.gov |date=June 27, 2005 |accessdate=June 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702083411/http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/2005_june/06_27_2005.html |archivedate=July 2, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon news of his death, the NAACP released a statement praising Byrd, saying that he "became a champion for civil rights and liberties" and "came to consistently support the NAACP civil rights agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-mourns-the-passing-of-u.s.-senator-robert-byrd/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707183755/http://www.naacp.org/press/entry/naacp-mourns-the-passing-of-u.s.-senator-robert-byrd/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 7, 2010|title=NAACP Mourns the Passing of U.S. Senator Robert Byrd {{!}} Press Room|website=www.naacp.org|access-date=August 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinton impeachment===
Byrd initially said that the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment proceedings]] against Clinton should be taken seriously. Although he harshly criticized any attempt to make light of the allegations, he made the [[motion to dismiss]] the charges and effectively end the matter. Even though he voted against both articles of impeachment, he was the sole Democrat to vote to [[censure]] Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/vote_menu_106_1.htm |title=U.S. Senate |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT rights===
Byrd strongly opposed Clinton's 1993 efforts to allow gays to [[Don't ask, don't tell|serve in the military]] and supported efforts to limit [[gay marriage]]. In 1996, before the passage of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], he said, "The drive for same-sex marriage is, in effect, an effort to make a sneak attack on society by encoding this aberrant behavior in legal form before society itself has decided it should be legal. [...] Let us defend the oldest institution, the institution of marriage between male and female as set forth in the Holy Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/11/us/senators-reject-both-job-bias-ban-and-gay-marriage.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title=Senators Reject Both Job-Bias Ban And Gay Marriage |first=Eric |last=Schmitt |date=September 11, 1996 |accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his previous position, he later stated his opposition to the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] and argued that it was unnecessary because the states already had the power to ban gay marriages.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://byrd.senate.gov/newsroom/news_june/marriage_amdt.html Robert Byrd Senate Office] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104220045/http://byrd.senate.gov/newsroom/news_june/marriage_amdt.html |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the amendment came to the Senate floor, he was one of the two Democratic senators who voted in favor of [[cloture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.org/voteno/files/060607_FMAvote.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tfTvHNaV?url=http://www.hrc.org/voteno/files/060607_FMAvote.pdf|archivedate=October 22, 2010 |title=Human Rights Campaign |format=PDF |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
On March 11, 1982, Byrd voted against a measure sponsored by Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] that sought to reverse ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' and allow Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortions. Its passing was the first time a congressional committee supported an anti-abortion amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/11/us/abortion-curbs-endorsed-10-7-by-senate-panel.html|title=ABORTION CURBS ENDORSED, 10-7, BY SENATE PANEL|date=March 11, 1982|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/28/magazine/howard-baker-trying-to-tame-an-unruly-senate.html|title=HOWARD BAKER TRYING TO TAME AN UNRULY SENATE|date=March 28, 1982|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Byrd voted against a ban on [[intact dilation and extraction]], a late-term abortion procedure typically referred to by its opponents as "partial-birth abortion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/bill/2752/7841/53359/partial-birthlate-term-abortion-ban-act-of-1995#.Wx6UQUgvzIU|title=HR 1833 - Partial-Birth/Late-Term Abortion Ban - National Key Vote|last=|first=|date=|website=votesmart.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, however, he voted for the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], which prohibits intact dilation and extraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00402 |title=U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 108th Congress – 1st Session |publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd also voted against the 2004 [[Unborn Victims of Violence Act]], which recognizes a "child in utero" as a legal victim if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of a crime of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=108&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00063|title=U.S. Senate: Roll Call Vote|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=January 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1970, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a plan to replace the Electoral College with direct elections of presidents. Byrd initially opposed direct elections on the key vote and was one of two senators to switch votes in favor of the proposal during later votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/04/24/archives/senate-unit-asks-popular-election-of-the-president-amendment-to.html|title=SENATE UNIT ASKS POPULAR ELECTION OF THE PRESIDENT|date=April 24, 1970|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1970, as the Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a vote on Supreme Court nominee [[Harry Blackmun]], Byrd stated that "no nomination should be voted on within 24 hours after the hearing" after the previous two Supreme Court nominees had delays and was one of the 17 committee members who went on record of assuring Blackmun's nomination would be reported favorably to the full Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/05/01/archives/senators-put-off-vote-on-blackmun-decision-by-judiciary-panel.html|title=SENATORS PUT OFF VOTE ON BLACKMUN|date=May 1, 1970|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1970, [[John Sherman Cooper]] and [[Frank Church]] sponsored legislation that would prevent President Nixon from using funds for American military operations in Cambodia. the Nixon administration disclosed that President Nixon had written letter of support for a neutralizing amendment sponsored by Byrd that would have been offered as an addition to the Cooper‐Church amendment while allowing the president the ability to take "such action as may be necessary to protect the lives of United States forces in South Vietnam or to facilitate the withdrawal of United States forces from Vietnam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/06/05/archives/gipullout-plans-await-end-of-drive-in-cambodia-troop-cut-awaits-end.html|title=G.I.‐Pullout Plans Await End of Drive in Cambodia|first=Robert B.|last=Semple, Jr.|date=June 5, 1970|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1970, Byrd sponsored an amendment protecting members of Congress and those elected that have not yet assumed office. Byrd mentioned the 88 political assassinations in the United States and said state law was not adequate to handle the increase in political violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1970/10/09/archives/rush-of-crime-bills-voted-by-senate-in-night-session-anticrime.html|title=Rush of Crime Bills Voted By Senate in Night Session|first=Marjorie|last=Hunter|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1971, after [[Fred R. Harris]] and [[Charles Mathias]] requested the Senate Rules Committee change the rules to permit selection of committee chairmen on a basis aside from seniority, Byrd indicated through his line of questioning that he saw considerable value in the seniority system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/02/13/archives/harris-and-mathias-ask-seniority-curb.html|title=HARRIS AND MATHIAS ASK SENIORITY CURB|date=February 13, 1971|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1971, after Representative [[Hale Boggs]] stated that he had been tapped by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and called on FBI Director [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to resign, Byrd opined that Boggs' imagination was involved and called on him to reveal any possible "good, substantial, bona fide evidence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/08/archives/kleindienst-assails-boggs-invites-inquiry-into-fbi-us-aide-assails.html|title=Kleindienst Assails Boggs; Invites Inquiry Into F.B.I.|date=April 8, 1971|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1971, Byrd met with President Nixon, [[Hugh Scott]], and [[Robert P. Griffin]] for a briefing that after which Byrd, Scott, and Griffin asserted they had been told by Nixon of his intent to withdraw American forces from [[Indochina]] by a specific date. White House Press Secretary [[Ronald L. Ziegler]] disputed their claims by stating that the three had not been told anything by Nixon he had not mentioned in his speech the same day as the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/09/archives/3-senators-aver-nixon-said-he-had-pullout-deadline-but-white-house.html|title=3 SENATORS AVER NIXON SAID HE HAD PULLOUT DEADLINE|date=April 9, 1971|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1971, [[Jacob Javits]], Fred R. Harris, and [[Charles H. Percy]] circulated letters to their fellow Senators in an attempt to gain cosponsors for a resolution appoint the Senate's first girl pages. Byrd maintained that the Senate was ill equipped for girl pages and was among those that cited the long hours of work, the carrying or sometimes heavy documents and the high crime rate in the Capitol area as among the reasons against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/11/archives/3-senators-press-girlpage-drive-resolution-barring-denial-of-job.html|title=3 SENATORS PRESS GIRL‐PAGE DRIVE|date=April 11, 1971|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1971, Representative [[Richard H. Poff]] was under consideration by President Nixon for a Supreme Court nomination, Byrd warning Poff that his nomination could be met with opposition by liberal senators and see a filibuster emerge. Within hours, Poff announced his declining of the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/10/06/archives/senator-warned-poff-of-a-floor-battle.html|title=Senator Warned Poff of a Floor Battle|date=October 6, 1971|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1972, Senate Majority Leader Mansfield announced that he had authorized Byrd to present an amendment to the Senate for a fixed deadline for total troop withdrawal that the Nixon administration would be obligated to meet and that the measure would serve as an amendment to the State Department‐United States Information Agency authorization bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/16/archives/new-senate-war-debate-seen-on-mansfield-pullout-measure.html|title=New Senate War Debate Seen On Mansfield Pullout Measure|date=April 16, 1972|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1972, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved the nomination of [[Richard G. Kleindienst]] as [[United States Attorney General]], Byrd being one of four Democrats to support the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/28/archives/senate-unit-114-again-approves-kleindienst-post-way-is-cleared-for.html|title=SENATE UNIT, 11‐4, AGAIN APPROVES KEINDIENST POST|date=April 28, 1972|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, Byrd announced that he would vote against Kleindienst, saying in a news release that this was Nixon's first nomination that he had not voted to confirm and that testimony at hearings investigating Kleindienst's tenure at the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation displayed "a show of arrogance and deception and insensitivity to the people's right to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/08/archives/top-democrat-asks-kleindienst-defeat.html|title=TOP DEMOCRAT ASKS KLEINDIENST DEFEAT|publisher=New York Times|date=June 8, 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 1972 luncheon speech, Byrd criticized American newspapers for "an increasing tendency toward shoddy technical production" and observed that there was "a greater schism between the Nixon Administration and the media, at least publicly, than at any previous time in our history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/31/archives/senator-scores-newspapers-for-shoddy-production.html|title=Senator Scores Newspapers For ‘Shoddy’ Production|date=May 31, 1972|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1972, Byrd introduced a proposal supported by the Nixon administration that would make cutting off all funding for American hostilities in Indochina conditional upon agreement on an internationally supervised cease‐fire. Byrd and Nixon supporters argued modification would bring the amendment more in line with President Nixon's proposal to withdraw all American forces from Vietnam the previous week and it was approved in the Senate by a vote of 47 to 43.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/05/17/archives/senate-4743-adds-ceasefire-to-amendment-to-halt-the-war.html|title=Senate, 47‐43, Adds Cease‐Fire To Amendment to Halt the War|date=May 17, 1972|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1972, [[Edward Brooke]] attempted to reintroduce his war ending amendment that had been defeated earlier in the week as an addendum to a clean drinking water bill when he discovered that Byrd had arranged a unanimous consent free agreement prohibiting amendments that were not relevant to the subject. Brooke charged the Byrd agreements with impairing his senatorial prerogatives to introduce amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/09/29/archives/panel-resubmits-vetoed-hew-bill-seeks-to-make-nixon-pick-programs.html|title=PANEL RESUBMITS VETOED H.E.W. BILE|date=September 29, 1972|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1972 general election campaign, Democratic nominee [[George McGovern]] advocated for partial amnesty for draft dodges. Byrd responded to the position in a November speech the day before the election without mentioning McGovern by name in saying, "How could we keep faith with the thousands of Americans we sent to Vietnam by giving a mere tap on the wrist to those who fled to Canada and Sweden?" Byrd said the welfare proposals were part of "pernicious doctrine that the Federal Government owes a living to people who don't want to work" and chastised individuals that had personal trips to Hanoi rather than official missions as "the Ramsey Clarks in our society who attempt to deal unilaterally with the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/11/07/archives/democratic-whip-criticizes-mcgovern-campaign-views.html|title=THE 1972 CAMPAIGN|date=November 7, 1972|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1973, the Senate passed legislation containing an amendment Byrd offered requiring President Nixon to give Congress an accounting of all funds that he had impounded and appropriated by February 5. Byrd stated that President Nixon had been required to submit reports to Congress and that he had not done so since June, leaving Congress in the dark on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/07/archives/senate-vote-calls-on-nixon-to-report-impounded-funds.html|title=Senate Vote Calls on Nixon To Report Impounded Funds|date=January 7, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1973, the Senate approved legislation requiring confirmation of the director and deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget in the White House in what was seen as "another battleground for the dispute between Congress and the White House over cuts in social spending programs in the current Federal budget and in the Nixon Administration's spending request for the fiscal year 1974, which begins next July 1". The legislation contained an amendment sponsored by Byrd limiting the budget officials to a maximum term of four years before having another confirmation proceeding. Byrd introduced another amendment that required all Cabinet officers be required to undergo reconfirmation by the Senate in the event that they are retained from one administration to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/06/archives/senate-votes-to-require-approval-of-budget-aides-move-to-seek.html|title=Senate Votes to Require Approval of Budget Aides|first=James M.|last=Naughton|date=February 6, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1973, Byrd led Senate efforts to reject a proposal that would have made most critical committee meetings open to the public, arguing that tampering with "the rides of the Senate is to tamper with the Senate itself" and argued against changing "procedures which, over the long past, have contributed to stability and efficiency in the operation of the Senate." The Senate voted down the proposal 47 to 38 on March 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/07/archives/senate-47-to-38-retains-a-limit-on-open-hearings-senate-retains.html|title=Senate, 47 to 38, Retains A Limit on Open Hearings|first=David E.|last=Rosenbaum|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 1973, the anniversary of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's death, Byrd called on President Nixon to appoint a permanent successor for Hoover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/03/archives/hoover-anniversary-is-ignored-by-fbi.html|title=Hoover Anniversary Is Ignored by F.B.I.|date=May 3, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1973, Byrd sponsored a bill that would impose the first Tuesday in October as the date for all federal elections and mandate that states hold primary elections for federal elections between the first Tuesday in June and the first Tuesday in July. Senate Rules Committee approved the measure on June 13 and it was sent to the Senate floor for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/14/archives/panel-passes-bill-to-cut-campaigns.html|title=PANEL PASSES BILL TO CUT CAMPAIGNS|date=June 14, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1973, along with [[Lloyd Bentsen]], Mike Mansfield, [[John Tower]], and [[Jennings Randolph]], Byrd was one of five senators to switch their vote on the foreign military aid authorization bill to assure its passage after previously voting against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/27/archives/senate-approves-military-aid-bill-votes-770million-after-rejecting.html|title=SENATE APPROVES MILITARY AID BILL|date=June 27, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1973, President Nixon vetoed the request of the United States Information Agency for 208 million for fiscal year 1974 on the grounds of a provision forcing the agency to provide any document or information demanded. Byrd introduced a bill identical to the one vetoed by Nixon the following month, differing in not containing the information provision as well as a ban on appropriating or spending more money than the annual budget called for, the Senate approving the legislation on November 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/14/archives/senate-approves-altered-usia-bill.html|title=SENATE APPROVES ALTERED U.S.I.A. BILL|date=November 14, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1973, after the Senate rejected an amendment to the [[National Energy Emergency Act]] intending to direct President Nixon to put gasoline rationing into effect on January 15, Byrd indicated the final vote not coming for multiple days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/11/16/archives/senate-rejects-gas-deadline-blocks-bid-to-force-nixon-to-impose.html|title=SENATE REJECTS ‘GAS’ DEADLINE|date=November 16, 1973|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1974, the Senate confirmed [[John C. Sawhill]] as Federal Energy Administrator only to rescind the confirmation hours later, the direct result of [[James Abourezk]] wanting to speak out and vote against the nomination due to the Nixon administration's refusal to roll back crude oil prices. Abourezk confirmed that he had asked Byrd for notice of when he could assume the Senate floor to deliver his remarks. Byrd was absent when present members passed the nomination as part of their efforts to clear the chmaber's executive calendar and rescinded the confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/06/18/archives/senators-hold-up-sawhill-approval.html|title=SENATORS HOLD UP SAWHILL APPROVAL|date=June 18, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nixon resignation ====
In May 1974, the House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against President Nixon after the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts of White House conversations between him and his aides and the administration became engulfed in the scandal that would come to be known as ''[[Watergate]]''. That month, Byrd delivered a speech on the Senate floor opposing Nixon's potential resignation, saying it would serve only to convince the President's supporters that his enemies had driven him out of office: "The question of guilt or innocence would never be fully resolved. The country would remain polarized — more so than it is today. And confidence in government would remain unrestored." Most of the members of the Senate in attendance for the address were conservatives from both parties that shared opposition to Nixon being removed from office. Byrd was among multiple conservative senators who stated that they would not ask Nixon to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/14/archives/leading-senators-refuse-to-press-nixon-on-quitting-conservatives-of.html|title=LEADING SENATORS REFUSE TO PRESS NIXON ON QUITTING|date=May 14, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Republican Attorney General [[Elliot L. Richardson]] termed Nixon "a law and order President who says subpoenas must he answered by everyone except himself," the comment being echoed by Byrd who additionally charged President Nixon with reneging on his public pledge that the independence of the special prosecutor to pursue the Watergate investigation would not be limited without the prior approval of a majority of Congressional leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/05/27/archives/bar-leader-urges-president-to-heed-justices-on-tapes-smith-says-he.html|title=BAR LEADER URGES PRESIDENT TO HEED JUSTICES ON TAPES|date=May 27, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, Byrd met with Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, Minority Leader [[Hugh Scott]], and Republican whip [[Robert P. Griffin]] in the first formality by Senate leaders on the matter of President Nixon's impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/30/archives/senate-leaders-prepare-for-impeachment-trial-working-quietly.html|title=Senate Leaders Prepare|first=Richard L.|last=Madden|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd opposed Nixon being granted immunity. The ''New York Times'' noted that as [[Chairman of the Republican National Committee]] [[George H. W. Bush]] issued a formal statement indicating no chance for the Nixon administration to be salvaged, Byrd was advocating for President Nixon to face some punishment for the illegal activities of the administration and that former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] should have been imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/07/archives/decline-in-senate-dole-says-president-now-has-no-more-than-20-votes.html|title=DECLINE IN SENATE|date=August 7, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate leadership met throughout August 7 to discuss Nixon's fate, the topic of immunity being mentioned in the office of Hugh Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/08/archives/senators-unable-to-agree-on-any-move-over-nixon-senators-unable-to.html|title=Senators Unable to Agree On Any Move Over Nixon|first=David E.|last=Rosenbaum|date=August 8, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon announced his resignation the following day and resigned on August 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| newspaper = The Washington Post| title = Nixon Resigns| series = The Watergate Story | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/watergate/part3.html| accessdate = July 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resignation led to Congress rearranging their intent from an impeachment to the confirmation of a new vice presidential nominee and the Senate scheduled a recess between August 23 to September 14, Byrd opining, "What the country needs is for all of us to get out of Washington and let the country have a breath of fresh air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/11/archives/congress-will-shift-focus-to-vicepresidency-vote-funding-veto-by.html|title=Congress Will Shift Focus To Vice‐Presidency Vote|date=August 11, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 11, Hugh Scott announced he was finding less members of Congress from either party committed to criminally prosecuting former President Nixon over ''Watergate'', Byrd and Majority Leader Mansfield both indicating their favoring for Nixon's culpability being left in the consideration of Special Prosecutor [[Leon Jaworski]] and the ''Watergate'' grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/08/12/archives/scott-says-capitol-leaders-oppose-nixon-prosecution-approve-a.html|title=Scott Says Capitol Leaders Oppose Nixon Prosecution|date=August 11, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gerald Ford era ===
On November 22, 1974, the Senate Rules Committee voted unanimously to recommend the nomination of [[Nelson Rockefeller]] as [[Vice President of the United States]] to the full Senate. Byrd admitted that he had preferred sending the nomination with no recommendation but was worried the act would apply prejudice to the nominee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/11/23/archives/senate-panel-90-backs-rockefeller-for-confirmation-byrd-and-allen.html|title=SENATE PANEL,9‐0, BACKS ROCKEFELLER FORCONFIRMATION|date=November 23, 1974|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1975, after President Ford requested 300 million in additional military aid for South Vietnam and 222 million more for Cambodia from Congress, Byrd said Ford and Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] had described the aid as "imperative" and that congressional leaders had been told North Vietnam would take over Saigon "little by little" if additional ammunition and other aid were not provided by the US to Saigon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/29/archives/new-indochina-aid-is-asked-by-ford-president-formally-urges.html|title=NEW INDOCHINA AID IS ASKED BY FORD|date=January 29, 1975|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February, along with Mike Mansfield, [[Hugh Scott]], and [[Robert P. Griffin]], Byrd was one of four senators to sponsor a compromise modification of the Senate's filibuster rule where three-fifths of the total Senate membership would be adequate in invoking closure on any measure except a change in the Senate's rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/01/archives/leaders-in-senate-back-a-compromise-on-filibuster-rule.html|title=Leaders in Senate Back a Compromise On Filibuster Rule|date=March 1, 1975|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, while the Senate voted on reforming its filibuster rule, [[James Allen (U.S. senator)|James B. Allen]] and other senators used their allotted time to speak at length and also force a series of votes. In response, Byrd said the group was engaging in an "exercise in futility" and that the chamber had already made up its mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/03/08/archives/filibuster-rule-reformed-by-senate-in-5627-vote-action-is-completed.html|title=Filibuster Rule Reformed By Senate in 56‐27 Vote|date=March 8, 1975|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, after President Ford and his administration's lawyers contended that Ford had authority as president to use troops under the War Powers Act, Byrd and [[Thomas F.

This failed, as the time limit for debating various proposals ran out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/09/24/archives/senate-liberals-fail-to-shut-off-debate-on-a-measure-that-would.html|title=Senate Liberals Fail to Shut Off Debate On a Measure That Would Curb Busing|first=Richard L.|last=Madden|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, Byrd met with President Ford for a discussion on the New York loan guarantee bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1975/11/11/archives/cityaid-measure-gains-in-senate-top-democrats-claim-votes-to-halt.html|title=CITY‐AID MEASURE GAINS IN SENATE|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1976, Byrd was one of five members of the Senate Select Committee to vote for a requirement that the proposed oversight committee would share Its jurisdiction with four committees that had authority over intelligence operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/04/28/archives/panel-trims-intelligence-oversight-plan-senate-panel-trims.html|title=Panel Trims Intelligence Oversight Plan|date=April 28, 1976|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, after the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to send a bill breaking up 18 large oil companies into separate production, refining and refining‐marketing entities to the Senate floor, Byrd announced his opposition to divestiture and joined Republicans [[Hugh Scott]] and [[Charles Mathias]] in confirming their votes were to report the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/06/16/archives/oil-breakup-bill-goes-to-senate-87-committee-vote-sends-plan-to.html|title=OIL BREAKUP BILL GOES TO SENATE|first=Edward|last=Cowan|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September, Congress overrode President Ford's veto of a 56 billion appropriations bill for social services, Ford afterward telling Byrd and House Speaker [[Carl Albert]] that he would sign two bills supported by the Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/10/01/archives/congress-overrides-fords-veto-of-bill-on-social-services.html|title=CONGRESS OVERRIDES FORD'S VETO OF BILL ON SOCIAL SERVICES|first=Richard D.|last=Lyons|publisher=New York Times|date=October 1, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd was elected Majority Leader on January 4, 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/05/archives/senate-democrats-pick-byrd-as-leader-gop-elects-baker-humphrey-bows.html|title=SENATE DEMOCRATS PICK BYRD AS LEADER; GIO.P, ELECTS BAKER|date=January 5, 1977|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 14, President Ford met with congressional leadership to announce his proposals for pay increases of high government officials, Byrd afterward telling reporters that the president had also stated his intent to recommend that the raises be linked to a code of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/15/archives/ford-to-ask-pay-rise-for-major-officials-congress-chiefs-say.html|title=FORD TO ASK PAY RISE FOR MAJOR OFFICIALS, CONGRESS CHIEFS SAY|date=January 15, 1977|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, after the Senate established a special 15‐member committee to draw up a code of ethics for senators, Byrd told reporters that he was supportive of the measure and it would be composed of eight Democrats and seven Republicans who would have until March 1 to issue a draft code that would then be subject to change by the full Senate.&lt;ref name="nytimes1977"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/19/archives/15member-panel-named-to-draft-ethics-code.html|title=15‐Member Panel Named To Draft Ethics Code|date=January 19, 1977|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jimmy Carter era ===
In January 1977, after President-elect Carter announced his nomination of [[Theodore C. Sorensen]] to be [[Director of Central Intelligence]], Byrd admitted to reporters that there could be difficulty securing a Senate confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/16/archives/sorensen-approval-by-senate-as-head-of-cia-is-in-doubt-withdrawal.html|title=SORENSEN APPROVAL BY SENATE AS HEAD OF C.I.A. IS IN DOUBT|date=January 16, 1977|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative opposition to Sorenson's nomination led Carter to conclude that he could not be confirmed, and Carter withdrawing it without the Senate taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |date=November 1, 2010 |title=Ted Sorensen, JFK's speechwriter and confidant, dies at 82 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/01/ted-sorensen-jfk-speechwriter-dies |work=The Guardian |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Role in changes in Senate rules ====
On January 18, 1977, after the Senate established a special 15‐member committee to draw up a code of ethics for senators, Byrd and Senate Minority Leader [[Howard Baker]] announced their support for the resolution, Byrd adding that knowledge of the code of ethics being enacted in the Senate would be privy to the public, press, and members of the Senate.&lt;ref name="nytimes1977"/&gt; While eight of Carter's secretaries were confirmed within the first hours of his presidency, Byrd made an unsuccessful effort to secure a date and time limit for debate on the confirmation of [[F. Ray Marshall]], Carter's nominee for [[United States Secretary of Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/21/archives/10-carter-nominees-are-approved-but-action-is-delayed-on-others.html|title=10 Carter Nominees Are Approved, But Action Is Delayed on Others|date=January 21, 1977|first=Warren|last=Weaver, Jr.|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January and February 1979, Byrd proposed outlawing tactics frequently used to prevent him from bringing a bill to the floor for consideration. He stated the filibuster tactics gave the Senate a bad reputation and rendered it ineffective. His proposals initially earned the opposition of Republicans and conservative Democrats until there was a compromise for the reform package to be split and have the less objectionable part come up first for consideration. The Senate passed legislation curtailing tactics that had been used in the past to continue filibusters after cloture had been invoked on February 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/02/23/archives/senate-votes-to-cut-postcloture-debate-to-100-hours-proposal-still.html|title=Senate Votes to Cut Post‐Cloture Debate to 100 Hours|date=February 23, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Byrd negotiated an agreement that a proposed amendment was referred to the Judiciary Committee and would be reported by April 10. The arrangement stated that Byrd could call up the proposed amendment any time following June 1 and his action would not be subject to a filibuster while the resolution embodying the amendment will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/16/archives/carter-legislation-on-elections-gets-off-to-a-shaky-start-in.html|title=Carter Legislation on Elections Gets Off to a Shaky Start in Congress|date=March 16, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Domestic issues ====
In October 1977, Byrd stated his refusal to authorize the Senate dropping consideration of the natural gas legislation under any circumstances, predicting the matter would be settled in the coming days as a result of conversations with colleagues he had the night before and a growing disillusion with filibusters in place of action on legislation. Byrd added that the deregulation bill would not become law due to it being identical to the Carter administration's proposal and President Carter's prior statement that he would veto deregulation bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/10/02/archives/byrd-vows-senate-will-vote-on-energy-despite-filibuster.html|title=Byrd Vows Senate Will Vote on Energy Despite Filibuster|date=October 2, 1977|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1978, Byrd announced that he would not move to end a filibuster against the Carter administration's labor law revision bill until after the Memorial Day recess. The decision was seen as allowing wavering senators to not be cornered on their votes as lobbying efforts for both business and labor commenced and various opponents of the bill viewed Byrd's call as a sign of weakness toward the Carter administration. Byrd stated that his decision to wait was "to give ample time for debate on the measure" and that he was expecting the first petition to end the filibuster to come sometime following the Senate returning in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Byrd Says He'll Postpone Action on Labor Filibuster|date=May 19, 1978|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1979, after Attorney General [[Griffin B. Bell]] named a special counsel in the Carter warehouse investigation, Byrd stated his dissatisfaction with the move in a Senate floor speech, citing the existence of legislation approved by Congress the previous year that would allow the appointment of a special prosecutor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/23/archives/8-senate-republicans-attack-bell-for-not-appointing-a-prosecutor.html|title=8 Senate Republicans Attack Bell For Not Appointing a Prosecutor|date=March 23, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Director of Public Citizens Congress Watch Mark Green stated that President Carter had told him that Majority Leader Byrd had threatened that he would personally lead a filibuster against any attempt to extend controls on domestic oil prices. In response, Byrd press secretary Mike Willard confirmed that Byrd told President Carter he would not vote for cloture in the event of a filibuster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/02/archives/carter-castigates-mobil-on-decontrol-calls-company-irresponsible.html|title=CARTER CASTIGATES MOBIL ON DECONTROL|date=June 2, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, after the Senate voted to grant President Carter authority to set energy conservation tareets for each of the 50 states and allow Carter to impose mandatory measures on any state that failed to implement a plan to meet the targets he set, Byrd reaffirmed his opposition to attempts aimed at President Carter's decision to remove price controls from crude oil produced within the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/06/archives/senate-votes-to-let-carter-set-state-energy-targets-domenici.html|title=Senate Votes to Let Carter Set State Energy Targets|date=June 6, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Byrd stated that the United States did not have an alternative to coal when attempting to meet its energy needs and that the technology needed to turn coal into liquid fuel at a lower cost than that of producing gasoline had already been made available, opining that doing this would solve most environmental problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/19/archives/byrd-says-nation-has-no-choice-but-to-switch-to-coal-for-energy.html|title=Byrd Says Nation Has No Choice But to Switch to Coal for Energy|date=November 18, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States Senate]] [[F. Nordy Hoffman]] sent a letter to Byrd warning him to take precautions against possible attacks by religious fanatics and nationalist terrorists and advocating for senators "vary their daily routines, take different routes to and from the Senate, exchange their personalized license plates for those that provide anonymity and be generally alert to the possibility of attack." Byrd distributed the letter to the other members of the chamber of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/30/archives/senators-warned-of-terrorist-acts.html|title=Senators Warned of Terrorist Acts|date=November 30, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, the Senate voted on a Republican proposal to limit overall Government tax revenue that would also yield an annual tax cut of 39 billion to 55 billion over the course of the following four years. Republican [[William V. Roth Jr.]] sponsored an amendment that Byrd moved to table Senator Roth's request for a budget waiver and won by five votes. The Senate narrowly blocked the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/06/archives/senate-bars-consideration-of-tax-cut-senate-bars-consideration-of.html|title=Senate Bars Consideration of Tax Cut|date=December 6, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December, congressional leadership was aiming for President Carter to sign a new synthetic fuels bill before Christmas, with Byrd wanting the bill to contain a 185 billion revenue that was achieved in a minimum tax provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/12/archives/delays-loom-for-fuel-bill-conferees-labor-to-meld-2-plans.html|title=Delays Loom for Fuel Bill|date=December 12, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, after the Senate approved a 1.5 billion in Federal loan guarantees for the Chrysler Corporation tonight after defeating a proposal to provide emergency, Byrd confirmed that he had spoken with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]] [[G. William Miller]] about what Byrd called "excellent" chances that the Senate would complete work on a federal loans guarantees bill for Chrysler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/20/archives/senate-by-53-to-44-backs-chrysler-aid-interim-help-loses-conference.html|title=SENATE, BY 53 TO 44, BACKS CHRYSLER AID; INTERIM HELP LOSES|date=December 20, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1980, Byrd stated that Congress was unlikely to pass a tax cut before the November elections despite the Senate being in the mood for passing one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/24/archives/byrd-doubts-approval-of-tax-cut-by-november.html|title=Byrd Doubts Approval Of Tax Cut by November|date=August 24, 1980|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Turkey ====
In July 1978, Byrd introduced and endorsed a proposal by [[George McGovern]] for an amendment to repeal the 42‐month‐old embargo on American military assistance for Turkey that also linked any future aid for that country to progress on a negotiated settlement of the Cyprus problem. The Senate approved the amendment in a vote of 57 to 42 as part of a 2.9 billion international security assistance bill. Byrd stated that every government in the NSTO alliance except Greece favored repeal of the embargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/07/26/archives/senate-acts-to-lift-arms-ban-on-turks-but-adds-warning-help-tied-to.html|title=SENATE ACTS TO LIFT ARMS BAN ON TURKS, BUT ADDS WARNING|first=Graham|last=Hovey|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1979, Byrd stated that giving Turkey a grant should not be construed as a retaliation against [[Greece]] and that aid for Turkey would improve Turkey's security in addition to that of Greece, NATO, and of American allies in the Middle East. Byrd mentioned his encouragement from the report on the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities agreeing to resume negotiations on the island's future as well as reports that progress was also being made on the reintegration of Greece into NATO. Byrd furthered that American military installations in Turkey were "of major importance in the monitoring of Soviet strategic activities" and would have "obvious significance" in the goal of verifying compliance by the Soviet Union with the strategic arms treaty. The Senate approved the Turkey grant, to Byrd's wishes, but against that of both President Carter and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/05/23/archives/senate-votes-to-make-50-million-for-turkey-a-grant-sarbanes-leads.html|title=Senate Votes to Make $50 Million for Turkey a Grant|first=Graham|last=Hovey|date=May 23, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Foreign policy ====
On February 2, 1978, Byrd and Minority Leader Baker invited all other senators to join them in sponsoring two amendments to the Panama Canal neutrality treaty, the two party leaders sending copies of amendments recommended by the Foreign Relations Committee the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/03/archives/byrd-and-baker-bid-colleagues-cosponsor-2-canal-amendments.html|title=Byrd and Baker Bid Colleagues Co‐Sponsor 2 Canal Amendments|date=February 3, 1978|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1979, Byrd met with [[Deputy Prime Minister of China]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] for assurances by Deng that China hoped to unite Taiwan to the mainland by peaceful means and would fully respect "the present realities" on the island. Byrd afterward stated that his concern on the Taiwan question had been allayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/01/31/archives/teng-on-capitol-hill-says-peking-must-keep-taiwan-options-open-teng.html|title=Teng, on Capitol Hill, Says Peking Must Keep Taiwan Options Open|date=January 31, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June, Byrd opined that a decision by President Carter to not proceed with the new missile system would kill the strategic arms limitation treaty in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/06/11/archives/soviet-cautions-us-on-mx-deployment-but-commentary-in-pravda-gives.html|title=SOVIET CAUTIONS U.S. ON MX DEPLOYMENT|date=June 11, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd held meetings with Soviet leaders between July 3 to July 4. Following their conclusion, Byrd said he was still undecided on supporting the arms pact and that there had been talks on "the need on both sides for avoidance of inflammatory rhetoric which can only be counterproductive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/06/archives/senator-byrd-leaving-soviet-says-he-is-still-undecided-on-arms-pact.html|title=Senator Byrd, Leaving Soviet, Says He Is Still Undecided on Arms Pact|first=Craig R.|last=Whitney|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 23, Byrd stated that it was possible the Senate could complete the strategic arms limitation treaty that year but a delay until the following year could result in its defeat, adding that senators might have to remain in session during Christmas to ensure the treaty was voted on before 1979's end. Byrd noted that he was opposed to the treaty being "held hostage to the Cuban situation" as American interests could be harmed in the event the treaty was defeated solely due to Soviet troops being in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/09/23/archives/byrd-says-arms-pact-could-still-be-acted-on-in-79.html|title=Byrd Says Arms Pact Could Still Be Acted on in '79|date=September 23, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, Byrd admitted to complaining to President Carter about Senate leadership receiving only occasional briefings about the [[Iranian hostage crisis]] and that Carter had agreed to daily consultations for Minority Leader [[Howard Baker]], Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee [[Frank Church]], and ranking Republican member of the Foreign Relations Committee [[Jacob Javits]]. Byrd added that he did not disagree with the move by the Carter administration to admit [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] for hospitalization and that the same action would extend to "[[Ayatollah Khomeini]] himself if he were needing medical treatment and had a terminal illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/11/18/archives/byrd-says-carter-agrees-to-consult-him-on-iran.html|title=Byrd Says Carter Agrees To Consult Him on Iran|date=November 18, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 3, Byrd told reporters that the Iranian hostage crisis was making the Senate uninhabitable for a debate on the strategic arms treaty, noting that a discussion could still occur before the Senate adjourned on December 21 but that he did not believe he would call up the opportunity even if granted the chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/04/archives/iran-issue-detracts-from-arms-treaty-byrd-says-environment-in.html|title=IRAN ISSUE DETRACTS FROM ARMS TREATY|date=December 4, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Days later, Byrd announced there was no chance that the Senate would take up debate on the strategic arms treaty that year while speaking to reporters, adding that he would see no harm in having the discussion on the treaty begin in January of the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/07/archives/byrd-sees-no-arms-debate-in-79.html|title=Byrd Sees No Arms Debate in ‘79|date=December 7, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1980 Presidential election ====
In July 1979, Senators [[Henry M. Jackson]] and George McGovern made comments expressing doubt on President Carter being assured as the Democratic nominee in the 1980 Presidential election. When asked about their comments by a reporter, Byrd referred to Jackson and McGovern as "two very strong voices and not at all to be considered men who have little background in politics" but stated it was too early to participate in "writing the political obituary of the President at this point." Byrd added that the powers of the presidency made it possible that Carter could have a comeback and cited the events in November and December as being telling of his prospects of achieving higher popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1979/07/29/archives/byrd-says-its-too-soon-to-count-out-president.html|title=Byrd Says It's Too Soon To Count Out President|date=July 29, 1979|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 1980, Byrd called for President Carter to debate Senator [[Ted Kennedy]], who he complimented as having done a service for the US by raising key issues in his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/05/11/archives/byrd-urges-president-to-face-kennedy-in-a-debate.html|title=Byrd Urges President to Face Kennedy in a Debate|date=May 10, 1980|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 2, Byrd advocated for an open Democratic National Convention where the delegates were not bound to a single candidate. The endorsement was seen as a break from President Carter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/08/03/archives/byrd-says-he-backs-open-convention-assails-libyan-case-judgment-of.html|title=BYRD SAYS HE BACKS 'OPEN' CONVENTION; ASSAILS LIBYAN CASE; JUDGMENT OF CARTER FAULTED Senator Calls Moves 'Amateurish' but Expects President to Win Democratic Nomination Response From the White House Criticism of Libya Matter More Messages Released BYRD SAYS HE BACKS 'OPEN' CONVENTION|date=August 3, 1980|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September, Byrd said that Republican presidential nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] had made comments on the war between Iran and Iraq that were a disservice to the United States and that he was exercising "reckless political posturing" in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/09/28/archives/byrd-accuses-reagan-of-reckless-posturing-on-war-the-wrong-signal.html|title=Byrd Accuses Reagan of 'Reckless Posturing' on War; 'The Wrong Signal'|date=September 28, 1980|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== George H. W. Bush era ===
In early 1990, Byrd proposed an amendment granting special aid to coal miners who would lose their jobs in the event that Congress passed clean air legislation. Byrd was initially confident in the number of votes he needed to secure its passage being made available but this was prevented by a vote from Democrat [[Joe Biden]] who said the measure's passage would mean an assured veto by President Bush. Speaking to reporters after its defeat, Byrd stated his content with the results: "I made the supreme effort. I did everything I could and, therefore, I don't feel badly about it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/30/us/senate-rejects-plan-on-aid-to-miners.html|title=Senate Rejects Plan on Aid to Miners|date=March 30, 1990|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-03-30/news/mn-193_1_clean-air-bill|title=Senate Kills Obstacle to Clean Air Bill Passage : Congress: Byrd's costly plan to aid coal miners is defeated on 50-49 vote after fierce White House lobbying. It would have brought a Bush veto.|first=Michael|last=Ross|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 30, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate passed clean air legislation within weeks of the vote on Byrd's amendment with the intent of reduction in acid rain, urban smog and toxic chemicals in the air and meeting the request by President Bush for a measure that was less costly than the initial plan while still performing the same tasks of combating clean air issues. Byrd was one of eleven senators to vote against the bill and said he "cannot vote for legislation that can bring economic ruin to communities throughout the Appalachian region and the Midwest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/04/us/senators-approve-clean-air-measure-by-a-vote-of-89-11.html|title=SENATORS APPROVE CLEAN AIR MEASURE BY A VOTE OF 89-11|date=April 4, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd authored an amendment to the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] that would bar the endowment from funding projects considered obscene such as depictions of sadomasochism, homo-eroticism, the sexual exploitation of children, or individuals engaged in sex acts while also requiring grant recipients to sign a pledge swearing their compliance with the restrictions. The October 1990 measure approved in the Senate was a bipartisan measure loosening government restrictions on art project funding and leaving courts to judge what art could be considered obscene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/10/24/Senate-votes-to-loosen-NEA-restrictions/2112656740800/|title=Senate votes to loosen NEA restrictions|date=October 24, 1990|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush nominated [[Clarence Thomas]] for the Supreme Court. In October 1991, Byrd stated his support in the credibility of [[Anita Hill]]: "I believe what she said. I did not see on that face the knotted brow of satanic revenge. I did not see a face that was contorted with hate. I did not hear a voice that was tremulous with passion. I saw the face of a woman, one of 13 in a family of Southern blacks who grew up on the farm and who belonged to the church." Byrd questioned how members of the Senate could be convinced that Thomas would serve as an objective judge when he could refuse to watch Hill's testimony against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/16/us/the-thomas-nomination-senators-who-switched-tell-of-political-torment.html|title=THE THOMAS NOMINATION; Senators Who Switched Tell of Political Torment|date=October 16, 1991|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1992, the Senate turned down a Republican attempt sponsored by [[John McCain]] and [[Dan Coats]] to grant President Bush line-item veto authority and thereby be authorized to kill projects that he was opposed to, Byrd delivering an address defending congressional power over spending for eight hours afterward. The speech had been written by Byrd two years prior and he had at this point steered 1.5 billion to his state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/28/us/senate-rejects-a-line-item-veto.html|title=Senate Rejects a Line-Item Veto|date=February 28, 1992|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, there was an effort made to pass a constitutional amendment to ensure a balanced federal budget. Byrd called the amendment "a smokescreen that will allow lawmakers to claim action against the deficit while still postponing hard budgetary decision" and spoke to reporters on his feelings against the amendment being passed: "Once members are really informed as to the mischief this amendment could do, and the damage it could do to the country and to the Constitution. I just have faith that enough members will take a courageous stand against the amendment." The sponsor of the amendment, [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]], admitted that Byrd's predicton was not off and that other senators speak "when the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee talks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/03/us/byrd-predicts-senate-will-defeat-amendment-for-balanced-budget.html|title=Byrd Predicts Senate Will Defeat Amendment for Balanced Budget|date=June 3, 1992|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 1992 debate, Byrd argued in favor of the United States withdrawing accepting immigrants that did not speak English, the comment being a response to a plan from the Bush administration that would enable former Soviet states to receive American assistance and allow immigrants from a variety of countries to receive welfare benefits. Byrd soon afterward apologized for the comment and said they were due to his frustration over the federal government's inability to afford several essential services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/27/us/remark-on-immigrants-brings-byrd-s-apology.html|title=Remark on Immigrants Brings Byrd's Apology|date=June 27, 1992|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill Clinton era ===
In February 1994, the Senate passed a spending bill of 10 billion that would mostly be allocated to [[Los Angeles, California]] earthquake victims and military operations abroad. Bob Dole, [[John Kerry]], [[John McCain]], and [[Russ Feingold]] partnered together to persuade the Senate in favor of cutting back the deficit expense.  Byrd raised a procedural point to derail an attempt by Dole that would approve 50 billion in spending cuts over the following five years. McCain proposed killing highway demonstration projects with a 203 million price tag, leading Byrd to produce letters written by McCain that the latter had sent to the Appropriations Committee in 1991 in an attempt to gather highway grants for his home state of [[Arizona]]. Byrd said that McCain "is very considerate of the taxpayers when it comes to financing projects in other states, but he supports such projects in his own state."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/11/us/senate-votes-a-quake-relief-measure.html|title=Senate Votes a Quake Relief Measure|date=February 11, 1994|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2000, Byrd and [[John Warner]] sponsored a provision threatening to withdraw American troops from Kosovo, the legislation if enacted cutting off funds for troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, without Congressional consent. The language would have also withheld 25 percent of the money for Kosovo in the bill unless the assertion that European countries were living up to their promises to provide reconstruction money for the province was certified by President Clinton by July 15. Byrd argued that lawmakers had never approved nor debate whether American troops should be stationed in Kosovo. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the legislation in a vote of 23-to-3 that was said to reflect "widespread concern among lawmakers about an open-ended deployment of American soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/10/world/senators-seek-vote-in-congress-on-extending-kosovo-mission.html|title=Senators Seek Vote in Congress On Extending Kosovo Mission|date=May 10, 2000|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, Congress passed an amendment sponsored by Byrd diverting tariff revenues from the Treasury Department and instead allocating them to the industry complaining, the amount involved ranging from between 40 million and 200 million a year. The following month, Japan and the European Union led a group of countries in filing a joint complaint with the World Trade Organization to the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/22/business/group-of-countries-protests-us-change-in-dumping-law.html?mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;gwh=063675A65E2BB0248AADC957B886B076&amp;gwt=pay|title=Group of Countries Protest U.S. Change in Dumping|date=December 22, 2000|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===George W. Bush era===
Byrd praised the nomination of [[John G. Roberts]] to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court created by the death of Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]]. Likewise, Byrd was one of four Democrats who supported the confirmation of [[Samuel Alito]] to replace retiring Associate Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm Roll Call Vote 109th Congress - 2nd Session (on the confirmation of Samuel Alito of New Jersey)], ''[[United States Senate]]'', January 31, 2006.

Like most Democrats, Byrd opposed Bush's tax cuts and his proposals to change the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] program.

Byrd opposed the 2002 [[Homeland Security Act]], which created the [[Department of Homeland Security]], stating that the bill ceded too much authority to the [[executive branch]].

On May 2, 2002, Byrd charged the White House with engaging in "sophomoric political antics", citing [[Homeland Security Advisor]] [[Tom Ridge]] briefing senators in another location instead of the Senate on how safe he felt the US was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/05/02/Byrd-White-House-pulling-stunts/89501020350467/|title=Byrd: White House pulling stunts|date=May 2, 2002|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also led the opposition to Bush's bid to win back the power to negotiate trade deals that Congress cannot amend, but lost overwhelmingly. In the 108th Congress, however, Byrd won his party's top seat on the new Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.

In July 2004, Byrd released the New York Times best-selling book ''Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency'', which criticized the Bush presidency and the [[war in Iraq]].

====Iraq War====

[[File:Byrd with petraeus.jpg|thumb|Byrd with Lieutenant General [[David Petraeus]], January 23, 2007]]

Byrd led a filibuster against the resolution granting [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] broad power to wage a [[preemptive war|"preemptive" war]] against Iraq, but he could not get even a majority of his own party to vote against [[cloture]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/10/11/iraq.us/index.html Senate approves Iraq war resolution]" (October 11, 2002). CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd was one of the Senate's most outspoken critics of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

Byrd anticipated the difficulty of fighting an insurgency in Iraq, stating on March 13, 2003,

{{quote|If the United States leads the charge to war in the [[Persian Gulf]], we may get lucky and achieve a rapid victory. But then we will face a second war: a war to win the peace in Iraq. This war will last many years and will surely cost hundreds of billions of dollars. In light of this enormous task, it would be a great mistake to expect that this will be a replay of the 1991 war. The stakes are much higher in this conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2003march/byrd_speeches_2003march_list/byrd_speeches_2003march_list_2.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050825063856/http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2003march/byrd_speeches_2003march_list/byrd_speeches_2003march_list_2.html|archivedate=August 25, 2005 |title=Senator Byrd – Senate Speeches |publisher=Byrd.senate.gov |date=March 13, 2003 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On March 19, 2003, when Bush ordered the invasion after receiving [[Iraq Resolution|congressional approval]], Byrd said,

{{quote|Today I weep for my country. I have watched the events of recent months with a heavy, heavy heart. No more is the image of America one of strong, yet benevolent peacekeeper. The image of America has changed. Around the globe, our friends mistrust us, our word is disputed, our intentions are questioned. Instead of reasoning with those with whom we disagree, we demand obedience or threaten recrimination. Instead of isolating Saddam Hussein, we seem to have succeeded in isolating ourselves.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Robert (March 23, 2003), [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/mar/23/usa.iraq2 Why I weep for my country]. ''The Observer''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Byrd also criticized Bush for his speech declaring the "end of major combat operations" in Iraq, which Bush made on the [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|U.S.S. ''Abraham Lincoln'']]. Byrd stated on the Senate floor,

{{quote|I do not begrudge his salute to America's warriors aboard the carrier Lincoln, for they have performed bravely and skillfully, as have their countrymen still in Iraq. But I do question the motives of a deskbound president who assumes the garb of a warrior for the purposes of a speech.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Stevenson, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/us/aftereffects-the-president-white-house-clarifies-bush-s-carrier-landing.html AFTEREFFECTS: THE PRESIDENT; White House Clarifies Bush's Carrier Landing], ''New York Times'' (May 7, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On October 17, 2003, Byrd delivered a speech expressing his concerns about the future of the nation and his unequivocal antipathy to Bush's policies. Referencing the [[Hans Christian Andersen]] children's tale ''[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]'', Byrd said of the president: "the emperor has no clothes." Byrd further lamented the "sheep-like" behavior of the "cowed Members of this Senate" and called on them to oppose the continuation of a "war based on falsehoods."

In April 2004, Byrd mentioned the possibility of the Bush administration violating law by its failure to inform leadership in Congress midway through 2002 about its use of emergency antiterror dollars to begin preparations for an invasion of Iraq. Byrd stated that he had never been told of a shift in money, a charge reported in the [[Bob Woodward]] book ''[[Plan of Attack]]'', and its validation would mean "the administration failed to abide by the law to consult with and fully inform Congress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/21/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-byrd-questions-use-of-money-for-iraq.html|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ; Byrd Questions Use Of Money for Iraq|date=April 21, 2004|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd accused the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] of stifling dissent:

{{quote|The right to ask questions, debate, and dissent is under attack. The drums of war are beaten ever louder in an attempt to drown out those who speak of our predicament in stark terms. Even in the Senate, our history and tradition of being the world's greatest deliberative body is being snubbed. This huge spending bill—{{Nowrap|$87 billion}}—has been rushed through this chamber in just one month. There were just three open hearings by the Senate Appropriations Committee on {{Nowrap|$87 billion}}—$87 for every minute since [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] was born—{{Nowrap|$87 billion}} without a single outside witness called to challenge the administration's line.}}

Of the more than 18,000 votes he cast as a senator, Byrd said he was proudest of his vote against the Iraq war resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/12/byrd.access/index.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=June 12, 2006 |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byrd also voted to tie a timetable for troop withdrawal to war funding.

====Gang of 14====
On May 23, 2005, Byrd was one of 14 senators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudin|first1=Ken|title=Judging Alito: The Gang of 14 Factor|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5080836|accessdate=June 29, 2016|publisher=NPR|date=January 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who became known as the "[[Gang of 14]]") to forge a compromise on the judicial [[filibuster]], thus securing up and down votes for many judicial nominees and ending the threat of the so-called [[Nuclear option (filibuster)|nuclear option]] that would have eliminated the filibuster entirely. Under the agreement, the senators retained the power to filibuster a judicial nominee in only an "extraordinary circumstance." It ensured that the [[appellate court]] nominees ([[Janice Rogers Brown]], [[Priscilla Owen]] and [[William H. Pryor Jr.|William Pryor]]) would receive votes by the full Senate.

===Other votes===
In 1977, Byrd was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of [[F. Ray Marshall]] as [[United States Secretary of Labor]].  Marshall was opposed by conservatives in both parties because of his pro-labor positions, including support for repealing [[Right-to-work law|right to work laws]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/01/27/archives/senate-rollcall-vote-approving-marshall.html|title=Senate Roll‐Call Vote Approving Marshall|date=January 27, 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall was confirmed, and served until the end of Carter's term in 1981.

In February 1981, as the Senate voted on giving final approval to the 50 billion increase in the debt limit, Democrats initially opposed the measure as part of an effort to elicit the highest number of Republicans in support of the measure. Byrd proceeded to give a signal for Democrats that saw caucus members switch their votes in support of the increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/07/us/senate-votes-raise-in-us-debt-ceiling.html|title=SENATE VOTES RAISE IN U.S. DEBT CEILING|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|publisher=New York Times|date=February 7, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Reagan was injured during an assassination attempt in March 1981. Following the shooting, Byrd opined that the aftermath of the attempt had proven there were "holes that need to be plugged" in the constitution's handling of the presidential line of succession after a president's disability and stated his intent to introduce legislation calling for a mandatory life sentence for anyone attempting to assassinate a president, vice president, or member of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/04/06/us/byrd-sees-a-need-to-alter-rules-on-succession-to-the-presidency.html|title=Byrd Sees a Need to Alter Rules On Succession to the Presidency|date=April 6, 1981|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1981, during a Capitol Hill interview, Byrd stated that the Reagan administration was promoting an economic package with assumptions for the national economy that might take a year for the public to see its difficulties and thereby lead to a political backlash. Byrd contented that President Reagan would win approval by Congress of 35 billion to 40 billion of the 48 billion in proposed budget cuts while having more difficulty in passing his tax-cut package, asserting Democratic opposition and some Republicans having misgivings about the approach as the reason Congress would block the plan and furthering that he would be surprised if a one-year-cut in rates lasted more than year. Byrd opined that it was time for "some tax reform" that would see loopholes closed for the rich dropped to bring in revenues and expressed belief in the likelihood of the administration dismantling existing energy programs: "Energy programs are not as catchy now as budget cuts. But if the gas lines begin to form again, or the overseas oil gets cut off, we will have lost the time, the momentum, the money. Basically, they have a wholesale dismantlement of the energy programs we spent several years creating around here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/14/us/byrd-calls-reagan-fiscal-plan-rosy-and-sees-tax-cut-held-to-one-year.html|title=BYRD CALLS REAGAN FISCAL PLAN 'ROSY' AND SEES TAX CUT HELD TO ONE YEAR|date=March 14, 1981|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1981, during a news conference, Byrd stated that the Reagan administration had not established a coherent foreign policy. He credited conflicting statements from administration officials with having contributed to confusion in Western European capitals. Byrd also said, "We've seen these statements, and backing and filling, and the secretary of state has been kept pretty busy explaining and denying assertions and pronouncements by others, which indeed indicate that the administration has not yet got its foreign policy act together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/23/Senate-Democratic-leader-Robert-Byrd-says-no-one-is/5454354171600/|title=Senate Democratic leader Robert Byrd says no one is...|date=March 23, 1981|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1981, Byrd announced his support for the Reagan administration's proposed budget for the fiscal year 1982 during a weekly news conference, citing that the "people want the President to be given a chance with his budget." Byrd added that he did not believe a balanced budget would be achieved by 1984, calling the budget "a balanced budget on paper only, made up of juggled figures produced out of thin air", and charged the administration with making assumptions, his comments being seen as an indication that little opposition would amount from the Democrats to the Reagan budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/05/03/us/despite-doubts-byrd-will-back-reagan-s-budget.html|title=DESPITE DOUBTS, BYRD WILL BACK REAGAN'S BUDGET|date=May 3, 1981|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1981, as Senate leaders rejected the request of Senator [[Harrison A. Williams Jr.]] to introduce new evidence during the Senate's consideration of whether to expel him for his involvement in the [[Abscam]] case, Byrd and Majority Leader Baker informed Williams that he could have a lawyer that would have to remain wordless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/19/nyregion/the-region-williams-spurned-on-new-evidence.html|title=THE REGION; Williams Spurned On New Evidence|date=November 19, 1981|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, 1981, Byrd voted in favor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/12/03/The-90-4-vote-by-which-the-Senate-approved-the/2840376203600/|title=The 90-4 vote by which the Senate approved the...|date=December 3, 1981|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; of an amendment to President Reagan's MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/03/us/senators-reject-plan-for-placing-mx-missile-in-silos.html|title=SENATORS REJECT PLAN FOR PLACING MX MISSILE IN SILOS|first=Steven V.|last=Roberts|date=December 3, 1981|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1981/1204/120455.html|title=Reagan scorns Senate rejection of silo-based MX missile plan|first=Stephen|last=Webbe|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=December 4, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1982, Byrd wrote a letter to President Reagan urging him to "withdraw the Administration's proposed fiscal 1983 budget, and resubmit a budget that provides for much lower deficits and makes use of more realistic assumptions", recalling his previous appeal to President Carter in 1980 amid the rise of soaring inflation rates and Carter afterward consulting with Democrats in Congress. Byrd stated that he was in favor of "a document we in Congress can work with, one based on realistic assumptions, one which shows a much clearer trend toward a balanced budget." Byrd had cautious praise for a proposal by Democrat [[Fritz Hollings]] called for a freeze on all benefit programs with the exception of food stamps, Medicare and Medicaid in addition to a freeze on military spending while eliminating a pay increase for federal employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/11/us/byrd-asks-president-to-resubmit-his-1983-budget.html|title=BYRD ASKS PRESIDENT TO RESUBMIT HIS 1983 BUDGET|date=February 11, 1982|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1982, Byrd announced he would introduce an amendment to the [[War Powers Resolution|War Powers Act]] that would bar the president from being able to send combat troops to El Salvador without the approval of Congress. Byrd described the proposal as only allowing the president to act with independence in the event that Americans needed to evacuate El Salvador or if the United States was attacked. "It is my view that if Americans are to be asked to shed their blood in the jungles of El Salvador, all Americans should first have an opportunity to debate and carefully evaluate that action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/07/world/byrd-seeking-to-bar-us-combat-troops-from-salvador-war.html|title=BYRD SEEKING TO BAR U.S. COMBAT TROOPS FROM SALVADOR WAR|date=March 7, 1982|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1982, along with Alan Cranston, Byrd was one of two senators supporting both the measure sponsored by Henry M. Jackson and [[John W. Warner]] calling upon the United States and the Soviet Union to freeze their nuclear arsenals at "equal and sharply reduced levels" and the bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy and [[Mark Hatfield]] calling upon the two countries first to negotiate a freeze on nuclear forces at existing levels before following atomic arms reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/31/world/58-senators-back-alternative-plan-on-nuclear-arms.html|title=58 SENATORS BACK ALTERNATIVE PLAN ON NUCLEAR ARMS|first=Judith|last=Miller|publisher=New York Times|date=March 31, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1983, after President Reagan said during his [[1983 State of the Union Address]] that he hoped for the same bipartisan support that had produced the Social Security recommendations would lead Congress during the year on other issues, Byrd and House Majority Leader [[Jim Wright]] assailed the unfairness of a six-month delay in the cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients during a period of letting the wealthy reap the benefits of the general income tax cut for a third year. Byrd stated that he did not "want a six-month delay in Social Security while leaving in place the third year of the tax cut for upper-income people" and stated that Reagan's speech had been "'rhetorically good, but substantively lacking in measures that would deal now with the crises that millions of people are experiencing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/us/democrats-say-any-pension-shift-should-mean-a-change-in-tax-cut.html|title=DEMOCRATS SAY ANY PENSION SHIFT SHOULD MEAN A CHANGE IN TAX CUT|first=Martin|last=Tolchin|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of February 1983, House Democrats committed themselves "to an emergency economic assistance program that would create public service jobs, provide shelter and soup kitchens for the destitute and avert foreclosures of homes and farms." Concurrently, Byrd pledged to work with the House Democrats in developing legislation concerning jobs, proposing 5 billion to 10 billion be spent and introducing legislation intended to form a national investment corporation that would assist with underwriting faltering basic industries and starting new ones in areas of high unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/02/us/all-house-democratic-chiefs-ask-emergency-jobs-and-aid-program.html|title=ALL HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CHIEFS ASK EMERGENCY JOBS AND AID PROGRAM|date=February 2, 1983|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1984, Byrd voted against a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public school for silent prayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/16/us/senate-vote-on-school-prayer.html|title=SENATE VOTE ON SCHOOL PRAYER|date=March 16, 1984|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in favor of President Reagan's unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/us/amendment-drive-on-school-prayer-loses-senate-vote.html|title=AMENDMENT DRIVE ON SCHOOL PRAYER LOSES SENATE VOTE|date=March 21, 1984|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/21/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-school-prayer.html|title=SENATE'S ROLL-CALL ON SCHOOL PRAYER|date=March 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1984, Byrd was one of five Democrats to vote against the [[Lawton Chiles]] proposal to cease MX production for a year during study in search of a smaller and single-warhead missile. The 48 to 48 tie was broken by then-Vice President [[George H. W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1984/06/14/The-49-48-vote-by-which-the-Senate-tabled-a/8470456033600/|title=The 49-48 vote by which the Senate tabled a...|date=June 14, 1984|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1986, Byrd endorsed the death penalty for some drug pushers in anti-drug legislation that would order President Reagan to end drug trafficking within 45 days through using the military as a means of intercepting smugglers, and imposing the death penalty on those pushers who intentionally cause a death as part of their operations while providing funding for prevention, drug abuse treatment, and anti-drug laws enforcement that was estimated to cost 3 billion to 4 billion over three years. Byrd admitted that calling for the death penalty seemed harsh, but cautioned that children in some cases had their entire lives destroyed through using drugs and that Congress had been soft for too long without seeing a change in results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1986/09/12/Reagan-Byrd-endorse-death-penalty-in-anti-drug-law/7457526881600/|title=Reagan, Byrd endorse death penalty in anti-drug law|date=September 12, 1986|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1986, Byrd announced that the Senate would convene a Watergate-type select committee to investigate the [[Iran-Contra affair]] the following year and that he had reached an agreement with Bob Dole for the committee to have six Democrats and five Republicans. Byrd and Dole disagreed on whether it was a necessity for Congress to be launched into a special session that month for the purpose of getting the investigative process moving. Naming members during December enabled participants to informally move ahead by selecting the staff and be prepared before the [[100th United States Congress]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-04/news/mn-1429_1_watergate|title=Senate Will Convene Watergate-Style Panel|date=December 4, 1986|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1988, in response to charges by Vice President Bush's presidential campaign that Democratic nominee [[Michael Dukakis]] was weak on defense, Byrd delivered a Senate speech in which he said that the Reagan administration "is living in a glass house when it throws a stone at the Democratic Party for its so-called Disneyland defense policies" and that the U.S. land-based missiles had grown in vulnerability due to the administration being "unable to produce an acceptable solution to make our missiles survivable." Byrd furthered, "Indeed, the Fantasyland exhibits of this White House's Defense Disneyland are loaded with the rejected systems that have been developed and discarded. If anything deserves the names 'Goofy' and 'Daffy' and 'Mickey Mouse,' it is those' basing proposals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/09/14/Byrd-Reagan-missile-plans-goofy/4310590212800/|title=Byrd: Reagan missile plans 'goofy'|date=September 14, 1988|publisher=UPI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1990, Byrd and [[James A. McClure]] served as floor managers for the appropriation bill for the [[National Endowment of the Arts]], accepting an amendment by [[Jesse Helms]] prohibiting NEA support of work denigrating objects or beliefs of religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-25/news/mn-4234_1_national-endowment|title=Senate Defeats Attempts by Helms to Cut Art Funding : Congress: A proposal to relax current restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts passes easily.|date=October 25, 1990|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1993, when the Senate voted to seek a federal court enforcement of a subpoena for the diaries of [[Bob Packwood]], Byrd stated the possibility of Americans becoming convinced that the Senate was delaying taking action to protect one of its own members. Byrd also called for Packwood to resign. "None of us is without flaws. But when those flaws damage the institution of the Senate, it is time to have the grace to go!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-03/news/mn-52654_1_ethics-panel|title=Senate Votes for Subpoena of Full Packwood Diaries : Politics: Lopsided ballot lets ethics panel seek access to memoirs.

In October 1999, Byrd was the only senator to vote present on the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]]. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/14/world/defeat-treaty-overview-senate-kills-test-ban-treaty-crushing-loss-for-clinton.html|title=DEFEAT OF A TREATY: THE OVERVIEW; SENATE KILLS TEST BAN TREATY IN CRUSHING LOSS FOR CLINTON; EVOKES VERSAILLES PACT DEFEAT|first=Eric|last=Schmitt|date=October 14, 1999|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/daily/oct99/senate14.htm|title=Senate Rejects Test Ban Treaty|date=October 14, 1999|first=Helen|last=Dewar|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrd opposed the [[Flag Desecration Amendment]], saying that, while he wanted to protect the [[American flag]], he believed that amending the Constitution "is not the most expeditious way to protect this revered symbol of our Republic." As an alternative, Byrd cosponsored the [[Flag Protection Act of 2005]] (S. 1370), a bill to prohibit destruction or desecration of the flag by anyone trying to incite violence or causing a breach of the peace, or who steals, damages, or destroys a flag on federal property, whether owned by the federal government or a private group or individual—can be imprisoned, fined or both. The bill did not pass.

In 2009, Byrd was one of three Democrats to oppose the confirmation of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Timothy Geithner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531082810/https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00015 |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |title=U.S. Senate: Legislation &amp; Records Home &gt; Votes &gt; Roll Call Vote|publisher=Senate.gov |accessdate=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After missing nearly two months while in hospital, Byrd returned to the Senate floor on July 21 to vote against the elimination of funding for the [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22]] fighter plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/07/sen_byrd_back_on_the_senate_fl.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | title=Sen.

On July 1, 2010, Byrd [[lay in repose]] on the [[Lincoln Catafalque]] in the Senate chamber of the [[United States Capitol]], becoming the first Senator to do so since his first year in the Senate, 1959. He was then flown to [[Charleston, West Virginia]], where he [[lay in repose]] in the Lower Rotunda of the [[West Virginia State Capitol]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

A funeral was held on July 2, 2010, on the grounds of the State Capitol where Byrd was eulogized by President [[Barack Obama]], Vice President [[Joe Biden]], Governor [[Joe Manchin]], Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]], Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]], Speaker of the House of Representatives [[Nancy Pelosi]], Senator Jay Rockefeller, Congressman [[Nick Rahall]], [[Victoria Reggie Kennedy]], and former President [[Bill Clinton]].

===Reaction to death===
Multiple political figures issued statements following Byrd's death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/28/usa-congress-byrd-reaction-idUSN2826562320100628 | publisher =Reuters | title=Factbox-Reaction to death of U.S. Senator Byrd | date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]: "It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest serving member, he was its heart and soul. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.com/2010/06/hillary-clinton-remembers-friend-and-mentor-robert-byrd/ | publisher =Observer.com | title=Hillary Clinton Remembers 'Friend and Mentor' Robert Byrd | date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vice President of the United States (and therefore President of the Senate) [[Joe Biden]]: "A very close friend of mine, one of my mentors, a guy who was there when I was a 29-year-old kid being sworn into the United States Senate. Shortly thereafter, a guy who stood in the rain, in the pouring rain, freezing rain outside a church as I buried my daughter and my wife before I got sworn in ... We lost the dean of the United States Senate, but also the state of West Virginia lost its most fierce advocate and, as I said, I lost a dear friend.
* [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senator [[Chris Dodd]]: He [Robert Byrd] never stopped growing as a public official, and was a man who learned from his mistakes. He was more than a friend and colleague. He was a mentor to me and literally hundreds of legislators with whom he served over the past five decades.
* [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Lindsey Graham]]: Senator Byrd was a valuable ally and worthy opponent. He will be viewed by history as one of the giants of the Senate.
* Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]]: On the issues, we were frequent opponents, but he was always gracious both in victory and defeat. This is a man who earned his law degree while serving in the Senate, and who had a prodigious knowledge of ancient and modern history.
* [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]: "He [Robert Byrd] was as much a part of the Senate as the marble busts that line its chamber and its corridors. His profound passion for that body and its role and responsibilities was as evident behind closed doors as it was in the stemwinders he peppered with history. He held the deepest respect of members of both parties, and he was generous with his time and advice, something I appreciated greatly as a young senator."
* [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Republican leader]] [[Mitch McConnell]]: "Senator Byrd combined a devotion to the U.S. Constitution with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the Senate. We will remember him for his fighter's spirit, his abiding faith, and for the many times he recalled the Senate to its purposes."
* [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]]: "Throughout his historic career in the House and Senate, he never stopped working to improve the lives of the people of West Virginia. While some simply bore witness to history, Senator Byrd shaped it and strove to build a brighter future for us all."
*Fellow Democratic Senator from West Virginia [[Jay Rockefeller]]: "Senator Byrd came from humble beginnings in the southern coalfields, was raised by hard-working West Virginians, and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in America. But he never forgot where he came from nor who he represented, and he never abused that power for his own gain."

==In popular culture==
Byrd had a prominent role in the 2008 [[Warner Bros.]] documentary ''[[Body of War]]'' directed by [[Phil Donahue]]. The film chronicles the life of Tomas Young, paralyzed from the chest down after a sniper shot him as he was riding in a vehicle in Iraq. Several long clips of Byrd show him passionately arguing against authorizing the use of force in Iraq. Later in the movie, Byrd has a one-on-one interview with Tomas Young in Byrd's Senate office, followed by a shot of Byrd walking beside the wheelchair-bound Young as they leave the Capitol.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

A fictionalized version of Byrd, then the Senate Majority Leader, was a character in the [[Jeffrey Archer]] novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Byrd was an avid [[violin|fiddle]] player for most of his life, starting in his teens when he played in various square dance bands. Once he entered politics, his fiddling skills attracted attention and won votes. In 1978 when Byrd was Majority Leader, he recorded an album called ''U.S. Senator Robert Byrd: Mountain Fiddler'' (County, 1978). Byrd was accompanied by [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] [[Doyle Lawson]], James Bailey, and [[Spider Gilliam]]. Most of the LP consists of bluegrass music. Byrd covers "Don't Let Your Sweet Love Die", a [[Zeke Manners]] song, and "[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (By and By)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]". He had performed at the [[Kennedy Center]], on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and on ''[[Hee Haw]]''. He occasionally took a break from Senate business to entertain audiences with his fiddle.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He stopped playing in 1982 when the symptoms of a benign [[essential tremor]] had begun to affect the use of his hands.&lt;ref&gt;

==Robert C. Byrd Center for Legislative Studies==
In 2002, the Robert C. Byrd Center for Legislative Studies (CLS) was opened on the campus of [[Shepherd University]]. Adjoining the University's Ruth Scarborough Library, the CLS "advances representative democracy by promoting a better understanding of the United States Congress and the Constitution through programs and research that engage citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert C. Byrd Center for Legislative Studies|url=http://www.byrdcenter.org/|website=Byrd Center|publisher=Byrd Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLS is an archival research facility, housing the papers of Senator Robert C. Byrd in addition to the papers of Congressmen [[Harley Orrin Staggers|Harley O. Staggers Sr.]] and [[Harley O. Staggers Jr.]] and Scot Faulkner, the first [[Chief Administrative Officer of the United States House of Representatives]]. The CLS is a founding institution of the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress, "an independent alliance of organizations and institutions which promote the study of the U.S. Congress." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Association of Centers for the Study of Congress|url=http://www.congresscenters.org/|website=Congress Centers|publisher=Association of Centers for the Study of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3155">'''The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.''' (CPSA) engages in [[research]] and other activities relating to the work of architect [[Andrea Palladio]].  CPSA was founded as a national [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] membership corporation in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], in 1979. &lt;ref name="{{Ref|1}}"&gt;The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., "Welcome," http://www.palladiancenter.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrea Palladio (1508-1580) is often referred to as the most influential [[architect]] in history.&lt;ref name="{{Ref|2}}"&gt;See, e.g., Rudolph Wittkower, ''Palladio and English Palladianism'' (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1983), {{ISBN|0-500-27296-4}}, p. 73: ". . . Palladio had an influence without parallel in the history of architecture."&lt;/ref&gt; He designed country villas, urban palaces, churches and bridges in the [[Veneto]] region of [[Italy]] in the late [[Renaissance]] period.  Palladio's greatest impact arose from publication ([[Venice]], 1570) of his treatise entitled ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'' [The Four Books on Architecture].&lt;ref name="{{Ref|3}}"&gt;Domenico de' Francheschi, printer; translated by Robert Tavernor and Richard Schofield as ''The Four Books on Architecture'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997), {{ISBN|0-262-16162-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Palladiana: Journal of the Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.'', is published semi-annually.  The Center's books include the 3-volume ''Building by the Book'' series edited by Mario di Valmarana and ''Palladio and America: Selected Papers Presented to the Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura'' (1997), &lt;ref name="{{Ref|4}}"&gt;Martin-St. Martin Publishing, {{ISBN|0-932958-18-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Christopher Weeks.  Grants have supported publication of Douglas Lewis’ ''The Drawings of Andrea Palladio'' (2nd ed., 2000) &lt;ref name="{{Ref|5}}"&gt;Martin-St. Martin Publishing, {{ISBN|0-932958-21-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bryan Clark Green’s ''In Jefferson’s Shadow: The Architecture of Thomas R. Blackburn'' (2006).  &lt;ref name="{{Ref|6}}"&gt;Princeton Architectural Press,  {{ISBN|1-56898-479-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Grant (money)|grants]] supported creation of the Mario di Valmarana Professorship in the [[University of Virginia School of Architecture]] &lt;ref name="{{Ref|7}}"&gt;University of Virginia Board of Visitors, meeting agenda, 19 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  and a National Register Report on Battersea, the important 1768 [[Palladian architecture|Palladian-style]] house in [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], Virginia. &lt;ref name="{{Ref|8}}"&gt;''Preservation: Magazine of the National Trust for Historic Preservation'' (July/August  2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
Madden has written numerous books and journal articles, including the "Crusades" entry for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. His research specialties are ancient and medieval history, including the [[Fourth Crusade]], as well as ancient and medieval Italian history. His 1997 revision of ''The Fourth Crusade: The Conquest of Constantinople'' (originally authored by Donald Queller) was a selection of the [[History Book Club]]. He is also known for speaking about the ways that the history of the Crusades is often used for manipulation of modern political agendas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crusade Propaganda|author=Madden, Thomas F.|date=November 2, 2001|publisher=''[[National Review]]'' |  url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/220747/crusade-propaganda-thomas-f-madden | accessdate=2007-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His book, ''The New Concise History of the Crusades'' has been translated into seven foreign languages.

His book ''Enrico Dandolo and the Rise of Venice'' won multiple awards, including the 2007 Haskins Medal from the [[Medieval Academy of America]] and the Otto Gründler Prize from the Medieval Institute.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; According to the ''[[Medieval Review]]'', with this book "Madden more than ever stakes out his place as one of the most important medievalists in America at present."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title_pages/1519.html Johns Hopkins University Press | Books | Enrico Dandolo and the Rise of Venice&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

His 2008 book, ''Empires of Trust,'' was a comparative study that sought elements in historic republics that led to the development of empires.  In the case of Rome, he argued that their citizens and leaders acquired a level of trust among allies and potential enemies that was based upon an unusual rejection of hegemonic power.  His most recent book, ''Venice: A New History'' is the culmination of decades of work in the archives and libraries of Venice.

'''Tinctures''' constitute the limited palette of colours and patterns used in [[heraldry]]. The need to define, depict, and correctly [[blazon]] the various tinctures is one of the most important aspects of heraldic art and design.

== Development and history ==
The use of these tinctures dates back to the formative period of European heraldry, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but the range of tinctures and the manner of depicting and describing them has evolved over time, as new variations and practices have developed.

The basic scheme and rules of applying the heraldic tinctures dates to the formative period of heraldry, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  By the time of the earliest coloured heraldic illustrations, in the mid-thirteenth century, the use of two metals, five colours, and two furs had become standardized, and ever since that time, the great majority of heraldic art has employed these nine tinctures.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87"&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 86–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Slater, ''The Complete Book of Heraldry'', Hermes House, New York (2003), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, variations on these basic tinctures were developed, particularly with respect to the furs, although the authorities differ as to whether these should be considered separate tinctures, or merely varieties of existing ones.  Two additional colours appeared, and were generally accepted by heraldic writers, although they remained scarce, and were eventually termed ''stains'', from the belief that they were used to signify some dishonour on the part of the bearer.&lt;ref name="Woodward 60–61"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', vol. 1, pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice of depicting certain charges as they appear in nature, termed ''proper'', was established by the seventeenth century.  Other colours have appeared occasionally since the eighteenth century, especially in continental heraldry, but their use is infrequent, and they have never been regarded as particularly heraldic, or numbered among the tinctures that form the basis of heraldic design.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', vol. 1, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency and national variants ===
The frequency with which different tinctures have been used over time has been much observed, but little studied.  There are, however, some general trends of note, both with respect to the passage of time, and noted preferences from one region to another.

In medieval heraldry, gules was by far the most common tincture, followed by the metals argent and or, at least one of which necessarily appeared on the majority of arms (see below).  Among the colours, sable was the second most common, followed by azure; vert, although present from the formative period of heraldic design, was relatively scarce.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 83"&gt;Pastoureau, "Heraldry", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, the popularity of azure increased above that of sable, while gules, still the most common, became less dominant.  A survey of French arms granted during the seventeenth century reveals a distinct split between the trends for the arms granted to nobles and commoners.  Among nobles, gules remained the most common tincture, closely followed by or, then by argent and azure at nearly equal levels; sable was a very distant fifth choice, while vert remained scarce.  Among commoners, azure was easily the most common tincture, followed by or, and only then by gules, argent, and sable, which was used more by commoners than among the nobility; vert, however, was even scarcer in common arms.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 83" /&gt;  Purpure is so scarce in French heraldry that some authorities do not regard it as a "real heraldic tincture".&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, ''Heraldry'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the whole, French heraldry is known for its use of azure and or, while English heraldry is characterized by heavy use of gules and argent, and unlike French heraldry, it has always made regular use of vert, and occasional, if not extensive, use of purpure.  German heraldry is known for its extensive use of or and sable.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;  German and Nordic heraldry rarely make use of purpure or ermine, except in [[mantling]], pavilions, and the lining of crowns and caps.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]], ''Heraldry: Customs, Rules, and Styles'', Blandford Press, Dorset (1981), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, furs occur infrequently in German and Nordic heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;Chrisopher von Warnstedt, "The Heraldic Provinces of Europe", in ''The Coat of Arms'', vol. XI, no. 84 (October 1970), pp. 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt;


==List==
{{Tinctures}}
[[File:tinctures.svg|thumb|Table of the tinctures and furs]]
The colours and patterns of the heraldic palette are divided into three groups, usually known as ''metals'', ''colours'', and ''furs''.

=== Metals ===
The metals are ''or'' and ''argent'', representing gold and silver, respectively, although in practice they are often depicted as yellow and white.&lt;ref name="CGH 70" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodward 60" /&gt;

[[Or (heraldry)|'''Or''']] &lt;small&gt;(Ger. ''Gelb'', ''Gold'', or ''golden'')&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonhard 128–129"&gt;Walter Leonhard, ''Das große Buch der Wappenkunst'', Callway-Verlag, Munich (1976), pp. 128, 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; derives its name from the Latin ''aurum'', "gold".  It may be depicted using either yellow or metallic gold, at the artist's discretion; "yellow" has no separate existence in heraldry, and is never used to represent any tincture other than or.&lt;ref name="CGH 70" /&gt;

'''[[Argent]]''' &lt;small&gt;(Ger. ''Weiß'', ''Weiss'', ''Silber'', or ''silbern'')&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leonhard 128–129" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is similarly derived from the Latin ''argentum'', "silver".  Although sometimes depicted as metallic silver or faint grey, it is more often represented by white, in part because of the tendency for silver paint to oxidize and darken over time,{{efn-lr|At one point, aluminum paint was used for argent, as it was more resistant to oxidation; but its effect also faded with age.}} and in part because of the pleasing effect of white against a contrasting colour.&lt;ref name="CGH 70" /&gt;  Notwithstanding the widespread use of white for argent, some heraldic authorities have suggested the existence of white as a distinct heraldic colour.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 70–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colours ===
Five colours have been recognized since the earliest days of heraldry.  These are: ''gules'', or red; ''sable'', or black; ''azure'', or blue; ''vert'', or green; and ''purpure'', or purple.

'''[[Gules]]''' &lt;small&gt;(Fr. ''gueules'', Ger. ''Rot'')&lt;ref name="Woodward 60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is of uncertain derivation; outside of the heraldic context, the modern French word refers to the mouth of an animal.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Cassell's French Dictionary'', Denis Gerard ''et al.'', (editors), Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, Inc., New York (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sable (heraldry)|'''Sable''']] &lt;small&gt;(Ger. ''Schwarz'')&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is named for a [[sable|type of marten]], known for its dark, luxuriant fur.{{efn-lr|Despite the origin of the name, sable is always regarded as a colour, rather than a fur.}}

[[Azure (heraldry)|'''Azure''']] &lt;small&gt;(Fr. ''azur'' or ''bleu'', Ger. ''Blau'')&lt;ref name="Woodward 60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt; comes through the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''lāzaward'',  from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''lāžavard''
both referring to the blue mineral [[lapis lazuli]], used to produce blue pigments.

[[Vert (heraldry)|'''Vert''']] &lt;small&gt;(Fr. ''vert'' or ''sinople'', Ger. ''Grün'')&lt;ref name="Woodward 60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is from Latin ''viridis'', "green".  The alternative name in French, ''sinople'', is derived from the ancient city of [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Asia Minor, which was famous for its pigments.

'''[[Purpure]]''' &lt;small&gt;(Fr. ''purpure or pourpre'', Ger. ''Purpur'')&lt;ref name="Woodward 60" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is from Latin ''purpura'', in turn from Greek ''porphyra'', the dye known as [[Tyrian purple]].  This expensive dye, known from antiquity, produced a much redder purple than the modern heraldic colour; and in fact earlier depictions of purpure are far redder than recent ones.  As a heraldic colour, purpure may have originated as a variation of gules.

====Stains====
Two more were eventually acknowledged by most heraldic authorities: ''sanguine'' or ''murrey'', a dark red or mulberry colour, and ''tenné'', an orange or dark yellow to brownish colour.  These were termed "stains" by some of the more influential heraldic writers, and supposed to represent some sort of dishonour on the part of the bearer; but in fact there is no evidence that they were ever so employed, and they probably originated as mere variations of existing colours.&lt;ref name="Woodward 60–61" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 70–74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the belief that they represented stains upon the honour of an armiger served to prevent them receiving widespread use, and it is only in recent times that they have begun to appear on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/ College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sanguine (heraldry)|Sanguine]]''' or '''[[Murrey]]''', from Latin ''sanguineus'', "blood red", and Greek ''morum'', "mulberry", one of the two so-called "stains" in British armory, is a dark red or mulberry colour, between gules and purpure in hue.&lt;ref name="Woodward 60" /&gt;  It probably originated as a mere variation of one of those two colours, and may in fact represent the original hue of ''purpure'', which is now treated as a much bluer colour than when it first appeared in heraldry.  Although long shunned in the belief that it represented some dishonour on the part of the bearer,{{efn-lr|A rare exception of sanguine in older heraldry, cited by Woodward and Burnett, were the arms of the Clayhills of Invergowrie: ''per bend sanguine and vert, two greyhounds courant bendways argent''.}} it has found some use in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.{{efn-lr|For instance, the arms of Lewes Old Grammar School, granted October 25, 2012: "Murrey within an Orle of eight Crosses crosslet Argent a Lion rampant Or holding in the forepaws a Book bound Azure the spine and the edges of the pages Gold" and those of Woolf, granted October 2, 2015: "Murrey a Snow Wolf's Head erased proper on a Chief Argent a Boar's Head coped at the neck between two Fleurs de Lys Azure."}}&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site" /&gt;

'''[[Tenné]]''' or '''tenny''', from Latin ''tannare'', "to tan", is the second of the so-called "stains".  It is most often depicted as orange, but sometimes as tawny yellow or brown.  In earlier times it was occasionally used in continental heraldry, but in England largely confined to [[livery]].&lt;ref name="Woodward 60–61" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Furs===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Heraldry]] --&gt;
[[File:Solemn kanunnik brugge.jpg|thumb|Canons from the [[Chapter (religion)|chapter]] of Bruges, solemn winterdress in fur]]
The use of heraldic furs alongside the metals and colours dates to the beginning of the art.  In this earliest period, there were only two furs, ermine and vair.{{efn-lr|Although ''sable'' is also named after the dark pelt of a type of marten, it has always been regarded as a colour, rather than a fur.}}  Ermine represents the fur of the [[stoat]], a type of weasel, in its white winter coat, when it is called an ermine.  Vair represents the winter coat of the [[red squirrel]], which is blue-grey above and white below.  These furs were commonly used to line the cloaks and robes of the nobility.  Both ermine and vair give the appearance of being a combination of metal and colour, but in heraldic convention they are considered a separate class of tincture that is neither metal nor colour.  Over time, several variations of ermine and vair have appeared, together with three additional furs typically encountered in continental heraldry, known as ''plumeté'', ''papelonné'', and ''kürsch'', the origins of which are more mysterious, but which probably began as variations of vair.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', pp. 63, 68–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 77–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erminespots.svg|right|Ermine spots]]
{{Split portions |section=Ermine |date=August 2018 |Ermine (heraldry)}}
'''Ermine''' &lt;small&gt;(Fr. ''hermine'', Ger. ''hermelin'')&lt;/small&gt; is normally depicted as a white field powdered with black spots, known as "ermine spots", representing the ermine's black tail.  The use of white instead of silver is normal, even when silver is available, since this is how the fur naturally appears; but occasionally silver is used to depict ermine.&lt;ref name="Woodward Ermine"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', pp. 63, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditionally, ermine has been used to line the cloaks and robes of various nobles, as well as the ''[[chapeau]]x'' and [[Cap of Maintenance|caps of maintenance]] worn by [[peerage|peers]], and used to line crowns; these appear beneath many crests in place of a [[torse]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 378–382.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is considerable variation in the shape of ermine spots; in the oldest depictions, they were drawn realistically, as long, tapering points; in modern times they are typically drawn as arrowheads, usually topped by three small dots;{{efn-lr|An interpretation of this shape is that the base of the ermine spot represents three tufts of fur, converging in a point at the top, which is attached to the white surface by three studs.}} but as with other details, the form used is left to the heraldic artist.  Ermine spots are considered part of the tincture known as ermine, rather than charges; but the same shape can also be used as a charge upon other tinctures.&lt;ref name="Woodward Ermine" /&gt;  In English heraldry, a single ermine spot has been used as a mark of difference when, by royal licence, one person assumes the names and arms of another, in the absence of any blood relationship.&lt;ref name="CGH 78"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ermine spots are normally depicted upright, except on a bend, when they are depicted bendwise.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

British armory recognizes three variations of ermine.  A black field powdered with white ermine spots is termed ''ermines'' &lt;small&gt;(Fr. ''contre-hermine'', Ger. ''gegen-hermelin'')&lt;/small&gt;; a gold field with black ermine spots is ''erminois'', and a black field with gold ermine spots is ''pean''.{{efn-lr|An additional variation, known as ''erminites'', is said to be the same as ermine, but with a red hair on each side of the ermine spots; but no examples are known in either British or continental heraldry, so it appears to be nothing more than the fanciful invention of heraldic writers.}}&lt;ref name="Woodward Ermine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 78" /&gt;  These are not regarded as separate furs, but merely variations of ermine.  Neither erminois nor pean are known by distinctive names outside of British armory; instead they are regarded as a field semé of ermine spots.  In French heraldry, erminois would be blazoned ''d'Or, semé d'hermines de sable'', while pean would be ''de Sable, semé d'hermines d'or''.{{efn-lr|The terms ''herminais'' and ''péan'' may be recent inventions.}}  Especially in continental heraldry, a field of any tincture may be semé of ermine spots, producing a pattern indistinguishable from ermine, except by virtue of the tinctures used; but these should be treated as other fields semé, rather than heraldic furs.&lt;ref name="Woodward Ermine" /&gt;

{{Split portions |section=Vair |date=August 2018 |Vair}}
'''Vair'''&lt;small&gt; (Ger. ''Feh'')&lt;/small&gt; derives its name from Latin ''varius'', "variegated".  It is usually depicted as a series of alternating shapes, conventionally known as panes or "vair bells", of argent and azure, arranged in horizontal rows, so that the panes of one tincture form the upper part of the row, while those of the opposite tincture are on the bottom.{{efn-lr|Usage varies as to whether the panes in the upper part of each row should be argent or azure.  There is no rule, but following the reasoning that metals are more "honourable" than colours, the leading authorities suggest that argent should come first.  This is the usual practice in French heraldry, but in British armory the top row is usually azure.}}  Succeeding rows are staggered, so that the bases of the panes making up each row are opposite those of the other tincture in the rows above and below.  As with ermine, the argent panes may be depicted as either white or silver; silver is used more often with vair than with ermine, but the natural fur is white.  In the earliest period of heraldry, vair was depicted by alternating straight and wavy or nebuly lines; today this form is known as ''vair ondé'' or ''vair ancien'' (Ger. ''Wolkenfeh'', "cloud vair").{{efn-lr|As with many heraldic terms, the Norman French spelling is commonly used, even in English heraldry; but the Anglicized form, ''vair ancient'', is also found.}}  Through a series of intermediate forms, the panes evolved their modern shape, consisting entirely of straight lines and sharp angles; but the heraldic artist is normally at liberty to use any of these forms.&lt;ref name="Woodward Vair"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', pp. 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 79–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally vair was produced in three sizes, and each size came to be depicted in armory.  A field consisting of only three rows, representing the largest size, was termed ''gros vair'' or ''beffroi'' (from the same root as the English word ''belfry''); vair of four rows was simply ''vair'', while if there were six rows, representing the smallest size, it was ''menu-vair'' (whence the English word ''miniver'').  This distinction is not generally observed in English heraldry, and is not strictly observed in continental heraldry, although in French heraldry it is customary to specify the number of rows if there are more than four.&lt;ref name="Woodward Vair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83" /&gt;

There are several varieties of vair consisting entirely of alternate arrangements of the rows.  The most familiar is ''counter-vair'' (Fr. ''contre vair''), in which succeeding rows are reversed instead of staggered, so that the bases of the panes of each tincture are opposite those of the same tincture in adjoining rows.  Less common is ''vair in pale'' (Fr. ''vair en pal'' or ''vair appointé'', Ger. ''Pfahlfeh''), in which the panes of each tincture are arranged in vertical columns.  In German heraldry one finds ''Stürzpfahlfeh'', or reversed vair in pale.  ''Vair in bend'' (Fr. ''vair en bande'') and ''vair in bend sinister'' (Fr. ''vair en barre''), in which the panes are arranged in diagonal rows, is found in continental heraldry.  ''Vair in point'' (Fr. ''vair en pointe'', Ger. ''Wogenfeh'', "wave vair") is formed by reversing alternate rows, as in counter-vair, and then displacing them by half the width of a pane, forming an undulating pattern across adjoining rows.  German heraldry also uses a form called ''Wechselfeh'', or "alternate vair", in which each pane is divided in half along a vertical line, one side being argent and the other azure.&lt;ref name="Woodward Vair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83" /&gt;

When the pattern of vair is used with other colours, the field is termed ''vairé'' or ''vairy''{{efn-lr|Sometimes, in older authorities, ''varry'' or ''verry''.}} of the tinctures used.  Normally vairé consists of one metal and one colour, although ermine or one of its variants is sometimes used, with an ermine spot appearing in each pane of that tincture.  Vairé of four colours (Ger. ''Buntfeh'', "gay-coloured" or "checked vair") is also known, usually consisting of two metals and two colours.&lt;ref name="Woodward Vair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83" /&gt;

Another type of variation is known as ''potent''{{efn-lr|Occasionally, ''varry cuppy''.}} (Ger. ''Sturzkrückenfeh'', "upside-down crutch vair").  In this form, the familiar "vair bell" is replaced by a T-shaped figure, known as a "potent" due to its resemblance to a crutch.  The appearance of this shape is thought by some authorities to have originated from crude draftsmanship, although others regard it as an old and perfectly acceptable variation.  A regularly encountered variation of potent is ''counter-potent'' or ''potent-counter-potent'' (Ger. ''Gegensturzkrückenfeh''), which is produced in the same fashion as counter-vair; ''potent in point'' (Ger. ''Verschobenes Gegensturzkrückenfeh'', "displaced counter-potent") is also found.  There is no reason why one could not have ''potent in pale'', ''potent in bend'', ''alternate potent'', or ''potent of four colours''.  The same pattern using other tinctures than argent and azure is termed ''potenté'' or ''potenty'' of those colours.&lt;ref name="Woodward Vair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83" /&gt;

Three other furs sometimes encountered in continental heraldry are thought to be derived from vair: in ''plumeté'' or ''plumetty'', the panes are depicted as feathers; and in ''papelonné'' or ''papellony'' they are depicted as scales, resembling those of a butterfly's wings, whence the name is derived.  In German heraldry there is a fur known as ''Kürsch'', or "vair bellies", consisting of panes depicted hairy and brown.&lt;ref name="Woodward Vair" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 79–83" /&gt;  Here the phrase "vair bellies" may be a misnomer, as the belly of the red squirrel is always white, although its summer coat is indeed reddish brown.

=== Other tinctures ===
Several other tinctures are occasionally met with, usually in continental heraldry:

*'''[[Cendrée]]''', or "ash-colour";{{efn-lr|Aschau of Bavaria: ''Cendrée, a mount of three coupeaux in base, or''.  Gwilt of South Wales: ''Argent, a lion rampant sable, the head, paws, and half of the tail ash colour''.}}
*'''[[Brunâtre]]''' &lt;small&gt;(Ger. ''Braun'')&lt;/small&gt;, or brown, occasionally used in German heraldry, in place of purpure;{{efn-lr|Mieroszewsky of Silesia: ''de Brunâtre, a cross patée argent supporting a raven rising sable, and holding in its beak a horse-shoe proper, its points towards the chief''.}}
*'''[[bleu celeste|Bleu-céleste]]''' or '''bleu de ciel''', a sky blue colour intended to be lighter than azure;{{efn-lr|Cinti (now Cini) of Florence: ''Per pale azure and bleu-celeste an estoile counter changed''.}}
*'''Amaranth''' or '''columbine''', a strong violet-red, found in at least one grant of arms to a Bohemian knight in 1701;
*'''Eisen-farbe''', or iron-colour, found in German heraldry; and
*'''[[Carnation (heraldry)|Carnation]]''', often used in French heraldry as the colour of flesh.

The heraldic scholar [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies|A. C. Fox-Davies]] proposed that, in some circumstances, ''white'' should be considered a heraldic colour, distinct from [[argent]].  In a number of instances, a label or collar blazoned as "white" rather than "argent" appears on a supporter blazoned argent ''or'' or.  The use of "white" in place of "argent" would be consistent with the practice of heraldic blazon that discourages repeating the name of a tincture in describing a coat of arms, but if it were merely intended as a synonym of "argent", this placement would clearly violate the rule against placing metal on metal or colour on colour (see below).  This difficulty is avoided if "white" is considered a colour in this particular instance, rather than a synonym of "argent".&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 70–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  This interpretation has neither been accepted nor refuted by any heraldic authority, but a counter-argument is that the labels are not intended to represent a heraldic tincture, but are in fact white labels proper.

Other exceptional colours have occasionally appeared during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries:

The arms of the [[Jewish Autonomous Region]] in [[Russia]] have a field of ''aquamarine'', which is emblazoned more as a kind of dark green than a true aquamarine colour.

The [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] granted arms containing ''[[rose (heraldic tincture)|rose]]'' as a colour in 1997.{{efn-lr|Arms of [[Kim Campbell]], 19th [[Prime Minister of Canada]]: ''Or the universal symbol for a woman pendant from its crosspiece a pair of scales Rose and in base three bars wavy Azure on a canton the mark of the Prime Ministership of Canada''.}}  In 2002, the Authority granted arms including ''[[copper (heraldry)|copper]]'', treated as a metal, to the municipality of [[Whitehorse, Yukon]].

''[[Ochre]]'', both red and yellow, appears in [[South Africa]]n heraldry; the national coat of arms, adopted in 2000, includes ''red ochre'', while (yellow) ochre appears in the arms of the [[University of Transkei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/za)coa.html |title=South Africa – Coat of Arms |publisher=Crwflags.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040603201208/http://uk.geocities.com/wapenskild/uni/Unitra.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], heraldry is not governed by any official authority; but the [[United States Army]], which makes extensive use of heraldry, does have its own authority, the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry]].  The armorial designs of the Institute of Heraldry include a number of novel tinctures, including ''[[Buff (colour)|buff]]'' (employed variously as either a metal or a colour),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 11th Transportation Battalion Insignia Page, The Institute of Heraldry|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Trans/11TransportationBattalion.htm|accessdate=2007-08-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061230082906/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Trans/11TransportationBattalion.htm |archivedate = December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''horizon blue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/QM/190QuartermasterBattalion.htm |title=190th Quartermaster Battalion Insignia Page |publisher=Tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-04-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080517150124/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/QM/190QuartermasterBattalion.htm |archivedate = May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Silver gray'' has appeared in the heraldry of both the Army and the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Numeric_Misc/1SpaceBattalion.htm |title=1st Space Battalion |publisher=Tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-04-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724111958/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Numeric_Misc/1SpaceBattalion.htm |archivedate = July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ascho.wpafb.af.mil/88th%20ABW%20Emblem.htm |title=88th ABW Emblem |publisher=Ascho.wpafb.af.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609020036/http://www.ascho.wpafb.af.mil/88th%20ABW%20Emblem.htm |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Bronze'' appears as a colour in the arms of the Special Troops Battalion of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heraldrysociety.us/forum/viewtopic.php?t=541 |title=American Heraldry Society forum |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208135825/http://heraldrysociety.us/forum/viewtopic.php?t=541 |archivedate=February 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There seems to be some confusion about the colour ''crimson'', as in some cases it is treated as a separate tincture, while in others it is used to specify the shade of gules to be employed by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Ord/15OrdnanceBattalion.htm |title=15th Ordnance Battalion |publisher=Tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil |date= |accessdate=2009-04-16 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080622035410/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Ord/15OrdnanceBattalion.htm |archivedate = June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Differing from most heraldic practice, the Institute of Heraldry often specifies the exact shades to be used in depicting various arms.

==== Proper ====
A charge that is coloured as it naturally appears is blazoned ''proper'' (Fr. ''propre''), or "the colour of nature".&lt;ref name="Woodward 62"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 74–76"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Strictly speaking, proper is not a tincture in itself, and if, as is sometimes the case, a charge is meant to be depicted in particular colours that are not apparent from the word "proper" alone, they may be specified in whatever detail is necessary.{{efn-lr|For example, "a dapple-grey horse proper, the mane and tail sable, and both hind feet white".}}&lt;ref name="Woodward 62" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 74–76" /&gt;  Certain charges are considered "proper" when portrayed with particular colours, even though a range of different colours is found in nature; for instance, a popinjay proper is green, even though wild parrots occur in a variety of colours.  In some cases, a charge depicted in a particular set of colours may be referred to as "proper", even though it consists entirely of heraldic tinctures; a rose proper, whether red or white, is barbed vert and seeded or.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Heraldry'',  A. S. Barnes and Company, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey (1968), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most extensive use of non-heraldic colours is probably associated with "landscape heraldry", a common feature of British and German armory during the latter part of the eighteenth century, and the early part of the nineteenth.  Although rarely used for the field itself, landscapes were often granted as [[Augmentation of honour|augmentations]], typically depicting a fortress successfully captured or defended, or a particular ship, or a battle in which the armiger to whom the augmentation was granted was involved.  Such landscapes, usually appearing on a chief, might be blazoned with great particularity as to the things portrayed and the colours used to portray them.  Officially, these landscapes appeared on a field of argent, but it was common, and perhaps expected, for the artist to add further details, such as the sky and clouds, by which the field might be wholly obscured.  The use of landscapes in heraldry fell out of fashion during the [[Victorian era]], when heraldic scholars and artists began looking to earlier and simpler periods of armorial design for inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
In the English-speaking world, heraldic terminology is based largely on that of British armory, which in turn is based on [[Norman language|Norman French]]. With respect to the heraldic tinctures, French heraldry, which is often cited by heraldic authors, uses similar terminology; while German heraldry, also highly influential, uses a different vocabulary; it calls the colours by their everyday names.{{efn-lr|Spanish and Dutch heraldry, in common with English, also use terminology derived from Norman French; while Italian heraldry, like German, uses everyday names for the colours.}}

In its original sense, ''tincture'' refers only to the group conventionally referred to as "colours".&lt;ref name="CGH 70"&gt;[[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', Dodge Publishing Company, New York (1909), reprinted by Bonanza Books, New York (1978), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; But as the word "colour" seems inapplicable to the heraldic furs, and no other term clearly encompasses all three classes, the word "tincture" has come to be used in this broader sense, while "colour" has acquired the more restricted sense originally given to "tincture".&lt;ref name="Woodward 60"&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when consulting various heraldic authorities, care must be taken to determine which meaning each term is given.

==Designations==
===Artistic liberties===
In most heraldic tradition, the various metals and colours have no fixed appearance, hue, or shade.  The heraldic artist is free to choose a lighter or darker blue or green, a deeper or brighter red; to choose between depicting or with yellow or any of various gold paints, to depict argent as white or silver.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, ''Heraldry'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently the College of Arms explained, "there are no fixed shades for heraldic colours. If the official description of a coat of arms gives its tinctures as Gules (red), Azure (blue) and Argent (white or silver) then, as long as the blue is not too light and the red not too orange, purple or pink, it is up to the artist to decide which particular shades they think are appropriate."&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site" /&gt;

=== In blazoning ===
{{Main|Blazon}}
Most heraldic authors do not capitalize the names of the various tinctures, although a few do (sometimes inconsistently), and some who do not capitalize the other tinctures recommend capitalizing "or" in order to avoid confusion with the conjunction.  However, there are relatively few occasions in which the conjunction "or" would appear in the blazon of a coat of arms; and if properly worded, which meaning is intended should be readily apparent from the context.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Aveling, ''Heraldry: Ancient and Modern, including Boutell's Heraldry,'' Frederick Warne and Company, London and New York (1890), pp. 11–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', vol. 1, pp. 60–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 70–87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklyn, ''Heraldry'', p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, ''The Complete Book of Heraldry'', pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), pp. 45–49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another convention has been to capitalize only the first word or the first tincture appearing in the blazon, but no other words.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the elaborate calligraphy appearing on most grants of arms, all of the tinctures are capitalized, as indeed are the names of the charges; but this is purely a matter of decorative style, and in no way does the manner of capitalization used in the original grant affect how the arms may be described on other occasions.

A long-standing heraldic tradition has been to avoid repeating the names of tinctures multiple times in any given blazon.  If it is possible to mention multiple charges of the same tincture at once, followed by the name of the tincture, then this problem is avoided; but when it is impossible to combine elements of the same tincture in this manner, more creative descriptions may be used.  For example, instead of "gules, on a fess or between three chess-rooks argent, a lion passant gules, armed and langued argent", one might say, "gules, on a fess or between three chess-rooks argent, a lion passant ''of the field'', armed and langued ''of the third''."  Similar phrases include "of the last" and "of the like".  Alternately, descriptions such as "gold" and "silver" might be substituted for "or" and "argent" on a subsequent occurrence.  Another rule of blazon relating to tinctures suggests the placing of a comma after each occurrence of a tincture.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 101–102, 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the College of Arms has regularly dispensed with many of these practices, believing them to cause confusion; and in new grants of arms, the names of tinctures are repeated on each instance that they occur.  The names of all tinctures and charges are capitalized, although the word "proper", indicating the colour of nature, is not; and internal commas are entirely omitted.

==== Rule of tincture ====
{{Main|Rule of tincture}}
The first so-called "rule" of heraldry is the '''rule of tincture''': ''metal should not be placed upon metal, nor colour upon colour'', for the sake of contrast.

The main duty of a heraldic device is to be recognized, and the dark colours or light metals are supposed to be too difficult to distinguish if they are placed on top of other dark or light colours, particularly in poor light. Though this is the practical genesis of the rule, the rule is technical and appearance is not used in determining whether arms conform to the rule. Another reason sometimes given to justify this rule is that it was difficult to paint with enamel (colour) over enamel, or with metal over metal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

This "rule" has at times been followed so pedantically that arms that violate it were called ''[[armes fausses]]'' (false arms) or ''[[armes à enquérir]]'' (arms of enquiry); any violation was presumed to be intentional, to the point that one was supposed to enquire how it came to pass. One of the most famous ''armes à enquérir'' (often said to be the only example) was the shield of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which had gold crosses on silver. This use of metal on metal, that is to say white and gold together, is seen on the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#Arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|arms of the King of Jerusalem]], the flag and arms of the Vatican, and the bishop's mitre in the arms of Andorra. It indicates the exceptional holy and special status of the Coat of Arms. An example of "colour on colour" is the arms of [[Albania]], with its sable [[two-headed eagle]] on a gules field.

The "rule of tincture" has had an influence reaching far beyond heraldry. It has been applied to the design of flags, so that the flag of [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] was modified to conform to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flagspot.net/flags/de-sw_hi.html |title=Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach 1813–1918 (Germany) |publisher=Flagspot.net |date= |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Counterchanging ====
When a charge or group of charges is placed across a [[division of the field|division]] line, [[variation of the field|variation]], or [[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]], it may be ''counterchanged'' (Fr. ''contre-changé'', but modern ''de l'un en l'autre'', Ger. ''verwechselte Farben'' or ''verschränkte Farben''), meaning that the charges are divided the same way as the field upon which they rest, with the colours reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Elvin, ''A dictionary of heraldry'' (1889), [https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofhera00elvi#page/35/mode/1up p. 35].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panckoucke, ''Le grand vocabulaire françois'' (1768), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iQN1Kwsm-LIC&amp;pg=PA556&amp;lpg=PA556 p. 556].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the municipal arms of [[Behnsdorf]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], seen at right, the field is divided with the left half white (argent) and the right half green (vert), and the counterchanged tree is green where it lies on the white part of the field, and white where it lies on the green part.

The [[flag of Maryland]] is another example of counterchanging.  The only U.S. state flag to be directly based on English heraldry, it is the arms of [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]], who founded the colony of Maryland in 1632.  In the 1st and 4th quarters, the field is divided into six vertical bands of gold (or) and black (sable) with a diagonal band (a [[Bend (heraldry)|bend]]) in which the colours are reversed (i.e., the bend is counterchanged).  The 2nd and 3rd quarters are themselves quartered between white (argent) and red (gules) with a counterchanged [[cross bottony]] that is red where it lies on the white part of the field and white where it lies on the red part of the field.

Counterchanging is rare in early heraldry; early examples from [[German heraldry]] are found in the late fifteenth-century [[Wernigerode Armorial]];&lt;ref&gt;''Wernigeroder Wappenbuch'', pp. [[:File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 202.jpg|202]], [[:File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 238.jpg|238]], [[:File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 239.jpg|239]], [[:File:Wernigeroder Wappenbuch 318.jpg|318]].&lt;/ref&gt; it becomes more frequently applied from the seventeenth century onward, especially with the substantial number of newly-created coats of arms, of which some notable examples include [[Baron Baltimore]] (1624), [[Nightingale baronets]] (1628), [[Barrett-Lennard baronets]] (1801), [[Verney baronets]] (1818), and [[Baron Alvingham]] (1929).

In Scottish heraldry, charges are sometimes blazoned as counterchanged of different colours from the field; for instance, ''per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour counterchanged or and of the first.''  A more typical blazon for this would be ''per fess gules and azure, a sun in splendour per fess or and of the first''.

The term ''countercoloured'' is sometimes used in place of ''counterchanged''.  The arms of the [[Fenwick baronets]] were originally blazoned as ''silver, a chief gules with six martlets countercoloured''.  In this case, three martlets argent rest on a chief gules, while three martlets gules rest on the argent field.  Some heraldic authorities regard the use of this term as erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;Gough and Parker, ''A Glossary of Terms Used in Heraldry'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hatching====
{{Main|Hatching (heraldry)}}
[[File:Zangrius kaart arceringg.jpg|thumb|140px|Hatching guide by [[Jan Baptist Zangrius]], 1600]]
During the first half of the seventeenth century, the proliferation of the printing press coupled with the persistence of difficulties in and expense of [[colour printing]] prompted the development of a number of systems of [[hatching system|hatching]] for the purpose of depicting heraldic designs without the use of colour.  Intended chiefly for printing and engraving, the system which eventually gained widespread acceptance was that of [[Silvester Petra Sancta|Silvestro de Petra Sancta]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and heraldic scholar, originally published in 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry'', vol. 1, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Petra Sancta's method, illustrated in the table above, a separate hatching represents each metal and colour, while the furs are treated as combinations of metal and colour.  Argent is represented by a plain field, while or is represented by a field strewn with dots.  Gules is represented by vertical lines, azure by horizontal lines, and sable by a combination of horizontal and vertical lines.  Diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base represent vert, while purpure is the reverse, represented by diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base.  Sanguine is represented by diagonal lines running in each direction, while tenné is represented by a combination of horizontal lines and diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base.&lt;ref name="CGH 75–76"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine additional hatchings, published by [[Marcus Vulson de la Colombière]] in 1639, were intended to represent other colours, although none of them correspond with regular heraldic tinctures, and they have never been used in British armory.  A combination of vertical lines with diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base represents brown; blood red is represented by vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from sinister chief to dexter base; earth-colour by horizontal and vertical lines combined with diagonal lines running from dexter chief to sinister base; iron-grey by diagonal lines running in each direction (the same as sanguine in Petra Sancta's system); water-colour by broken horizontal lines; flesh-colour by broken vertical lines; ashen-grey by a combination of broken horizontal and broken diagonal lines; orange by broken vertical lines interspersed with dots; and the colour of nature by zig-zag lines running from dexter chief to sinister base.&lt;ref name="CGH 75–76" /&gt;

====Tricking====
{{Main|Tricking}}
[[Image:Tricking.png|thumb|140px|left|Tricked arms of John Browne of Spexhall, Suffolk (1591)]]
Before the use of hatching to depict individual heraldic tinctures, it was common to "trick" heraldic designs when colours were unavailable.  The arms would be drawn in outline, and the tinctures written in abbreviated form: ''O'' or ''or'' for or; ''A'', ''ar'', or ''arg'' for argent, ''G'' or ''gu'' for gules; ''S'' or ''sa'' for sable; ''Az'' or ''B'' for azure (''B'' for "blue" being used in older trickings to avoid confusion between ''ar'' and ''az''); ''Vt'' for vert, ''Purp'' for purpure, and ''Pr'' for proper.  Although most records of the [[College of Arms]] are in colour, the practice of tricking is used in all other cases, even after the widespread adoption of hatching for printing and engraving arms.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

French heraldry also uses tricking to depict heraldic tinctures, using ''O'' for or; ''A'' for argent; ''G'' for gules; ''S'' for sable; ''B'' for bleu (to avoid confusing azur with argent);  ''V'' for vert (to avoid confusing sinople with sable); ''P'' for purpure or pourpre; and ''Pr'' for propre.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;

In German heraldry, ''G'' is used for gelb (gold); ''W'' for weiss (white); ''R'' for rot (red); ''S'' for schwarz (black); ''B'' for blau (blue); and ''Gr'', or a shape like an upright leaf, for grün (green); German heraldry makes little use of purpure, but in its place allows ''Br'' for braun (brown).  These abbreviations may be either capitalized or lowercase.&lt;ref name="Neubecker 86–87" /&gt;

===Poetic representation===
That was a time when [[heraldry]] was ruled by allegorical and astrological views. {{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=January 2015}} All this was in connection with the ancient lore of sympathies, {{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=January 2015}} which examined sympathies and antipathies among the stars, [[mineral]]s, [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, and people. Some additional tinctures were also designed {{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=January 2015}} by astrological symbols.

The Babylonians, according to the lore of sympathies, had great esteem for gems, semi-precious stones and scarce minerals. {{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=January 2015}}They saw them as the concentrates of cosmic powers. [[Pliny the Elder]] stressed several times that he wrote his work to reveal this universal law (i. e. the lore of sympathies). This doctrine was taken over by the Medieval medicine, pharmacy, alchemy, heraldry etc. During the 1350s, the work of [[Bartolo de Sassoferrato]] (1313/1314-1357) linked Or to the sun, Azure to the element air, and Gules to the element fire. Between 1382 and 1387 he was followed by [[Honoré Bonet]] (c. 1340-c. 1410), a heraldist from Provence. In his work ''Arbre des Batailles'' (1387) Bonet declares that the metal gold is the noblest in the world because, due to its very nature, is bright and shining and full of virtues.

During the late medieval period and Renaissance, there was an occasional practice of [[tricking (heraldry)|blazoning tinctures]] by gemstones, or by references to the seven classical "planets" (including Sun and Moon).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Reference-idFox-Davies1909|Fox-Davies (1909)]], p. 77.

The work of Bonet was thoroughly studied by the 15th century Burgundian heraldists and [[Jean Courtois (herald)|Jean Courtois]] (†1436) called Sicily Herald. In his work ''Le Blason des Couleurs'' (1414), Courtois developed a heraldic system consisting of the tinctures, planets and [[Carbuncle (gemstone)|carbuncles]] (furthermore, the virtues, metals, months, the zodiac, and weekdays among others). He was familiar with the ''Etymologies'' of [[Isidore of Seville]], and also he gave the names of the tinctures in [[Greek language|Greek]]. However, his main contribution was the development of gemstone-planetary blazon. The system that Bonet developed was as a mix of the colour-gemstone-planet: or topaz the sun, argent pearl the moon, gules ruby the Mars, sable diamond the Saturn, azure sapphire the Jupiter, vert emerald the Venus, purpure amethyst the Mercury, tenné jacinth the dragon's head, sanguine/murrey sardonyx the dragon's tail.

[[Tenné]] and [[Sanguine (heraldry)|Sanguine]] were the stains used in the abatements of arms which were dishonorable charges placed upon the coats of arms of malefactors. [[Lunar node|Dragon's head]] and [[Lunar node|dragon's tail]] were in use from the late ancient times. While the dragon's head (called also [[Anabibazon]] in [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]]) symbolizes a light colour ([[tenné]]), dragon‘s tail (called also [[Catabibazon]]) symbolizes a dark colour ([[sanguine]]) which in miniature corresponds to transmutation, provided by [[alchemy|alchemists]]. The purpose of this process is to produce the [[philosopher's stone]]. During the process, as a result of the successive reactions, the [[materia prima]] will get transformed to a darker and more reddish one from the light coloured material. In the astrology dragon‘s head is connected to good luck, while dragon‘s tail is linked to unlucky events. All these indicate that the then contemporary [[heraldry]] was strongly under the influences of magical views and alchemistic ideas, which in turn were connected to the lore of the sympathies between the colours, planets, gemstones, metals, virtues etc. (The odd terminology of colours used by Heraldus Britannus, as mentioned by Spener, can partly reflect the view of alchemy: aurum–cytrine, argentum–aspre, rubeus–coccine, caeruleus– veneto, Niger–mauro, viridis–prasino, and purpureus–oiscy.)

The work of Jean Courtois was diffused in manuscripts and later became one of the first books printed in French. Shortly it was published in [[England]] as well, but without much impact. However, during the Tudor and Stuart dynasties (1485–1702), it appeared in the then heraldry manuals. In his book ''Traité du blason'' (1465), [[Clément Prinsault]] deals with the relation of colours to the [[virtues]], the seven planets, the 12 celestial signs, gemstones, weekdays, the three elements etc. This book is one of the earliest writings on heraldry that is available today.

The English historian and heraldist Sir [[Henry Spelman]] (1564–1641) applied in his 1654 book titled ''Aspilogia'' the [[symbols]] of the planets to designate tinctures (presented in the table). Sir [[John Ferne]] (†1609) enumerates as many as 14 different methods of blazon: 1. by colours,  2. by planets,  3. by precious stones,  4. by virtues,  5. by celestial signs,  6. by the months of the year,  7. by the days of the week, 8. by the ages of man, 9. by flowers, 10. by the elements, 11. by the seasons of the year, 12. by the complexions of man, 13. by numbers, 14. by metals. Though today its practice is considered absurd, it was an organic part of the then heraldic view.

Apart from the main tinctures, there also existed English and other language tricking abbreviations for some other tinctures (such as [[Proper (heraldry)|Proper]] – ppr, pp, [[Ermine]] – er etc.). To designate [[carnation]] (carnea tinctura), the then contemporary [[heraldry]] applied the zodiac sign of Leo in reverse ([[Image:Fordított oroszlán állatjegy.jpg]]), and the [[German heraldry]] used trefoil to designate colours above the seven main tinctures („qui ultimus color alibi signo trifolii ♣ pinguitur“). [[Philipp Jakob Spener|Spener]] also maintained (1717. p.&amp;nbsp;113), the [[tenné]] and [[sanguine]] were designated by the zodiac sign of Leo ([[Image:Oroszlán állatjegy.jpg]]). Besides the planetary sign of Venus, Rudolphi  also refers to trefoil ( [[Image:zöld Rudolphi.PNG|8px]] ) as a designation of colour vert. He also assigned the specific lengthy variants of astrological signs dragon's head and dragon's tail to the tinctures orange and carnation, respectively([[Image:Narancs rudolphi.PNG|16px]] [[Image:Testszín rudolphi.PNG|17px]]). Furthermore, the tincture Purpure  being abbreviated by the letter p. (de: Purpur), and the grey by the letter a. (Asche-Farb).&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Rudolphi: ''Heraldica Curiosa''. Nürnberg, 1698.  96. l.&lt;/ref&gt; The astrological signs of the [[ascending node|ascending]] and [[descending node]]s ([[Lunar node|dragon's head]] and [[Lunar node|dragon's tail]]: [[Image:Sárkányfej jó.jpg]]&amp;nbsp;[[Image:Sárkányfarok jó.jpg]] were also derived from the [[zodiac]] sign of [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] that was highly esteemed in the [[Renaissance]] age [[astrology]].

So, besides these seven principal [[tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]], there soon emerged some additional colours, which were also symbolized by the planetary symbols, gemstones, weekdays etc. Thus, a system of nine tinctures was developed. In general, it was said that the great [[magnate]]s – the [[duke]]s, the [[earl]]s, and the [[baron]]s – were to have their arms blazoned by [[gemstone]]s, and that the [[prince]]s, the [[king]]s and the [[emperor]]s were to have their arms blazoned by the [[planet]]s. However, the Austrian [[troubadour]] and [[herald]] [[Peter Suchenwirt]] (c. 1320-1395) used gemstones to designate the tinctures even earlier (c. 1355) to describe the [[coat of arms]] of the Hungarian king Louis the Great (1342–1382).&lt;ref&gt;”I wish I was so ingenious and sage to praise the brilliance of his arms, held by him in honour, according to my volition! His escutcheon is not disfigured by any flaws; it beams a silvery colour, and is divided in two equal parts. One field gleams in the light colour of pearls and rubies, and is polished for radiant, and there lie in the horizontal direction eight picked fesses; another field of blue celeste is redundantly graced by domed golden fleurs-de-lis that stood by the arms many times with their plentiful rays, which are very pleasant to see. The helmet’s top decorates a richly decked golden crown with a lot of shining gemstones, smoothed to lustrous; from the crown standing off two ostrich feathers and between them to be seen the ermine neck of the ostrich; his eyes sparkling from the rubies towards the enemy, his bill is golden, in which he beautifully holds a handsomely curved horseshoe-shaped charge made of gold. His head is being richly crowned by gold.” (Jakab Bleyer, Századok 1899. pp. 808-809) This poem is an evidence that in the past there really existed some coat of arms made of gemstones.&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem titled ''Turnier von Nantheiz'' (c. 1258) [[Konrad von Würzburg]] (c. 1230 -1287) also mentioned some coat of arms made of gemstones. In his blazon on the arms of the king of England (lines 310-320) we can learn that his escutheion was covered with Arabian gold and his leopards were made of rubies; finally, to the end of his work (1040) we can also read about further precious stones applied on coat of arms.&lt;ref&gt;”smaragden und karvunkel [Karfunkelsteine],/ jachande [Hyazinthsteine] und crisolîten [Krisolithen],/ die wurden bi den zîten/ getengelt ûz den schilten.”&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Uranus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|jʊər|ə|n|ə|s|,_|j|ʊəˈr|eɪ|n|ə|s}}; [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Οὐρανός}}, ''Ouranos'' {{IPA-grc|oːranós|}} meaning "[[sky]]" or "[[heaven]]") was the primal [[Greek mythology|Greek]] god personifying the sky and one of the [[Greek primordial deities]]. Uranus is associated with the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]] [[Caelus]].&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, s.v. "Caelus" p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varro, ''De lingua Latina'' 5.58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marion Lawrence, "The Velletri Sarcophagus," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 69.3 (1965), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Greek literature]], Uranus or '''Father Sky''' was the son and husband of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], Mother Earth. According to [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Uranus was conceived by Gaia alone, but other sources cite [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] as his father.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alcman]], Frag 61, [[Callimachus]], Frag 498, [[Cicero]], ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft#page/328/mode/2up 3.17].&lt;/ref&gt; Uranus and Gaia were the parents of the first generation of [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s, and the ancestors of most of the Greek gods, but no [[Cult (religion)|cult]] addressed directly to Uranus survived into [[Classical times]],&lt;ref&gt;"We did not regard them as being in any way worthy of worship," [[Karl Kerenyi]], speaking for the ancient Greeks, said of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] (Kerenyi, p. 20); "with the single exception, perhaps, of Cronos; and with the exception, also, of [[Helios]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and Uranus does not appear among the usual themes of [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek painted pottery]]. Elemental Earth, Sky, and [[Styx]] might be joined, however, in a solemn invocation in [[Homeric epic]].&lt;ref&gt;As at [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:15.34-15.77 15.36 ff.], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:5.145-5.191 5.184 ff].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The most probable [[etymology]] traces the name to a [[Proto-Greek]] form *''worsanós'' (Ϝορσανός)&lt;ref&gt;Originally reconstructed in: Johann Baptist Hofmann, ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Griechischen'' (Munich: R. Oldenbourg, 1950).&lt;/ref&gt; enlarged from *''ṷorsó-'' (also found in Greek ''ouréō'' 'to urinate', [[Sanskrit]] ''varṣá'' 'rain', [[Hittite language|Hittite]] ''ṷarša-'' 'fog, mist').&lt;ref name=Beekes&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', vol. 2 (Leiden: Brill, 2009), 1128–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The basic [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root is ''*ṷérs-'' 'to rain, moisten' (also found in Greek ''eérsē'' 'dew', Sanskrit ''várṣati'' 'to rain', [[Avestan language|Avestan]] aiβi.''varəšta'' 'it rained on'), making Ouranos the 'rainmaker'.&lt;ref name="Beekes"/&gt; A less likely etymology is a [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] with meaning 'the one standing on high' from [[PIE]] *''ṷérso-'' (cf. Sanskrit ''várṣman'' 'height, top', [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] ''viršùs'' 'upper, highest seat', Russian ''verx'' 'height, top'). 
Of some importance in the comparative study of [[Indo-European mythology]] is the identification by [[Georges Dumézil]] (1934)&lt;ref name=Dumézil&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''Ouranos-Varuna – Essai de mythologie comparée indo-européenne'' (Paris: G.-P. Maisonneuve, 1934).&lt;/ref&gt; of Uranus with  the [[Vedic]] deity ''[[Varuna|Váruṇa]]'' ([[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni|Mitanni]] ''Aruna''), god of the sky and waters, but the etymological equation is considered untenable.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Mayrhofer]], ''Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen'', vol. 2, s.v. “Váruṇa” (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1996), 515–6.

==Family==

=== Genealogy ===
In Hesiod's ''[[Theogony]],'' Uranus is the offspring of Gaia, the earth goddess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D104 126 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alcman]] and [[Callimachus]] elaborate that Uranus was fathered by [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]], the god of heavenly light and the upper air. Under the influence of the philosophers, [[Cicero]], in ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' ("Concerning the Nature of the Gods"), claims that he was the offspring of the ancient gods [[Aether (mythology)|Aether]] and [[Hemera (mythology)|Hemera]], Air and Day. According to the [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic Hymns]], Uranus was the son of [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]], the personification of night.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Uranus was the brother of Pontus, the God of the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donna Jo Napoli]], "[[Treasury of Greek Mythology: Classic Stories of Gods, Goddesses, Heroes &amp; Monsters]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descendants===
According to [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', Uranus mated with Gaia, and she gave birth to the twelve [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s: [[Oceanus]], [[Coeus]], [[Crius]], [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]], [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], [[Theia]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], [[Themis]], [[Mnemosyne]], [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]], [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Cronus]];&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+132 132&amp;#x2013;138].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[cyclops|Cyclopes]]: Brontes, Steropes and [[Arges (cyclops)|Arges]];&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+139 139&amp;#x2013;146].&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hecatoncheires]] ("Hundred-Handed Ones"): Cottus, Briareos, and Gyges.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+147 147&amp;#x2013;153].&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, according to the ''Theogony'', when Cronus [[Castration|castrated]] Uranus, from Uranus' blood, which splattered onto the earth, came the [[Erinyes]] (Furies), the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Giant]]s, and the [[Meliae]]. Also, according to the ''Theogony'', Cronus threw the severed genitals into the sea, around which "a white foam spread" and "grew" into the [[goddess]] [[Aphrodite]],&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+173 173&amp;#x2013;206].&lt;/ref&gt; although according to [[Homer]], Aphrodite was the daughter of [[Zeus]]  and [[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.374 3.374], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.370 5.370&amp;#x2013;71], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:20.105 20.105], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.308 8.308], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.320 320]; see Gantz, pp. 99&amp;#x2013;100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation myth==

===Greek mythology===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
[[File:The Mutiliation of Uranus by Saturn.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Mutilation of Uranus by Saturn'': fresco by [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Cristofano Gherardi]], c. 1560 (Sala di Cosimo I, [[Palazzo Vecchio]])]]

In the Olympian creation myth, as [[Hesiod]] tells it in the ''[[Theogony]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D104 133 ff.].&lt;/ref&gt; Uranus came every night to cover the earth and mate with [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]], but he hated the children she bore him. Hesiod named their first six sons and six daughters the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]]s, the three one-hundred-handed giants the [[Hekatonkheires]], and the one-eyed giants the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]].

Uranus imprisoned Gaia's youngest children in [[Tartarus]], deep within Earth, where they caused pain to Gaia. She shaped a great flint-bladed sickle and asked her sons to [[castration|castrate]] Uranus. Only [[Cronus]], youngest and most ambitious of the Titans, was willing: he ambushed his father and castrated him, casting the severed testicles into the sea.

For this fearful deed, Uranus called his sons [[Titan (mythology)|Titanes Theoi]], or "Straining Gods."&lt;ref&gt;Modern etymology suggests that the linguistic origin of Τιτάνες lies on the pre-Greek level.&lt;/ref&gt; From the blood that spilled from Uranus onto the Earth came forth the [[Giants (Greek mythology)|Giants]], the [[Erinyes]] (the avenging Furies), the [[Meliae]] (the ash-tree [[nymph]]s), and, according to some, the [[Telchines]]. From the genitals in the sea came forth [[Aphrodite]].

The learned Alexandrian poet [[Callimachus]]&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Aitia'' ("On Origins"), from book II, fragment 43, discussed by Lane Fox, pp. 270 ff.; Lane Fox notes that Zancle was founded in the 8th century BC.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the bloodied sickle had been buried in the earth at [[Zancle]] in Sicily, but the Romanized Greek traveller [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] was informed that the sickle had been thrown into the sea from the cape near [[Boline, Achaea|Bolina]], not far from [[Argyra, Greece|Argyra]] on the coast of [[Achaea]], whereas the historian [[Timaeus (historian)|Timaeus]] located the sickle at [[Corcyra]];&lt;ref&gt;Reported by the [[scholiast]] on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''[[Argonautica]]'', 4.984, (Lane Fox, p. 274 n. 36).&lt;/ref&gt; Corcyrans claimed to be descendants of the wholly legendary [[Phaeacia]] visited by [[Odysseus]], and by circa 500 BCE one Greek mythographer, [[Acusilaus]], was claiming that the Phaeacians had sprung from the very blood of Uranus' castration.&lt;ref&gt;Acusilaus, in ''[[Fragmente der griechischen Historiker|FrGH]]'' vol. 2, fragment 4, noted by Lane Fox, p. 274 n. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

After Uranus was deposed, [[Cronus]] re-imprisoned the Hekatonkheires and Cyclopes in Tartarus. Uranus and Gaia then prophesied that Cronus in turn was destined to be overthrown by his own son, and so the Titan attempted to avoid this fate by devouring his young. [[Zeus]], through deception by his mother [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], avoided this fate.

These ancient myths of distant origins were not expressed in [[Cult (religion)|cults]] among the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenes]].&lt;ref&gt;Kerényi, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The function of Uranus was as the vanquished god of an elder time, before real time began.

After his castration, the Sky came no more to cover the Earth at night, but held to its place, and "the original begetting came to an end" (Kerényi). Uranus was scarcely regarded as anthropomorphic, aside from the genitalia in the castration myth. He was simply the sky, which was conceived by the ancients as an overarching dome or roof of bronze, held in place (or turned on an axis) by the Titan [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. In formulaic expressions in the Homeric poems ''ouranos'' is sometimes an alternative to [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] as the collective home of the gods; an obvious occurrence would be the moment in ''Iliad'' 1.495, when [[Thetis]] rises from the sea to plead with Zeus: "and early in the morning she rose up to greet Ouranos-and-Olympus and she found the son of Kronos ..."

William Sale remarks that "... '[[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]' is almost always used of &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;the home of the [[Olympian gods]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but ''ouranos'' often refers to the natural sky above us without any suggestion that the gods, collectively live there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=William Merritt |last=Sale |title=Homeric Olympus and its formulae |journal=[[American Journal of Philology]] |volume=105 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=1–28 [p. 3] |jstor=294622 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sale concluded that the earlier seat of the gods was the actual [[Mount Olympus]], from which the epic tradition by the time of Homer had transported them to the sky, ''ouranos''. By the sixth century, when a "heavenly Aphrodite" ([[Aphrodite Urania]]) was to be distinguished from the "common Aphrodite of the people", ''ouranos'' signifies purely the celestial sphere itself.

===Hurrian mythology===
The Greek creation myth is similar to the [[Hurrian]] creation myth. In Hurrian religion [[Anu]] is the sky god. His son [[Kumarbis]] bit off his genitals and spat out three deities, one of whom, [[Teshub]], later deposed Kumarbis.&lt;ref&gt;Guterbock, Hans Gustav. "Hittite Religion" in ''Forgotten Religions including some Primitive Religions" ed. Vergilius Firm. NY Philadelphia Library 1950: 88f,103f.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sumerian mythology]] and later for [[Assyria]]ns and [[Babylonians]], [[Anu]] is the sky god and represented law and order.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

It is possible that Uranus was originally an [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] god, to be identified with the [[Vedic]] [[Varuna|{{IAST|Váruṇa}}]], the supreme keeper of order who later became the god of oceans and rivers, as suggested by [[Georges Dumézil]],&lt;ref name="Dumézil"/&gt; following hints in [[Émile Durkheim]], ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life'' (1912).&lt;ref&gt;The Durkheim connection was noted by [[Arnoldo Momigliano]], "Georges Dumezil and the Trifunctional Approach to Roman Civilization", ''History and Theory'', 1984; a link between Uranus and Varuna was suggested as early as 1824 by [[Albrecht Weber]], ''Modern investigations on ancient India: A lecture delivered in Berlin March 4, 1824'', 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Dumézil's theories is that the Iranian supreme God [[Ahura Mazda]] is a development of the [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] *vouruna-*mitra.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Dumézil, ''Mitra Varuna: Essai sur deux representati'' (Paris: Gallimard, 1948). &lt;br&gt;English translation: ''Mitra-Varuna: an Essay on Two Indo-European Representations of Sovereignty'', trans. Derek Coltman (New York: Zone Books, 1988).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this divinity has also the qualities of [[Mitra]], which is the god of the falling rain.&lt;ref&gt;According to Dumézil, Varuna is the god of "masses of water", while falling rain is rather related to Mitra.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranus and Váruṇa===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}
Uranus is connected with the night sky, and [[Varuna|Váruṇa]] is the god of the sky and the celestial ocean, which is connected with the Milky Way. 

[[Georges Dumézil]] made a cautious case for the identity of Uranus and [[Vedic]] [[Varuna|{{IAST|Váruṇa}}]] at the earliest [[Proto-Indo-European society|Indo-European]] cultural level.&lt;ref name="Dumézil"/&gt; Dumézil's identification of mythic elements shared by the two figures, relying to a great extent on linguistic interpretation, but not positing a common origin, was taken up by [[Robert Graves]] and others. The identification of the name ''Ouranos'' with the [[Hindu]] Váruṇa, based in part on a posited [[PIE]] root ''*-ŭer'' with a sense of "binding"—ancient king god Váruṇa binds the wicked, ancient king god Uranus binds the Cyclopes, who had tormented him.  The most probable etymology is from [[Proto-Greek]] ''*(F)orsanόj'' (worsanos) from a PIE root ''*ers'' "to moisten, to drip" (referring to the rain).

==Cultural context of flint==
{{Greek myth (primordial-cthonic)}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The detail of the sickle's being flint rather than bronze or even iron was retained by Greek mythographers (though neglected by Roman ones). [[Knapping|Knapped flints]] as cutting edges were set in wooden or bone sickles in the late Neolithic, before the onset of the [[Bronze Age]]. Such sickles may have survived latest in ritual contexts where metal was taboo, but the detail, which was retained by classical Greeks, suggests the antiquity of the [[mytheme]].

==Planet Uranus==
{{Main|Uranus}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2016}}
The ancient Greeks and Romans knew of only five 'wandering stars' ({{lang-el|πλανήται}}, ''planētai''): [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], and [[Saturn]]. Following the discovery of a sixth planet in 1781 using a telescope, there was long-term disagreement regarding its name.  Its discoverer [[William Herschel]] named it Georgium Sidus (The Georgian Star) after his monarch George III. This was the name preferred by English astronomers, but others such as the French preferred "Herschel".  Finally, the name ''[[Uranus]]'' became accepted in the mid-19th century, as suggested by astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann Bode]] as the logical addition to the existing planets' names, since Mars (''Ares'' in Greek), Venus, and Mercury were the children of Jupiter, Jupiter (''Zeus'' in Greek) the son of Saturn, and Saturn ([[Cronus]] in Greek) the son of Uranus. What is anomalous is that, while the others take Roman names, ''Uranus'' is a name derived from Greek in contrast to the Roman [[Caelus]].

The '''Vinland map''' is claimed to be a 15th-century [[mappa mundi]] with unique information about [[Norse colonization of the Americas|Norse exploration of North America]]. It is very well known because of the publicity campaign which accompanied its revelation to the public as a "genuine" pre-Columbian map in 1965. In addition to showing [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], the map depicts a landmass south-west of [[Greenland]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] labelled as [[Vinland]] (''Vinlanda Insula'').

The map describes this region as having been visited by Europeans in the 11th century. Although it was presented to the world in 1965 with an accompanying scholarly book written by [[British Museum]] and [[Yale University]] librarians,&lt;ref name="skelton"&gt;

==History==
[[File:beinecke-speculum-hist-223r-det.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The last remnant of old ownership marks]]

The Vinland map first came to light in 1957 (three years before the discovery of the Norse site at [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in 1960), bound in a slim volume with a short medieval text called the ''Hystoria Tartarorum'' (usually called in English ''[[Ystoria Mongalorum#The Tartar Relation|The Tartar Relation]]''),  and was unsuccessfully offered to the [[British Museum]] by London book dealer Irving Davis on behalf of a Spanish-Italian dealer named Enzo Ferrajoli de Ry. Shortly afterwards, Ferrajoli sold the volume, for $3,500, to American dealer [[Laurence C. Witten II]], who offered it to his ''alma mater'', [[Yale University]]. It was initially treated with suspicion, partly because wormholes in the map and the ''Relation'' did not match. In spring 1958, however, Witten's friend Thomas Marston, a Yale librarian, acquired from London book dealer Irving Davis a dilapidated medieval copy of books 21-24 of [[Vincent of Beauvais]]'s encyclopedic ''Speculum historiale'' ("Historical Mirror"), written in two columns on a mix of parchment and paper sheets, with initial capitals left blank, which turned out to be the missing link; the wormholes showing that it had formerly had the map at its beginning and the ''Relation'' at its end. All traces of former ownership marks, except for a small part of a bright pink stamp which overlapped the writing on folio 223 of the ''Speculum'', had been removed, perhaps to avoid tax liability for the former owner (although as historian Kirsten Seaver noted many years later, stamps on random book pages indicate institutional, not private ownership).&lt;ref name="seaver"/&gt;

Unable to afford the asking price, and concerned that, ostensibly because of the former private owner's tax concerns, Witten refused to reveal the [[provenance]] of the map, Yale contacted another alumnus, [[Paul Mellon]], who agreed to buy it (for a price later stated to be about $300,000) and [[Donation|donate]] it to the university if it could be authenticated. Recognizing its potential importance as the earliest map unambiguously showing America, Mellon insisted that its existence be kept secret until a scholarly book had been written about it. Even the three authors of the book were chosen from among the small number of people who had seen the map before Mellon bought it—two [[British Museum]] curators and Marston. Only one of them, Dr. [[Raleigh Ashlin Skelton]], keeper of the Museum's map collection, had significant expertise relevant to the problems posed by the map (his colleague [[George Painter]], the first person to whom Davis had shown the map in 1957, was brought in for the transcription and translation of the ''Relation'') and the secrecy almost completely ruled out consultation with specialists.&lt;ref name="seaver"/&gt; Witten did his best to help during this period, not only answering the authors' questions, but offering suggestions of his own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Tyacke|Tyacke, Sarah]] [http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/sandars/Sandars1.pdf Sandars Lectures 2007, 1], Cambridge University, 2007, page 16&lt;/ref&gt; After years of study, the proofs of the book, ''The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation'',&lt;ref name="skelton"/&gt; were ready by the end of 1964, and Mellon donated the map to Yale. The book was published, and the map revealed to the world, the day before [[Columbus Day]], 1965. Many academic reviewers of the book took the opportunity to point out evidence that called the map's authenticity into question, so a year later, a Vinland Map Conference was held at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], during which further significant questions were asked, particularly of Witten, who gave very straightforward and helpful answers; but, the proceedings were not published for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |editor-last= Washburn |editor-first= Wilcomb E.  |title= Proceedings of the Vinland Map Conference |year= 1971 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago, IL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Vinland-map greenland.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Greenland from the Vinland Map superimposed (in green) on an early-20th-century atlas map. The [[Wikt:stipple|unstippled]] area at the northern tip represents land not surveyed until after 1896.]]

===Academic controversies, 1965–1966===

There were questions about the actual content of the map. Witten had pointed out that it bore strong resemblances to a map made in the 1430s by Italian mariner [[Andrea Bianco]], but others found some of the similarities and differences very strange—the map cuts off [[Africa]] where Bianco's map has a page fold, but distorts shapes, and includes major revisions in the far east and west. The most surprising revision is that, unlike, for example, the famous [[Cantino World Map]], the Vinland Map depicts [[Greenland]] as an island, remarkably close to the correct shape and orientation (while [[Norway]], of which Greenland was just a colony, is wildly inaccurate) although contemporary Scandinavian accounts—including the work of [[Claudius Clavus]] in the 1420s—depict Greenland as a peninsula joined to northern Russia. For practical purposes, [[Arctic ice pack|Arctic sea ice]] may have made this description true, and Greenland is not known to have been successfully circumnavigated until the 20th century. Skelton wondered also whether the revisions in the far east were meant to represent [[Japan]]—they seem to show not only [[Honshu]], but also [[Hokkaido]] and [[Sakhalin]], omitted even from Oriental maps in the 15th century.

In addition, the text uses a [[Latin]] form of [[Leif Ericson]]'s name ("Erissonius") more consistent with 17th-century norms and with transmission through a French or Italian source. The Latin captions include several usages of the [[Typographical ligature|ligature]] ''æ'';  this was almost unknown in later medieval times (a simple ''e'' was written instead), and although the ligature was revived by Italian humanist scholars in the early 15th century, it is found only in documents of deliberately classicising [[humanist minuscule]] produced by Italian scribes, and never in conjunction with a Gothic style of script such as is seen in the map.

Another point calling the map's authenticity into question was raised at the 1966 Conference: that one caption referred to Bishop Eirik of Greenland "and neighboring regions" (in Latin, "regionumque finitimarum"), a title known previously from the work of religious scholar Luka Jelic (1863–1922). An essay by British researcher [[Peter Foote]] for the ''Saga Book of the [[Viking Society for Northern Research|Viking Society]]'' (vol. 11, part 1), published shortly after the conference, noted that German researcher Richard Hennig had spent years, before the Vinland Map was revealed, fruitlessly trying to track Jelic's phrase down in medieval texts. It seemed that either Jelic had seen the Vinland Map and promised not to reveal its existence (keeping the promise so rigidly that he never mentioned any of the other new historical information on the map), or that he had invented the phrase as a scholarly description, and the Vinland Map creator copied him. In practice, because Jelic's work had gone through three editions, Foote was able to demonstrate how the first edition (in French) had adopted the concept from the work of earlier researchers, listed by Jelic, then the later editions had adapted the anachronistic French scholarly phrase "évèque régionnaire des contrées américaines" into Latin.

Handwriting experts at the 1966 Conference tended to disagree with Witten's assessment that the map captions had been written by the same person as the ''Speculum'' and ''Relation'' texts. This had also been a major reason why the British Museum had rejected the map in 1957, the Keeper of Manuscripts having detected elements of handwriting style not developed until the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="seaver"/&gt;

===Analysis of ink===
Complaints were made at the Conference that no scientist had been permitted to examine the map and its companion documents in all the years of study since 1957. Skelton's scientific colleagues at the British Museum made a short preliminary examination in 1967 and found that:

{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-alpha|
| despite its appearance to the naked eye, the ink was certainly not conventional [[iron gall ink|iron-gall ink]] like its two companion manuscripts, and indeed was unlike any recipe they had ever seen (they spent several months after the initial testing, trying to find similar inks as far afield as Iceland);
| the map outline appeared to consist of two superimposed lines, one black (but mostly vanished) which looked like graphite or soot, and one yellowish;
| the whole of the map [[parchment]] (again, unlike its companions) had been coated or soaked in an unknown substance—they were not allowed to take a large enough sample to analyze it;
| they could not be certain that the two halves of the map, held together by a binding strip glued on the back, had ever been a single sheet—unlike any other known medieval double-page map; looking at the map, it is clear that the artist knew exactly, to the nearest millimeter, where it was going to be folded, because several place-names start or finish right next to it while none are written straight across it, and the rivers of eastern Europe run parallel to it;
| the rebinding of the ''Speculum'' volume without the map and ''Relation'' had used plastic thread, only available since about 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1972, with new technology becoming available, Yale sent the map for chemical analysis by forensic specialist [[Walter McCrone]] whose team, using a variety of techniques, found that the yellowish lines contain [[anatase]] (titanium dioxide) in a rounded crystalline form manufactured for use in pale pigments since the 1920s, indicating that the ink was modern. They also confirmed that the ink contained only trace amounts of iron, and that the black line remnants were on top of the yellow, indicating that they were not the remains of a penciled guide-line, as the British Museum staff had speculated.&lt;ref name="mcr1"&gt;

A new investigation in the early 1980s, by a team under Dr. Thomas Cahill at the [[University of California, Davis]], using [[Particle-Induced X-ray Emission]] (PIXE) found that only trace amounts (&lt;&amp;nbsp;0.0062% by weight) of titanium appeared to be present in the ink,&lt;ref name=cahill85&gt;

One member of the team, Gregory Möller, also analyzed loose particles retrieved from the split down the middle of the map by a different method, finding that most of them were rich in titanium (though a few black particles were rich in chromium and iron).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Möller, "Preliminary Report on the Scanning Electron Microscope Analysis of Particles from the Vinland Map", unpublished&lt;/ref&gt; Because they were the first to apply PIXE to ink analysis, nobody at the time could explain the difference between the Cahill and McCrone figures. Attempting to reconcile the conflicting results, the Cahill team suggested that the high concentrations found by McCrone were due to a combination of contamination from modern dust, and poor sample selection (i.e. choosing contaminant particles like those in the split);&lt;ref&gt;Skelton et al. (1995) pages xxix-xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; however, they also chose not to publish or publicise Möller's loose particle study.&lt;ref&gt;

The McCrone team had also made mistakes, though none as fundamental as Cahill's. Revisiting his notes in 1987 to draft a detailed reply to the abbreviated public version of Cahill's report, Walter McCrone chose the wrong sample to illustrate a "typical" black ink particle, selecting one which had been found only loosely attached to the ink.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1991, McCrone visited Yale to take new microsamples from the map, partly to check his earlier results, and partly to apply new techniques. Photomicrographs taken at 1 [[micrometer (unit)|micrometer]] intervals through the thickness of ink samples demonstrated that the manufactured [[anatase]] particles were not just sticking to the surface as Cahill's criticisms had implied, and [[Fourier transform spectroscopy]] identified the ink's binder as gelatin, probably made from animal skin.&lt;ref&gt;

Various scientists have formed their own theories to explain how the "20th century manufactured" anatase in the Vinland Map ink could have got into genuine medieval ink. The first was chemist Jacqueline Olin, then a researcher with the Smithsonian Institution, who in the 1970s conducted experiments which produced anatase at an early stage of a medieval iron-gall ink production process. Examination of her anatase by a colleague, mineralogist Dr Kenneth Towe, showed that it was very different from the neat, rounded crystals found in the Vinland Map and modern pigments.&lt;ref name="towe90"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towe himself, a clay specialist, briefly considered the possibility that the anatase could have come from clay, where it is present in trace amounts, but on checking McCrone's data found no significant traces of clay minerals. Shortly before the Raman analysis was published, historian Douglas McNaughton based a mistaken theory about the ink around McCrone's emphasis on the chromium-rich black particle, having obtained unpublished data on the similar particles in Möller's report.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Olin published a paper that identifies the anatase in the Vinland Map ink as being truncated bi-pyramidal rather than rounded crystals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olin |first=J.S. |year=2013 |title=The Vinland Map: Transmission Electron Micrograph of the Ink |journal=International Journal of Advances in Chemistry |volume=1 |number=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (however, this is not vastly different from the McCrones' 1974 description of the crystals as "smooth, rounded rhomb shapes"&lt;ref name="mcr1"/&gt;).

===Dating of parchment===
[[Radiocarbon dating]], begun in 1995 by physicist Douglass Donahue and chemists Jacqueline Olin and Garman Harbottle, places the origin of the [[parchment]] somewhere between 1423 and 1445. The initial results were confusing because the unknown substance the British Museum had found across the whole map, effectively ignored by later researchers who were concentrating on the ink, turned out to be trapping tiny traces of [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] deep within the parchment from 1950s [[nuclear tests]]. Although there is none of this 1950s substance on top of the ink, further tests, starting with a detailed chemical analysis, are needed to confirm whether the lines were drawn after it soaked into the parchment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Donahue, D. J. |author2=Olin, J.

In 2008, Harbottle's attempt to explain a possible medieval origin for the ink was published, but he was shown by Towe and others to have misunderstood the significance of the various analyses, rendering his theory meaningless.&lt;ref name=towe08/&gt;&lt;ref name=brownclark/&gt;

==="VMTR 95"===
The expanded 30th anniversary edition of the 1965 official book, ''The Vinland Map and the Tartar Relation'', was notable for its exclusion of most of the evidence against the map's authenticity, concentrating instead on vindications by George Painter, and Thomas Cahill with colleague Bruce Kusko (in which they claimed specifically that they had not analyzed the loose particles they took from the map at the time of their PIXE research), but it did reprint a remarkable essay written in 1989 by the original book dealer Laurence Witten. He stated that, when the McCrone investigation concluded the map to be a forgery in 1974, he was asked by Yale to reveal its provenance as a matter of urgency, and to discuss the possible return of Mr Mellon's money. He replied that he had no idea where the map came from, beyond Ferrajoli (who was convicted of theft shortly after the sale, and died shortly after release from prison). On the subject of the money, he said he could not pay it all back because he had paid agreed shares of his profit to Ferrajoli and to another dealer who had introduced him. For his part, Mellon did not ask for the return of any money. The essay also revealed that Witten had, on Ferrajoli's recommendation, met with Irving Davis after buying the map volume in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Skelton et al. (1995) pages lvi-lvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the controversy, the map, which had been valued for insurance purposes at over $750,000 in the 1960s, was claimed in 1996 to be worth $25,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/13/science/disputed-medieval-map-called-genuine-after-all.html?scp=2&amp;sq=vinland%20map&amp;st=cse John Noble, Wilford, ''Disputed Medieval Map Called Genuine After All'', New York Times, Feb. 13, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservation===
In 2005 a team from the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], led by Dr. René Larsen, studied the map and its accompanying manuscripts to make recommendations on the best ways to preserve the centuries-old parchment.&lt;ref name="larsen1"&gt;René Larsen &amp; Dorte V. Poulsen, [http://www.maphist.nl/papers/vinland051220.pdf Report on the Assessment and Survey ... of the Vinland Map ...] web version, Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Among other findings, this study confirmed that the two halves of the map were entirely separate, though they might have been joined in the past. A few months earlier, Kirsten Seaver had suggested that a forger could have found two separate blank leaves in the original "Speculum Historiale" volume, from which the first few dozen pages appeared to be missing, and joined them together with the binding strip.&lt;ref name="seaver"/&gt; On the other hand, at the International Conference on the History of Cartography in July 2009, Larsen revealed that his team had continued their investigation after publishing their original report, and he told the press that "All the tests that we have done over the past five years — on the materials and other aspects — do not show any signs of forgery".&lt;ref name=larsen&gt;{{cite web |title= Vinland Map of America no forgery, expert says|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE56G58320090717|date= 17 July 2009|work= reuters.com|publisher= Reuters|accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formal report of his presentation&lt;ref name=larsen2/&gt; shows that his work ignores rather than contradicts earlier studies. For example, he experimented only with artificial wormholes, and did not follow up the observation made at the 1966 Conference, that live bookworms were a known tool of the fake antiquities trade. Similarly, he claimed that the anatase in the ink could have come from sand used to dry it (the hypothetical source of the sand being [[gneiss]] from the [[Binnenthal]] area of [[Switzerland]]) but his team had not examined the crystals microscopically, and Kenneth Towe responded that this was an essential test, given that crystal size and shape should clearly distinguish commercial anatase from anatase found in sand.&lt;ref&gt;Borrell, Brendan [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=vinland-map-could-be-authentic&amp;posted=1 Pre-Columbian Map of North America Could Be Authentic--Or not], ''Scientific American'' (2008-07-22)&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the Danish team later joined with others to perform microanalyses of the remaining piece from the 1995 carbon dating sample. They found a significant quantity of monostearin ([[Glycerol monostearate]]) which is commonly used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, with additional aromatic compounds; if it is not purely localised contamination from handling by somebody using something like hand lotion, this is likely to be the mystery post-1950 chemical soaked into the parchment. Their microscopic examination confirmed that the parchment had been treated very roughly at some time, with 95% of fibres damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sommer |first1=Dorte V.

==Yale's position on the map==
As controversy has swirled around the map almost since its acquisition, authorities at Yale University chose not to comment on the authenticity of the parchment document, other than to say they watch the debate with unusual interest. "We regard ourselves as the custodians of an extremely interesting and controversial document," said Yale librarian Alice Prochaska in 2002, "and we watch the scholarly work on it with great interest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_10/l_v.html Vinland Map Flap Redux, Yale Alumni Magazine, October 2002] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114130724/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/02_10/l_v.html |date=2012-11-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Yale's Chester D.

At the 2018 Vinland Map Symposium, Yale conservation scientist Richard Hark revealed the results of new global chemical analyses of the Map and the Tartar Relation, which established, among many other things, that the ink lines of the Map contain varying amounts of anatase "consistent with modern manufacture". So too do two small patches on the first page of the Tartar Relation, where the original iron-gall ink appears to have been erased and replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Richard Hark |date=21 Sep 2018 |title=The Vinland Map Rediscovered symposium |medium=recorded livestream |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1YXS8dbY2I&amp;t=20353 |access-date=22 Sep 2018 |location=Mystic Seaport, CT |publisher=Mystic Seaport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Washington Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art''', formally the '''Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art''' and sometimes referred to as the '''Washington Declaration''' is a statement concerning the restitution of art confiscated by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime in Germany]] before and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rt/hlcst/270431.htm|title=Washington Conference Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in connection with the Washington Conference on Holocaust Era Assets, held in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on 3 December 1998.&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

== The Conference ==

The conference was hosted by the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref name="USF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/index.HTM |title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |date= |accessdate=4 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It assembled participants from a 1995 New York symposium, [[The Spoils of War (symposium)|The Spoils of War—World War II and Its Aftermath: The Loss, Reappearance, and Recovery of Cultural Property]], along with others,&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; and built on the Nazi Gold conference which had been held in [[London]] in December 1997.&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt;

The 1998 conference's aim was to discuss Jewish losses in particular, including artworks, books, and archives, as well as insurance claims and other types of assets.&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; 44 governments, including the [[German reunification|reunified Germany]], sent delegates,&lt;ref name="Eizenstat 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/heac.htm |title=05/20/99: Eizenstat Briefing on Holocaust-Era Assets Conference |last=Eizenstat |first=Stuart E. |work=[[University of South Florida]] |date=20 May 1999 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did thirteen international non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; The conference organizer was the U.S. [[Under Secretary of State for Economic, Business, and Agricultural Affairs]], [[Stuart E. Eizenstat]],&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; who had previously been [[United States Ambassador to the European Union]],&lt;ref name="Covington"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cov.com/seizenstat/|title=Stuart E. Eizenstat|publisher=Covington &amp; Burling|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its chairman was Judge [[Abner Mikva]].&lt;ref name="Eizenstat 2" /&gt; U.S. [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], [[Madeleine Albright]] gave the opening address.&lt;ref name="Albright"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/981201.htm|title=The Washington Conference on Holocaust-Era Assets|last=Albright|first=Madeleine K.|date=1 December 1998|publisher=[[University of South Florida]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Principles ==

The statement includes eleven numbered principles, prefixed:&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

{{Quote|In developing a consensus on non-binding principles to assist in resolving issues relating to Nazi-confiscated art, the Conference recognizes that among participating nations there are differing legal systems and that countries act within the context of their own laws.}}

The principles are:&lt;ref name="Statement" /&gt;

# Art that had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted should be identified.
# Relevant records and archives should be open and accessible to researchers, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Council on Archives.
# Resources and personnel should be made available to facilitate the identification of all art that had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted.
# In establishing that a work of art had been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted, consideration should be given to unavoidable gaps or ambiguities in the provenance in light of the passage of time and the circumstances of the Holocaust era.
# Every effort should be made to publicize art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted in order to locate its pre-War owners or their heirs.
# Efforts should be made to establish a central registry of such information.
# Pre-War owners and their heirs should be encouraged to come forward and make known their claims to art that was confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted.
# If the pre-War owners of art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis and not subsequently restituted, or their heirs, can be identified, steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution, recognizing this may vary according to the facts and circumstances surrounding a specific case.
# If the pre-War owners of art that is found to have been confiscated by the Nazis, or their heirs, can not be identified, steps should be taken expeditiously to achieve a just and fair solution.
# Commissions or other bodies established to identify art that was confiscated by the Nazis and to assist in addressing ownership issues should have a balanced membership.
# Nations are encouraged to develop national processes to implement these principles, particularly as they relate to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for resolving ownership issues.

The Principles were outlined by Eizenstat, along with "Declarations of the Task Force for International Cooperation on Holocaust Education, Remembrance, and Research."&lt;ref name="USF" /&gt; He also gave a statement at the conference, titled ''In Support of Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art'', saying:&lt;ref name="Eizenstat"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/resource/assets/art.htm|title=12/03/98: Eizenstat -- Principles on Nazi-Confiscated Art|last=Eizenstat|first=Stuart E.|date=3 December 1998|publisher=[[University of South Florida]]|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote| Several weeks ago, we prepared a discussion paper of 11 general principles, which was used as the basis of extensive consultations and which all of you have today. These principles are not, in themselves, a solution. They are a means by which nations can fashion their own solutions consistent with their own legal systems. The principles try to capture the spirit of this conference for nations engaging in this task.

If these principles are properly applied, the discovery of Nazi-confiscated art will no longer be a matter of chance. Instead, there will be an organized international effort -- voluntary in nature but backed by a strong moral commitment -- to search provenance and uncover stolen art. This effort will be undertaken by governments, NGOs, museums, auctioneers and dealers. }}

The early decades of his professional career were spent as a member of the [[East Germany|East German]] historical establishment:  the focus of much of his work was on the history of the labour movement.

== Life ==
Wolfgang Schröder was born in [[Dresden]] just over two years after the [[Nazi Party]] [[Machtergreifung|took power]] in Germany, and just under ten years before the central portion of the city [[Bombing of Dresden|was destroyed]] during the final months of the [[Second World War]].

He passed his [[Abitur|school final exams (''Abitur'')]] in 1953, which opened the way to university-level education.   He studied [[History]] at the [[Leipzig University|Karl Marx University (as it had recently been renamed)]] in [[Leipzig]] between 1953 and 1957.   That year he passed the state exams entitling him to work as a secondary school teacher, and for a year he worked as a [[:de:Oberschule|secondary school]] teacher.

In 1958 he became a research assistant at the "1871–1917 department" at the Leipzig branch of the Institute for History of the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].   He received his doctorate in July 1963, supervised by [[Ernst Engelberg]] and [[:de:Lothar Mosler|Lothar Mosler]].  His subject was the German Trades Union movement in the 1890s.   A peculiar feature of the East German university system - taking a lead from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] system - was the  [[:de:Promotion B|Promotion B (loosely ''"Doctorate B"'')]], which in terms of building an academic career (though not, protagonists insist, in other respects) took the place of a [[Habilitation]] qualification.   Schröder received his [[:de:Promotion B|Promotion B]] in 1972 for work on the Labour Movement in the final third of the nineteenth century.

Between 1969 and 1990 he was employed as editor responsible for the "Jahrbuch für Geschichte" (''[East German] History Yearbook'').  From 1973 he was also a member of its editorial college.   In 1976 he relocated from [[Leipzig]] to [[East Berlin]] when he switched to working as a researcher at the Central/National Historical Institute at the [[German Academy of Sciences at Berlin|German Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].   It was here, in 1986, that he received the title of "professor".

Following [[Die Wende|the changes of 1989/]][[East German general election, 1990|1990]],  from 1992 till 1996 Schröder worked as an assistant at the [[Bonn]] based [[:de:Kommission für Geschichte des Parlamentarismus und der politischen Parteien|Commission for the history of parliamentarianism and political parties [in Germany]]].&lt;ref name="Retallack2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=James N. Retallack|title=Saxony in German History: Culture, Society, and Politics, 1830-1933| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf7XvOLaXnwC&amp;pg=PA377|year=2000|publisher=University of Michigan Press| isbn=0-472-11104-3| page=377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schröder's main research area was the history of the later nineteenth century, with a particular focus on the German labour movement.   He published an article on Ernestine Liebknecht (1989) and an essay on Nathalie Liebknecht (1990)

After publishing a book on Ernestine Liebknecht (1897, 2nd ed., 1989) and an essay on Nathalie Liebknecht (1990),&lt;ref name=WSlautHH/&gt; his crowning academic achievement was to have been his biography of [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] (1826-1990), a pioneer of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], and the father of [[Karl Liebknecht]] (1871 - 1919).   Unfortunately, when Wolfgang Schröder died at [[Taucha]] (near [[Leipzig]]) in 2010,&lt;ref name=WSlautHR/&gt; the biography remained unfinished.   However, the project was well progressed, and three years later his widow, Renate Dreßler-Schröder and the historian [[:de:Klaus Kinner|Klaus Kinner]] were able to publish a version of it in 2013 as part of Schröder's literary legacy.   No attempt was made to gloss over the fragmentary nature of the work, but it nevertheless contained a large amount of new research involving hitherto overlooked sources.&lt;ref name=WSlautHR/&gt;
