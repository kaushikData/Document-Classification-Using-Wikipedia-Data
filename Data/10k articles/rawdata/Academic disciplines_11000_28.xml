      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10208">'''6D BIM''', an acronym for 6D [[Building Information Modeling]] and a term widely used in the [[Construction]] industry, refers to the intelligent linking of individual [[3D CAD]] components or assemblies with all aspects of project life-cycle management information.&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-01/&gt;&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-02/&gt;&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-04/&gt;&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-07/&gt; 

The 6D model is usually delivered to the owner when a construction project is finished. The "As-Built" BIM model is populated with relevant building component information such as product data and details, maintenance/operation manuals, cut sheet specifications, photos, warranty data, web links to product online sources, manufacturer information and contacts, etc. This database is made accessible to the users/owners through a customized proprietary web-based environment. This is intended to aid facilities managers in the operation and maintenance of the facility.&lt;ref name=6DBIM-R-06/&gt;

The term is less commonly used in the UK and has been replaced with reference to the Asset Information Requirements (AIR) and an Asset Information Model (AIM) as specified in PAS1192-3:2014.
In some fora, the life-cycle management aspect is considered the 7th dimension, and energy, environmental, and sustainability aspects are labelled as the 6th dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theory of Evolution BIM 3D-7D|url=https://bimestimate.eu/en/the-theory-of-evolution-bim-3d-7d/|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIM 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D|url=http://www.bimpanzee.com/bim-3d-4d--5d--6d---7d.html|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3372">The '''Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna''' ('''ANITA''') experiment has been designed to study [[Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray|ultra-high-energy]] (UHE) cosmic [[neutrino]]s by detecting the radio pulses emitted by their interactions with the [[Antarctic]] ice sheet. This is to be accomplished using an array of radio antennas suspended from a [[high altitude balloon|helium balloon]] flying at a height of about 37,000 meters.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ANITA-4 prior to launch.jpg|thumb|The ANITA-IV experiment in Antarctica, prior to being launched on a balloon.]]

The neutrinos, with energies on the order of [[Orders of magnitude (energy)#10-1|10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV]], produce radio pulses in the ice because of the [[Askaryan effect]]. It is thought that these high-energy cosmic neutrinos result from interaction of [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray|ultra-high-energy]] (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;eV) [[cosmic ray]]s with the photons of the [[CMB|cosmic microwave background radiation]]. It is thus hoped that the ANITA experiment can shed light on the origin of these cosmic rays.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental time frame ==
ANITA-I launched from [[McMurdo Station|McMurdo]], [[Antarctica]] in the summer of 2006-07.
The array should travel around the continent with the circumpolar winds for approximately a month before being recovered by the [[Columbia_Scientific_Balloon_Facility|CSBF]]. Each successive mission (if funded) would be at two year intervals. ANITA-II, a modified instrument with 40 antennas, launched from McMurdo Station in the summer of 2008-2009.  ANITA-III, expected to improve sensitivity by a factor of 5-10, launched in December 2014. 

ANITA-IV launched in December 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |title=CSBF: Payload monitoring ANITA-IV
 |url=https://www.csbf.nasa.gov/map/balloon7/flight675n.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a lighter overall build, tunable notch filters and an improved trigger system.

== Funding ==
ANITA is currently being funded by [[NASA]].

== Collaborators ==
The current ANITA collaboration team includes members from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]], [[University of California, Los Angeles]], [[The Ohio State University]], [[The University of Delaware]], [[The University of Kansas]], [[Washington University]], the NASA [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], [[University College London]], [[University of Chicago]],  [[National Taiwan University]] and the [[California Polytechnic State University]].

Resistance arises through one of three mechanisms: natural resistance in certain types of bacteria, genetic [[mutation]], or by one species acquiring resistance from another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|title=General Background: About Antibiotic Resistance|website=www.tufts.edu|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023035356/http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/about_antibioticres.shtml|archive-date=23 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All classes of microbes can develop resistance. Fungi develop [[antifungal]] resistance. [[Virus]]es develop [[antiviral]] resistance. [[Protozoa]] develop [[antiprotozoal]] resistance, and [[bacteria]] develop [[antibiotic]] resistance. Resistance can appear spontaneously because of random mutations. However, extended use of antimicrobials appears to encourage selection for mutations which can render antimicrobials ineffective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The WHO defines antimicrobial resistance as a microorganism's resistance to an antimicrobial drug that was once able to treat an infection by that microorganism.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt;
A person cannot become resistant to antibiotics. Resistance is a property of the microbe, not a person or other organism infected by a microbe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|title=CDC: Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Cdc.gov|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429180658/http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#antibiotic-resistance-concerns|archive-date=29 April 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasons for the widespread use of antibiotics in human medicine include:

Because individuals may feel better before the infection is eradicated, doctors must provide instructions to them so they know when it is safe to stop taking a prescription.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem among humans and wildlife in terrestrial or aquatic environments.

Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; The contribution of the pharmaceutical industry is so significant that parallels can be drawn between countries with highest rate of increasing antibiotic resistance and countries with largest footprint of pharmaceutical industry. China, which contributes to nearly 90 per cent of the world's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing, has seen a 22 per cent increase in rate of antimicrobial resistance in six years, compared to a 6 per cent increase in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yezli S, Li H | title = Antibiotic resistance amongst healthcare-associated pathogens in China | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 389–97 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 22999767 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2012.07.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment. Already in 2011, mapping of sewage and water supply samples in [[New Delhi]] showed widespread and uncontrolled infection as indicated by the presence of NDM-1-positive enteric bacteria ([[New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1]]).&lt;ref name="Walsh_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh TR, Weeks J, Livermore DM, Toleman MA | title = Dissemination of NDM-1 positive bacteria in the New Delhi environment and its implications for human health: an environmental point prevalence study | journal = The Lancet.

As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter water bodies through wastewater replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. In addition, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic-resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure.&lt;ref name="Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171" /&gt; Antibiotic resistance is widespread in marine vertebrates, and they may be important reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the [[Marine ecosystem|marine environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rose JM, Gast RJ, Bogomolni A, Ellis JC, Lentell BJ, Touhey K, Moore M | title = Occurrence and patterns of antibiotic resistance in vertebrates off the Northeastern United States coast | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 421–31 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19187217 | pmc = 5444207 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00648.x | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
[[File:Antibioticresistance diagram.png|thumb|350px|Mission Critical: Preventing Antibiotic Resistance (CDC report, 2014)|alt=Infographic from CDC report on preventing antibiotic resistance]]

There have been increasing public calls for global collective action to address the threat, including a proposal for international treaty on antimicrobial resistance. Further detail and attention is still needed in order to recognize and measure trends in resistance on the international level; the idea of a global tracking system has been suggested but implementation has yet to occur. A system of this nature would provide insight to areas of high resistance as well as information necessary for evaluation of programs and other changes made to fight or reverse antibiotic resistance.

===Duration of antibiotics===
Antibiotic treatment duration should be based on the infection and other health problems a person may have.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- "When optimising therapy for an infection consider the person’s immune status, the infecting agent and the focus of infection." --&gt; For many infections once a person has improved there is little evidence that stopping treatment causes more resistance.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  "There does not appear to be strong evidence to support the notion that stopping antibiotics before the end of the recommended treatment contributes to increasing resistance" --&gt; Some therefore feel that stopping early may be reasonable in some cases.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!--  "Therefore, in selected cases, it may be appropriate to stop antibiotic therapy early." --&gt; Other infections, however, do require long courses regardless of whether a person feels better.&lt;ref name=NPS2013/&gt;&lt;!-- "For some infections, such as Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia, enterococcal endocarditis or tuberculosis, clear evidence favours prolonged treatment to prevent relapse" --&gt;

===Monitoring and mapping===
There are multiple national and international monitoring programs for drug-resistant threats, including [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']] (VRSA), [[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]] (ESBL), [[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']] (VRE), [[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'']] (MRAB).&lt;ref name="CDC2013"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|title=Biggest Threats - Antibiotic/Antimicrobial Resistance - CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-05-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912115220/https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest_threats.html|archive-date=12 September 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all|date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limiting antibiotic use ===
{{Further|Antibiotic misuse}}
[[Antibiotic stewardship programme]]s appear useful in reducing rates of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref name="pmid28629876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baur D, Gladstone BP, Burkert F, Carrara E, Foschi F, Döbele S, Tacconelli E | title = Effect of antibiotic stewardship on the incidence of infection and colonisation with antibiotic-resistant bacteria and Clostridium difficile infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = The Lancet. Infectious Diseases | volume = 17 | issue = 9 | pages = 990–1001 | date = September 2017 | pmid = 28629876 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(17)30325-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease.&lt;ref name=Andersson2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersson DI, Hughes D | title = Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 35 | issue = 5 | pages = 901–11 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21707669 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause of rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed individuals who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In an analysis of drug prescriptions, 36% of individuals with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Gilberg2003&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, Isonaka S | title = Analysis of medication use patterns:apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF | journal = Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 232–7 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14613466 | doi = 10.18553/jmcp.2003.9.3.232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increasing the risk of further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

==== At the hospital level ====
[[Antimicrobial stewardship]] teams in hospitals are encouraging optimal use of antimicrobials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doron S, Davidson LE | title = Antimicrobial stewardship | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 1113–23 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 22033257 | pmc = 3203003 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2011.0358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals of antimicrobial stewardship are to help practitioners pick the right drug at the right dose and duration of therapy while preventing misuse and minimizing the development of resistance. Stewardship may reduce the length of stay by an average of slightly over 1 day while  not increasing the risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davey P, Marwick CA, Scott CL, Charani E, McNeil K, Brown E, Gould IM, Ramsay CR, Michie S | title = Interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for hospital inpatients | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD003543 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28178770 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd003543.pub4 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== At the level of GP ====
Given the volume of care provided in primary care (General Practice), recent strategies have focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing in this setting. Simple interventions, such as written information explaining the futility of antibiotics for common infections such as upper respiratory tract infections, have been shown to reduce antibiotic prescribing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan JW, Harvey RT, Glasziou PP, McCullough A | title = Written information for patients (or parents of child patients) to reduce the use of antibiotics for acute upper respiratory tract infections in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD011360 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27886368 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011360.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prescriber should closely adhere to the five rights of drug administration: the right patient, the right drug, the right dose, the right route, and the right time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|title=The Five Rights of Medication Administration|website=www.ihi.org|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024101457/http://www.ihi.org/resources/pages/improvementstories/fiverightsofmedicationadministration.aspx|archive-date=24 October 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultures should be taken before treatment when indicated and treatment potentially changed based on the susceptibility report.&lt;ref name="CDC Mission" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Leekha S, Terrell CL, Edson RS | title = General principles of antimicrobial therapy | journal = Mayo Clinic Proceedings | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–67 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21282489 | pmc = 3031442 | doi = 10.4065/mcp.2010.0639 | url = http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)60140-7/pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About a third of antibiotic prescriptions written in [[Patient#Outpatients and inpatients|outpatient settings]] in the United States were not appropriate in 2010 and 2011. Doctors in the U.S. wrote 506 annual antibiotic scripts for every 1,000 people, with 353 being medically necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fleming-Dutra KE, Hersh AL, Shapiro DJ, Bartoces M, Enns EA, File TM, Finkelstein JA, Gerber JS, Hyun DY, Linder JA, Lynfield R, Margolis DJ, May LS, Merenstein D, Metlay JP, Newland JG, Piccirillo JF, Roberts RM, Sanchez GV, Suda KJ, Thomas A, Woo TM, Zetts RM, Hicks LA | title = Prevalence of Inappropriate Antibiotic Prescriptions Among US Ambulatory Care Visits, 2010-2011 | journal = JAMA | volume = 315 | issue = 17 | pages = 1864–73 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27139059 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.4151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health workers and pharmacists can help tackle resistance by: enhancing infection prevention and control; only prescribing and dispensing antibiotics when they are truly needed; prescribing and dispensing the right antibiotic(s) to treat the illness.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

==== At the individual level ====
People can help tackle resistance by using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor; completing the full prescription, even if they feel better; never sharing antibiotics with others or using leftover prescriptions.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

====Country examples====
* The [[Netherlands]] has the lowest rate of antibiotic prescribing in the [[OECD]], at a rate of 11.4 defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 people per day in 2011. 
* [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] also have lower prescribing rates, with Sweden's rate having been declining since 2007. 
* [[Greece]], [[France]] and [[Belgium]] have high prescribing rates of more than 28 DDD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing#vis-ref_585|title=Indicator: Antibiotic prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=Nuffield Trust &amp; Health Foundation|access-date=16 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114213112/http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/indicator/antibiotic-prescribing#vis-ref_585|archive-date=14 January 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water, sanitation, hygiene ===
Infectious disease control through improved [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)]] infrastructure needs to be included in the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) agenda. The "Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance" stated in 2018 that "the spread of pathogens through unsafe water results in a high burden of gastrointestinal disease, increasing even further the need for antibiotic treatment."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;IACG (2018) [http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/IACG_Optimize_use_of_antimicrobials_120718.pdf?ua=1 Reduce unintentional exposure and the need for antimicrobials, and optimize their use IACG Discussion Paper], Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance, [http://www.who.int/antimicrobial-resistance/interagency-coordination-group/public-consultation-discussion-papers/en/ public consultation process] at WHO, Geneva, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly a problem in [[developing countries]] where the spread of infectious diseases caused by inadequate WASH standards is a major driver of antibiotic demand.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; Growing usage of antibiotics together with persistent infectious disease levels have led to a dangerous cycle in which reliance on antimicrobials increases while the efficacy of drugs diminishes.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; The proper use of infrastructure for water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) can result in a 47–72 percent decrease of diarrhea cases treated with antibiotics depending on the type of intervention and its effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; A reduction of the diarrhea disease burden through improved infrastructure would result in large decreases in the number of diarrhea cases treated with antibiotics. This was estimated as ranging from 5 million in Brazil to up to 590 million in India by the year 2030.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; The strong link between increased consumption and resistance indicates that this will directly mitigate the accelerating spread of AMR.&lt;ref name="Araya" /&gt; Sanitation and water for all by 2030 is [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Goal Number 6]] of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].

An increase in [[hand washing]] compliance by hospital staff results in decreased rates of resistant organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swoboda SM, Earsing K, Strauss K, Lane S, Lipsett PA | title = Electronic monitoring and voice prompts improve hand hygiene and decrease nosocomial infections in an intermediate care unit | journal = Critical Care Medicine | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 358–63 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14758148 | doi = 10.1097/01.CCM.0000108866.48795.0F | ref = harv }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in health facilities offer significant co-benefits for combatting AMR, and investment should be increased.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is much room for improvement: WHO and UNICEF estimated in 2015 that globally 38% of health facilities did not have a source of water, nearly 19% had no toilets and 35% had no water and soap or alcohol-based hand rub for handwashing.&lt;ref&gt;WHO, UNICEF (2015).

In 1997, European Union health ministers voted to ban [[avoparcin]] and four additional antibiotics used to promote animal growth in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Casewell M, Friis C, Marco E, McMullin P, Phillips I | title = The European ban on growth-promoting antibiotics and emerging consequences for human and animal health | journal = The Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 2 | pages = 159–61 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12837737 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkg313 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a ban on the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castanon JI | title = History of the use of antibiotic as growth promoters in European poultry feeds | journal = Poultry Science | volume = 86 | issue = 11 | pages = 2466–71 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 17954599 | doi = 10.3382/ps.2007-00249 | ref = harv }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scandinavia, there is evidence that the ban has led to a lower [[prevalence]] of antibiotic resistance in (nonhazardous) animal bacterial populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bengtsson B, Wierup M | title = Antimicrobial resistance in Scandinavia after ban of antimicrobial growth promoters | journal = Animal Biotechnology | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–56 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17127526 | doi = 10.1080/10495390600956920 | ref = harv }}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, several European countries established a decline of antimicrobial resistance in humans through limiting the usage antimicrobials in agriculture and food industries without jeopardizing animal health or economic cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Angulo FJ, Baker NL, Olsen SJ, Anderson A, Barrett TJ | title = Antimicrobial use in agriculture: controlling the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans | journal = Seminars in Pediatric Infectious Diseases | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 78–85 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15185190 | doi = 10.1053/j.spid.2004.01.010 | url = https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1045187004000111 | access-date = 4 March 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180602155635/https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1045187004000111 | archive-date = 2 June 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in humans and in a more limited fashion in animals.&lt;ref name="gao"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|title=GAO-11-801, Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|publisher=gao.gov|access-date=2014-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105120254/http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|archive-date=5 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states.
In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. Legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006.&lt;ref name="Nelson-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson JM, Chiller TM, Powers JH, Angulo FJ | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17342653 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007. However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

===Global action plans and awareness===

The increasing interconnectedness of the world and the fact that new classes of antibiotics have not been developed and approved for more than 25 years highlight the extent to which antimicrobial resistance is a global health challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/health/focus-on-antimicrobial-resistance.html|title=RAND Europe Focus on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)|website=www.rand.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180421004546/https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/health/focus-on-antimicrobial-resistance.html|archive-date=21 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A global action plan to tackle the growing problem of resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines was endorsed at the Sixty-eighth World Health Assembly in May 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf|title=GLOBAL ACTION PLAN ON ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE|last=WHO|first=|date=|website=|access-date=November 14, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031170522/http://www.wpro.who.int/entity/drug_resistance/resources/global_action_plan_eng.pdf|archive-date=31 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key objectives of the plan is to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education and training.

==== Antibiotic Awareness Week ====
The World Health Organization has promoted the first World Antibiotic Awareness Week running from 16–22 November 2015. The aim of the week is to increase global awareness of antibiotic resistance. It also wants to promote the correct usage of antibiotics across all fields in order to prevent further instances of antibiotic resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|title=World Antibiotic Awareness Week|website=World Health Organization|access-date=20 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120222039/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/2015/world-antibiotic-awareness-week/event/en/|archive-date=20 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

World Antibiotic Awareness Week has been held every November since 2015.

==Mechanisms and organisms==

===Fundamentals===
[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.|alt=Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site]]

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004"&gt;[Criswell, Daniel. "The "Evolution" of Antibiotic Resistance." Institute for Creation Research. N.p., 2004. Web. 28 Oct. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of target- or binding site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connell SR, Tracz DM, Nierhaus KH, Taylor DE | title = Ribosomal protection proteins and their mechanism of tetracycline resistance | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 47 | issue = 12 | pages = 3675–81 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14638464 | pmc = 296194 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.47.12.3675-3681.2003 | url = http://aac.asm.org/content/47/12/3675 | access-date = 14 June 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180601200938/http://aac.asm.org/content/47/12/3675 | archive-date = 1 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acid]]s in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henry|first=Richard J.|date=December 1943|title=THE MODE OF ACTION OF SULFONAMIDES *|pmc=440870|journal=Bacteriological Reviews|volume=7|issue=4|pages=175–262|issn=0005-3678|pmid=16350088}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li XZ, Nikaido H | title = Efflux-mediated drug resistance in bacteria: an update | journal = Drugs | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19678712 | pmc = 2847397 | doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; These pumps  within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage.

[[File:Antibiotic resistance mechanisms.jpg|thumb|300x300px|A number of mechanisms used by common antibiotics to deal with bacteria and ways by which bacteria become resistant to them.|alt=Infographic showing mechanisms for antibiotic resistance]]

Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ochiai K, Yamanaka T, Kimura K, Sawada O, O | year = 1959 |title = Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor |page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cirz RT, Chin JK, Andes DR, de Crécy-Lagard V, Craig WA, Romesberg FE | title = Inhibition of mutation and combating the evolution of antibiotic resistance | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = e176 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15869329 | pmc = 1088971 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic action against a pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive will reproduce, pass the trait to their offspring, which leads to the [[microevolution]] of a fully resistant colony. Chromosomal mutations providing antibiotic resistance benefit the bacteria but also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but will also slow protein synthesis.&lt;ref name="Criswell, Daniel 2004" /&gt; manifesting, in slower growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levin BR, Perrot V, Walker N | title = Compensatory mutations, antibiotic resistance and the population genetics of adaptive evolution in bacteria | journal = Genetics | volume = 154 | issue = 3 | pages = 985–97 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10757748 | pmc = 1460977 | url = http://www.genetics.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10757748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = The Lancet.

===Bacteria===
[[File:Klebsiella pneumoniae 01.png|thumb|''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', the bacterium in which NDM-1 was first identified.|alt=Magnified Klebsiella pneumoniae]]
{{Further|List of antibiotic resistant bacteria}}[[Bacteria]]&amp;nbsp;can often develop&amp;nbsp;[[antibiotic]]&amp;nbsp;resistance. [[Mutation]]s that confer increased survival are selected for in [[natural selection]], which can happen quickly in bacteria because lifespans and production of new generations can be on a timescale of mere hours. A new (de novo) mutation in a parent cell can quickly become an [[heredity|inherited]] mutation of widespread prevalence. Moreover, some adaptive mutations can propagate not only through inheritance but also through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Very often this is done via [[plasmid]]s, however, through means of [[Transduction (genetics)]], [[Transformation (genetics)]] and chromosomal [[Conjugation (genetics)]], resistance genes residing on bacterial chromosomes can also be transferred. If the new DNA is maintained in the receiving bacterium, this transfer is followed by inheritance of the new resistance from parents to offspring.

Recent findings show no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. Small populations of ''E. coli'' in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of ''E. coli'' produced by the gradient of antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johansen TB, Scheffer L, Jensen VK, Bohlin J, Feruglio SL | title = Whole-genome sequencing and antimicrobial resistance in Brucella melitensis from a Norwegian perspective | language = En | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 1 | pages = 8538 | date = June 2018 | pmid = 29867163 | pmc = 5986768 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-018-26906-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic resistance can be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral transfer of genes and gene fragments in Staphylococcus extends beyond mobile elements | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–77 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viruses===
Specific [[antiviral drug]]s are used to treat some viral infections. These drugs prevent viruses from reproducing by inhibiting essential stages of the virus's replication cycle in infected cells. Antivirals are used to treat [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[influenza]], [[herpesviridae|herpes viruses]] including [[varicella zoster virus]], [[cytomegalovirus]] and [[Epstein-Barr virus]]. With each virus, some strains have become resistant to the administered drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lou Z, Sun Y, Rao Z | title = Current progress in antiviral strategies | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 86–102 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24439476 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2013.11.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resistance to HIV antivirals is problematic, and even multi-drug resistant strains have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pennings PS | title = HIV Drug Resistance: Problems and Perspectives | journal = Infectious Disease Reports | volume = 5 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = e5 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24470969 | pmc = 3892620 | doi = 10.4081/idr.2013.s1.e5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistant strains of the HIV virus emerge rapidly if only one antiviral drug is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ton Q, Frenkel L | title = HIV drug resistance in mothers and infants following use of antiretrovirals to prevent mother-to-child transmission | journal = Current HIV Research | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 126–36 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23432488 | doi = 10.2174/1570162x11311020005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using three or more drugs together has helped to control this problem, but new drugs are needed because of the continuing emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ebrahim O, Mazanderani AH | title = Recent developments in hiv treatment and their dissemination in poor countries | journal = Infectious Disease Reports | volume = 5 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = e2 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 24470966 | pmc = 3892621 | doi = 10.4081/idr.2013.s1.e2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fungi===
Infections by fungi are a cause of high morbidity and mortality in [[Immunodeficiency|immunocompromised]] persons, such as those with HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis or receiving [[chemotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xie JL, Polvi EJ, Shekhar-Guturja T, Cowen LE | title = Elucidating drug resistance in human fungal pathogens | journal = Future Microbiology | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 523–42 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24810351 | doi = 10.2217/fmb.14.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fungi [[Candida (fungus)|candida]], ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'' cause most of these infections and antifungal resistance occurs in all of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Srinivasan A, Lopez-Ribot JL, Ramasubramanian AK | title = Overcoming antifungal resistance | journal = Drug Discovery Today: Technologies | volume = 11 | pages = 65–71 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24847655 | pmc = 4031462 | doi = 10.1016/j.ddtec.2014.02.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Multidrug resistance in fungi is increasing because of the widespread use of antifungal drugs to treat infections in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costa C, Dias PJ, Sá-Correia I, Teixeira MC | title = MFS multidrug transporters in pathogenic fungi: do they have real clinical impact? | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 5 | pages = 197 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24904431 | pmc = 4035561 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular note, [[Fluconazole]]-resistant Candida species have been highlighted as a growing problem by the CDC.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt; More than 20 species of Candida can cause [[Candidiasis]] infection, the most common of which is ''[[Candida albicans]]''. Candida yeasts normally inhabit the skin and mucous membranes without causing infection. However, overgrowth of Candida can lead to Candidiasis. Some Candida strains are becoming resistant to first-line and second-line [[Antifungal|antifungal agents]] such as [[Azole#Use as anti-fungal agents|azoles]] and [[echinocandin]]s.&lt;ref name="CDC2013" /&gt;

===Parasites===

The [[protozoa]]n parasites that cause the diseases [[malaria]], [[trypanosomiasis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], [[cryptosporidiosis]] and [[leishmaniasis]] are important human pathogens.&lt;ref name="pmid25057459"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andrews KT, Fisher G, Skinner-Adams TS | title = Drug repurposing and human parasitic protozoan diseases | journal = International Journal for Parasitology.

[[Trypanosoma|Trypanosomes]] are parasitic protozoa that cause [[African trypanosomiasis]] and [[Chagas disease]]  (American trypanosomiasis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franco JR, Simarro PP, Diarra A, Jannin JG | title = Epidemiology of human African trypanosomiasis | journal = Clinical Epidemiology | volume = 6 | pages = 257–75 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25125985 | pmc = 4130665 | doi = 10.2147/CLEP.S39728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Herrera L | title = Trypanosoma cruzi, the Causal Agent of Chagas Disease: Boundaries between Wild and Domestic Cycles in Venezuela | journal = Frontiers in Public Health | volume = 2 | pages = 259 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25506587 | pmc = 4246568 | doi = 10.3389/fpubh.2014.00259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no vaccines to prevent these infections so drugs such as [[pentamidine]] and [[suramin]], [[benznidazole]] and [[nifurtimox]] are used to treat infections. These drugs are effective but infections caused by resistant parasites have been reported.&lt;ref name="pmid25057459" /&gt;

[[Leishmaniasis]] is caused by protozoa and is an important public health problem worldwide, especially in sub-tropical and tropical countries.

The phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance caused by overuse of antibiotics was predicted by [[Alexander Fleming]] who said "The time may come when penicillin can be bought by anyone in the shops. Then there is the danger that the ignorant man may easily under-dose himself and by exposing his microbes to nonlethal quantities of the drug make them resistant."&lt;ref&gt;Amábile-Cuevas CF, editor.

Since the mid-1980s pharmaceutical companies have invested in medications for cancer or chronic disease that have greater potential to make money and have "de-emphasized or dropped development of antibiotics".&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016" /&gt; On January 20, 2016 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], more than "80 pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies" from around the world called for "transformational commercial models" at a global level to spur research and development on antibiotics and on the "enhanced use of diagnostic tests that can rapidly identify the infecting organism".&lt;ref name="NYT_jan_21_2016"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | title=To Fight 'Superbugs,' Drug Makers Call for Incentives to Develop Antibiotics | publisher=New York Times | date=20 January 2016 | access-date=24 January 2016 | last=Pollack | first=Andrew | name-list-format=vanc | series=Davos 2016 Special Report | location=Davos, Switzerland | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424142407/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/to-fight-superbugs-drug-makers-call-for-incentives-to-develop-antibiotics.html?smid=tw-share | archive-date=24 April 2018 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal frameworks===
Some global health scholars have argued that a global, legal framework is needed to prevent and control antimicrobial resistance.&lt;ref name="A. Behdinan, S.J.

==== U.S. ====
On March 27, 2015, the [[White House]] released a comprehensive plan to address the increasing need for agencies to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The Task Force for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria developed ''The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria'' with the intent of providing a roadmap to guide the US in the antibiotic resistance challenge and with hopes of saving many lives. This plan outlines steps taken by the Federal government over the next five years needed in order to prevent and contain outbreaks of antibiotic-resistant infections; maintain the efficacy of antibiotics already on the market; and to help to develop future diagnostics, antibiotics, and vaccines.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|title=FACT SHEET: Obama Administration Releases National Action Plan to Combat Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria|website=whitehouse.gov|access-date=2015-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122075741/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant|archive-date=22 November 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action Plan was developed around five goals with focuses on strengthening health care, public health veterinary medicine, agriculture, food safety and research, and manufacturing. These goals, as listed by the White House, are as follows:
* Slow the Emergence of Resistant Bacteria and Prevent the Spread of Resistant Infections
* Strengthen National One-Health Surveillance Efforts to Combat Resistance
* Advance Development and use of Rapid and Innovative Diagnostic Tests for Identification and Characterization of Resistant Bacteria
* Accelerate Basic and Applied Research and Development for New Antibiotics, Other Therapeutics, and Vaccines
* Improve International Collaboration and Capacities for Antibiotic Resistance Prevention, Surveillance, Control and Antibiotic Research and Development
The following are goals set to meet by 2020:&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"/&gt;
* Establishment of antimicrobial programs within acute care hospital settings
* Reduction of inappropriate antibiotic prescription and use by at least 50% in outpatient settings and 20% inpatient settings
* Establishment of State Antibiotic Resistance (AR) Prevention Programs in all 50 states
* Elimination of the use of medically important antibiotics for growth promotion in food-producing animals.

=== Policies ===
According to [[World Health Organization|WHO]] policymakers can help tackle resistance by strengthening resistance tracking and laboratory capacity; regulating and promoting appropriate use of medicines.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt; Policymakers and industry can help tackle resistance by: fostering innovation and research and development of new tools; promoting cooperation and information sharing among all stakeholders.&lt;ref name="who.int" /&gt;

== Further research ==
It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doan Q, Enarson P, Kissoon N, Klassen TP, Johnson DW | title = Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 9 | issue = 9 | pages = CD006452 | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25222468 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006452.pub4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccines===
Microorganisms do not develop resistance to [[vaccine]]s because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Furthermore, if the use of vaccines increases, there is evidence that antibiotic resistant strains of pathogens will decrease; the need for antibiotics will naturally decrease as vaccines prevent infection before it occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mishra RP, Oviedo-Orta E, Prachi P, Rappuoli R, Bagnoli F | title = Vaccines and antibiotic resistance | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 5 | pages = 596–602 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22981392 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2012.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases, and Pandemics—What You Can Do|publisher=HomesteadSchools.com|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203005320/http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html|archive-date=3 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternating therapy===
Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim S, Lieberman TD, Kishony R | title = Alternating antibiotic treatments constrain evolutionary paths to multidrug resistance | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 40 | pages = 14494–9 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25246554 | pmc = 4210010 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1409800111 | bibcode = 2014PNAS..11114494K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of new drugs===
Since the discovery of antibiotics, [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill people may run out of treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu J, Bedell TA, West JG, Sorensen EJ | title = Design and Synthesis of Molecular Scaffolds with Anti-infective Activity | journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 72 | issue = 25 | pages = 3579–3592 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27284210 | pmc = 4894353 | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2016.01.044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf |title=Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer - Infections and the rise of antimicrobial resistance|date=2011|publisher=UK NHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030190650/http://media.dh.gov.uk/network/357/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf|archive-date=30 October 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries because of the increased risk of harmful infection.&lt;ref name="obama"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals|title=Obama Administration Seeks To Ease Approvals For Antibiotics|date=4 June 2013|publisher=NPR|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313042023/http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals|archive-date=13 March 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of [[multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis]] can cause deafness or psychological disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients|title=Moldova Grapples With Whether To Isolate TB Patients|date=4 June 2013|publisher=NPR|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803104507/http://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&amp;D.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844|title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' – medical chief|last=Walsh|first=Fergus|name-list-format=vanc|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=2013-03-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808002730/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844|archive-date=8 August 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name="TheRealNews-2014-05-18"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11872 | title = Why Are Antibiotics Becoming Useless All Over the World? | first = Martin | last = Khor | name-list-format = vanc | author-link = Martin Khor | date = 2014-05-18 | publisher = [[The Real News]] | access-date = 2014-05-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140518173348/http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=11872 | archive-date = 18 May 2014 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; The pharmaceutical industry has little incentive to invest in antibiotics because of the high risk and because the potential financial returns are less likely to cover the cost of [[drug development|development]] than for other pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Antibiotic Resistance: Why Aren't Drug Companies Developing New Medicines to Stop Superbugs?|last = Nordrum | first =  Amy | name-list-format = vanc | publisher = International Business Times|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Pfizer]], one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name="medpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708|title=Pfizer Moves May Dim Prospect for New Antibiotics|last=Gever|first=John|name-list-format=vanc|date=2011-02-04|publisher=MedPage Today|access-date=2013-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214004508/http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708 |archive-date=14 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies are still active in antibiotic drug research.

The ADAPT Act aims to fast-track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, the FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance, and make the data publicly available. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints' is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|title=Green, Gingrey Introduce ADAPT Act to Safeguard Public Health|author=Press Release|date=12 December 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220023844/http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|archive-date=20 December 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|date=12 December 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|access-date=19 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233910/http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|archive-date=3 March 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the proposals:
* Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections.  The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
* Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
* Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&amp;D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.

Phage therapy relies on the use of naturally-occurring bacteriophages to infect and lyse bacteria at the site of infection in a host. Due to current advances in genetics and biotechnology these bacteriophages can possibly be manufactured to treat specific infections.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin DM, Koskella B, Lin HC | title = Phage therapy: An alternative to antibiotics in the age of multi-drug resistance | journal = World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 162–173 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28828194 | pmc = 5547374 | doi = 10.4292/wjgpt.v8.i3.162 | url = http://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v8/i3/162.htm | access-date = 23 April 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180424135945/https://www.wjgnet.com/2150-5349/full/v8/i3/162.htm | archive-date = 24 April 2018 | dead-url = no | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phages can be bioengineered to target multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, and their use involves the added benefit of preventing the elimination of beneficial bacteria in the human body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Phages destroy bacterial cell walls and membrane through the use of lytic proteins which kill bacteria by making many holes from the inside out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Salmond GP, Fineran PC | title = A century of the phage: past, present and future | language = En | journal = Nature Reviews.

'''Body-on-frame''' is an [[automobile]] construction method where a separate [[coachwork|body]] is mounted on a relatively rigid [[vehicle frame|frame]] or [[chassis]] carrying the [[Powertrain|engine and drivetrain]]. The original method of building automobiles, body-on-frame construction is now used mainly for [[pickup trucks]] and [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]].

In the late 19th century the frames, like those of the carriages they replaced, might be made of wood (commonly [[ash tree|ash]]), reinforced by steel flitch plates - but in the early 20th century steel [[vehicle frame#Ladder frame|ladder frames]] or chassis rapidly became standard. Mass production of all-metal bodies began with the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Dodge Brothers]]. Mass production of all-metal bodies became general in the 1920s but Europe, with exceptions, followed almost a decade later. Europe's custom-made or "coachbuilt" cars usually contained some wood framing or used aluminium alloy castings.

[[Unibody]] or [[monocoque]] designs, where panels within the body supported the car on its suspension, were developed by European manufacturers in the late 1920s with Budd USA (which had a number of large factories in Europe) and its technical knowhow; but not in USA until the 1950s and generally later. Because of the high cost of designing and developing these structures and the high cost of specialised machinery to make the large pressings required by this style of construction it is not used by low-volume manufacturers, who might construct an equivalent by welding steel tube to form a suitable space frame.

== History ==
The [[Ford Model T]] carried the tradition of body-on-frame over from horse-drawn buggies, helping to facilitate high volume manufacturing on a moving assembly line.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304178104579538081576326194?ref=SB10001424052702304677904579535612915387656 Great Moments in Body-on-Frame Car Construction] WSJ, May 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA the frequent changes in [[automotive design]] made it necessary to use a ladder frame rather than unibody construction to make it possible to change the design without having to change the [[chassis]], allowing frequent changes and improvements to the car's bodywork and interior (where they were most noticeable to customers) while leaving the chassis and driveline unchanged, and thus keeping costs down and design times short. It was also easy to use the same chassis and driveline for several very different cars. Especially in the days before [[computer-aided design]], this was a big advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KJI/is_2_115/ai_97872909 |title=Framing the question &amp;#124; Automotive Design &amp; Production &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-12-08 |first=Christopher A. |last=Sawyer |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211205129/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0KJI/is_2_115/ai_97872909 |archivedate=2009-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most small passenger vehicles switched to [[Vehicle frame#Types|unibody]] construction by the end of the 1930s. The trend had started with cars like the [[Citroen Traction Avant]] (1934) and [[Opel Olympia]] (a [[General Motors]] design) introduced in 1935. [[Truck]]s,  [[bus manufacturing|bus manufacturers]] and large low volume cars or those made in USA continued to use separate bodies on "conventional" frames. Body-on-frame remains the preferred construction method for heavy-duty commercial vehicles (especially those intended to carry or pull heavy loads, such as trucks and some [[sport utility vehicles]] (SUVs)) but as production volumes rise increasing numbers of SUVs and [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover SUVs]] are switching to [[unibody]] frames. Mass-market manufacturers [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]] are abandoning true body-on-frame SUVs, opting, when sales volume permits, for more efficient unibody construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/blogs/autosblogpost.aspx?post=7bdff2c1-c41c-4a71-bc48-bbf244f419d1|title=Car Reviews, New and Used Car Prices, Photos and Videos - MSN Autos|author=|date=|website=editorial.autos.msn.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toyota]] currently manufactures the most body-on-frame SUVs with the [[Toyota 4Runner|4Runner]], [[Toyota Sequoia|Sequoia]], [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Land Cruiser]], [[Lexus GX]] and [[Lexus LX|LX]] followed by [[Nissan]] with the [[Nissan Patrol|Patrol]], [[Nissan Armada|Armada]], and [[Infiniti QX80|Infiniti QX56/80]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2013/07/29/toyota-reaffirms-commitment-to-body-on-frame-suvs/|title=Toyota reaffirms commitment to body-on-frame SUVs|author=|date=|website=autoblog.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Ford Panther platform|Panther platform]], which was discontinued in 2011, was the last series of traditional passenger cars to be built in this manner.

One variant used by Chevrolet for its Corvette incorporates the inner skeleton to the frame.

An intermediate to full [[monocoque]] construction was the '[[semi-monocoque]]' used by the [[Volkswagen Beetle]] and [[Renault 4]]. These used a lightweight separate chassis made from pressed sheet steel panels forming a 'platform chassis', to give the benefits of a traditional chassis, but with lower weight and greater stiffness. Both of these chassis were used for several different models. The mid-1930s designed Volkswagen made use of the bodyshell for structural strength as well as the chassis — hence 'semi-monocoque'. Traditionally chassis had "compliance", they were designed to allow some twisting. As suspensions improved they could not perform correctly unless supporting a rigid structure like that intended to be provided by unibody or monocoque construction.

The [[Lincoln Town Car]] once dominated the American limousine market because it was the last American luxury car made on the body-on-frame system and it was easily lengthened for livery work. With the Town Car discontinued since 2011, the de facto replacement is the Lincoln Navigator SUV.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
{{More citations needed|section|date=January 2017}}

===Advantages===

* Easier to design, build and modify. (partly due to today's computer-aided design (CAD) for coach-built vehicles in particular)
* Less noise while travelling, because the groans squeaks and rattles normally associated with bodywork movement due to stresses and strains are not heard so much, and road noise from tyres is more 'distant', all due to the bodywork being isolated from the chassis by rubber pads around the attachment bolts, or by suspending the body on the chassis.
* Easier to repair after accidents. This is crucial for first responders (police, fire, EMS) and anyone who needs their vehicle to earn a living. Damaged bolt-on wings, bumpers etc.: can be replaced easily, and in the case of a 'working vehicle' they can be returned to earning status almost immediately. A monocoque (one piece) vehicle shell would need specialist repairs, which could mean long delays before the vehicle is usable again.
* Can allow more torsional flexing before yielding (trucks, truck-base SUVs, off roading) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.web2carz.com/autos/car-tech/2332/body-on-frame-vs-unibody-construction|title=Body-on-Frame vs. Unibody Construction - Web2Carz|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=web2carz.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vehicles mounted high on a separate chassis such as trucks and true off-road SUVs are less likely to suffer damage from rust caused by dampness, mud, stones, road grit, water, snow, and other more serious damage like the transmission or engine oil sump damage often caused by rocks.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===Disadvantages===
* The complete vehicle will often be heavier than a monocoque shell, resulting in diminished performance and higher fuel consumption.
* Body-on-frame vehicles with high ground clearance such as trucks and true off-road SUVs have high centers of gravity, compromising their on-road performance. 
* Torsional flexing during cornering can compromise the handling and road grip.
* Many older body-on-frame vehicles have no inbuilt crumple zones, so their [[crashworthiness]] is below that of a monocoque shell with crumple zones.

{{Sociology}}

'''Comparative sociology''' involves comparison of the social processes between [[nation states]], or across different types of society (for example [[capitalism|capitalist]] and [[socialist]]). There are two main approaches to comparative sociology: some seek similarity across different countries and cultures whereas others seek variance.  For example, [[structural Marxists]] have attempted to use comparative methods to discover the general processes that underlie apparently different social orderings in different societies.  The danger of this approach is that the different social contexts are overlooked in the search for supposed universal structures.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910157494|title=A dictionary of sociology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Scott, John, 1949-|isbn=9780191763052|edition= Fourth|location=Oxford|oclc=910157494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One sociologist who employed comparative methods to understand variance was [[Max Weber]], whose studies attempted to show how differences between cultures explained the different social orderings that had emerged (see for example ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' and [[Sociology of religion]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is some debate within sociology regarding whether the label of 'comparative' is suitable. [[Emile Durkheim]] argued in ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' (1895) that all sociological research was in fact comparative since social phenomenon are always held to be typical, representative or unique, all of which imply some sort of comparison. In this sense, all sociological analysis is comparative and it has been suggested that what is normally referred to as comparative research, may be more appropriately called [[cross-national research]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''C5a''' is a protein fragment released from cleavage of [[Complement component 5|complement component C5]] by protease [[C5-convertase]] into C5a and C5b fragments. C5b is important in late events of the complement cascade, an orderly series of reactions which coordinates several basic defense mechanisms, including formation of the Membrane Attack Complex (MAC), one of the most basic weapons of the innate immune system, formed as an automatic response to intrusions from foreign particles and microbial invaders. It essentially pokes microscopic pinholes in these foreign objects, causing loss of water and sometimes death. C5a, the other cleavage product of C5, acts as a highly inflammatory peptide, encouraging complement activation, formation of the MAC, attraction of innate immune cells, and histamine release involved in allergic responses. The origin of C5 is in the hepatocyte, but its synthesis can also be found in macrophages, where it may cause local increase of C5a. C5a is a chemotactic agent and an anaphylatoxin; it is essential in the innate immunity but it is also linked with the adaptive immunity. The increased production of C5a is connected with a number of inflammatory diseases.&lt;ref name="pmid19464229"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Manthey HD, Woodruff TM, Taylor SM, Monk PN | title=Complement component 5a (C5a) | journal=Int J Biochem Cell Biol | year= 2009 | volume= 41 | issue= 11 | pages= 2114–7 | doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2009.04.005 | pmc= | pmid=19464229  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Human polypeptide C5a contains 74 amino acids and has 11kDa. NMR spectroscopy proved that the molecule is composed of four helices and connected by peptide loops with three disulphide bonds between helix IV and II, III.  There is a short 1.5 turn helix on N terminus but all agonist activity take place in the C terminus.

==Functions==
C5a is an [[anaphylatoxin]], causing increased expression of adhesion molecules on endothelium, contraction of smooth muscle, and increased vascular permeability. C5a des-Arg is a much less potent anaphylatoxin. Both C5a and C5a des-Arg can trigger [[mast cell]] degranulation, releasing proinflammatory molecules [[histamine]] and [[TNF-α]]. C5a is also an effective [[Chemotaxis#Chemotactic ligands|chemoattractant]], initiating accumulation of complement and phagocytic cells at sites of infection or recruitment of antigen-presenting cells to lymph nodes.
C5a plays a key role in increasing migration and adherence of neutrophils and monocytes to vessel walls. White blood cells are activated by upregulation of [[integrin]] [[avidity]], the [[Prostaglandin#Biosynthesis|lipoxygenase pathway]] and [[arachidonic acid]] metabolism.
C5a also modulates the balance between activating versus inhibitory [[IgG]] [[Fc receptor]]s on leukocytes, thereby enhancing the [[Autoimmunity|autoimmune]] response.&lt;ref name="pmid19464229"/&gt;

==Binding process==
C5a interact with [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein C5aR ([[CD88]]) on the surface of target cells such as macrophages, neutrophils and endothelial cells. C5aR is a member of the [[G-protein-coupled receptor]] superfamily of proteins, predicted to have seven transmembrane helical domains of largely hydrophobic [[amino acid]] residues, forming three intra- and three extra-cellular loops, with an extracellular N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus.

C5a binding to the receptor is a two-stage process: an interaction between basic residues in the helical core of C5a and acidic residues in the extracellular N-terminal domain allows the C-terminus of C5a to bind to residues in the receptor transmembrane domains. The latter interaction leads to receptor activation, and the transduction of the ligand binding signal across the cell [[plasma membrane]] to the cytoplasmic G protein [[Gi alpha subunit|G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]] type [[GNAI2]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/prow/guide/666919736_g.htm PROW and IWHLDA present the GUIDE on: CD88] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724181852/http://mpr.nci.nih.gov/prow/guide/666919736_g.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensitivity of C5aR to C5a stimulation is enhanced by Lipopolysaccharides exposure, yet this is not due to C5aR upregulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Raby AC, Holst B, Davies J, Colmont C, Laumonnier Y, Coles B, Shah S, Hall J, Topley N, Khol J, Morgan BP, Labeta MO | title= TLR activation enhances C5a-induced pro-inflammatory responses by negatively modulating the second C5a receptor, C5L2| journal= European Journal of Immunology | year= 2011| volume= 41| pages=2741–2752 | doi= 10.1002/eji.201041350 | pmid= 21630250 | issue= 9 | pmc= 3638321}}&lt;/ref&gt; C5L2 is another C5a receptor that is thought to regulate the C5a-C5aR effects.

==Diseases==
C5a is a powerful inflammatory mediator, and seems to be a key factor in the development of pathology of many inflammatory diseases involving the complement system such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythemotosis, psoriasis. The inhibitor of C5a that can block its effects would be helpful in medical applications.

In [[astrophysics]], '''dark flow''' is a possible non-random component of the [[peculiar velocity]] of [[galaxy cluster]]s. The actual measured velocity is the sum of the velocity predicted by [[Hubble's Law]] plus a possible small and unexplained (or ''dark'') velocity flowing in a common direction.

According to standard [[cosmological model]]s, the motion of galaxy clusters with respect to the [[cosmic microwave background]] should be randomly distributed in all directions. However, analyzing the three-year [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) data using the kinematic [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]], astronomers [[Alexander Kashlinsky]], F. Atrio-Barandela, D. Kocevski and H. Ebeling found evidence of a "surprisingly coherent" 600–1000&amp;nbsp;km/s&lt;ref name="10.1086/592947" /&gt;&lt;ref name="10.1088/0004-637X/691/2/1479" /&gt; flow of clusters toward a 20-degree patch of sky between the constellations of [[Centaurus]] and [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]].

The researchers had suggested that the motion may be a remnant of the influence of no-longer-visible regions of the universe prior to [[inflationary cosmology|inflation]]. Telescopes cannot see events earlier than about 380,000 years after the [[Big Bang]], when the universe became transparent (the [[cosmic microwave background]]); this corresponds to the [[particle horizon]] at a distance of about 46 billion (4.6×10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) [[light year]]s. Since the matter causing the net motion in this proposal is outside this range, it would in a certain sense be outside our [[visible universe]]; however, it would still be in our past [[light cone]].

The results appeared in the October 20, 2008, issue of [[Astrophysical Journal Letters]].&lt;ref name="10.1086/592947"&gt;{{cite journal

In 2013, data from the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck space telescope]] showed no evidence of "dark flow" on that sort of scale, discounting the claims of evidence for either gravitational effects reaching beyond the visible universe or existence of a multiverse.&lt;ref name="newsci-dn23340" /&gt; However, in 2015  Kashlinsky ''et al'' claim to have found support for its existence using both Planck and WMAP data.&lt;ref name="10.1088/0004-637X/810/2/143"&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Panoramic view of galaxies beyond Milky Way, with Norma cluster &amp; Great Attractor shown by a long blue arrow at the bottom-right in image near the disk of the Milky Way.]]
The dark flow was determined to be flowing in the direction of the [[Centaurus]] and [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] constellations.&lt;ref name="Kash2010"&gt;NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (2010, March 11). Mysterious cosmic 'dark flow' tracked deeper into universe. ScienceDaily. Retrieved 2010-09-28, from https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/03/100310162829.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2013}} This corresponds with the direction of the [[Great Attractor]], which is a gravitational mystery originally discovered in 1973. However, the source of the Great Attractor's attraction was thought to originate from a massive cluster of galaxies called the [[Norma Cluster]], located about 250 million light-years away from Earth.

In a study from March 2010, Kashlinsky extended his work from 2008, by using the 5-year WMAP results rather than the 3-year results, and doubling the number of galaxy clusters observed from 700. The team also sorted the cluster catalog into four "slices" representing different distance ranges. They then examined the preferred flow direction for the clusters within each slice. While the size and exact position of this direction display some variation, the overall trends among the slices exhibit remarkable agreement.&lt;ref name="Kash2010" /&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=August 2013}}  "We detect motion along this axis, but right now our data cannot state as strongly as we'd like whether the clusters are coming or going," Kashlinsky said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mysterious Cosmic 'Dark Flow' Tracked Deeper into Universe |author1=Reddy, Francis  |author2=Chandler, Lynn |publisher=Goddard Space Flight Center |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/releases/2010/10-023.html |date=10 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has so far catalogued the effect as far out as 2.5 billion light-years, and hopes to expand its catalog out further still to twice the current distance.

== Criticisms ==

Astrophysicist [[Edward L. Wright|Ned Wright]] posted an online response to the study arguing that its methods are flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/dark-flow-errors.html |title=Archived item in Ned Wright's News of the Universe |publisher=Astro.ucla.edu |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the "dark flow" study released a statement in return, refuting three of Wright's five arguments and identifying the remaining two as a typo and a technicality that do not affect the measurements and their interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kashlinsky.info/bulkflows/Wright_is_wrong |title=Refutation of Wright's remarks |publisher=Kashlinsky.info |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2012-11-11 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent statistical work done by Ryan Keisler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| arxiv=0910.4233|title=The Statistical Significance of the "Dark Flow" |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=707 |pages=L42–L44 |date=2009-10-22 |last1=Keisler |first1=Ryan |doi=10.1088/0004-637X/707/1/L42 |bibcode = 2009ApJ...707L..42K }}&lt;/ref&gt; claims to rule out the possibility that the dark flow is a physical phenomenon because Kashlinsky et al. did not consider the primary [[anisotropies]] of the [[CMB|cosmic microwave background (CMB)]] to be as important as they are.

NASA's Goddard Space Center considered that this could be the effect of a sibling universe or a region of space-time fundamentally different from the observable universe. Data on more than 1,000 galaxy clusters have been measured, including some as distant as 3 billion light-years. Alexander Kashlinsky claims these measurements show the universe's steady flow is clearly not a statistical fluke. Kashlinsky said: "At this point we don't have enough information to see what it is, or to constrain it. We can only say with certainty that somewhere very far away the world is very different than what we see locally. Whether it's 'another universe' or a different fabric of space-time we don't know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.discovery.com/space/dark-flow-universe.html | title=Mysterious 'Dark Flow' May Be Tug Of Other Universe |publisher=News.discovery.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laura Mersini-Houghton]] and Rich Holman observe that some anisotropy is predicted both by theories involving interaction with another universe, or when the frame of reference of the CMB does not coincide with that of the universe's expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5966|title=A Tale of Two Oxford Talks – Not Even Wrong|work=columbia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, data from the European Space Agency's [[Planck satellite]] was claimed to show no statistically significant evidence of existence of dark flow.&lt;ref name="newsci-dn23340"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23340-blow-for-dark-flow-in-plancks-new-view-of-the-cosmos.html|title=Blow for 'dark flow' in Planck's new view of the cosmos|date=3 April 2013|author=Maggie McKee|journal=[[New Scientist]]|issue=2911}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1303.5090"&gt;{{arxiv|1303.5090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, another analysis by a member of the Planck collaboration, Fernando Atrio-Barandela, suggested the data were consistent with the earlier findings from WMAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{arxiv|1303.6614}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Popular media continued to be interested in the idea, with Mersini-Houghton claiming the Planck results support existence of a multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=5907|title=Hard Evidence for the Multiverse Found, but String Theory Limits the Space Brain Threat|accessdate=19 December 2013|date=22 May 2013|author=Peter Woit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2326869/Is-universe-merely-billions-Evidence-existence-multiverse-revealed-time-cosmic-map.html|title=Is our universe merely one of billions?

'''Deception in animals''' is the transmission of misinformation by one animal to another, of the same or different species, in a way that propagates beliefs that are not true. [[Deception]] in animals does not automatically imply a conscious act, but can occur at different levels of [[Cognition|cognitive ability]].

[[Mimicry]] and [[camouflage]] enable animals to appear to be other than they are. Prey animals may appear as predators, or ''vice versa''; both predators and prey may be hard to see ([[crypsis]]), or may be mistaken for other objects ([[mimesis]]). In [[Batesian mimicry]], harmless animals may appear to be distasteful or poisonous. In [[automimicry]], animals may have eyespots in less important parts of the body than the head, helping to distract attack and increase the chance of survival.

In more active forms of [[anti-predator adaptation]], animals may [[apparent death|feign death]] when they detect a predator, or may quickly conceal themselves or take action to distract a predator, such as when a [[cephalopod]] releases ink. In [[deimatic behaviour]], a harmless animal adopts a threatening pose or displays startling, brightly coloured parts of its body to startle a predator or rival.

Some animals may use tactical deception, with behaviour that is deployed in a way that other animals misinterpret what is happening to the advantage of the agent. Some of the evidence for this is anecdotal, but in the [[great apes]] in particular, experimental studies{{which|date=August 2018}} in [[ethology]] suggest that deception is actively practised by some animals.

==Overview==

Some types of deception in animals are completely involuntary (e.g. [[disruptive coloration]]), but others are under voluntary control and may involve an element of learning. Most instances of voluntary deception in animals involve a simple behaviour, such as a cat arching its back and raising its hackles, to make itself appear larger than normal when attacked. There are relatively few examples of animal behaviour which might be attributed to the manipulative type of deception which we know occurs in humans, i.e. "tactical deception". It has been argued that true deception assumes the deceiver knows that (1) other animals have minds, (2) different animals' minds can believe different things are true (when only one of these is actually true), and (3) it can make another mind believe that something false is actually true. True deception requires the deceiver to have the mental capacity to assess different representations of reality. Animal behaviour scientists are therefore wary of interpreting a single instance of behaviour to true deception, and explain it with simpler mental processes such as learned associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incharacter.org/archives/honesty/i-cannot-tell-a-lie-what-people-with-autism-can-tell-us-about-honesty/|title=I Cannot Tell a Lie – what people with autism can tell us about honesty|last=Baron-Cohen|first=Simon|date=1 April 2007|accessdate=7 May 2013|publisher=John Templeton Foundation|journal=In Character|issue=Spring 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, human activities such as [[military deception]] are certainly intentional, even when they involve methods such as camouflage which physically parallel [[List of camouflage methods|camouflage methods used by animals]].

=== Levels of deception in animals ===

Mitchell and Thompson list four levels of deception in animals:&lt;ref name=MitchellThompson&gt;{{cite book | publisher=SUNY Press | isbn=1438413327 | last=Mitchell | first=Robert W. | first2=Nicholas S.|last2= Thompson | title=Deception, Perspectives on Human and Nonhuman Deceit | year=1986 |pages=21–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#False markings on animals, such as butterfly markings that indicate their heads are at the back end of their bodies as an aid to escape, or markings to make predators appear safe&lt;ref name=MitchellThompson/&gt;
#False behaviour, such as a predator acting in a way to hide its predatory nature around prey&lt;ref name=MitchellThompson/&gt;
#[[Distraction display|Feigned injury]] to get or divert attention; for example, a parent bird feigning a broken wing to attract a predator away from its defenceless offspring&lt;ref name=MitchellThompson/&gt;
#Verbal deception such as a chimp misleading other chimps to hide a food source, or a human lying in order to deceive another&lt;ref name=MitchellThompson/&gt;

== Mimicry ==
{{main article|Mimicry}}

Mimicry is the similarity of one species to another which protects one or both species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=King |first=R. C. |last2=Stansfield |first2=W. D. |last3=Mulligan |first3=P. K. |year=2006 |title=A Dictionary of Genetics |edition=7th |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=278 |isbn=0-19-530762-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This similarity can be in [[Visual appearance|appearance]], [[behaviour]], [[sound]], [[scent]], and [[Location (geography)|location]], with the mimics found in similar places to their models. There are many forms of mimicry, and an individual example may fall into more than one of the recognised categories.

=== Defensive mimicry ===
Defensive or protective mimicry takes place when organisms are able to avoid encounters that would be harmful to them by deceiving enemies by appearing to be something that they are not. For example, [[mantis shrimp]] typically spread their front limbs (known as "smashers") to threaten rivals in a behaviour called the "meral spread".&lt;ref name="Srour" /&gt;  [[moulting|Newly moulted]] mantis shrimps frequently deceive potential competitors by spreading their front limbs, even though their still-soft [[exoskeleton]]s meant that they could not use their smashers without damaging  themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blueboard.com/mantis/bio/bluff.htm |title=Stomatopod biology |author=San Juan, A. |year=1998 |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130120220605/http://www.blueboard.com/mantis/bio/bluff.htm |archivedate=January 20, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Srour"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 29, 2016|title=Mantis Shrimp (Crustacea: Stomatopoda)|date=July 13, 2011|author=Srour, M.|publisher=Bioteaching.com|url=http://bioteaching.com/mantis-shrimp-crustacea-stomatopoda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Batesian mimicry is a form of mimicry typified by a situation where a harmless species has evolved to imitate the [[warning signal]]s of a harmful species directed at a common predator. The harmful species (the model) might have spines, stingers, or toxic chemistry, while its apparent double has no defence other than resembling the unpalatable species. Protection of the mimic from predators is afforded by its resemblance to the unpalatable species, which the predator associates with a certain appearance and a bad experience.&lt;ref name=Butler/&gt;

Examples of Batesian mimicry are the several species of butterflies that mimic the toxic [[Heliconiinae|Heliconid]] butterflies. Another butterfly mimic is the non-toxic [[Papilio memnon|great Mormon]] of Indonesia. Each female butterfly (regardless of her coloration) can produce one or more different female forms which mimic any of five other species of foul-tasting butterflies. Batesian mimicry is also found in the harmless [[milk snake]], which mimics venomous [[coral snakes]]. Both snakes are marked with alternating yellow, red, and black bands, causing potential predators to avoid both. The snakes can often be distinguished by using an old saying: "Red against yellow: kill a fellow. red against black: friend to Jack." The deadly coral snake has bands in the order of red, yellow, black, while the innocuous species have the pattern of red, black, yellow (although there are exceptions).&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/0306.htm |title=The arts of deception: Mimicry and camouflage |author=R. Butler |year=2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deception by Batesian mimicry need not be visual, as it may involve any of the [[sense]]s. For example, some [[moths]] use a highly effective defence against bats. In response to hearing ultrasound emitted by hunting bats, they produce loud [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]] clicks to mimic the unpalatable [[Tiger moth (moth)|tiger moth]] – a case of auditory Batesian mimicry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Conner |first=W.

Müllerian mimicry occurs when two or more genuinely unprofitable species have come to mimic each other's warning signals, so unlike the case in Batesian mimicry, no deception is involved.&lt;!--so we mention this case here only to draw the dividing line between what is deceptive and what is not--&gt; Typically the species share one or more common predators, though they may or may not be closely related.&lt;ref name=RitlandBrower/&gt;

For example, the [[viceroy butterfly]] appears very similar to the noxious-tasting [[monarch butterfly]]. Although for a long time thought to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy has recently been discovered to be just as unpalatable as the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry.&lt;ref name=RitlandBrower&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ritland |first=D. |last2=Brower |first2=L.P. |author-link2=Lincoln Brower |year=1991 |title=The viceroy butterfly is not a Batesian mimic |journal=Nature |volume=350 |issue=6318 |pages=497–498 |doi=10.1038/350497a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poison dart frogs]] of South America and [[mantella]] frogs of Madagascar are examples of Müllerian mimicry with their conspicuous [[warning coloration]] (bright colours against black markings) and toxic composition.

Müllerian mimicry may also use any of the senses. For example, many snakes share the same [[hearing (sense)|auditory]] warning signals.

=== Aggressive mimicry ===
{{main|Aggressive mimicry}}
[[File:Humpback anglerfish.png|thumb|[[Aggressive mimicry]] in the [[humpback anglerfish]]]]

Aggressive mimicry is the mimicking by predators or [[parasites]] of harmless species, allowing the predator to approach and sometimes to attract its prey.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"/&gt;

[[Anglerfish]] are named for their characteristic method of predation. Anglerfish typically have at least one long filament (the ''illicium'') sprouting from the middle of the head, protruding above the fish's eyes and terminating in an irregular growth of flesh (the ''[[esca (fish anatomy) |esca]]'') at the tip of the filament. The filament can move in all directions and the esca can be wiggled so as to resemble a prey animal, thus acting as bait to lure other predators close enough for the anglerfish to devour them.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=William John|title=The Behavior of Communicating: an ethological approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zu2ML2rigZ4C&amp;pg=PA381|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04379-4|page=381|quote=Others rely on the technique adopted by a wolf in sheep's clothing—they mimic a harmless species. ... Other predators even mimic their prey's prey: angler fish (Lophiiformes) and alligator snapping turtles ''Macroclemys temmincki'' can wriggle fleshy outgrowths of their fins or tongues and attract small predatory fish close to their mouths.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some deep-sea anglerfishes of the [[bathypelagic |bathypelagic zone]] emit light from their escas to attract prey. This [[bioluminescence]] is a result of [[symbiosis]] with [[bacterium |bacteria]].&lt;ref name=Haddock&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haddock |first1=Steven H.D. |last2=Moline |first2=Mark A. |last3=Case |first3=James F. |title=Bioluminescence in the Sea |journal=Annual Review of Marine Science |date=2010 |volume=2 |pages=443–493 |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/eprint/pbWcm4DyqvQGJ7F2qGkc/full/10.1146/annurev-marine-120308-081028 |doi=10.1146/annurev-marine-120308-081028 |pmid=21141672|bibcode=2010ARMS....2..443H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/umrsmas/bullmar/1983/00000033/00000004/art00003 | title=Oceanic Bioluminescence: an Overview of General Functions | author=Young, Richard Edward | journal=Bulletin of Marine Science |date=October 1983 | volume=33 | issue=4 | pages=829–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[turtle]] species and the [[Chaca (genus) |frogmouth catfish]] have tongue extensions that lure prey to a position where they become an easy catch.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"/&gt;&lt;!--for snapping turtles--&gt; In [[caudal luring]], the predator uses [[tail]] movements to attract prey. This form of mimicry is used by several snake and lizard species, as well by as the [[tasselled wobbegong]] shark.

In another example of aggressive mimicry, males are lured toward what seems to be a [[sexually receptive]] female, only to be eaten. For example, [[firefly |fireflies]] of the genus ''[[Photuris (genus) |Photuris]]'' emit the same light signals that females of the genus ''[[Photinus (beetle) |Photinus]]'' emit as a mating signal.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lloyd |first=J. E. |title=Aggressive Mimicry in Photuris: Firefly Femmes Fatales |journal=Science |date=6 August 1965 |volume=149 |issue=3684 |pages=653–654 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3684.653}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these "[[femmes fatales]]" because the predatory females can identify the male's species and emit the signal used by the female of the male's species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last=Lloyd  |first=J. E.  |title=Aggressive Mimicry in Photuris Fireflies: Signal Repertoires by Femmes Fatales  |journal=Science  |date=7 February 1975  |volume=187  |issue=4175  |pages=452–453  |doi=10.1126/science.187.4175.452  |pmid=17835312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggressive mimicry need not involve the sense of vision. For example, the [[assassin bug]] preys on spiders, entering their web and plucking its silk threads. This produces vibrations that match the pattern of vibrations made by typical prey caught in the web, causing the spider to approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wignall |first=A.

W. |title=Assassin bug uses aggressive mimicry to lure spider prey |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=27 October 2010 |volume=278 |issue=1710 |pages=1427–1433 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.2060 |pmid=20980305 |pmc=3061146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Automimicry ===
[[File:Four-Eye Butterflyfish.jpg|thumb|[[Four-eye butterflyfish]] showing its concealed eye and false eyespot near the tail]]
{{main|Automimicry}}

Automimicry refers to instances in which one body part of an animal mimics another. This may help and animal survive an attack, or help a predators to appear innocuous.  Examples include many moth, butterfly, and fish species that have "eye-spots". These are large dark markings that help prey escape by causing predators to attack a false target.  For example, the gray hairstreak (''[[Strymon melinus]]'') shows the false head at its rear; it has a better chance of surviving an attack to that part than an attack to the head. Another example is the "two-headed" snake of Central Africa which has a tail that resembles a head. The snake even moves its tail in the way most snakes move their heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleforanimalsindia.org/articles-by-maneka-gandhi/615-camouflage.html |title=Camouflage |author=Gandhi, M. |year=2011 |publisher=People for animals |accessdate=March 24, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805234726/http://peopleforanimalsindia.org/articles-by-maneka-gandhi/615-camouflage.html |archivedate=August 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation functions to deceive prey as to the source of an attack.

== Camouflage ==
{{main article|Camouflage}}
Camouflage is the use of any combination of materials, coloration, or behaviour that helps to conceal an animal by making it hard to see ([[crypsis]]) or by disguising it as something else ([[mimicry|mimesis]]).

=== Crypsis ===
{{main article|Crypsis|List of camouflage methods}}
[[File:Gekkoninae Uroplatus sikorae camouflage horiz.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|[[Uroplatus]] gecko relies on [[camouflage methods|multiple methods of camouflage]], including [[disruptive coloration]], eliminating shadow, and cryptic behaviour (lying low and keeping still).]]

There are several methods of achieving crypsis. These include, resemblance to the surroundings,
[[disruptive coloration]], eliminating shadow, self-decoration, cryptic behaviour, [[motion camouflage]], changeable skin appearance, [[countershading]], [[counter-illumination]], transparency, and [[Camouflage#Silvering|silvering]] to reflect the environment.

Many species are cryptically colored to resemble their surroundings. For example, ''[[Uroplatus]]'' geckos can be almost completely invisible, even to a nearby observer. Similarly, the [[Tettigoniidae|katydids]], a group of grasshopper-like insects found worldwide, are nocturnal and use their cryptic coloration to remain unnoticed during the day. They remain perfectly still, often in a position that increases the effectiveness of their camouflage.

[[File:2 - Aphia minuta 03-11-06 DSCF4095.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Transparency camouflage in the [[transparent goby]]]]

Some animals have coloration which makes them highly conspicuous when outside their normal environment but highly cryptic when in it. For example, the blue [[morpho]], a forest butterfly, has iridescent blue upper wings and a 17&amp;nbsp;cm wingspan. However, because the underwings are dark, when the morpho flies through the flickering light of the forest or even out in daylight, it seems to disappear. Other forest species, especially mammals, use disruptive coloration and have spotted or striped pelage which helps break up the animal's outline. In the shade created by trees or other foliage, even large mammals such as [[leopards]], [[jaguars]], [[ocelots]], and [[okapi]] are difficult to see because of such disruptive coloration.

[[Underwater camouflage|Underwater animals]] adopt a wide range of methods of camouflage including transparency, reflection, counter-illumination, countershading, and self-decoration.

Most forms of camouflage are less effective when the camouflaged animal moves because motion is easily seen by the observing predator or prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | publisher=Oxford University Press | last=Cott | first=Hugh Bamford | title=Adaptive Coloration in Animals | year= 1940 |pages=141–143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insects such as [[hoverflies]]&lt;ref name="Srinivasan and Davey"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Srinivasan |first=M.

=== Mimesis ===
{{main article|Mimicry}}
[[File:Leafyseadragon2276ppx PLW edit.JPG|thumb|upright|Mimesis in the [[leafy sea dragon]] with seaweed-like coloration, protuberances and behaviour]]

Katydids have evolved a wide range of camouflage adaptations so their body colouring and shape match entire leaves, half-eaten leaves, dying leaves, leaves with bird droppings, sticks, twigs, and tree bark. Other well-known mimetic animals include [[beetle]]s, [[mantid]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, [[moth]]s, [[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, and fish.

A well known response of cephalopods when threatened is to release large volumes of [[Cephalopod ink|ink]]. Some cephalopods also release [[Pseudomorph#Pseudomorph in other fields|pseudomorphs]] ("false bodies"); smaller clouds of ink with a greater [[mucus]] content, which allows them to hold their shape for longer. These are expelled slightly away from the cephalopod; they are roughly the same volume and look like the cephalopod that released them. Predators have often been seen attacking a pseudomorph, allowing the cephalopod to escape.

=== Active camouflage ===
{{main article|Active camouflage}}
[[File:Peacock Flounder Bothus mancus in Kona.jpg|thumb |right|200px|Colour change: four frames of a [[peacock flounder]] taken a few minutes apart]]

There are two mechanisms of active camouflage in animals: [[counter-illumination]] and [[Camouflage#Crypsis by changing skin pattern.2C colour|colour change]] (sometimes called metachrosis).

In counter-illumination camouflage an animal produces light that causes it to blend in against a lit background. In water, light comes down from the surface, so when animals are seen from below, they appear darker than the background. Some species of cephalopod, such as the [[midwater squid]]&lt;ref name="Abralia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-photos/midwater-squid-abralia-veranyi | title=Midwater squid, Abralia veranyi | publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History | year=2010 | accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Watasenia scintillans|sparkling enope squid]], produce light in [[photophore]]s on their undersides to match the background. Bioluminescence is common among marine animals, so counter-illumination camouflage may be a widespread mode of deception.

Colour change permits camouflage against different backgrounds. In the context of deception, this can be used as a defence or predatory strategy, or during courtship and mating. Colour change is made possible by [[chromatophores]]; pigment-containing and light-reflecting organelles in cells found in amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and cephalopods. Inside the chromatophore cell of cephalopods, pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac. To change colour, the animal distorts the sac by muscular contraction, changing its translucency, reflectivity or opacity. This differs from the mechanism used in fish, amphibians and reptiles, in that the shape of the sac is being changed rather than a translocation of pigment vesicles within the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.sc.gov/marine/sertc/Featured%20Species%20O%20vulgaris.pdf| title=Tales from the cryptic: The common Atlantic octopus | accessdate=March 25, 2013 | author=Meyers, N. |publisher=Southeastern Regional Taxonomic Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[chameleon]] and [[anole]] species are able to voluntarily change their skin colours. Different chameleon species are able to change different colours which can include pink, blue, red, orange, green, black, brown, light blue, yellow, turquoise and purple. Some species, such as [[Smith's dwarf chameleon]], adjust their colours for camouflage in accordance with the vision of the specific predator species (bird or snake) that they are being threatened by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13944-chameleons-finetune-camouflage-to-predators-vision.html |author=Young, E. |year=2008 |title=Chameleons fine-tune camouflage to predator's vision |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some octopuses can use muscles in the skin to change both the colour and texture of their [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] to achieve a greater camouflage. In some species, the mantle can take on the spiky appearance of seaweed, or the scraggly, bumpy texture of a rock, among other disguises. A few species, such as the [[mimic octopus]], have another defence mechanism. They can combine their highly flexible bodies with their colour-changing ability to accurately mimic other, more dangerous animals, such as [[Pterois|lionfish]], [[sea snakes]], and [[eel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, M.D., Finn J. and Tregenza, T., (2001). {{cite web |url= http://marinebio.org/upload/files/mimic.pdf |title=Dynamic mimicry in an Indo-Malayan octopus. }} {{small|(312&amp;nbsp;KB)}} Proceedings of the Royal Society, 268: 1755–1758&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Norman | first1=M.D. | last2=Hochberg | first2=F.G. | year=2005 | title=The "mimic octopus" (''Thaumoctopus mimicus'' n. gen. et sp.), a new octopus from the tropical Indo-West Pacific (Cephalopoda: Octopodidae) | url=http://www.mapress.com/mr/content/v25/2005f/n2p070.htm | journal=Molluscan Research | volume=25 | pages=57–70 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feigning death==
{{main article|Apparent death}}
[[File:BatrixNatrixBellyPattern.JPG|right|thumb|200px|A [[grass snake]] [[Apparent death|feigning death]]]]

A well-researched form of deception is [[Apparent death|feigning death]], often referred to by non-specialists as "playing dead" or "playing possum", although specialists use the terms "tonic immobility" or "thanatosis". A wide range of animals, e.g. lizards, birds, rodents, and sharks, behave as if dead as an [[anti-predator adaptation]], as predators usually take only live prey.&lt;ref name="Pasteur, (1982)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pasteur | first1=G | year=1982 | title=A classificatory review of mimicry systems | url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125 | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=13 | issue=| pages=169–199 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.13.110182.001125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced.&lt;ref name="Miyatake et al., (2004)"&gt;Miyatake, T., Katayama, K., Takeda, Y., Nakashima, A. and Mizumoto, M. (2004). Is death-feigning adaptive? Heritable variation in fitness difference of death-feigning behaviour. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences'', 271: 2293–2296. doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2858&lt;/ref&gt; Birds often feign death to escape predation; for example tonic immobility in quail reduces the probability of attacks by cats.&lt;ref name="Forkman et al., 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Forkman | first1=B. | last2=Boissy | first2=A. | last3=Meunier-Salaün | first3=M.-C. | last4=Canali | first4=E. | last5=Jones | first5=R.B. | year=2007 | title=A critical review of fear tests used on cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and horses | url=| journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume=92 | issue=| pages=340–374 | doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.03.016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death feigning may also play a role in reproduction, For example, in the [[Pisaura mirabilis|nursery web spider]], the male sometimes feigns death to avoid getting eaten by females during mating.&lt;ref name="spider"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hansen | first1=L.S. | last2=Gonzales | first2=S.F. | last3=Toft | first3=S. | last4=Bilde | first4=T. | year=2008 | title=Thanatosis as an adaptive male mating strategy in the nuptial gift–giving spider ''Pisaura mirabilis'' | url=| journal=behavioural Ecology | volume=19 | pages=546–551 | doi=10.1093/beheco/arm165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, death feigning is used by a predator. For example, the predatory [[cichlid]] ''Haplochromis livingstoni'' lies on its side on the bottom sediments until approached by scavengers attracted to what appears to be a dead fish, whereupon ''H. livingstoni'' abandons the pretence, rights itself and attacks the scavenger.&lt;ref name="Helfman et al., (1997)"&gt;Helfman, G.S., Collette, B.B. and Facey, D.E., (1997). ''The Diversity of fishes''. Wiley-blackwell. pp. 324. {{ISBN|978-0-86542-256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death feigning behaviour can be deliberately induced by humans, a prominent example being the "hypnosis" of chickens or pigeons. For example, if a pigeon is grasped firmly, quickly inverted and held briefly on its back on a table, it often remains immobile for a minute or two. According to Gilman et al.&lt;ref name="Gilman et al., 1950"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilman | first1=T.T. | last2=Marcuse | first2=F.L. | last3=Moore | first3=A.U. | year=1960 | title=Animal hypnosis: a study of the induction of tonic immobility in chickens | url=| journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology and Psychology | volume=43 | issue=| pages=99–111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the investigation of 'animal hypnosis' dates back to the year 1646 in a report by Kircher. It has been shown that the intensity and duration of death feigning is related to the intensity of fear prior to the feigning state being induced. This has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens,&lt;ref name="Jones and Faure, (1981)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Jones | first1=B. | last2=Faure | first2=J.

== Concealment ==
Many animals hide from predators behind rocks, in holes, in brush, and in many other ways. Some actually carry around parts of the environment to use for that purpose. For example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=sanders, R.|title=Octopuses occasionally stroll around on two arms, UC Berkeley biologists report|publisher=University of California|year=2005|url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/03/24_octopus.shtml|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Huffard | first1=C.L. | last2=Boneka | first2=F. | last3=Full | first3=R.J. | year=2005 | title=Underwater bipedal locomotion by octopuses in disguise | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/307/5717/1927.abstract | journal=Science | volume=307 | issue=| page=1927 | doi=10.1126/science.1109616 | pmid=15790846}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least four individual veined octopuses were seen retrieving discarded coconut shells, carrying them up to 20 meters, manipulating them, and then assembling them to use as shelter. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8408233.stm |author=Morelle, R.| work=BBC News | title=Octopus snatches coconut and runs | date=December 14, 2009 | accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edutube.org/video/coconut-shelter-evidence-tool-use-octopuses&lt;/ref&gt; This may be the first known example of [[Tool use in animals|tool use]] in cephalopods.

Cephalopods also conceal themselves by releasing large amounts of dark [[Cephalopod ink|ink]] when they are threatened. The ink obsucures the vision of the threatening animal and allows the cephalopod to escape.

==Distraction displays==
{{main article|Distraction display}}

Distraction displays, also known as deflection displays and diversionary displays,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armstrong, Edward A. |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1949.tb02261.x |title=Diversionary Display |year=2008 |journal=Ibis |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=179–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; are behaviours that draw the attention of a predator away from an object, typically the nest or young.&lt;ref&gt;Barrows, E. M., (2001). ''Animal behaviour desk reference.'' CRC Press. 2nd ed. p. 177 {{ISBN|0-8493-2005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are well known in birds, but also occur in fish.&lt;ref name=ruxton&gt;Ruxton, G. D., Sherratt, T. N. and Speed, M. P., (2004). Avoiding attack: the evolutionary ecology of crypsis, warning signals and mimicry. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-852859-0}}. p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; A familiar example is the ''broken-wing'' display seen in nesting [[charadriformes|waders, plovers]] and doves such as the [[mourning dove]].&lt;ref&gt;Baskett, T. S.; Sayre, M. W.; Tomlinson, R. E., (1993). ''Ecology and Management of the mourning dove''. Stackpole Books, p. 167, {{ISBN|0-8117-1940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this display, a bird walks away from its nest with one wing dragging on the ground. It seems to be an easy target, thus distracting the predator's attention away from the nest. Once the bird is far enough away it "recovers" and quickly flies off.

== Deimatic displays ==
{{main article|Deimatic behaviour}}
[[File:Spirama retorta 012.jpg|thumb|''[[Spirama retorta]]'' female]]

&lt;!--need more examples of deimatic displays here--&gt;
A deimatic displays is a pattern of threatening or startling behaviour, such as suddenly displaying conspicuous eyespots, used to scare off or momentarily distract a predator, thus giving the prey animal an opportunity to escape. For example, some moths look threatening while at rest by displaying a sinister lurking face, such as those of genus ''[[Speiredonia]]'', or the more aggressive face of a snake poised to attack, such as many species of genus ''[[Spirama]]''. Adult Atlas moths of the genera ''[[Attacus]]'' and ''[[Rothschildia]]'' also display snake heads.&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F0-306-48380-7_1185 Malcolm Edmunds, ''Encyclopedia of Entomology''; Deimatic behaviour, 2005, p 677]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smerinthus ocellatus|The eyed hawkmoth]] displays its large eyespots on its wings and moves them slowly as if it were a vertebrate predator such as an [[owl]].&lt;ref name=Springer&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.springerreference.com/docs/html/chapterdbid/86053.html | title=Deimatic behaviour | publisher=Springer | year=2012 | accessdate=March 24, 2013 | author=Edmunds, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactical deception ==
Tactical deception (also referred to as functional deception) is the use of signals or displays from an animal's normal repertoire to mislead or deceive another individual.&lt;ref name="Byrne and Whiten, (1991)"&gt;Byrne, R.; Whiten. A. (1991). Computation and mindreading in primate tactical deception. In ''Natural Theories of Mind: Evolution, Development and Simulation of Everyday Mindreading.'' Whiten, A. (ed.). pp. 127-141. Cambridge: Basil blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers limit the use of this term to an [[Biological specificity|intraspecific]]&lt;ref name="Byrne and whiten"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrne |first=Richard |author2=Whiten, A. |title=Tactical deception of familiar individuals in baboons (''Papio ursinus'') |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=1985 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=669–673 |doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  behaviour, meaning that it occurs between members of the same species. Most other kinds of deception are meant to fool members of a different species. Tactical deception can also be achieved when the deceiver withholds information by failing to perform an expected action, such as giving a warning call when danger is observed.

Tactical deception can be costly to the user, because it occurs mostly in social animals that may lose trust in a group-member when that member's deceit is discovered. Indeed, a notable view in ethology is that animal displays are usually accurate signals, and that widespread deception cannot become a stable feature of a communication system. In this view, widespread use of deception would cause communication to break down, as the recipients of false signals would become "skeptical" about signal validity in general and fail to respond appropriately. However, as exemplified below, limited use of deception does seem to be a stable feature in various communities.

It is unclear what cognitive abilities are necessary for an animal to exhibit tactical deception. It might require the ability to understand another animal's point of view, or it might require only the use of specialized learned behaviours. These alternatives are hotly debated, and the answer tends to vary depending on the species being observed. In the first scenario, the deceiver would need a [[Theory of Mind]] which is the ability to attribute mental states (beliefs, knowledge, intents, desires, etc.) to another individual, The alternative view denies the need for such a capacity, but it does suggest the evolution of specialized brain functions responsible for social learning.

Tactical deception has been used as a measure of advanced social cognition as it relates to brain function.  Primates have larger brains, relative to body size, than in any other mammal except for [[dolphins]], and this size difference is mainly due to an enlarged neocortex. Research has suggested that the evolution of the primate brain is selected-for in highly social species. One study used 18 species with varying brain volumes (three [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]], four New World monkeys, seven Old World monkeys, and four ape species). The study used the frequency of tactical deception as a measure of social cognition, and it found a strong correlation between the use of social deception and size of the neocortex.&lt;ref name="Byrne and Corp"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrne |first=Richard |author2=Corp, Nadia |title=Neocortex size predicts deception rate in primates |journal=The Royal Society |year=2004 |volume=271 |pages=1693–1699 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.2780|pmc=1691785 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among [[cephalopods]], some colour changes in [[cuttlefish]] might be called tactical deception, as these fish sometimes present entirely different displays to two different observers. When a male cuttlefish courts a female in the presence of other males, he displays a male pattern facing the female (courtship), and a female pattern facing away, to deceive other males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=S. |last=Williams |year=2012 |title=Two-faced fish tricks competitors |publisher=Science Now |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/07/two-faced-fish-tricks-competitor.html |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094334/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/07/two-faced-fish-tricks-competitor.html |archivedate=March 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In domestic pigs, in a setting where the behavior of a trained animal could reveal the source of food to another animal, the trained animal spent longer at the food source before other pigs arrived.&lt;ref name="Held et al., (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Held | first1=S. | last2=Mendl | first2=M. | last3=Devereux | first3=C. | last4=Byrne | first4=R.W. | year=2002 | title=Foraging pigs alter their behaviour in response to exploitation | url=| journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=64 | issue=| pages=157–165 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.3044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an anecdotal account, Simmons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Simmons | first1=R | year=1992 | title=Brood adoption and deceit among African marsh harriers, Circus ranivorus | doi=10.1111/j.1474-919x.1992.tb07226.x| journal=Ibis | volume=134 | issue=| pages=32–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that a female [[marsh harrier]] courted a male to obtain access to food he had stored. She then took this food and fed it to chicks that had been fathered by another male. More extensive studies focused on possibly deceitful behaviour in the pied flycatcher, a species in which males may possess more than one territory. Females gain from mating with a male that has no other mates and males may try to deceive females about their mating status (mated or unmated). Females frequently visit the male, and if he is always alone on his territory he is probably unmated. Thus, by repeated sampling of male behaviour, females are usually able to avoid mating with previously mated males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animalbehaviouronline.com/deceitstudies.html|author=Breed, M.D.|title=Studies of deceit|year=2001|accessdate=March 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-foraging [[common raven]]s [[Hoarding (animal behaviour)|hoard]] their food in a number of places, and also raid the caches made by others. Cachers withdraw from [[Conspecificity|conspecifics]] when hiding their food and usually place their caches behind structures, out of sight of potential observers. Raiders remain inconspicuous, keeping at a distance from cachers near their cache sites, but within sight. In response, cachers often interrupt caching, change cache sites, or empty their caches. These behaviours suggest that ravens can withhold information about their intentions, which may qualify as tactical deception.&lt;ref name="Bugnyarf and Kotrschal, (2002)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bugnyarf | first1=T. | last2=Kotrschal | first2=K. | year=2002 | title=Observational learning and the raiding of food caches in ravens, ''Corvus corax'': is it 'tactical' deception? | url=| journal=Animal Behaviour | volume=64 | issue=| pages=185–195 | doi=10.1006/anbe.2002.3056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, if a [[Eurasian jay]] (''Garrulus glandarius'') is being watched by another jay, it tends to cache food behind an opaque barrier rather than a transparent barrier, apparently to reduce the likelihood of other jays pilfering their caches.&lt;ref name="Legg"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Legg, E.W. |author2=Clayton, N.S. |year=2014 |title=Eurasian jays (Garrulus glandarius) conceal caches from onlookers|journal=Animal Cognition |volume=17 |issue=5 |pages=1223–1226 |doi=10.1007/s10071-014-0743-2|pmc=4138428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observations on great apes have been widely reported as evidence of tactical deception. Several great apes have been trained to use sign language, and in some instances these animals seem to have used language in an attempt to deceive human observers. [[Koko (gorilla)|Koko]], a female gorilla, was trained to use a form of [[American Sign Language]].  It has been claimed that she once tore a steel sink out of its moorings and when her handlers confronted her, Koko signed "cat did it" and pointed at her innocent pet kitten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=Malcom |title=Book of Lies |year=2005 |publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|location=Kansas City |isbn=9780740755606 |page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJOE6N6QF4EC&amp;pg=PA61 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nim Chimpsky]] was a [[chimpanzee]] also trained in American Sign Language. In a documentary about the chimp ("[[Project Nim (film)|Project Nim]]") trainers claimed that when Nim got bored of learning to sign words she would sign 'dirty' indicating she wanted to go to the toilet, which caused the trainer to stop the lesson.&lt;ref&gt;"Project Nim." Television documentary transmitted on BBC2, March 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example involves a chimpanzee that was approached from behind by a loud aggressive rival. Here, the chimpanzee moved his lips until he lost his  fear grin thereby concealing his fear. Only then did he turn around to face the challenger.&lt;ref name="Byrne and whiten, (1991)"&gt;Byrne, R. and whiten. A., (1991). Computation and mindreading in primate tactical deception. In ''Natural Theories of Mind: Evolution, Development and Simulation of Everyday Mindreading.'' whiten, A. (ed.). pp. 127-141.

In ''Deception: Perspectives on Human and Non-human Deceit.'' Mitchell, (ed.). pp. 221-224.

[http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/totem/vol15/iss1/4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Deceit in great apes has been studied under experimental conditions, one of which is summarised by Kirkpatrick:&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick, (2007)" /&gt;
:"...food was hidden and only one individual, named Belle, in a group of chimpanzees was informed of the location. Belle was eager to lead the group to the food but when one chimpanzee, named Rock, began to refuse to share the food, Belle changed her behaviour. She began to sit on the food until Rock was far away, then she would uncover it quickly and eat it. Rock figured this out though and began to push her out of the way and take the food from under her. Belle then sat farther and farther away waiting for Rock to look away before she moved towards the food. In an attempt to speed the process up, Rock looked away until Belle began to run for the food. On several occasions he would even walk away, acting disinterested, and then suddenly spin around and run towards Belle just as she uncovered the food."

Deceptive behaviour has been observed in [[Old World monkeys]] including [[baboons]] (''[[Papio ursinus]]''). In one of their articles, Byrne and Whiten recorded observations of "intimate tactical deception" within a group of baboons, and documented examples that they classified as follows: A juvenile using warning screams to gain access to underground food storages which otherwise would have been inaccessible; an exaggerated "looking" gesture (which in an honest context would mean detection of a predator) produced by a juvenile to avoid attack by an adult male; recruitment of a "fall-guy" (a third party used by the deceiver to draw attention or aggression); and using one's own movement pattern to draw group-mates away from food caches. Byrne and Whiten also broke these categories into subcategories denoting the modality of the action (e.g. vocalization) and what the action would have signified if observed in an honest context. They noted whether the individual that had been manipulated was in turn used to manipulate others, what the costs had been to the manipulated individual, and whether or not there were additional costs to third parties. Byrne and Whiten expressed concern that these observations might be exceptions, and that such deceptive behaviors might not be common to the species.&lt;ref name="Byrne and Whiten"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byrne |first=Richard |author2=Whiten |title=Tactical deception of familiar individuals in baboons (''Papio ursinus'') |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=1985 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=669–673 |doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among New World monkeys, [[Tufted capuchin]] (''Cebus apella'') monkey subordinates have been found to employ a vocal form of tactical deception when competing with dominant monkeys over valuable food resources. They use alarm calls normally reserved for predator sightings— either barks (used specifically for aerial stimuli), peeps, or hiccups— to elicit a response in fellow group members and then take advantage of the distraction to pilfer food. In a series of experiments directed by Brandon Wheeler a group of tufted capuchin monkeys was provided with bananas on feeding platforms. Here, subordinate monkeys made nearly all of the alarm calls that could be classified as "false", and in many of the false alarms, the caller was on or within two meters of the feeding platform. The calls made dominant monkeys leave the platform while the subordinate caller stayed behind to eat.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wheeler |first=Brandon |title=Monkeys crying wolf? Tufted |journal=The Royal Society |year=2009 |volume=276 |pages=3013–3018 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0544|pmc=2817219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Costs of tactical deception ===
Withholding information, a form of tactical deception, can be costly to the deceiver. For example, rhesus monkeys discovering food announce their discoveries by calling on 45% of occasions. Discoverers who fail to call, but are detected with food by other group members, receive significantly more aggression than vocal discoverers. Moreover, silent female discoverers eat significantly less food than vocal females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Hauser | first1=M. D. | year=1992 | title=Costs of deception: Cheaters are punished in rhesus monkeys | url=http://www.pnas.org/content/89/24/12137.full.pdf | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA | volume=89 | pages=12137–12139 | doi=10.1073/pnas.89.24.12137| pmc=50713 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably because of such costs to deceivers, tactical deception occurs rather rarely. It is thought to be more common in forms and species where the cost of ignoring the possibly deceptive act is even higher than the cost of believing. For example, tufted capuchin monkeys sometimes emit false alarm calls. The cost of ignoring one of these calls could be death, which may lead to a "better safe than sorry" philosophy even when the caller is a known deceiver.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt;

'''Dynamic simulation''' (or dynamic system simulation) is the use of a computer program to model the time varying behavior of a system. The systems are typically described by [[ordinary differential equations]] or [[partial differential equations]]. As [[mathematical model]]s incorporate real-world constraints, like gear [[backlash (engineering)|backlash]] and rebound from a hard stop, equations become nonlinear. This requires numerical methods to solve the equations. A [[numerical simulation]] is done by stepping through a time interval and calculating the integral of the derivatives by approximating the area under the derivative curves. Some methods use a fixed step through the interval, and others use an adaptive step that can shrink or grow automatically to maintain an acceptable error tolerance. Some methods can use different time steps in different parts of the simulation model. Industrial uses of dynamic simulation are many and range from nuclear power, steam turbines, 6 degree of freedom vehicle modeling, electric motors, econometric models, biological systems, robot arms, mass spring dampers, hydraulic systems, and drug dose migration through the human body to name a few. These models can often be run in real time to give a virtual response close to the actual system. This is useful in [[process control]] and [[mechatronic]] systems for tuning the [[automatic control]] systems before they are connected to the real system, or for human training before they control the real system.
Simulation is also used in computer games and animation and can be accelerated by using a [[physics engine]], the technology used in many powerful [[computer graphics]] [[software]] [[computer program|programs]], like [[3ds Max]], [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[Lightwave]], and many others to simulate physical characteristics. In computer animation, things like [[hair]], [[cloth]], [[liquid]], [[fire]], and [[wiktionary:particles|particles]] can be easily modeled, while the human [[animator]] animates simpler objects. Computer-based dynamic animation was first used at a very simple level in the 1989 [[Pixar]] [[short film]] ''Knick Knack'' to move the fake snow in the snowglobe and pebbles in a fish tank.

== Example of dynamic simulation ==
[[Image:TRUE_Procedural_Animation.gif|right|[[Piston motion equations]]|frame]]
This animation was made with a software system dynamics, with a 3D modeler. The calculated values are associated with parameters of the rod and crank. In this example the crank is driving, we vary both the speed of rotation, its radius and the length of the rod, the piston follows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2910">The terms '''easting''' and '''northing''' are [[Geography|geographic]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] for a point. Easting refers to the [[east]]ward-measured distance (or the ''x''-[[coordinate]]), while northing refers to the [[north]]ward-measured distance (or the ''y''-coordinate). When using common projections such as the [[transverse Mercator projection]], these are distances [[Map projection|projected]] on an imaginary surface similar to a bent sheet of paper, and are not the same as distances measured on the [[Figure of the Earth|curved surface of the Earth]].
[[File:Utm-zones.jpg|thumb|UTM-zones]]

Easting and northing coordinates are commonly measured in metres from the axes of some [[datum (geodesy)#Horizontal datum|horizontal datum]]. However, other units (e.g., [[survey feet]]) are also used. The coordinates are most commonly associated with the [[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system#Locating a position using UTM coordinates|Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]] (UTM), which has unique zones that cover the Earth to provide detailed referencing.

==Notation and conventions==
Locations can be found using easting/northing (or '' x'', ''y'') pairs. The pair is usually represented conventionally with easting first, northing second.

For example, the peak of [[Mount Assiniboine]] (at {{coord|50|52|10|N|115|39|03|W}}) in UTM Zone 11 is represented by &lt;code&gt;11U 594934 5636174&lt;/code&gt;. Other conventions can also be used, such as a truncated grid reference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bivouac.com/PgxPg.asp?PgxId=155 |title=Truncated Grid References |publisher=Bivouac.com - Canadian Mountain Encyclopedia|date=2006-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would shorten the example coordinates to &lt;code&gt;949-361&lt;/code&gt;.

Negative northing and easting values indicate a position due south and west of the origin, respectively.

{{anchor|False origin}}{{anchor|Natural origin}}Usually associated with a map projection is a ''natural origin'', e.g., at which the ellipsoid and flat map surfaces coincide.&lt;ref name=OGP7_2&gt;{{cite web|title=Geomatics  Guidance Note Number 7, part 2    Coordinate Conversions and Transformations including Formulas|url=http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|publisher=International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (OGP)|accessdate=5 March 2014|pages=9–10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306005736/http://info.ogp.org.uk/geodesy/guides/docs/G7-2.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that the northing and easting coordinates on a map are not negative, map projections may set up a ''false origin'', specified in terms of ''false northing'' and ''false easting'' values, that offset the true origin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3944">In [[scientific research]], an '''experimental system'''  is the physical, technical and procedural basis for an [[experiment]] or series of experiments.  Historian of science [[Hans-Jörg Rheinberger]] defines an experimental system as: "A basic unit of experimental activity combining local, technical, instrumental, institutional, social, and [[Epistemology|epistemic]] aspects."&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scientists]] (particularly laboratory biologists) and [[historians]] and [[philosophers]] of [[biology]] have pointed to the development and spread of successful experimental systems, such as those based on popular [[model organism]] or scientific apparatus, as key elements in the history of science, particularly since the early 20th century.  The choice of an appropriate experimental system is often seen as critical for a scientist's long-term success, as experimental systems can be very productive for some kinds of questions and less productive for others, acquiring a sort of momentum that takes research in unpredicted directions.&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful experimental system must be stable and reproducible enough for scientists to make sense of the system's behavior, but variable and unpredictable enough that it can produce useful results.  In many cases, a well-understood experimental system can be "[[black-boxed]]" as a standard technique, which can then be a component of other experimental systems.  Rheinberger divides experimental systems into two parts: the part under investigation ("epistemic things") and the well-understood part that provides a stable context for experimentation ("technical objects").&lt;ref&gt;Rheinberger, ''Toward a History of Epistemic Things'', pp. 24-31. Note that the translation from German language introduces an ambiguity, or a possible misunderstanding. The meaning of ''Experimentalsystem'', referring to a system that is the site for experiments, whereas an ''experimentelles System'' is a system that is unfinished and under experimental investigation. Rheinberger uses the former term.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of experimental systems in biology often requires the "[[domestication]]" of a particular organism for the laboratory environment, including the creation of relatively homogeneous lines or [[Strain (biology)|strains]] and the tailoring of conditions to highlight the variable aspects that scientists are interested in.&lt;ref&gt;See Kohler, ''Lords of the Fly''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific technologies, similarly, often require the development of a full experimental system to go from a viable concept to a technique that works in practice on a usefully consistent basis.  For example, the invention of the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is generally attributed to [[Kary Mullis]], who came up with the concept in 1983, but the process of development of PCR into the revolutionary technology it became by the early 1990s took years of work by others at [[Cetus Corporation]]&amp;mdash;and the basic components of the system had been known since the 1960s DNA synthesis work of [[Har Gobind Khorana]]&amp;mdash;making "who invented PCR?" a complicated question.&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, ''Making PCR'', pp. 7-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Beck was born in [[Wiesbaden]], [[Germany]]. He was the son of the businessman Fritz Beck and his wife Margaret Cron. Beck attended the Grammar School in [[Darmstadt]] and after that studied [[physics]] at [[University of Göttingen]] and [[Darmstadt University of Technology]]. As a student of [[Max von Laue]], he performed research on [[superconductivity]]. In the spring of 1950 Beck started work on his PhD thesis entitled ''"The electrodynamic potential in the extended phenomenological theory of superconductivity"'',&lt;ref name="Beck1951"&gt;{{cite journal

==Academic career==
From 1952 to 1954 Beck worked as an assistant at the [[Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG|Fritz Haber Institute]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Beck1955"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Followed a research visit in the [[United States|U.S.]] from 1954 to 1956 as a Research Associate at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. Then Beck went to the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] where in 1958 he wrote a [[Habilitation thesis]] on nuclear reactions as a result of electromagnetic interactions. From 1958 to 1960 he worked as a lecturer both at the University of Munich and [[Heidelberg University]].

In 1960 Beck was appointed an Associate Professor of Theoretical Physics at [[Goethe University Frankfurt]].

In 1963 he became a Professor of Theoretical Physics at [[Darmstadt University of Technology]], where in the same year he took over the management of the Institute for Theoretical Nuclear Physics.

Beck held [[visiting professor]]ship positions several times. From 1974 to 1975 he taught at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], in 1976 at the [[Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro]], in 1979 at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]], in 1983 at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot]], in 1987 at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], in 1988 at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] in [[Beersheba]], and in 1991 at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in [[Johannesburg]].

After Beck's retirement in 1995, his successor at Darmstadt University of Technology became Professor Jochen Wambach.

'''Glass-to-metal seals''' are a very important element of the construction of [[vacuum tube]]s, electric discharge tubes, [[incandescent light bulb]]s, glass encapsulated [[semiconductor diode]]s, [[reed switch]]es, pressure tight glass windows in metal cases, and metal or ceramic packages of [[electronic component]]s.

Properly done, such a seal is [[Hermetic seal|hermetic]] (vacuum tight, good electrical insulation, special optical properties e.g. UV lamps).  To achieve such a seal, two properties must hold:
# The molten glass must be capable of [[wetting]] the metal, in order to form a tight bond, and
# The [[thermal expansion]] of the glass and metal must be closely matched so that the seal remains solid as the assembly cools.

Thinking for example about a metal wire in a glass bulb sealing, the metal glass contact can break if the CTEs (coefficient of thermal expansion) are not well aligned. For the case that the CTE of the metal is larger than the CTE of the glass, the sealing shows a high probability to break upon cooling. By lowering the temperature, the metal wire shrinks more than the glass does, leading to a strong tensile force on the glass, which finally lead to breakage. On the other hand, if the CTE of the glass is larger than the CTE of the metal wire, the seal will tighten upon cooling since compression force is applied on the glass.

[[File:2017-11-16 14 50 51-Alloy.png|thumb|Thermal expansion data for some metals and alloys ]]

According to all requirements that need to be fulfilled and the strong necessity to align the CTE of both materials, there only a few companies offering specialty glass for glass-metal sealing. Such as [[SCHOTT-Rohrglas_GmbH|SCHOTT AG]] and  [http://www.morgantechnicalceramics.com/en-gb/products/glass-components/?_ga=2.46632878.862435219.1523553824-579033178.1474321043 Morgan Advance Materials].

==Glass-to-metal bonds==
Glass and metal can bond together by purely mechanical means, which usually gives weaker joints, or by chemical interaction, where the oxide layer on the metal surface forms a strong bond with the glass. The [[acid-base reaction]]s are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the presence of metal oxides on the surface of metal. After complete dissolution of the surface oxides into the glass, further progress of interaction depends on the oxygen [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] at the interface. The oxygen [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] can be increased by diffusion of [[Allotropes of oxygen|molecular oxygen]] through some defects like cracks. Also, reduction of the thermodynamically less stable components in the glass (and releasing the oxygen ions) can increase the oxygen [[Thermodynamic activity|activity]] at the interface. In other words, the [[redox]] reactions are main causes of interaction between glass-metal in the absence of metal oxides on the surface of metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319915024751|author1=M. Fakouri Hasanabadi|author2=A. Nemati|author3=A. H. Kokabi|lastauthoramp=y|title=Effect of intermediate nickel layer on seal strength and chemical compatibility of glass and ferritic stainless steel in oxidizing environment for solid oxide fuel cells|journal=Int. J. Hydrogen Energy|volume=40|issue=46|pp=16434–16442|date=October 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2015.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For achieving a vacuum-tight seal, the seal must not contain bubbles. The bubbles are most commonly created by gases escaping the metal at high temperature; degassing the metal before its sealing is therefore important, especially for nickel and iron and their alloys. This is achieved by heating the metal in vacuum or sometimes in hydrogen atmosphere or in some cases even in air at temperatures above those used during the sealing process. Oxidizing of the metal surface also reduces gas evolution. Most of the evolved gas is produced due to the presence of [[carbon]] impurities in the metals; these can be removed by heating in hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "vacsealtec"&gt;{{cite book| author = Alexander Roth| title = Vacuum Sealing Techniques| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sdKAPJh5RgQC| date = 1997-05-27| publisher = Springer| isbn = 978-1-56396-259-2| page = 151 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass-oxide bond is stronger than glass-metal. The oxide forms a layer on the metal surface, with the proportion of oxygen changing from zero in the metal to the stoichiometry of the oxide and the glass itself. A too thick oxide layer tends to be porous on the surface and mechanically weak, flaking, compromising the bond strength and creating possible leakage paths along the metal-oxide interface. Proper thickness of the oxide layer is therefore critical.

===Copper===
Metallic [[copper]] does not bond well to glass. [[Copper(I) oxide]], however, is wetted by molten glass and partially dissolves in it, forming a strong bond. The oxide also bonds well to the underlying metal. But [[copper(II) oxide]] causes weak joints that may leak and its formation has to be prevented.

For bonding copper to glass, the surface has to be properly oxidized. The oxide layer has to have the right thickness; too thin oxide would not provide enough material for the glass to anchor to, too thick oxide would fail in the oxide layer, and in both cases the joint would be weak and possibly non-hermetic. To improve the bonding to glass, the oxide layer should be borated; this is achieved by e.g. dipping the hot part into a concentrated solution of [[borax]] and then heating it again for certain time. This treatment stabilizes the oxide layer by forming a thin protective layer of [[sodium borate]] on its surface, so the oxide does not grow too thick during subsequent handling and joining. The layer should have uniform deep red to purple sheen.&lt;ref name="elmatpack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="handbeltube"/&gt; The boron oxide from the borated layer diffuses into glass and lowers its melting point. The oxidation occurs by oxygen diffusing through the molten borate layer and forming copper(I) oxide, while formation of copper(II) oxide is inhibited.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

The copper-to-glass seal should look brilliant red, almost scarlet; pink, sherry and honey colors are also acceptable. Too thin oxide layer looks light, up to the color of metallic copper. Too thick oxide looks too dark.

[[Oxygen-free copper]] has to be used if the metal comes in contact with [[hydrogen]] (e.g. in a [[gas-filled tube|hydrogen-filled tube]] or during handling in the flame). Normally, copper contains small inclusions of [[copper(I) oxide]]. Hydrogen diffuses through the metal and reacts with the oxide, reducing it to copper and yielding water. The water molecules however can not diffuse through the metal, are trapped in the location of the inclusion, and cause [[hydrogen embrittlement|embrittlement]].

As copper bonds well to the glass, it is often used for combined glass-metal devices. The ductility of copper can be used for compensation of the thermal expansion mismatch in e.g. the knife-edge seals. For wire feed throughs, [[dumet]] wire – nickel-iron alloy plated with copper – is frequently used. Its maximum diameter is however limited to about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm due to its thermal expansion.

Copper can be sealed to glass without the oxide layer, but the resulting joint is less strong.

===Platinum===
[[Platinum]] has similar thermal expansion as glass and is well-wetted with molten glass. It however does not form oxides, its bond strength is lower. The seal has metallic color and limited strength.

===Gold===
Like platinum, [[gold]] does not form oxides that could assist in bonding. Glass-gold bonds are therefore metallic in color and weak. Gold tends to be used for glass-metal seals only rarely. Special compositions of soda-lime glasses that match the thermal expansion of gold, containing [[tungsten trioxide]] and oxides of lanthanum, aluminum and zirconium, exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3847628.html|title=METAL-TO-GLASS JOINT|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silver===
[[Silver]] forms a thin layer of [[silver oxide]] on its surface. This layer dissolves in molten glass and forms [[silver silicate]], facilitating a strong bond.&lt;ref name="metalweld"&gt;{{cite book| author = John Frederik Lancaster| title = Metallurgy of welding| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-Xq6WaCKGwYC| year = 1999| publisher = Woodhead Publishing| isbn = 978-1-85573-428-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nickel===
[[Nickel]] can bond with glass either as a metal, or via the [[nickel(II) oxide]] layer. The metal joint has metallic color and inferior strength. The oxide-layer joint has characteristic green-grey color. Nickel plating can be used in similar way as copper plating, to facilitate better bonding with the underlying metal.&lt;ref name="elmatpack"&gt;{{cite book| author = Merrill L. Minges| title = Electronic Materials Handbook: Packaging| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=c2YxCCaM9RIC| year = 1989| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-87170-285-2| last2 = Handbook Committee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron===
[[Iron]] is only rarely used for feedthroughs, but frequently gets coated with [[vitreous enamel]], where the interface is also a glass-metal bond. The bond strength is also governed by the character of the oxide layer on its surface. A presence of [[cobalt]] in the glass leads to a chemical reaction between the metallic iron and cobalt oxide, yielding iron oxide dissolved in glass and cobalt alloying with the iron and forming [[dendrite (metal)|dendrites]], growing into the glass and improving the bond strength.&lt;ref name="metalweld"/&gt;

Iron can not be directly sealed to [[lead glass]], as it reacts with the lead oxide and reduces it to metallic lead. For sealing to lead glasses, it has to be copper-plated or an intermediate lead-free glass has to be used. Iron is prone to creating gas bubbles in glass due to the residual carbon impurities; these can be removed by heating in wet hydrogen. Plating with copper, nickel or chromium is also advised.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Chromium===
[[Chromium]] is a highly reactive metal present in many iron alloys. Chromium may react with glass, reducing the silicon and forming crystals of [[chromium silicide]] growing into the glass and anchoring together the metal and glass, improving the bond strength.&lt;ref name="metalweld"/&gt;

===Kovar===
[[Kovar]], an iron-nickel-cobalt alloy, has low thermal expansion similar to [[Borosilicate glass|high-borosilicate glass]] and is frequently used for glass-metal seals especially for the application in [[x-ray tubes]] or glass lasers. It can bond to glass via the intermediate oxide layer of [[nickel(II) oxide]] and [[cobalt(II) oxide]]; the proportion of iron oxide is low due to its reduction with cobalt. The bond strength is highly dependent on the oxide layer thickness and character.&lt;ref name="handbeltube"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metalweld"/&gt; The presence of cobalt makes the oxide layer easier to melt and dissolve in the molten glass. A grey, grey-blue or grey-brown color indicates a good seal. A metallic color indicates lack of oxide, while black color indicates overly oxidized metal, in both cases leading to a weak joint.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Molybdenum===
[[Molybdenum]] bonds to the glass via the intermediate layer of [[molybdenum(IV) oxide]]. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, molybdenum, like tungsten, is often used for glass-metal bonds especially in conjunction with aluminium-silicate glass. Its high electrical conductivity makes it superior over nickel-cobalt-iron alloys. It is favored by the lighting industry as feedthroughs for lightbulbs and other devices. Molybdenum oxidizes much faster than tungsten and quickly develops a thick oxide layer that does not adhere well, its oxidation should be therefore limited to just yellowish or at most blue-green color. The oxide is volatile and evaporates as a white smoke above 700&amp;nbsp;°C; excess oxide can be removed by heating in inert gas (argon) at 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Molybdenum strips are used instead of wires where higher currents (and higher cross-sections of the conductors) are needed.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Tungsten===
[[Tungsten]] bonds to the glass via the intermediate layer of [[tungsten(VI) oxide]]. A properly formed bond has characteristic coppery/orange/brown-yellow color in lithium-free glasses; in lithium-containing glasses the bond is blue due to formation of [[lithium tungstate]]. Due to its low thermal expansion coefficient, matched to glass, tungsten is frequently used for glass-metal bonds. Tungsten forms satisfying bonds with glasses with similar thermal expansion coefficient such as [[Borosilicate glass|high-borosilicate glass]]. The surface of both the metal and glass should be smooth, without scratches.&lt;ref name="handbeltube"&gt;{{cite book| author = Fred Rosebury| title = Handbook of electron tube and vacuum techniques| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yBmnnaODnHgC| date = 1992-12-31| publisher = American Institute  . of Physics| isbn = 978-1-56396-121-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tungsten has the lowest expansion coefficient of metals and the highest melting point.

===Stainless steel===
304 [[Stainless steel]] forms bonds with glass via an intermediate layer of [[chromium(III) oxide]] and [[iron(III) oxide]]. Further reactions of chromium, forming chromium silicide dendrites, are possible. The thermal expansion coefficient of steel is however fairly different from the glass; like with copper, this can be alleviated by using knife-edge (Housekeeper) seals.&lt;ref name="handbeltube"/&gt;

===Zirconium===
[[Zirconium]] wire can be sealed to glass with just little treatment – rubbing with abrasive paper and short heating in flame. Zirconium is used in applications demanding chemical resistance or lack of magnetism.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Titanium===
[[Titanium]], like zirconium, can be sealed to some glasses with just little treatment.&lt;ref name="vacsealtec"/&gt;

===Indium===
[[Indium]] and some of its alloys can be used as a [[solder]] capable of wetting glass, ceramics, and metals and joining them together. Indium has low melting point and is very soft; the softness allows it to deform plastically and absorb the stresses from thermal expansion mismatches. Due to its very low vapor pressure, indium finds use in glass-metal seals used in vacuum technology.&lt;ref name="vacphystech"&gt;{{cite book|  title = Vacuum physics and technology| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tfLWfAx1ZWQC| year = 1979| isbn = 978-0-12-475914-5| last2 = Carlson| author1 = Weissler| first1 = G. L| first2 = Robert Warner }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gallium===
[[Gallium]] is a soft metal with melting point at 30&amp;nbsp;°C. It readily wets glasses and most metals and can be used for seals that can be assembled/disassembled by just slight heating. It can be used as a [[liquid seal]] up to high temperatures or even at lower temperatures when alloyed with other metals (e.g. as [[galinstan]]).&lt;ref name="vacphystech"/&gt;

===Mercury===
[[mercury (element)|Mercury]] is a metal liquid at normal temperature. It was used as the earliest glass-to-metal seal and is still in use for [[liquid seal]]s for e.g. rotary shafts.

==Mercury seal==
The first technological use of a glass-to-metal seal was the encapsulation of the [[vacuum]] in the [[barometer]] by [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricelli]]. The liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] wets the glass and thus provides for a vacuum tight seal. Liquid mercury was also used to seal the metal leads of early [[mercury arc lamp]]s into the [[fused silica]] bulbs.

A less toxic and more expensive alternative to mercury is [[gallium]].

Mercury and gallium seals can be used for vacuum-sealing rotary shafts.

==Platinum wire seal==
The next step was to use thin [[platinum]] [[wire]]. Platinum is easily [[wetting|wetted]] by glass and has a similar [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] as typical [[soda-lime glass|soda-lime]] and [[lead glass]]. It is also easy to work with because of its
non-oxidibility and high melting point. This type of seal was used in scientific equipment throughout the 19th century and also in the early incandescent lamps and radio tubes.

==Dumet wire seal==
In 1911 the [[Fernico|Dumet]]-wire seal was invented which is still the common practice to seal [[copper]] leads through soda-lime or lead glass. If copper is properly oxidised before it is wetted by molten glass a vacuum tight seal of good mechanical strength can be obtained. After copper is oxidized, it is often dipped in a borax solution, as borating the copper helps prevents over-oxidation when reintroduced to a flame. Simple copper wire is not usable because its coefficient of thermal expansion is much higher than that of the glass. Thus, on cooling a strong tensile force acts on the glass-to-metal interface and it breaks. Glass and glass-to-metal interfaces are especially sensitive to tensile stress. Dumet-wire is a copper clad wire (about 25% of the weight of the wire is copper) with a core of nickel-iron alloy 42, an alloy with a composition of about 42% nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlcelectromet.com/dumetwire.htm|title=JLC Electromet - Dumet Wire: Copper-Clad Ni-Fe Alloy Wire|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218044952/http://www.jlcelectromet.com/dumetwire.htm|archivedate=2010-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The core has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing for a wire with a coefficient of radial thermal expansion which is slightly lower than the linear coefficient of thermal expansion of the glass, so that the glass-to-metal interface is under a low compression stress. It is not possible to adjust the axial thermal expansion of the wire as well. Because of the much higher mechanical strength of the nickel-iron core compared to the copper, the axial thermal expansion of the Dumet-wire is about the same as of the core. Thus, a shear stress builds up which is limited to a safe value by the low tensile strength of the copper. This is also the reason why Dumet is only useful for wire diameters lower than about 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm. In a typical Dumet seal through the base of a vacuum tube a short piece of Dumet-wire is butt welded to a nickel wire at one end and a copper wire at the other end. When the base is pressed of lead glass the Dumet-wire and a short part of the nickel and the copper wire are enclosed in the glass. Then the nickel wire and the glass around the Dumet-wire are heated by a gas flame and the glass seals to the Dumet-wire. The nickel and copper do not seal vacuum tight to the glass but are mechanically supported. The butt welding also avoids problems with gas-leakages at the interface between the core wire and the copper.

==Copper tube seal==
[[File:Glass to metal seals 1922.png|thumb|Three types of copper tube seals (from ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]'', 1922). In A, the edge of the copper is not in contact with the glass. In B and C, the copper is machined to a sharp knife edge in contact with the glass, with the glass either inside (B) or outside (C) of the copper.]]

Another possibility to avoid a strong tensile stress when sealing copper through glass is the use of a thin walled copper tube instead of a solid wire. Here a shear stress builds up in the glass-to-metal interface which is limited by the low tensile strength of the copper combined with a low tensile stress. The copper tube is insensitive to high electric current compared to a Dumet-seal because on heating the tensile stress converts into a compression stress which is again limited by the tensile strength of the copper. Also, it is possible to lead an additional solid copper wire through the copper tube. In a later variant, only a short section of the copper tube has a thin wall and the copper tube is hindered to shrink at cooling by a ceramic tube
inside the copper tube.

If large parts of copper are to be fitted to glass like the water cooled copper anode of a high power radio transmitter tube or an x-ray tube historically the Houskeeper knife edge seal is used. Here the end of a copper tube is machined to a sharp knife edge, invented by O. Kruh in 1917. In the method described by W.G. Houskeeper the outside or the inside of the
copper tube right to the knife edge is wetted with glass and connected to the [[glass tube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Handbook of materials and techniques for vacuum devices| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-Ll6qjWB-RUC| year = 1967| publisher = American Institute of Physics| isbn = 978-1-56396-387-2| author1 = Kohl| first1 = Walter Heinrich }}&lt;/ref&gt; In later descriptions the knife edge is just wetted several millimeters deep with glass, usually deeper on the inside, and then connected to the [[glass tube]].

If copper is sealed to glass, it is an advantage to get a thin bright red {{chem|Cu|2|O}} containing layer between copper and glass. This is done by borating. After W.J. Scott a copper plated tungsten wire is immersed for about 30 s in chromic acid and
then washed thoroughly in running tap water. Then it is dipped into a saturated solution of borax and heated to bright red heat
in the oxidizing part of a gas flame. Possibly followed by quenching in water and drying. Another method is to oxidize the
copper slightly in a gas flame and then to dip it into borax solution and let it dry. The surface of the borated
copper is black when hot and turns to dark wine red on cooling.

It is also possible to make a bright seal between copper and glass where it is possible to see the blank copper surface through the glass, but this gives less adherence than the seal with the red {{chem|Cu|2|O}} containing layer. If glass is melted on
copper in a reducing hydrogen atmosphere the seal is extremely weak. If copper is to be heated in hydrogen-containing atmosphere e.g. a gas flame it
needs to be oxygen-free to prevent hydrogen embrittlement. Copper which is meant to be used as an electrical conductor is not necessarily oxygen-free
and contains particles of {{chem|Cu|2|O}} which react with hydrogen that diffuses into the copper to {{chem|H|2|O}} which cannot diffuse out-off the
copper and thus causes embrittlement. The copper usually used in vacuum applications is of the very pure [[OFHC]] (oxygen-free-high-conductivity)
quality which is both free of {{chem|Cu|2|O}} and deoxidising additives which might evaporate at high temperature in vacuum.

==Copper disc seal==
In the copper disc seal, as proposed by W.G. Houskeeper, the end of a [[glass tube]] is closed by a round copper disc. An additional ring of glass on the opposite side of the disc increases the possible thickness of the disc to more than 0.3&amp;nbsp;mm. Best mechanical strength is obtained if both sides of the disc are fused to the same type of [[glass tube]] and both tubes are under vacuum. The disc seal is of special practical interest because it is a simple method to make a seal to low expansion borosilicate glass without the need of special tools or materials. The keys to success are proper borating, heating of the joint to a temperature as close to the melting point of the copper as possible and to slow down the cooling, at least by packing the assembly into glass wool while it is still red hot.

==Matched seal==
[[File:Matched glass-to-metal seals.JPG|thumb|Matched glass-to-metal seals]]
In a matched seal the thermal expansion of metal and glass is matched. Copper-plated tungsten wire can be used to seal through borosilicate glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion which is matched by tungsten. The tungsten is electrolytically copper plated and heated in hydrogen atmosphere to fill cracks in the tungsten and to get a proper surface to easily seal to glass. The borosilicate glass of usual [[laboratory glassware]] has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than tungsten, thus it is necessary to use an intermediate sealing glass to get a stress-free seal.

There are combinations of glass and iron-nickel-cobalt alloys ([[Kovar]]) where even the non-linearity of the thermal expansion is matched. These alloys can be directly sealed to glass, but then the oxidation is critical. Also, their low electrical conductivity is a disadvantage. Thus, they are often gold plated. It is also possible to use silver plating, but then an additional gold layer is necessary as an oxygen diffusion barrier to prevent the formation of iron oxide.

While there are Fe-Ni alloys which match the thermal expansion of tungsten at room temperature, they are not useful to seal to glass because of a too strong increase of their thermal expansion at higher temperatures.

Reed switches use a matched seal between an iron-nickel alloy (NiFe 52) and a matched glass. The glass of reed switches is usually green due to its iron content because the sealing of reed switches is done by heating with infrared radiation and this glass shows a high absorption in the near infrared.

The electrical connections of high-pressure sodium vapour lamps, the yellow lamps for street lighting, are made of niobium alloyed with 1% of zirconium.&lt;ref&gt;stahl und eisen 130 (2010), Vol. 2, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some television cathode ray tubes were made by using ferric steel for the funnel and glass matched in expansion to ferric steel. The steel plate used had a diffusion layer enriched with chromium at the surface made by heating the steel together with chromium oxide in a HCl-containing atmosphere. In contrast to copper, pure iron does not bond strongly to silicate glass. Also, technical iron contains some carbon which forms bubbles of CO when it is sealed to glass under oxidizing conditions. Both are a major source of problems for the technical enamel coating of steel and make direct seals between iron and glass unsuitable for high vacuum applications. The oxide layer formed on chromium-containing steel can seal vacuum tight to glass and the chromium strongly reacts with carbon. Silver-plated iron was used in early microwave tubes.

It is possible to make matched seals between copper or austenitic steel and glass, but silicate glass with that high thermal expansion is especially fragile and has a low chemical durability.

==Molybdenum foil seal==
Another widely used method to seal through glass with low coefficient of thermal expansion is the use of strips of thin molybdenum foil. This can be done with matched coefficients of thermal expansion. Then the edges of the strip also have to be knife sharp. The disadvantage here is that the tip of the edge which is a local point of high tensile stress reaches through the wall of the [[glass container]]. This can lead to low gas leakages. In the tube to tube knife edge seal the edge is either outside, inside, or buried into the glass wall.

==Compression seal==
[[File:Semi-hermetic compressor multipole feedthrough (compression glass-to-metal-seal).JPG|thumb|Semi-hermetic compressor multipole feedthrough (compression glass-to-metal-seal]]
Another possibility of seal construction is the compression seal. This type of glass-to-metal seal can be used to feed through the wall of a metal container. Here the wire is usually matched to the glass which is inside of the bore of a strong metal part with higher coefficient of thermal expansion. Compression seals can withstand extremely high pressures and physical stress such as mechanical and thermal shock. Because glass is extremely strong in compression, compression seals can withstand very high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hermetic Seal {{!}} Glass-to-Metal Seal {{!}} Elan Technology in USA|url = http://www.elantechnology.com/glass/glass-metal-hermetic-seal/|website = Elan Technology|accessdate = 2015-12-03|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Silver chloride==
[[Silver chloride]], which melts at 457 C bonds to glass, metals and other materials and has been used for vacuum seals. Even if it can be a convenient way to seal metal into glass it will not be a true glass to metal seal but rather a combination of a glass to silver chloride and a silver chloride to glass bond, an inorganic alternative to wax or glue bonds.

==Design aspects==
Also the mechanical design of a glass-to-metal seal has an important influence on the reliability of the seal. In practical glass-to-metal seals cracks usually start at the edge of the interface between glass and metal either inside or outside the glass container. If the metal and the surrounding glass are symmetric the crack propagates in an angle away from the axis. So, if the glass envelope of the metal wire extends far enough from the wall of the container the crack will not go through the wall of the container but it will reach the surface on the same side where it started and the seal will not leak despite the crack.

Another important aspect is the [[wetting]] of the metal by the glass. If the thermal expansion of the metal is higher than the thermal expansion of
the glass like with the Housekeeper seal, a high contact angle (bad wetting) means that there is a high tensile stress in the surface of the glass
near the metal. Such seals usually break inside the glass and leave a thin cover of glass on the metal. If the contact angle is low (good wetting)
the surface of the glass is everywhere under compression stress like an [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] coating. Ordinary soda-lime glass does not flow on copper at temperatures below the melting point of the copper and, thus, does not give a low contact angle. The solution is to cover the copper with a
[[Solder#Glass solder|solder glass]] which has a low melting point and does flow on copper and then to press the soft soda-lime glass onto the copper. The solder glass
must have a coefficient of thermal expansion which is equal or a little lower than that of the soda-lime glass. Classically high lead containing
glasses are used, but it is also possible to substitute these by multi-component glasses e.g. based on the
system {{chem|Li|2|O}}-{{chem|Na|2|O}}-{{chem|K|2|O}}-{{chem|CaO}}-{{chem|SiO|2}}-{{chem|B|2|O|3}}-{{chem|ZnO}}-{{chem|TiO|2}}-{{chem|BaO}}-{{chem|Al|2|O|3}}.

The '''grizzly bear''' (''Ursus arctos'' ssp.) is a large [[population]] of the [[brown bear]] inhabiting [[North America]]. Scientists generally do not use the name grizzly bear but call it the '''North American brown bear'''.

Multiple morphological forms sometimes recognized as [[subspecies]] exist, including the mainland grizzly (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), [[Kodiak bear]] (''U. a. middendorffi''), [[Alaska Peninsula brown bear|peninsular grizzly]] (''U. a. gyas''), and the recently extinct [[California grizzly bear|California grizzly]] (''U. a. californicus''†)&lt;ref name=Schwartz&gt;Schwartz, C.

==Classification==

===Meaning of "grizzly"===
[[Meriwether Lewis]] and [[William Clark]] first described it as ''grisley'', which could be interpreted as either "[[wikt:grizzly|grizzly]]" (i.e., "grizzled"—that is, with golden and grey tips of the hair) or "[[wikt:grisly|grisly]]" ("fear-inspiring", now usually "gruesome").&lt;ref name="Wright 1909"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=William Henry|title=The Grizzly Bear: The Narrative of a Hunter-naturalist, Historical, Scientific and Adventurous|date=1909|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kOtGAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=great+naked+bear|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern spelling supposes the former meaning; even so, naturalist [[George Ord]] formally classified it in 1815 as ''U. horribilis'', not for its hair, but for its character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grisly indeed, Grizzly Island was aptly named|url=http://www.dailyrepublic.com/uncategorized/grisly-indeed-grizzly-island-was-aptly-named/|publisher=Daily Republic|accessdate=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution and genetics===

====Grizzly phylogenetics====
Classification has been revised along genetic lines.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt; There are two morphological forms of ''Ursus arctos'', the grizzly and the coastal brown bears, but these morphological forms do not have distinct [[mtDNA]] lineages.&lt;ref name="Cronin et al. 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronin|first1=M. A.|last2=Armstrup|first2=S. C.|last3=Garner, and E. R. Vyse|first3=G. W.|last4=Vyse|first4=E.R.|title=Interspecific and intraspecific mitochondrial DNA variation in North American bears (Ursus)|journal=Can. J.

==== ''Ursus arctos'' - the brown bear====
[[Brown bear]]s originated in [[Eurasia]] and traveled to North America approximately 50,000 years ago,&lt;ref name="Blood"&gt;{{cite web |last=Blood |first=D. A. |year=2002 |title=Grizzly Bears in British Columbia |location=Province of British Columbia |publisher=Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/grzzlybear.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paabo 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Paabo|first1=Svante|title=Of bears, conservation genetics, and the value of time travel|journal=PNAS|date=February 15, 2000|volume=97|issue=4|pages=1320–1321|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/4/1320.full.pdf+html|accessdate=25 January 2016|doi=10.1073/pnas.97.4.1320|pmid=10677456|pmc=34293}}&lt;/ref&gt; spreading into the contiguous United States about 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Leonard et al. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leonard|first1=J.A.|last2=Wayne|first2=R.K.|last3=Cooper|first3=A.|title=Population genetics of ice age brown bears|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=2000|volume=97|issue=4|pages=1651–1654|doi=10.1073/pnas.040453097|pmid=10677513|pmc=26490}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 19th century, the grizzly was classified as 86 distinct species. However, by 1928 only seven grizzlies remained&lt;ref name="Storer &amp; Tevis 1955" /&gt; and by 1953 only one species remained globally.&lt;ref name="Erdbrink 1953"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdbrink|first1=D.P.|title=A review of the fossil and extinct bears of the old world|date=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern genetic testing reveals the grizzly to be a subspecies of the brown bear (''Ursus arctos''). Rausch found that North America has but one species of grizzly.&lt;ref name="Rausch 1953"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rausch|first1=Robert|title=On the status of some arctic animals|journal=Arctic|date=1953|volume=6|issue=2|pages=91–148|doi=10.14430/arctic3870}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, everywhere it is the "brown bear"; in North America, it is the "grizzly", but these are all the same species, ''Ursus arctos''.

==== ''Ursus arctos'' subspecies in North America====
In 1963 Rausch reduced the number of North American subspecies to one, ''Ursus arctos middendorffi''&lt;ref name="Rausch 1963"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rausch|first1=R.L.|title=Geographic variation in size in North American brown bears, Ursus arctos L., as indicated by condylobasal length|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1963|volume=41|pages=33–45|doi=10.1139/z63-005}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 January 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Further testing of [[Y-chromosome]]s is required to yield an accurate new taxonomy with different subspecies.&lt;ref name=Schwartz/&gt;

Coastal grizzlies, often referred to by the popular but geographically redundant synonym of "brown bear" or "Alaskan brown bear" are larger and darker than inland grizzlies, which is why they, too, were considered a different species from grizzlies. [[Kodiak bear|Kodiak]] grizzly bears were also at one time considered distinct. Therefore, at one time there were five different "species" of brown bear, including three in North America.&lt;ref&gt;''Grizz: Of Men and the Great Bear.'' National Geographic Article, February 1986. Douglas H. Chadwick.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although variable in color from blond to nearly black, grizzly bear fur is typically brown with darker legs and commonly white or blond tipped fur on the flank and back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A001 Species Profile: Grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos horribilis'')] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111015043034/http://ecos.fws.gov/speciesProfile/profile/speciesProfile.action?spcode=A001 |date=15 October 2011 }}.

Retrieved 17 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A pronounced hump appears on their shoulders; the hump is a good way to distinguish a grizzly bear from a black bear, as black bears do not have this hump. Aside from the distinguishing hump a grizzly bear can be identified by a "dished in" profile of their face with short, rounded ears, whereas a black bear has a straight face profile and longer ears.&lt;ref name="westernwildlife.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Western Wildlife Outreach Project: Grizzly Bear Identification|url=http://westernwildlife.org/grizzly-bear-outreach-project/bear-identification/|website=Western Wildlife Outreach Project|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A grizzly bear can also be identified by its rump, which is lower than its shoulders, while a black bear's rump is higher.&lt;ref name="westernwildlife.org"/&gt; A grizzly bear's front claws measure about 2–4 inches in length and a black bear's measure about 1–2 inches in length.&lt;ref name="westernwildlife.org"/&gt;

===North America===
There are currently about 55,000 wild grizzly bears total located throughout North America, most of which reside in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt; Only about 1,500 grizzlies are left in the lower 48 states of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear Facts {{!}} National Geographic|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/articles/grizzly-bear-facts/|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321022032/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/articles/grizzly-bear-facts/|archivedate=21 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, about 800 live in [[Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montanakids {{!}} Grizzly Bears|url=http://montanakids.com/plants_and_animals/animals/grizzly_bears.htm|publisher=Montanakids |accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 600 more live in [[Wyoming]], in the Yellowstone-Teton area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With Deadly Attacks Up, Federal Officials Prepare to Remove Grizzly Protections|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/While-A-Federal-Agency-Works-to-Remove-the-Grizzly-Bear-from-the-Endangered-Species-List-Conservationists-Worry.html?page=all|publisher=outsideonline.com|accessdate=18 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130805165435/http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/While-A-Federal-Agency-Works-to-Remove-the-Grizzly-Bear-from-the-Endangered-Species-List-Conservationists-Worry.html?page=all|archivedate=5 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 70–100 grizzly bears living in northern and eastern [[Idaho]]. Its original range included much of the [[Great Plains]] and the [[American Southwest|southwestern states]], but it has been [[Local extinction|extirpated]] in most of those areas. Combining Canada and the United States, grizzly bears inhabit approximately half the area of their historical range.&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt;

Although the once-abundant grizzly bear (see [[California grizzly bear]]) appears prominently on the state flag of [[California]] and was the symbol of the [[Bear Flag Republic]] before California's admission to the Union, they are no longer naturally present.  The last grizzly in all of California was killed in the Sierra foothills east of [[Fresno]] in August 1922.&lt;ref name=library.ca.gov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.ca.gov/history/symbols.html|title=California State Library – History and Culture – State Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, a hunter produced evidence of one bear in the [[Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness]] [[ecosystem]], by killing a male grizzly bear there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2007/09/12/news/local/news03.txt |title=Grizzly shot in Selway-Bitterroot |website=[[Missoulian]] website |date=12 September 2007 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164942/http://www.missoulian.com/articles/2007/09/12/news/local/news03.txt |archivedate=12 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[North Cascades]] ecosystem of northern [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], grizzly bear populations are estimated to be fewer than 20 bears. One sighting of a grizzly bear in 2010 has been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/rare-grizzly-bear-photographed-in-north-cascades/ |title=Rare grizzly bear photographed in North Cascades |last=Welch |first=Craig |date=2 July 2011 |access-date=13 February 2017 |work=Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been no confirmed sighting of a grizzly in Colorado since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife Officials Hope Grizzly Bears Stay Out Of Colorado|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2012/05/23/wildlife-officials-hope-grizzly-bears-stay-out-of-colorado/|publisher=CBS Denver|date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other provinces and the United States may use a combination of methods for population estimates. Therefore, it is difficult to say precisely what methods were used to produce total population estimates for Canada and North America, as they were likely developed from a variety of studies. The grizzly bear currently has legal protection in [[Mexico]], [[European countries]], some areas of Canada and in the United States. However, it is expected that repopulating its former range will be a slow process, due to a variety of reasons including the bear's slow reproductive habits and the effects of reintroducing such a large animal to areas prized for agriculture and livestock. Competition with other predators and predation on cubs are other possible limiting factors for grizzly bear recovery, though grizzly bears also benefit from [[Kleptoparasite|scavenged carcasses from predators]] as an easy food source when other food sources decline.

==Biology==
===Hibernation===
Grizzly bears hibernate for 5–7 months each year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nwf.org/wildlife/wildlife-library/mammals/grizzly-bear.aspx|publisher= National Wildlife Federation|title=Hibernation in grizzly bears}}&lt;/ref&gt; except where the climate is warm, as the [[California grizzly]] did not hibernate.&lt;ref name="Storer &amp; Tevis 1955" /&gt; During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength for the remainder of the hibernation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animalfactguide.com/animal-facts/grizzly-bear/ |title=Grizzly Bear |publisher=Animal Fact Guide |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare a den, and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_10/Hellgren_Vol_10.pdf |journal=Ursus |year=1998 |volume=10 |page=467 |title=Physiology of hibernation in bears |first=Eric |last=Hellgren }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for winter, bears can gain approximately {{convert|180|kg|abbr=on}}, during a period of [[hyperphagia]], before going into [[hibernation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Hibernation-Migration-Fascination" Narrative|url=http://www.nps.gov/glac/forteachers/hibernation-migration-fascination-narrative.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bear often waits for a substantial snowstorm before it enters its den: such behavior lessens the chances predators will find the den. The dens are typically at elevations above {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} on north-facing slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear Information, Photos, and Facts|url=https://americanexpedition.us/grizzly-bear-information-facts-photos-and-artwork|publisher=American Expedition}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate amongst professionals as to whether grizzly bears technically hibernate: much of this debate revolves around body temperature and the ability of the bears to move around during hibernation on occasion. Grizzly bears can "partially" recycle their body wastes during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denning and Hibernation Behavior|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/denning.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although inland or Rocky Mountain grizzlies spend nearly half of their life in dens, coastal grizzlies with better access to food sources spend less time in dens. In some areas where food is very plentiful year round, grizzly bears skip hibernation altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Are Grizzly Bears Awake &amp; When Do They Sleep?|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/grizzly-bears-awake-sleep-1603.html|publisher=Demand Media|author=Di Jensen, Elle }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reproduction===
[[File:Grizzlymumcubs-c01.jpg|thumb|Sow with two cubs in the [[Kananaskis Country|Kananaskis]]]]
Except for females with cubs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/grizzly-bear/ Grizzly Bears, Grizzly Bear Pictures, Grizzly Bear Facts – National Geographic]. Animals.nationalgeographic.com. Retrieved 17 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; grizzlies are normally [[wiktionary:solitary|solitary]], active animals, but in [[coast]]al areas, grizzlies gather around streams, lakes, rivers, and ponds during the [[Salmon run|salmon spawn]]. Every other year, females (sows) produce one to four young (usually two) that are small and weigh only about {{convert|450|g|lb|sigfig=1}} at birth. A sow is protective of her offspring and will attack if she thinks she or her cubs are threatened.

Grizzly bears have one of the lowest reproductive rates of all terrestrial mammals in North America.&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pacificwild.org/site/great_bear_rainforest/conservation_priorities/sport_hunting.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331050354/http://www.pacificwild.org/site/great_bear_rainforest/conservation_priorities/sport_hunting.html |archivedate=31 March 2009 |website=Pacific Wild |title=Trophy Hunting of BC Grizzly Bears}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to numerous ecological factors. Grizzly bears do not reach sexual maturity until they are at least five years old.&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edupeca"/&gt; Once mated with a male in the summer, the female delays embryo implantation until hibernation, during which miscarriage can occur if the female does not receive the proper nutrients and caloric intake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0003464 |title=Grizzly Bear |website=The Canadian Encyclopedia |first=Stephen |last=Herrero |authorlink=Stephen Herrero}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, females produce two cubs in a litter&lt;ref name="edupeca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edu.pe.ca/southernkings/grizzly.htm |title=Endangered Wildlife: Grizzly Bear |first=Jason |last=MacDonald |first2=Paula |last2=MacDonald |first3=Mitchell |last3=MacPhee |lastauthoramp=yes |first4=Paige |last4=Nicolle |website=Edu.pe.ca }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mother cares for the cubs for up to two years, during which the mother will not mate.&lt;ref name="Blood"/&gt;

Litter size is between one and four cubs, averaging twins or triplets. Cubs are always born in the mother's winter den while she is in hibernation. Female grizzlies are fiercely protective of their cubs, being able to fend off predators as large as male bears bigger than they are in defense of the cubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear Wars: Rare Photos of a Mamma Grizzly Battling a Huge Male to Protect Her Cub|url=http://www.fieldandstream.com/photos/gallery/hunting/2011/03/grizzly-bears-cubs-photos-wild-fight-war|publisher=Field and Stream|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cubs feed entirely on their mother's milk until summer comes, after which they still drink milk but begin to eat solid foods. Cubs gain weight rapidly during their time with the mother—their weight will have ballooned from {{convert|4.5|to|45|kg|abbr=on|0}} in the two years spent with the mother. Mothers may see their cubs in later years but both avoid each other.&lt;ref name="THE REINTRODUCTION OF ORPHANED GRIZZLY BEAR CUBS"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE REINTRODUCTION OF ORPHANED GRIZZLY BEAR CUBS INTO THE WILD|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_4/Jonkel_Husby_Russell_Beecham_Vol_4.pdf|publisher=Bear Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity===
The grizzly bear is, by nature, a long-living animal. The average lifespan for a male is estimated at 22 years, with that of a female being slightly longer at 26.&lt;ref name="Brown Bear"&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear – Ursus Arctos|url=http://www.nps.gov/kefj/naturescience/brown-bear.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females live longer than males due to their less dangerous life; avoiding the seasonal breeding fights in which males engage. The oldest wild inland grizzly was 34 years old in Alaska; the oldest coastal bear was 39,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Gary. ''The Great Bear Almanac.'' Guilford, CT, 1993, pg. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; but most grizzlies die in their first few years of life from predation or hunting.&lt;ref name="Grizzly Ecology"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear Population Ecology and Monitoring Denali National Park and Preserve|url=https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2003/nsf03021/nsf03021_3.pdf|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captive grizzlies have lived as long as 44 years.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Ecology==
===Diet===
{{see also|Hypocarnivore}}
Although grizzlies are of the order [[Carnivora]] and have the digestive system of carnivores, they are normally [[omnivore]]s: their diets consist of both plants and animals. They have been known to prey on large mammals, when available, such as [[moose]], [[elk]], [[Caribou (North America)|caribou]], [[white-tailed deer]], [[mule deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[American bison|bison]], and even [[American black bear|black bears]]; though they are more likely to take calves and injured individuals rather than healthy adults. Grizzly bears feed on fish such as [[salmon]], [[trout]], and [[bass (fish)|bass]], and those with access to a more [[protein]]-enriched diet in coastal areas potentially grow larger than inland individuals. Grizzly bears also readily [[scavenge]] food or carrion left behind by other animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance |first=Stephen |last=Herrero |year=2002 |location=Guilford, Conn. |publisher=Lyons Press |isbn=978-1-58574-557-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grizzly bears will also eat [[bird]]s and their eggs, and gather in large numbers at fishing sites to feed on spawning [[salmon]]. They frequently prey on baby [[deer]] left in the grass, and occasionally they raid the nests of raptors such as [[bald eagle]]s.&lt;ref name="Food For Thought"&gt;{{cite web|title=Food For Thought|url=http://www.shadowofthebear.com/Food%20for%20Thought.html|publisher=Shadow of the Bear|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229204520/http://shadowofthebear.com/Food%20for%20Thought.html|archivedate=29 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian or Alaskan grizzlies are larger than those that reside in the American [[Rocky Mountains]]. This is due, in part, to the richness of their diets. In [[Yellowstone National Park]] in the United States, the grizzly bear's diet consists mostly of [[whitebark pine|whitebark]] [[pine nut]]s, [[tuber]]s, grasses, various [[rodent]]s, [[army cutworm]] moths, and scavenged carcasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Habits of Grizzly Bears and Black Bears in the Yellowstone Ecoystem|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bearfoods.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of these, however, match the fat content of the salmon available in Alaska and British Columbia. With the high fat content of salmon, it is not uncommon to encounter grizzlies in Alaska weighing {{convert|1200|lb|abbr=on|order=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear: facts, diet, habitat, baby cubs, claws, kodiak|url=http://www.bearlife.org/brown-bear.html|publisher=Bear Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grizzlies in Alaska supplement their diet of salmon and [[clams]] with [[sedge grass]] and [[berries]]. In areas where salmon are forced to leap waterfalls, grizzlies gather at the base of the falls to feed on and catch the fish. Salmon are at a disadvantage when they leap waterfalls because they cluster together at their bases and are therefore easier targets for the grizzlies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown, Grizzly or Kodiak Bear|url=http://www.shadowofthebear.com/Brown,%20Grizzly%20or%20Kodiak%20Bear.html|publisher=shadowofthebear.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grizzly bears are well-documented catching leaping salmon in their mouths at [[Brooks Falls]] in [[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] in Alaska.

[[Meat]], as already described, is an important part of a grizzly's diet. Grizzly bears occasionally prey on small mammals, such as [[marmot]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[lemming]]s, and [[vole]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grizzly bear feeding habits|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bearfoods.htm|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous example of such predation is in [[Denali National Park and Preserve]], where grizzlies chase, pounce on, and dig up [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s to eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encounters Explorer – Grizzly Bear – Natural History|url=http://www.encountersnorth.org/wildexplorer/grizzlybears/natural-history.html|publisher=Wild Explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas, grizzly bears prey on [[hoary marmot]]s, overturning rocks to reach them, and in some cases preying on them when they are in [[hibernation]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, John O. (1980) ''The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mammals.'' Chanticleer Press, New York, p. 388. {{ISBN|0-394-50762-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Larger prey includes [[bison]] and [[moose]], which are sometimes taken by bears in [[Yellowstone National Park]].

Although the diets of grizzly bears vary extensively based on seasonal and regional changes, plants make up a large portion of them, with some estimates as high as 80–90%.&lt;ref name="hww.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=90&amp;cid=8 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103075335/http://www.hww.ca/hww2.asp?id=90&amp;cid=8 |archivedate=3 January 2011 |website=Hinterland Who's Who |title=Grizzly |accessdate=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various berries constitute an important food source when they are available. These can include [[blueberry|blueberries]], blackberries (''[[Rubus fruticosus]]''), salmon berries (''[[Rubus spectabilis]]''), cranberries (''[[Vaccinium oxycoccos]]''), buffalo berries (''[[Shepherdia argentea]]''), soapberries (''[[Shepherdia canadensis]]''), and huckleberries (''[[Vaccinium parvifolium]]''), depending on the environment. Insects such as [[ladybug]]s, ants, and bees are eaten if they are available in large quantities. In Yellowstone National Park, grizzly bears may obtain half of their yearly caloric needs by feeding on [[Army cutworm|miller moth]]s that congregate on mountain slopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/2011/06/yellowstone-grizzly-bears-eat-40000-moths-a-day-in-august/ |title=Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Eat 40,000 Moths a Day In August |publisher=Yellowstone International |date=21 June 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When food is abundant, grizzly bears will feed in groups.

The interactions of grizzly bears with the wolves of Yellowstone have been under considerable study. Typically, the conflict will be in the defense of young or over a carcass, which is commonly an [[elk]] killed by wolves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gunther |first=K.

As the wolves and grizzly compete for the kill, one wolf may try to distract the bear while the others feed. The bear then may retaliate by chasing the wolves. If the wolves become aggressive with the bear, it is normally in the form of quick nips at its hind legs. Thus, the bear will sit down and use its ability to protect itself in a full circle. Rarely do interactions such as these end in death or serious injury to either animal. One carcass simply is not usually worth the risk to the wolves (if the bear has the upper hand due to strength and size) or to the bear (if the wolves are too numerous or persistent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yellowstone wolves' return means more grizzly food|url=http://www.sfgate.com/science/article/Yellowstone-wolves-return-means-more-grizzly-food-4701979.php|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While wolves usually dominate grizzly bears during interactions at wolf dens, both grizzly and black bears have been reported killing wolves and their cubs at wolf dens even when the latter was in defense mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How wolves interact with other predators|url=http://www.freewebs.com/alphawolfsabrina/wolfecology.htm|publisher=wolfbehavior|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228164448/http://www.freewebs.com/alphawolfsabrina/wolfecology.htm|archivedate=28 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Potential Interactions Between Bears &amp; Wolves|url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/bearwolves.htm|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American black bear|Black bear]]s generally stay out of grizzly [[territory (animal)|territory]], but grizzlies may occasionally enter black bear terrain to obtain food sources both bears enjoy, such as pine nuts, acorns, mushrooms, and berries. When a black bear sees a grizzly coming, it either turns tail and runs or climbs a tree. Black bears are not strong competition for prey because they have a more herbivorous diet. Confrontations are rare because of the differences in size, habitats, and diets of the bear species. When this happens, it is usually with the grizzly being the aggressor. The black bear will only fight when it is a smaller grizzly such as a yearling or when the black bear has no other choice but to defend itself. There is at least one confirmed observation of a grizzly bear digging out, killing and eating a black bear when the latter was in hibernation.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Robert H. (2000) ''The Grizzly Almanac.'' New York, p. 94. {{ISBN|1-58574-143-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The segregation of black bear and grizzly bear populations is possibly due to competitive exclusion. In certain areas, grizzly bears outcompete black bears for the same resources.&lt;ref name="ApplsMcLellan"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Apps |first=C. D. |last2=McLellan |first2=B.

Grizzly bears tend to favor old forests with high productivity, higher elevations and more open habitats compared with black bears.&lt;ref name="ApplsMcLellan"/&gt;

The relationship between grizzly bears and other predators is mostly one-sided; grizzly bears will approach feeding predators to steal their kill. In general, the other species will leave the carcasses for the bear to avoid competition or predation. Any parts of the carcass left uneaten are scavenged by smaller animals.&lt;ref name=Wolverine&gt;{{cite web|title=Wolverine|url=http://fwp.mt.gov/mtoutdoors/HTML/articles/portraits/wolverine.htm|publisher=Montana Outdoors}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[North American cougar|Cougar]]s generally give the bears a wide berth. Grizzlies have less competition with [[cougar]]s than with other predators, such as coyotes, wolves, and other bears. When a grizzly descends on a cougar feeding on its kill, the cougar usually gives way to the bear. When a cougar does stand its ground, it will use its superior agility and its claws to harass the bear, yet stay out of its reach until one of them gives up. Grizzly bears occasionally kill cougars in disputes over kills.&lt;ref&gt;Hornocker, M., and S. Negri (Eds.). (2009). Cougar: ecology and conservation. University of Chicago Press.

[[Coyotes]], foxes, and [[wolverine]]s are generally regarded as pests to the grizzlies rather than competition, though they may compete for smaller prey, such as ground squirrels and rabbits. All three will try to scavenge whatever they can from the bears. Wolverines are aggressive enough to occasionally persist until the bear finishes eating, leaving more scraps  than normal for the smaller animal.&lt;ref name="Wolverine"/&gt; Packs of [[coyote]]s have also displaced grizzly bears in disputes over kills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellowstone Wildlife – Coyote|url=http://www.yellowstonenationalpark.com/coyote.htm|publisher=yellowstonenationalpark.com|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological role===
The grizzly bear has several relationships with its ecosystem. One such relationship is a mutualistic relationship with fleshy-fruit bearing plants. After the grizzly consumes the fruit, the seeds are excreted and thereby dispersed in a germinable condition. Some studies have shown germination success is indeed increased as a result of seeds being deposited along with nutrients in feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Meyer |first=G. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Witmer |first2=M. |year=1998 |title=Influence of Seed Processing by Frugivorous Birds on Germination Success of Three North American Shrubs |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=140 |issue=1 |pages=129–139 |doi=10.1674/0003-0031(1998)140[0129:IOSPBF]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes grizzly bears important seed distributors in their habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Willson |first=M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Gende |first2=S. |year=2004 |title=Seed Dispersal by Brown Bears, ''Ursus arctos'', in Southeastern Alaska|url=http://www.canadianfieldnaturalist.ca/index.php/cfn/article/view/53 |journal=Canadian Field-Naturalist |volume=118 |issue=4 |pages=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While foraging for tree roots, plant bulbs, or ground squirrels, bears stir up the soil. This process not only helps grizzlies access their food, but also increases species richness in alpine ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Doak, D. 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doak |first=D. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Loso |first2=M. |year=2003 |title=Effects of Grizzly Bear Digging on Alpine Plant Community Structure |journal=Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=499–503 |doi=10.1657/1523-0430(2003)035[0421:EOGBDO]2.0.CO;2|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1657/1523-0430%282003%29035%5B0421%3AEOGBDO%5D2.0.CO%3B2 |format=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; An area that contains both bear digs and undisturbed land has greater plant diversity than an area that contains just undisturbed land.&lt;ref name="Doak, D. 2003"/&gt; Along with increasing species richness, soil disturbance causes nitrogen to be dug up from lower soil layers, and makes nitrogen more readily available in the environment.

Grizzlies directly regulate prey populations and also help prevent overgrazing in forests by controlling the populations of other species in the food chain.&lt;ref name="PeekBeecham"/&gt; An experiment in [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Wyoming]] in the [[United States]] showed removal of wolves and grizzly bears caused populations of their herbivorous prey to increase.&lt;ref name="Berger, J. 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Berger |first=J. |last2=Stacey |first2=P. |last3=Bellis |first3=L. |lastauthoramp=yes |last4=Johnson |first4=M. |year=2001 |title=A Mammalian Predator-Prey Imbalance: Grizzly Bear and Wolf Extinction Affect Avian Neo-Tropical Migrants |journal=Ecological Applications |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=947–960 |doi=10.2307/3061004 |jstor=3061004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, changed the structure and density of plants in the area, which decreased the population sizes of migratory birds.&lt;ref name="Berger, J. 2001"/&gt; This provides evidence grizzly bears represent a keystone predator, having a major influence on the entire ecosystem they inhabit.&lt;ref name="PeekBeecham"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Peek |first=J. |last2=Beecham |first2=J. |last3=Garshelis |first3=D. |last4=Messier |first4=F. |last5=Miller |first5=S. |lastauthoramp=yes |last6=Dale |first6=S. |year=2003 |title=Management of Grizzly Bears in British Columbia: A Review by and Independent Scientific Panel |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/documents/gbear_finalspr.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When grizzly bears fish for salmon along the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, they often only eat the skin, [[brain]] and [[roe]] of the fish. In doing so, they provide a food source for [[gull]]s, [[raven]]s, and [[fox]]es, all of which eat salmon as well; this benefits both the bear and the smaller predators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grizzly Bear Eating Salmon|url=http://grizzlybearblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/21/grizzly-bear-eating-salmon/|publisher=The Grizzly Bear Blog|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bear awareness programs have been developed by numerous towns in British Columbia, Canada, to help prevent conflicts with both black and grizzly bears. The main premise of these programs is to teach humans to manage foods that attract bears. Keeping garbage securely stored, harvesting fruit when ripe, securing livestock behind electric fences, and storing pet food indoors are all measures promoted by bear awareness programs.   The fact that grizzly bears are less numerous and even protected in some areas, means that preventing conflict with grizzlies is especially important.

In the ten years preceding the development of a community education program in Revelstoke, 16 grizzlies were destroyed and a further 107 were relocated away from the town.  An education program run by Revelstoke Bear Aware was put in place in 1996. Since the program began just four grizzlies have been eliminated and five have been relocated.&lt;ref&gt;"Revelstoke Bear Aware Annual Report – 2015" – Sue Davies, Community Coordinator |url=http://revelstokebearaware.org/about-us/documents/&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[back-country]] [[Camping|campers]], hanging food between trees at a height unreachable to bears is a common procedure, although some grizzlies can climb and reach hanging food in other ways. An alternative to hanging food is to use a [[bear canister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outdoorlife.com/node/45053 |title=How to Outrun a Grizzly [and other really bad ideas] |date=31 January 2006 |first=Christopher |last=Batin |website=Outdoor Life }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traveling in groups of six or more can significantly reduce the chance of bear-related injuries while [[hiking]] in bear country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herrero |first=S. |last2=Higgins |first2=A. |year=2000 |title=Human Injuries inflicted by bears in Alberta: 1960–98 |journal=Ursus |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=44–54 |jstor=3872956 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grizzly bears are especially dangerous because of the force of their bite, which has been measured at over 8 [[Pascals (unit)|megapascals]] (1160 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]). It has been estimated that a bite from a grizzly could even crush a bowling ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://natgeotv.com/uk/casey-and-brutus-grizzly-encounters/facts Facts: Casey &amp; Brutus: Grizzly Encounters – National Geographic Channel – UK].

The grizzly bear is [[Endangered species#Conservation status|listed]] as threatened in the [[Continental United States|contiguous United States]] and [[Endangered species|endangered]] in parts of Canada. In May 2002, the Canadian Species at Risk Act listed the Prairie population ([[Alberta]], [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] range) of grizzly bears as extirpated in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name="canada_prairie"&gt;{{cite web | title = Species at Risk – Grizzly Bear Prairie population | publisher = [[Environment Canada]] | date =8 May 2006 | url = http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=139 | accessdate=8 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2002, grizzly bears were listed as special concern under the [[COSEWIC]] registry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sararegistry.gc.ca/species/speciesDetails_e.cfm?sid=1195|title=Species Profile: Grizzly Bear Northwestern Population.

Within the United States, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service concentrates its effort to restore grizzly bears in six recovery areas. These are Northern Continental Divide (Montana), Yellowstone (Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho), Cabinet-Yaak (Montana and Idaho), Selway-Bitterroot (Montana and Idaho), Selkirk (Idaho and Washington), and North Cascades (Washington). The grizzly population in these areas is estimated at 750 in the Northern Continental Divide, 550 in Yellowstone, 40 in the Yaak portion of the Cabinet-Yaak, and 15 in the Cabinet portion (in northwestern Montana), 105 in Selkirk region of Idaho, 10–20 in the North Cascades, and none currently in Selway-Bitterroots, although there have been sightings.&lt;ref&gt;Knibb, David (2008) ''Grizzly Wars: The Public Fight Over the Great Bear'', Eastern Washington University Press, pp. 164–213, {{ISBN|978-1-59766-037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These are estimates because bears move in and out of these areas, and it is therefore impossible to conduct a precise count. In the recovery areas that adjoin Canada, bears also move back and forth across the international boundary.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service claims the Cabinet-Yaak and Selkirk areas are linked through British Columbia, a claim that is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Knibb, David (2008) ''Grizzly Wars: The Public Fight Over the Great Bear'', Eastern Washington University Press, pp. 202–204, {{ISBN|978-1-59766-037-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. and Canadian [[national parks]], such as [[Banff National Park]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] and [[Grand Teton National Park|Grand Teton]], and [[Theodore Roosevelt National Park]] are subject to laws and regulations designed to protect the bears.

On 9 January 2006, the [[US Fish and Wildlife Service]] proposed to remove Yellowstone grizzlies from the [[Endangered species#Endangered mammals|list of threatened and protected species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.fws.gov/NewsReleases/showNews.cfm?newsId=781C3C9B-65BF-03E7-2866F7DC447822A1 |title=Public Meetings for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Proposal to Remove Yellowstone Area Population of Grizzly Bears from List of Threatened and Endangered Wildlife |website=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |date=29 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service "de-listed" the population,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/mammals/grizzly/press_release03222007.pdf |title=Successful Recovery Efforts bring Yellowstone Grizzly Bears off the Endangered List |website=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively removing [[Endangered Species Act]] protections for grizzlies in the [[Yellowstone National Park]] area. Several environmental organizations, including the NRDC, brought a lawsuit against the federal government to relist the grizzly bear. On 22 September 2009, U.S. District Judge [[Donald W.

Farther north, in Alberta, Canada, intense [[DNA]] hair-snagging studies in 2000 showed the grizzly population to be increasing faster than what it was formerly believed to be, and Alberta Sustainable Resource Development calculated a population of 841 bears.&lt;ref name="alberta_report"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.srd.gov.ab.ca/fishwildlife/status/grizzly/pop.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081226232826/http://www.srd.gov.ab.ca/fishwildlife/status/grizzly/pop.html|archivedate=26 December 2008 |title=Wildlife Status – Grizzly bear – Population size and trends|publisher=Fish and Wildlife Division of Alberta Sustainable Resource Development|accessdate=6 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Endangered Species Conservation Committee recommended that the Alberta grizzly bear population be designated as threatened due to recent estimates of grizzly bear mortality rates that indicated the population was in decline.

===Conservation efforts===
[[File:Bear trap GTNP1.jpg|thumb|right|Drum or barrel trap, used to safely relocate bears, adjacent to a building in [[Grand Teton National Park]] in [[Wyoming]], [[United States]]]]
Conservation efforts have become an increasingly vital investment over recent decades, as population numbers have dramatically declined. Establishment of parks and protected areas are one of the main focuses currently being tackled to help reestablish the low grizzly bear population in British Columbia. One example of these efforts is the [[Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary]] located along the north coast of British Columbia; at {{convert|44,300|ha}} in size, it is composed of key habitat for this threatened species. Regulations such as limited public access, as well as a strict no hunting policy, have enabled this location to be a safe haven for local grizzlies in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/khutzeymateen|title=Khutzeymateen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary|website=env.gov.bc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; When choosing the location of a park focused on grizzly bear conservation, factors such as habitat quality and connectivity to other habitat patches are considered.

The Refuge for Endangered Wildlife located on [[Grouse Mountain]] in Vancouver is an example of a different type of conservation effort for the diminishing grizzly bear population. The refuge is a five-acre terrain which has functioned as a home for two orphaned grizzly bears since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://grousemountain.com/Winter/wildlife-education/refuge/ |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100206165858/http://grousemountain.com/Winter/wildlife-education/refuge/ |archivedate=6 February 2010 |title=Wildlife and Education: Refuge for Endangered Wildlife |year=2009 |publisher= Grouse Mountain: The Peak of Vancouver |accessdate=11 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this refuge is to provide awareness and education to the public about grizzly bears, as well as providing an area for research and observation of this secluded species.

Another factor currently being taken into consideration when designing conservation plans for future generations are anthropogenic barriers in the form of urban development and roads. These elements are acting as obstacles, causing fragmentation of the remaining grizzly bear population habitat and prevention of gene flow between subpopulations (for example, Banff National Park). This, in turn, is creating a decline in genetic diversity, and therefore the overall fitness of the general population is lowered.&lt;ref name="KrebsCJ"&gt;{{cite book |last=Krebs |first=C. J. |year=2009 |title=Ecology: The Experimental Analysis of Distribution and Abundance |edition=6th |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-321-50743-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these issues, conservation plans often include migration corridors by way of long strips of "park forest" to connect less developed areas, or by way of tunnels and overpasses over busy roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clevenger |first1=A. P. |last2= Waltho |first2= N|year= 2005|title= Performance indices to identify attributes of highway crossing structures facilitating movement of large mammals |journal= Biological Conservation |issue= 3 |pages= 453–464 |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.04.025 |volume=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using GPS collar tracking, scientists can study whether or not these efforts are actually making a positive contribution towards resolving the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last1= Edwards| first1=M.

In the United States, national efforts have been made since 1982 for the recovery plan of grizzly bears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North Cascades Ecosystem Grizzly Bear Restoration Plan /Environmental Impact Statement|url=http://www.conservationnw.org/what-we-do/northcascades/north-cascades-ecosystem-grizzly-bear-restoration-plan-eis-nps-usfws-brochure-2.2015/at_download/file|website=Conservation Northwest|publisher=National Park Service and US Fish and Wildlife|accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of the efforts made have been through different organizations efforts to educate the public on grizzly bear safety, habits of grizzly bears and different ways to reduce human-bear conflict.

In early March 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to withdraw Endangered Species Act protections from grizzly bears in and around [[Yellowstone National Park]]. The population has risen from 136 bears in 1975 to an estimated 700 in 2017, and was "delisted" in June 2017.&lt;ref name="conservationnw.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.tempo.co/read/news/2016/03/04/206750635/US-Proposes-Lifting-Protections-for-Yellowstone-area-Grizzlies |title=U.S. Proposes Lifting Protections for Yellowstone-area Grizzlies |date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Bear-watching===
In the past 20 years in Alaska, [[ecotourism]] has boomed. While many people come to Alaska to bear-hunt, the majority come to watch the bears and observe their habits. Some of the best bear viewing in the world occurs on coastal areas of the Alaska Peninsula, including in [http://www.nps.gov/lacl/planyourvisit/wildlife-viewing.htm Lake Clark National Park and Preserve], Katmai National Park and Preserve, and the McNeil River State Game Sanctuary and Refuge. Here bears gather in large numbers to feast on concentrated food sources, including sedges in the salt marshes, clams in the nearby tidal flats, salmon in the estuary streams, and berries on the neighboring hillsides.

[[File:A053, Katmai National Park, Brooks Falls, Alaska, USA, bear and salmon, 2002.jpg|thumb|right|Bear catches a salmon at [[Brooks Falls]]]]
[[Katmai National Park and Preserve]] is one of the best spots to view brown bears. The bear population in Katmai is estimated at a healthy 2,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Be a guest of Katmai's brown bears|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/27/travel/summer-park-katmai|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The park is located on the Alaskan Peninsula about {{convert|300|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} southwest of the city of [[Anchorage]].

The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; 

[[Image:Guild of Saint Luke.jpg|thumb|1730s engraving of the Delft Guild of St. Luke, by an unknown artist. Today the location of the [[Vermeer Centre]]]]
For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7574">'''Holeums''' are hypothetical stable, quantized gravitational bound states of [[Primordial black hole|primordial]] or [[micro black holes]]. Holeums were proposed by L. K. Chavda and Abhijit Chavda in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [http://iopscience.iop.org/0264-9381/19/11/311 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt; They have all the properties associated with [[cold dark matter]]. Holeums are not [[black holes]], even though they are made up of black holes.

==Properties==

The [[binding energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_{n}&lt;/math&gt; of a holeum that consists of two identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0308054 Dark matter and stable bound states of primordial black holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{n}=-\frac{mc^{2}\alpha_{g}^{2}}{4n^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the principal [[quantum number]], &lt;math&gt;n=1,2,...,\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational counterpart of the [[fine structure constant]]. The latter is given by

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{g}=\frac{m^{2}G}{\hbar c}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant]] divided by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;;
: &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum;
: &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]].

The ''n''th excited state of a holeum then has a mass that is given by

: &lt;math&gt;m_{H}=2m+\frac{E_{n}}{c^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The holeum's atomic transitions cause it to emit [[gravitational radiation]].

The radius of the ''n''th excited state of a holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{n}=\left(  \frac{n^{2}R}{\alpha_{g}^{2}}\right)  \left(  \frac{\pi^{2}}{{8}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where:

: &lt;math&gt;R=\left(  \frac{2mG}{c^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Schwarzschild radius]] of the two identical micro black holes that constitute the holeum.

The holeum is a stable particle. It is the gravitational analogue of the [[hydrogen atom]]. It occupies space. Although it is made up of black holes, it itself is not a black hole. As the holeum is a purely gravitational system, it emits only gravitational radiation and no [[electromagnetic radiation]]. The holeum can therefore be considered to be a [[dark matter]] particle.&lt;ref&gt;M. Yu. Khlopov, [https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:0801.0116 Primordial Black Holes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Macro holeums and their properties==

A macro holeum is a quantized gravitational bound state of a large number of micro black holes. The energy eigenvalues of a macro holeum consisting of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; identical micro black holes of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; are given by&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0703 Quantized Gravitational Radiation from Black Holes and other macro holeums in the Low Frequency Domain]&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;E_{k}=-\frac{p^{2}mc^{2}}{2n_{k}^{2}}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha_{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\gg2&lt;/math&gt;. The system is simplified by assuming that all the micro black holes in the core are in the same quantum state described by &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and that the outermost, &lt;math&gt;k^{th}&lt;/math&gt; micro black hole is in an arbitrary quantum state described by the principal quantum number &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''physical radius'' of the bound state is given by

: &lt;math&gt;r_{k}=\frac{\pi^{2}kRn_{k}^{2}}{16p^{2}\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The mass of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;M_{k}=mk\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The Schwarzschild radius of the macro holeum is given by

: &lt;math&gt;R_{k}=kR\left(  1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[entropy]] of the system is given by

: &lt;math&gt;S_{k}=k^{2}S\left( 1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the entropy of the individual micro black holes that constitute the macro holeum.

== The ground state of macro holeums ==

The [[ground state]] of macro holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;. The holeum has maximum binding energy, minimum physical radius, maximum Schwarzschild radius, maximum mass, and maximum entropy in this state.

Such a system can be thought of as consisting of a gas of &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; free (&lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;) micro black holes that is bounded and therefore isolated from the outside world by a solitary outermost micro black hole whose principal quantum number is &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;.

== Stability ==

It can be seen from the above equations that the condition for the stability of holeums is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the relations &lt;math&gt;p=k\alpha _{g}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha _{g}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}&lt;/math&gt; into this inequality, the condition for the stability of holeums can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;m&lt;m_{P}\left( 6\right) ^{\frac{1}{4}}\left( \frac{n}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

The ground state of holeums is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, which gives us &lt;math&gt;m&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; as the condition for stability. Thus, the ground state of holeums is guaranteed to be always stable.

== Black holeums ==

A holeum is a black hole if its physical radius is less than or equal to its Schwarzschild radius, i.e. if

:&lt;math&gt;r_{k}\leqslant R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;

Such holeums are termed black holeums. Substituting the expressions for &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and simplifying, we obtain the condition for a holeum to be a black holeum to be

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi n_{k}}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For the ground state, which is characterized by &lt;math&gt;n_{k}=1&lt;/math&gt;, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;m\geqslant \frac{m_{P}}{2}\left( \frac{\pi}{k}\right) ^{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Black holeums are an example of black holes with internal structure. Black holeums are quantum black holes whose internal structure can be fully predicted by means of the quantities &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n_{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Holeums and cosmology ==

Holeums are speculated to be the progenitors of a class of short duration [[gamma ray bursts]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007AdSpR..40.1236A Holeums as potential candidates for some short-lived gamma ray bursts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Al Dallal, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010AdSpR..46..468D Primordial black holes and holeums as progenitors of galactic diffuse gamma-ray background]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also speculated that holeums give rise to [[cosmic rays]] of all energies, including [[ultra-high-energy cosmic rays]].&lt;ref&gt;L. K. Chavda &amp; Abhijit Chavda, [https://arxiv.org/abs/0806.0454 Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays from decays of holeums in Galactic Halos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for New Testament Textual Research''' ({{lang-de|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung}} — INTF) at the [[University of Münster]], [[Westphalia]], [[Germany]], is to research the textual history of the New Testament and to reconstruct its Greek initial text on the basis of the entire manuscript tradition, the early translations and patristic citations; furthermore the preparation of an ''[[Editio Critica Maior]]'' based on the entire tradition of the [[New Testament]] in Greek manuscripts, early versions and [[List of New Testament Church Fathers|New Testament quotations]] in ancient Christian literature. Under [[Kurt Aland]]'s supervision, the INTF collected almost the entire material that was needed - Manuscript count 1950: 4250; 1983: 5460; 2017: approx. 5800. 

Moreover, INTF produces several more editions and a variety of tools for [[New Testament]] scholarship, including the concise editions known as the [[Novum Testamentum Graece|"Nestle-Aland" - Novum Testamentum Graece]] 
and the UBS [[Greek New Testament]]. Many of the results are also available to the wider public at the adjoining [[Bible Museum Münster|Bible Museum]], which is affiliated with the institute.

First supplements of the [[Editio Critica Maior]] with the [[Catholic Letters]] and [[The Acts of the Apostels]] have been published since 1997. 

== History ==
The INTF was founded in [[Münster]], Germany, in 1959 by Kurt Aland (1915-1994). Since the 1950s Aland had been working on Eberhard and [[Erwin Nestle]]'s [[Novum Testamentum Graece]]. At the INTF the concise scholarly edition saw further revisions and publications, until it became the trade-mark of the institute under the name of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|"Nestle-Aland" - Novum Testamentum Graece]]. In 1966, a second concise edition intended for translators, the [[Greek New Testament]], was published. The great [[papyri]] discoveries of the 20th century were of special relevance for a new reconstruction of the text published in both the 26th edition of Nestle-Aland and the third edition of the Greek New Testament. Both editions contain the identical text while differing in their apparatus.

However, the main objective of the Institute was the so-called [[Editio Critica Maior]] based on the entire tradition of the New Testament in [[Biblical manuscript|Greek manuscripts]], old translations and New Testament quotations in ancient Christian literature. The pre-requisite for the realisation of this task was the sifting and examination of the entire manuscript tradition of the Greek New Testament. Under the supervision of Kurt Aland the INTF first of all collected almost the entire material (partly on extensive manuscript travels), followed by analyses in single editions and specific studies in preparation of the Editio critia Maior.

Kurt Aland found a friend and patron in Bishop Hermann Kunst. In 1964 the latter established the foundation “Hermann Kunst Foundation for the Promotion of New Testament Textual Research” that has granted crucial financial support to the Institute ever since.

In 1979, Kurt Aland founded the [[Bible Museum Münster]] that presents the work of the institute to the general public.

In 1983, [[Barbara Aland]] succeeded her husband as director of the Institute. Under her supervision, the analysis of the material that had been started under Kurt Aland continued and was made accessible for research in numerous publications. The first supplement of the [[Editio Critica Maior]] with the Epistle of James was finally published in 1997. Barbara Aland led the Institute until 2004.

Since October 2004 [http://www.wwu.de/EvTheol/personen/strutwolf.html Holger Strutwolf] has been in office as director of the Institute and the Bible Museum.

In 2007 the "Northrhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences and Arts" accepted the [[Editio Critica Maior]] as one of their projects. In the following year the project was established at Münster University as “Novum Testamentum Graecum - Editio Critica Maior”.

== Profile ==

'''History of the textual tradition of the New Testament''' - It is the task of the Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF) to comprehensively document and analyse the history of the textual tradition of the New Testament in its Greek original language.

'''List of Greek NT manuscripts''' - The Institute for New Testament Textual Research operates the international recording list of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. All newly discovered manuscripts anywhere in the world are being recorded, examined and provided with a short description at the Institute.

'''Reconstruction of the initial text''' - The core objective is to gain an impression, for the first time based on the entire material available today, of the textual history, and to reconstruct from this the initial text of the New Testament tradition. The result of this work is being published in the Editio Critica Maior.

'''Scholarly concise editions and tools''' - It has always been a distinguished task of the INTF to answer the need for scholarly concise editions based on the current state of research (Nestle-Aland, Greek New Testament, Synopsis) and scholarly reference works (concordances, Bauer-Aland). The concise editions have been continued, but they have also been supplemented by a digital edition and transcripts of important manuscripts on the Internet and a virtual manuscript room to make use of the advantages of that medium. All editions will increasingly benefit from the insights gained in the work on the [[Editio Critica Maior]].

''' New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room ''' - The INTF provides an electronic text critical resource, the ''[[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] (NT.VMR)'' - a virtual manuscript reading room, where New Testament manuscripts can be viewed online. Digitized manuscripts can be viewed in the VMR individually in facsimile and as transcript, if available.

'''«Arbeiten zur neutestamentlichen Textforschung»''' - Under this title, INTF publishes its own series. It mainly contains research results and studies from various projects of INTF.

'''Bible Museum''' - It is also highly relevant for the INTF not only to connect with the academic world but also to reach out to the broader public through the affiliated Bible Museum and through exhibitions outside the institute.

== Manuscripts ==
The INTF also holds some manuscripts of the New Testament, and took responsibility for registering the New Testament manuscripts (named the "[[Gregory-Aland]] numbers"), and for editing the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]].

[[Image:Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics, UCLA.jpg|right|thumb|A closer view of the entrance. The blue banner is on the occasion of UCLA's Department of Mathematics receiving the [[American Mathematical Society|AMS]] exemplary math department prize for 2007.]]
The '''Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics''' ('''IPAM''') is an [[United States|American]] [[mathematics]] institute funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]. The initial funding for the institute was approved in May 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=753  | title = NSF Opts for Three Institutes: UCLA's IPAM To Join IMA, MSRI}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was inaugurated in  August, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/reception.html | title = Inaugural Lectures  and Opening Reception   Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IPAM is located on the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] campus, in close proximity to UCLA's Department of Mathematics. The building currently housing the institute was designed in  1973 by world-renowned [[Pritzker Architecture Prize|Pritzker Prize]]-winning architect [[Frank Gehry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=753  | title = Newest NSF Institute Open Its Doors, Notices of the AMS, Volume 47, Number 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The mission of the institute is to make connections between a broad spectrum of mathematicians and scientists, to launch new collaborations, to better inform mathematicians and scientists about interdisciplinary problems, and to broaden the range of applications in which mathematics is used.

IPAM seeks to bring the full range of mathematical techniques to bear on the great scientific challenges of our time, to stimulate exciting new mathematics via new problems motivated by other sciences, and to train the people who will do this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/about.aspx  | title =IPAM  &amp;mdash; About Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
IPAM is currently one of eight [http://www.mathinstitutes.org NSF Mathematical Sciences Institutes] in the [[United States]]. The initial five year grant was renewed in 2005, and this grant was once again renewed in 2010, for an additional five years.

The institute was co-founded by [[Tony F. Chan]], Mark Green, and [[Eitan Tadmor]]; [[Russel E. Caflisch|Russ Caflisch]] is its current director. Christian Ratsch and [[Skip Garibaldi]] are its current associate directors. [[Stanley Osher]] is its current special projects director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/people/directors.aspx  | title =IPAM  &amp;mdash; Directors Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Every year IPAM offers two three-month scientific programs, or long programs. These programs bring together senior and junior mathematicians and scientists and engineers from the scientific disciplines related to the program. In addition, IPAM supports graduate students, post-doctoral scholars and young academics to encourage their participation in long programs.

The programs consist of three phases: Tutorials from both streams are offered at the beginning. These are followed by four five-day workshops focusing on particular topics related to the overall theme of the program. The programs culminate with a 1-week [[Oberwolfach]]-like workshop at the [[UCLA]] at [[Lake Arrowhead, California]].

Between the long programs, IPAM sponsors independent five-day workshops on a broad range of scientific themes. During the summer IPAM holds a research program for undergraduates (RIPS) focusing on industrial problems as well as a summer school for graduate students. The graduate student summer school is dedicated to an important scientific theme involving problems of mathematical interest.

The '''International Plant Names Index''' ('''IPNI''') describes itself as "a [[database]] of the names and associated basic bibliographical details of [[seed plant]]s, [[fern]]s and [[lycophyte]]s." Coverage of plant names is best at the rank of [[species]] and [[genus]].&lt;ref name=IPNI-on-IK/&gt; It includes basic bibliographical details associated with the names. Its goals include eliminating the need for repeated reference to primary sources for basic bibliographic information about plant names.&lt;ref name=IPNI-schol-publ/&gt;&lt;ref name=IPNI-orig-schol-publ/&gt;

The IPNI also maintains a list of standardized [[Author citation (botany)|author abbreviations]]. These were initially based on [[Authors of Plant Names|Brummitt &amp; Powell (1992)]], but new names and abbreviations are continually added.

==Description==
IPNI is the product of a collaboration between The [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] ([[Index Kewensis]]), The [[Harvard University Herbaria]] (Gray Herbarium Index), and the [[Australian National Herbarium]] ([[Australian Plant Name Index|APNI]]). The IPNI database is a collection of the names registered by the three cooperating institutions and they work towards standardizing the information. The standard of author abbreviations recommended by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' is Brummitt and Powell’s ''[[Authors of Plant Names]]''. A digital and continually updated list of authors and abbreviations can be consulted online at IPNI.

The IPNI provides names that have appeared in scholarly publications, with the objective of providing an index of published names rather than prescribing the accepted [[botanical nomenclature]].&lt;ref name=IPNI-schol-publ/&gt;

{{anchor|Bureau of Economic Geology}}
'''Bureau of Economic Geology'''

The Bureau of Economic Geology was established in 1909 as a successor to the Texas Geological Survey and the Texas Mineral Survey. Dr. William Battle Phillips was the Bureau's first director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/100/db_phillips.htm William Battle Phillips – Bureau of Economic Geology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217191659/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/100/db_phillips.htm |date=2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fph09  PHILLIPS, WILLIAM BATTLE | The Handbook of Texas Online | Texas State Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1909 the Texas legislature established and funded three Texas Geological Surveys, which lasted from 1858–1867 (with a four-year suspension), 1873–1876, and 1888–1901 (with the last five years unfunded).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/szg02 GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS OF TEXAS | The Handbook of Texas Online | Texas State Historical Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Today the Bureau functions as a research unit of The University of Texas at Austin, the State Geological Survey, and the Regional Lead Organization for the Petroleum Technology Transfer Council.

[[Image:beg seal transparent.png|125px|right]]

Currently under the leadership of Dr. Scott Tinker,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php Tinker profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113190743/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/Tinker/tinker_about.php |date=2012-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau conducts research in two broad areas: energy and environment.

The Bureau’s energy research focuses largely on oil and natural gas. Major approaches include salt tectonics, carbonate and clastic reservoir characterization, fracture characterization and prediction, multicomponent seismic applications, and basin analysis. The Bureau works to bring insight and innovation from outcrop studies to the evolving science of reservoir characterization. With 70% of in-place reserves typically remaining in the ground at the time of oil field abandonment, this research has enduring economic and societal importance.

The Bureau’s environmental research group conducts a wide range of basic and applied research in groundwater resources, [[vadose zone]] hydrology, coastal studies, near-surface [[geophysics]], and geologic mapping. The group also has programs that relate energy and the environment, including a major initiative in geological sequestration of greenhouse gases. A variety of approaches are used to investigate characteristics and processes of shallow Earth systems and impacts of human activities on those systems. Remote sensing, including satellite (GRACE and MODIS) and airborne geophysics are used to quantify regional scale evapotranspiration, groundwater storage, and saline plume characterization. Subsurface geologic and hydrogeologic characterization provides critical information on sustainability of water resources and potential for [[carbon sequestration]] and desalination. Although many of the studies are focused in Texas, insights and process understanding are applied to other regions globally (such as China, India, Africa, and South America).

The Bureau provides wide-ranging advisory, technical, informational, and research-based services to industries, nonprofit organizations, and Federal, State, and local agencies. The Bureau also provides facilities and management to the office of Publication Sales, Core Research Laboratories, and the Geophysical Log Facility, all of which serve the public.

'''Institute for Geophysics'''

Founded in 1972, the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG) is an Organized Research Unit within The University of Texas at Austin, conducting academic research in geology and geophysics.UTIG works with the UT Department of Geological Sciences and Bureau of Economic Geology to provide basic and applied geophysical research opportunities for graduate students at the MA and PhD level through its worldwide programs in solid earth geophysics, marine geology/geophysics, and multi-channel reflection seismology. Some of its scientists also participate in the university's Environmental Science Institute.

[[Image:UTIG-logo.png|150px|right]]UTIG research activities are carried out all over the world and include large-scale, multi-investigator, multi-institutional field programs. The importance of geophysical measurements and their mathematical interpretation in the exploration for petroleum and economically useful minerals has also led to valuable partnerships between UTIG and industry. UTIG plays a role in K-12 education through formal teacher-training programs and informal outreach efforts.

UTIG strives to conduct research that expands the frontiers of knowledge in earth science, has societal and economic relevance, and is of human interest. Dedicated to basic and applied research alike, the Institute aims to enhance humanity's fundamental understanding of the dynamic geophysical processes that have influenced and continue to influence Earth's structure and climate.

Geographically, UTIG's scope includes the ocean basins, continental margins, Antarctica, and all sites of seismic activity. Chronologically, its scope is no less vast: from the development of tectonic evolution models that reconstruct continental arrangements as much as a billion years ago to predicting how future climatic scenarios would impact sea-level changes and thus the habitability of densely populated coastal regions. The Institute's research is highly relevant to natural resource exploration, the assessment of [[geologic hazards]], and the mitigation of environmental damage. The development of new mathematical models, data processing and imaging techniques, and geophysical instrumentation is also an integral part of UTIG's ongoing research and future goals.

'''Department of Geological Sciences'''

[[Image:University of texas at austin department of geological sciences logo.png|165px|right]]Founded in 1888, the Department of Geological Sciences is the main academic unit of the Jackson School. However, scientists and students in the Department do conduct a wide range of research and collaborate with researchers at the Institute and Bureau, as well as with colleagues around the world.

Scientists in the Department conduct research and teach courses in 9 main areas: Atmospheric Sciences, Computational Geosciences, Geochemistry/Thermo- &amp; Geo-chronology, Geophysics/Seismology, Hydrogeology/Glaciology, Paleontology/Geobiology, Petrology/Mineral Physics, Sedimentary Geology/Stratigraphy, Structural Geology/Lithospheric Geodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson School of Geosciences Research Disciplines
http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/disciplines/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department houses one of only a handful of non-medical CT scanners at an academic institution anywhere in the world. The High Resolution X-Ray CT (UTCT) Facility has been used to non-destructivley scan precious, one-of-a-kind specimens such as Lucy (an ancient human ancestor and the world's most famous fossil),&lt;ref&gt;Researchers Complete First CT Scan of Ancient Human Ancestor Lucy http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/news/2009/02/researchers-complete-first-ct-scan-of-ancient-human-ancestor-lucy/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Archaeopteryx'' (one of the oldest and most primitive birds known), one of the first books printed in the New World, and a meteorite thought by some to contain signs of life on Mars. The UTCT is an NSF-supported shared multi-user facility. Data and imagery from the research are freely available online for scientists,  students and the general public via the DigiMorph web site.&lt;ref&gt;High Resolution X-Ray CT Facility http://www.ctlab.geo.utexas.edu/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DigiMorph http://digimorph.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major lab facilities include: Aqueous Geochemistry, Electron Microbeam (EPMA, SEM, ESEM, and XRD), Fission Track Thermochronology, Geomicrobiology, Geophysics (Landmark and Geoquest software for seismic processing and  interpretation), ICP Mass Spectrometry, Isotope Hydrology, Mineral Physics, Paleomagnetics, Petrographic Imaging, Stable Isotope, [[thermal ionization mass spectrometry|Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry]] (TIMS), and U-PB Geochronology.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Geological Sciences Resources and Facilities http://www.jsg.utexas.edu/research/facilities/&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Department, in partnership with the Texas Natural Science Center, also maintains two major paleontology collections: the Vertebrate Paleontology Laboratory (focusing largely on the American Southwest and Texas) and the Non-vertebrate Paleontology Lab.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18211">In mathematics, '''low-rank approximation''' is a [[mathematical optimization|minimization]] problem, in which the [[Loss function|cost function]] measures the fit between a given matrix (the data) and an approximating matrix (the optimization variable), subject to a constraint that the approximating matrix has reduced [[rank (linear algebra)|rank]]. The problem is used for [[mathematical model]]ing and [[data compression]]. The rank constraint is related to a constraint on the complexity of a model that fits the data. In applications, often there are other constraints on the approximating matrix apart from the rank constraint, e.g., [[nonnegative matrix factorization|non-negativity]] and [[Hankel matrix|Hankel structure]].

Low-rank approximation is closely related to:

* [[principal component analysis]],
* [[factor analysis]],
* [[total least squares]],
* [[latent semantic analysis]], and
* [[orthogonal regression]].

== Definition ==

Given

* structure specification &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S} : \mathbb{R}^{n_p} \to \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}&lt;/math&gt;,
* vector of structure parameters &lt;math&gt;p\in\mathbb{R}^{n_p}&lt;/math&gt;, 
* [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] &lt;math&gt; \| \cdot \| &lt;/math&gt;, and
* desired rank &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over } \widehat p \quad \|p - \widehat p\| \quad\text{subject to}\quad \operatorname{rank}\big(\mathcal{S}(\widehat p)\big) \leq r.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Basic low-rank approximation problem ==

The unstructured problem with fit measured by the [[Frobenius norm]], i.e., 
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over } \widehat D \quad \|D - \widehat D\|_{\text{F}}
\quad\text{subject to}\quad \operatorname{rank}\big(\widehat D\big) \leq r
&lt;/math&gt;
has analytic solution in terms of the [[singular value decomposition]] of the data matrix. The result is referred to as the matrix approximation lemma or Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem.&lt;ref name=EYM-thm&gt;C. Eckart, G. Young, The approximation of one matrix by another of lower rank. Psychometrika, Volume 1, 1936, Pages 211–8. {{doi|10.1007/BF02288367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let
:&lt;math&gt;
D = U\Sigma V^{\top} \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}, \quad m \leq n
&lt;/math&gt;
be the singular value decomposition of &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; and partition &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=:\operatorname{diag}(\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_m)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
U =: \begin{bmatrix} U_1 &amp; U_2\end{bmatrix}, \quad 
\Sigma =: \begin{bmatrix} \Sigma_1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \Sigma_2 \end{bmatrix}, \quad\text{and}\quad 
V =: \begin{bmatrix} V_1 &amp; V_2 \end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;r\times r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;m\times r&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n\times r&lt;/math&gt;. Then the rank-&lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; matrix, obtained from the truncated singular value decomposition
:&lt;math&gt;
\widehat D^* = U_1 \Sigma_1 V_1^{\top},
&lt;/math&gt;
is such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\|D-\widehat D^*\|_{\text{F}} = \min_{\operatorname{rank}(\widehat D) \leq r} \|D-\widehat D\|_{\text{F}} = \sqrt{\sigma^2_{r+1} + \cdots + \sigma^2_m}.
&lt;/math&gt;
The minimizer &lt;math&gt;\widehat D^*&lt;/math&gt; is unique if and only if &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{r+1}\neq\sigma_{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Proof of Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem (for [[spectral norm]]) ==
Let &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}&lt;/math&gt; be a real (possibly rectangular) matrix with &lt;math&gt;m\geq n&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that 
:&lt;math&gt;
A = U\Sigma V^\top
&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Recall that &lt;math&gt; U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are [[Orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] matrices, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;m\times n&lt;/math&gt; [[Diagonal matrix|diagonal]] matrix with entries &lt;math&gt;(\sigma_{1}, \sigma_{2}, \cdots ,\sigma_{n})&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1 \geq \sigma_2 \geq \cdots \geq \sigma_n\geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

We claim that the best rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approximation to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the spectral norm, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_2&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
A_k = \sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt;and &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th column of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

First, note that we have

: &lt;math&gt;
\|A-A_k\|_2 = \left\|\sum_{i=k+1}^n \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top \right\|_2 = \sigma_{k+1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we need to show that if &lt;math&gt;B_k = XY^\top&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; columns then &lt;math&gt;
\|A-A_k\|_2=\sigma_{k+1}\leq \|A-B_k\|_2&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; columns, then there must be a linear combination of the first &lt;math&gt;k+1&lt;/math&gt; columns of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.,

: &lt;math&gt;
w = \gamma_1v_1+\cdots+\gamma_{k+1}v_{k+1},
&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;Y^\top w = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, we can scale &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\|w\|_2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; or (equivalently) &lt;math&gt;\gamma_1^2+\cdots +\gamma_{k+1}^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;
\|A-B_k\|_2^2 \geq \|(A-B_k)w\|_2^2 = \|Aw\|_2^2 = \gamma_1^2\sigma_1^2+\cdots+\gamma_{k+1}^2\sigma_{k+1}^2\geq \sigma_{k+1}^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

The result follows by taking the square root of both sides of the above inequality.

== Proof of Eckart–Young–Mirsky theorem (for [[Frobenius norm]]) ==

Let &lt;math&gt;A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}&lt;/math&gt; be a real (possibly rectangular) matrix with &lt;math&gt;m\geq n&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;
A = U\Sigma V^\top
&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[singular value decomposition]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

We claim that the best rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approximation to &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the Frobenius norm, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\|\cdot\|_F&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

: &lt;math&gt;
A_k = \sum_{i=1}^k \sigma_i u_i v_i^\top
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;th column of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

First, note that we have

: &lt;math&gt;
\|A-A_k\|_F^2 = \left\|\sum_{i=k+1}^n \sigma_i u_iv_i^\top \right\|_F^2 = \sum_{i=k+1}^n \sigma_i^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, we need to show that if &lt;math&gt;B_k = XY^\top&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; have &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; columns then

: &lt;math&gt;\|A-A_k\|_F^2=\sum_{i=k+1}^n\sigma_{i}^2\leq \|A-B_k\|_F^2.&lt;/math&gt;

By the triangle inequality with the spectral norm, if &lt;math&gt;A = A' + A''&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1(A)\leq \sigma_1(A') + \sigma_1(A'')&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt; A'_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A''_k&lt;/math&gt; respectively denote the rank &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; approximation to &lt;math&gt;A'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A''&lt;/math&gt; by SVD method described above. Then, for any &lt;math&gt;i,j\geq1 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\sigma_i(A')+\sigma_j(A'') &amp;= \sigma_1(A'-A'_{i-1}) + \sigma_1(A''-A''_{j-1})\\
&amp;\geq \sigma_1(A-A'_{i-1}-A''_{j-1})\\
&amp;\geq \sigma_{i+j-1}(A).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma_{k+1}(B_k) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;A' = A-B_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A'' = B_k&lt;/math&gt; we conclude that for &lt;math&gt;i\geq 1,j=k+1&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\sigma_i(A-B_k) \geq \sigma_{k+i}(A).
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

: &lt;math&gt;
\|A-B_k\|_F^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma_i(A-B_k)^2 \geq \sum_{i=k+1}^n\sigma_i(A)^2 = \|A-A_k\|_F^2,
&lt;/math&gt;

as required.

== Weighted low-rank approximation problems ==

The Frobenius norm weights uniformly all elements of the approximation error  &lt;math&gt;D - \widehat D&lt;/math&gt;. Prior knowledge about distribution of the errors can be taken into account by considering the weighted low-rank approximation problem
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over } \widehat D \quad 
\operatorname{vec}^{\top}(D - \widehat D) W \operatorname{vec}(D - \widehat D)
\quad\text{subject to}\quad \operatorname{rank}(\widehat D) \leq r,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;vec(A)&lt;/math&gt; [[vectorization (mathematics)|vectorizes]] the matrix  &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; column wise and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a given positive (semi)definite weight matrix.

The general weighted low-rank approximation problem does not admit an analytic solution in terms of the singular value decomposition and is solved by local optimization methods, which provide no guarantee that a globally optimal solution is found.

Inspired by Netflix prize application, weighted low-rank approximation problem also can be formulated in this way &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Weighted Low Rank Approximations with Provable Guarantees| conference = STOC '16 Proceedings of the forty-eighth annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing|url=https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2897639|last1=Razenshteyn|first1=Ilya|last2=Song|first2=Zhao|last3=Woodruff|first3=David P.|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; : for a non-negative matrix &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; and a matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; we seek to minimize &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i,j} ( W_{i,j}( A_{i,j} - B_{i,j} ))^2&lt;/math&gt;.

== Entry-wise L1 low-rank approximation problems == 
Let &lt;math&gt;\|A\|_1 = \sum_{i,j}|A_{i,j}|&lt;/math&gt;. It is known that this entry-wise L1 norm is more robust than the Frobenius norm in the presence of outliers and is indicated in models where Gaussian assumptions on the noise may not apply. It is natural to seek to minimize &lt;math&gt;\|B - A\|_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|title=Low Rank Approximation with Entrywise L1-Norm Error| conference = STOC '17 Proceedings of the forty-ninth annual ACM symposium on Theory of Computing|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.00898.pdf|last1=Song|first1=Zhao|last2=Woodruff|first2=David P.|last3=Zhong|first3=Peilin|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Image and kernel representations of the rank constraints ==

Using the equivalences
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{rank}(\widehat D) \leq r 
\quad\iff\quad
\text{there are } P\in\R^{m\times r} \text{ and } L\in\R^{r\times n}
\text{ such that } \widehat D  = PL
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{rank}(\widehat D) \leq r 
\quad\iff\quad
\text{there is full row rank } R\in\R^{m - r\times m} \text{ such that } R \widehat D  = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
the weighted low-rank approximation problem becomes equivalent to the parameter optimization problems
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over } \widehat D, P \text{ and } L \quad 
\operatorname{vec}^{\top}(D - \widehat D) W \operatorname{vec}(D - \widehat D)
\quad\text{subject to}\quad \widehat D = PL
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over } \widehat D \text{ and } R \quad 
\operatorname{vec}^{\top}(D - \widehat D) W \operatorname{vec}(D - \widehat D)
\quad\text{subject to}\quad R \widehat D = 0 \quad\text{and}\quad RR^{\top} = I_r,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;I_r&lt;/math&gt; is the [[identity matrix]] of size &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

== Alternating projections algorithm ==

The image representation of the rank constraint suggests a parameter optimization method in which the cost function is minimized alternatively over one of the variables (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) with the other one fixed. Although simultaneous minimization over both &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a difficult [[biconvex optimization]] problem, minimization over one of the variables alone is a [[linear least squares (mathematics)|linear least squares]] problem and can be solved globally and efficiently.

The resulting optimization algorithm (called alternating projections) is globally convergent with a linear convergence rate to a locally optimal solution of the weighted low-rank approximation problem. Starting value for the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) parameter should be given. The iteration is stopped when a user defined convergence condition is satisfied.

[[Matlab]] implementation of the alternating projections algorithm for weighted low-rank approximation:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function [dh, f] = wlra_ap(d, w, p, tol, maxiter)
[m, n] = size(d); r = size(p, 2); f = inf;
for i = 2:maxiter
    % minimization over L
    bp = kron(eye(n), p);
    vl = (bp' * w * bp) \ bp' * w * d(:);
    l  = reshape(vl, r, n);
    % minimization over P
    bl = kron(l', eye(m));
    vp = (bl' * w * bl) \ bl' * w * d(:);
    p  = reshape(vp, m, r);
    % check exit condition
    dh = p * l; dd = d - dh;
    f(i) = dd(:)' * w * dd(:);
    if abs(f(i - 1) - f(i)) &lt; tol, break, end
end 
&lt;/source&gt;

== Variable projections algorithm ==

The alternating projections algorithm exploits the fact that the low rank approximation problem, parameterized in the image form, is bilinear in the variables &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The bilinear nature of the problem is effectively used in an alternative approach, called variable projections.&lt;ref&gt;G. Golub and V. Pereyra, Separable nonlinear least squares: the variable projection method and its applications, Institute of Physics, Inverse Problems, Volume 19, 2003, Pages 1-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider again the weighted low rank approximation problem, parameterized in the image form. Minimization with respect to the &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; variable (a linear least squares problem) leads to the closed form expression of the approximation error as a function of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
f(P) = \sqrt{\operatorname{vec}^{\top}(D)\Big( 
W - W (I_n \otimes P) \big( (I_n \otimes P)^{\top} W (I_n \otimes P) \big)^{-1} (I_n \otimes P)^{\top} W
\Big) \operatorname{vec}(D)}.
&lt;/math&gt; 
The original problem is therefore equivalent to the [[Least squares#Non-linear least squares|nonlinear least squares problem]] of minimizing &lt;math&gt;f(P)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. For this purpose standard optimization methods, e.g. the [[Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm]] can be used.

[[Matlab]] implementation of the variable projections algorithm for weighted low-rank approximation:

&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
function [dh, f] = wlra_varpro(d, w, p, tol, maxiter)
prob = optimset(); prob.solver = 'lsqnonlin';
prob.options = optimset('MaxIter', maxiter, 'TolFun', tol); 
prob.x0 = p; prob.objective = @(p) cost_fun(p, d, w);
[p, f ] = lsqnonlin(prob); 
[f, vl] = cost_fun(p, d, w); 
dh = p * reshape(vl, size(p, 2), size(d, 2));

function [f, vl] = cost_fun(p, d, w)
bp = kron(eye(size(d, 2)), p);
vl = (bp' * w * bp) \ bp' * w * d(:);
f = d(:)' * w * (d(:) - bp * vl);
&lt;/source&gt;
 
The variable projections approach can be applied also to low rank approximation problems parameterized in the kernel form. The method is effective when the number of eliminated variables is much larger than the number of optimization variables left at the stage of the nonlinear least squares minimization. Such problems occur in system identification, parameterized in the kernel form, where the eliminated variables are the approximating trajectory and the remaining variables are the model parameters. In the context of [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant systems]], the elimination step is equivalent to [[Kalman filter|Kalman smoothing]].

==A Variant: convex-restricted low rank approximation==
Usually, we want our new solution not only to be of low rank, but also satisfy other convex constraints due to application requirements. Our interested problem would be as follows,

: &lt;math&gt;
\text{minimize} \quad \text{over } \widehat p \quad \|p - \widehat p\| \quad\text{subject to}\quad \operatorname{rank}\big(\mathcal{S}(\widehat p)\big) \leq r \text{ and }
g(\widehat p) \leq 0
&lt;/math&gt;

This problem can find tons of real applications, including to recover a good solution from an inexact (semidefinite programming) relaxation. If additional constraint &lt;math&gt;g(\widehat p) \leq 0&lt;/math&gt; is linear, like we require all elements to be nonnegative, the problem is called structured low rank approximation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=structured low-rank approximation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379502005050 | doi=10.1016/S0024-3795(02)00505-0 | volume=366|journal=Linear Algebra and its Applications|pages=157–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the more general form is named as convex-restricted low rank approximation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|title=restricted low-rank approximation|eprint=1512.01748|last1=Zhang|first1=Ying|class=cs.NA|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem is helpful in solving many problems. However, it is challenging due to the combination of the convex and nonconvex (low-rank) constraints. Different techniques were developed based on different realizations of &lt;math&gt;g(\widehat p) \leq 0&lt;/math&gt;. However, the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) can be applied to solve the nonconvex problem with convex objective function, rank constraints and other convex constraints,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A General System for Heuristic Solution of Convex Problems over Nonconvex Sets|url=http://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/ncvx.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is thus suitable to solve our above problem. Moreover, unlike the general nonconvex problems, ADMM will guarantee to converge a feasible solution as long as its dual variable converges in the iterations

The term is a [[portmanteau]] of [[neuron]] and [[physics]], to represent an interdisciplinary science which applies the approaches and methods of experimental biophysics to study the nervous system.

Examples of techniques developed and used in neurophysics are [[Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain|magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]], [[patch clamp]], [[tomography]], and [[two-photon excitation microscopy]].

'''New media''' are forms of media that are native to computers, computational and relying on computers for redistribution. Some examples of new media are [[telephone]]s, [[computer]]s, [[virtual world]]s, [[single media]], [[website games]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interface]], [[computer animation]] and [[New media art|interactive computer installations]].&lt;ref name="Manovich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11661|title=Designing Learning Tools. Methodological Insights.|last=Leinonen|first=Teemu|publisher=Aalto University School of Art and Design|year=2010|isbn=978-952-60-0031-2|location=Helsinki|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New media are often contrasted to "[[old media]]", such as television, radio, and print media, although scholars in communication and media studies have criticised rigid distinctions based on oldness and novelty. New media does not include [[television program]]s (only analog broadcast), feature films, [[magazine]]s, [[book]]s, &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; unless they contain technologies that enable digital generative or interactive processes.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;Manovich, Lev. "New Media From Borges to HTML." ''The New Media Reader.'' Ed. Noah Wardrip-Fruin &amp; Nick Montfort. Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2003. 13-25. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia, is a good example of New Media, combining [[Internet]] accessible digital text, images and video with web-links, creative participation of contributors, interactive feedback of users and formation of a participant community of editors and donors for the benefit of non-community readers. [[Facebook]] is another type of New Media, belonging to the category of [[social media]] model, in which most users are also participants. Another type of New Media is [[Twitter]] which also belongs to the social media category, through which users interact with one another and make announcements to which the public receive. Both Facebook and Twitter have risen in usage in recent years and have become an online resource for acquiring information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/|title=The Evolving Role of News on Twitter and Facebook|date=2015-07-14|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1950s, connections between computing and radical art began to grow stronger. It was not until the 1980s that [[Alan Kay]] and his co-workers at [[Xerox PARC]] began to give the [[computability]] of a [[personal computer]] to the individual, rather than have a big organization be in charge of this. "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, we seem to witness a different kind of parallel relationship between social changes and [[computer design]]. Although causally unrelated, conceptually it makes sense that the [[Cold War]] and the design of the Web took place at exactly the same time."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

Writers and philosophers such as [[Marshall McLuhan]] were instrumental in the development of [[media theory]] during this period. His now famous declaration in ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) that "[[the medium is the message]]" drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their "content," have on humans' experience of the world and on society broadly.

Until the 1980s [[media (communication)|media]] relied primarily upon print and [[analog signal|analog]] [[broadcast]] models, such as those of [[television]] and [[radio]]. The last twenty-five years have seen the rapid transformation into media which are predicated upon the use of digital technologies, such as the [[Internet]] and [[video game]]s. However, these examples are only a small representation of new media. The use of [[digital computer]]s has transformed the remaining 'old' media, as suggested by the advent of [[digital television]] and [[online publication]]s. Even traditional media forms such as the printing press have been transformed through the application of technologies such as [[image manipulation]] software like [[Adobe Photoshop]] and desktop publishing tools.

[[Andrew L. Shapiro]] (1999) argues that the "emergence of new, digital technologies signals a potentially radical shift of who is in control of information, experience and resources" (Shapiro cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). [[W. Russell Neuman]] (1991) suggests that whilst the "new media" have technical capabilities to pull in one direction, economic and social forces pull back in the opposite direction. According to Neuman, "We are witnessing the evolution of a universal interconnected network of audio, video, and electronic text communications that will blur the distinction between interpersonal and mass communication and between public and private communication" (Neuman cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). Neuman argues that new media will:
*Alter the meaning of geographic distance.
*Allow for a huge increase in the volume of [[communication]].
*Provide the possibility of increasing the speed of communication.
*Provide opportunities for interactive communication.
*Allow forms of communication that were previously separate to overlap and interconnect.

Consequently, it has been the contention of scholars such as [[Douglas Kellner]] and [[James Bohman]] that new media, and particularly the Internet, provide the potential for a democratic [[postmodern]] public sphere, in which citizens can participate in well informed, non-hierarchical debate pertaining to their social structures. Contradicting these positive appraisals of the potential social impacts of new media are scholars such as Ed Herman and [[Robert D. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] who have suggested that the transition to new media has seen a handful of powerful [[International|transnational]] [[telecommunication]]s corporations who achieve a level of global influence which was hitherto unimaginable.

Scholars, such as Lister et al. (2003), have highlighted both the positive and negative potential and actual implications of new media technologies, suggesting that some of the early work into new media studies was guilty of technological [[determinism]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; whereby the effects of media were determined by the technology themselves, rather than through tracing the complex social networks which governed the development, funding, implementation and future development of any technology.

Based on the argument that people have a limited amount of time to spend on the consumption of different media, Displacement theory argue that the viewership or readership of one particular outlet leads to the reduction in the amount of time spent by the individual on another. The introduction of New Media, such as the internet, therefore reduces the amount of time individuals would spend on existing "Old" Media, which could ultimately lead to the end of such traditional media.&lt;ref name="Dimmick"&gt;Dimmick, J., Chen, Y., &amp; Li, Z. (2004). Competition between the internet and traditional news media: The gratification-opportunities niche dimension. Journal of Media Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although there are several ways that New Media may be described, Lev Manovich, in an introduction to ''The New Media Reader'', defines New Media by using eight propositions:&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;
#'''New Media versus [[Cyberculture]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Cyberculture is the various social phenomena that are associated with the Internet and network communications (blogs, online multi-player gaming), whereas New Media is concerned more with cultural objects and paradigms (digital to analog television, iPhones).
#'''New Media as Computer Technology Used as a Distribution Platform'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media are the cultural objects which use digital computer technology for distribution and exhibition. e.g. (at least for now) Internet, Web sites, computer multimedia, Blu-ray disks etc. The problem with this is that the definition must be revised every few years. The term "new media" will not be "new" anymore, as most forms of culture will be distributed through computers.
#'''New Media as Digital Data Controlled by Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The language of New Media is based on the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on digital representation and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to digital data that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.
#'''New Media as the Mix Between Existing Cultural Conventions and the Conventions of Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media today can be understood as the mix between older cultural conventions for data representation, access, and manipulation and newer conventions of data representation, access, and manipulation. The "old" data are representations of visual reality and human experience, and the "new" data is numerical data. The computer is kept out of the key "creative" decisions, and is delegated to the position of a technician. e.g. In film, software is used in some areas of production, in others are created using computer animation.
#'''New Media as the [[Aesthetics]] that Accompanies the Early Stage of Every New Modern Media and Communication Technology'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; While ideological tropes indeed seem to be reappearing rather regularly, many aesthetic strategies may reappear two or three times ... In order for this approach to be truly useful it would be insufficient to simply name the strategies and tropes and to record the moments of their appearance; instead, we would have to develop a much more comprehensive analysis which would correlate the history of technology with social, political, and economical histories or the modern period.
#'''New Media as Faster Execution of [[Algorithms]] Previously Executed Manually or through Other Technologies'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Computers are a huge speed-up of what were previously manual techniques. e.g. calculators. Dramatically speeding up the execution makes possible previously non-existent representational technique. This also makes possible of many new forms of media art such as interactive multimedia and video games. On one level, a modern digital computer is just a faster calculator, we should not ignore its other identity: that of a cybernetic control device.
#'''New Media as the Encoding of Modernist [[Avant-Garde]]; New Media as Metamedia'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Manovich declares that the 1920s are more relevant to New Media than any other time period. [[Metamedia]] coincides with [[postmodernism]] in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media is an example of how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.
#'''New Media as Parallel Articulation of Similar Ideas in Post-WWII Art and Modern Computing'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Post WWII Art or "combinatorics" involves creating images by systematically changing a single parameter. This leads to the creation of remarkably similar images and spatial structures. This illustrates that algorithms, this essential part of new media, do not depend on technology, but can be executed by humans.

==Globalization==
The rise of new media has increased communication between people all over the world and the Internet. It has allowed people to express themselves through blogs, websites, videos, pictures, and other user-generated media.

[[Terry Flew|Flew]] (2002) stated that, "as a result of the evolution of new media technologies, [[globalization]] occurs." Globalization is generally stated as "more than expansion of activities beyond the boundaries of particular nation states".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John B. (1995). ''The Media and Modernity''. Cambridge: Polity Press, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization shortens the distance between people all over the world by the electronic communication (Carely 1992 in Flew 2002) and Cairncross (1998) expresses this great development as the "death of distance". New media "radically break the connection between physical place and social place, making physical location much less significant for our social relationships" (Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 311).

However, the changes in the new media environment create a series of tensions in the concept of "public sphere".&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, "Building Media's industry while promoting community of values in the globalisation", Politické Vedy, Journal of International Affairs, Policy and Security, 2/2011, http://www.fpvmv.umb.sk/politickevedy&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingrid Volkmer, "public sphere" is defined as a process through which public communication becomes restructured and partly disembedded from national political and cultural institutions. This trend of the globalized public sphere is not only as a geographical expansion form a nation to worldwide, but also changes the relationship between the public, the media and state (Volkmer, 1999:123).&lt;ref&gt;Volkmer, Ingrid (1999) News in the Global Sphere. A Study of [[CNN]] and its impact on [[Global Communication]], Luton: University of Luton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Virtual communities]]" are being established online and transcend geographical boundaries, eliminating social restrictions.&lt;ref name="DeFleur 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeFleur|first=Everette E. Dennis, Melvin L.|title=Understanding media in the digital age : connections for communication, society, and culture|year=2010|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=New York|isbn=0205595820}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Rheingold]] (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble what we do in real life. "People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create a little high art and a lot of idle talk" (Rheingold cited in Slevin 2000: 91). For [[Sherry Turkle]] "making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships" (Holmes 2005: 184). New media has the ability to connect like-minded others worldwide.

While this perspective suggests that the technology drives&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and therefore is a determining factor&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in the process of globalization, arguments involving [[technological determinism]] are generally frowned upon by mainstream media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond (1974) 'Television: Technology and Cultural Form, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durham, M &amp; Kellner, Douglas (2001) Media and Cultural Studies Keyworks, Malden, Ma and Oxford, UK, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddings, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) "New Media: A Critical Introduction", London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Instead academics focus on the multiplicity of processes by which technology is funded, researched and produced, forming a feedback loop when the technologies are used and often transformed by their users, which then feeds into the process of guiding their future development.

While commentators such as [[Manuel Castells|Castells]]&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"&gt;Castells, Manuel, (1996) Rise of the Network Society, The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture volume 1, Massachusetts, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; espouse a "soft determinism"&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddins, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) New Media: A Critical Introduction, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereby they contend that "Technology does not determine society. Nor does society script the course of technological change, since many factors, including individual inventiveness and entrpreneurialism, intervene in the process of scientific discovery, technical innovation and social applications, so the final outcome depends on a complex pattern of interaction. Indeed the dilemma of technological determinism is probably a false problem, since technology is society and society cannot be understood without its technological tools." (Castells 1996:5) This, however, is still distinct from stating that societal changes are instigated by technological development, which recalls the theses of [[Marshall McLuhan]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962) The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, Toronto, McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

Manovich&lt;ref&gt;Manovich, Lev (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' [[MIT Press]], Cambridge and London&lt;/ref&gt; and Castells&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"/&gt; have argued that whereas mass media "corresponded to the logic of industrial mass society, which values conformity over individuality," (Manovich 2001:41) new media follows the logic of the postindustrial or globalized society whereby "every citizen can construct her own custom lifestyle and select her ideology from a large number of choices. Rather than pushing the same objects to a mass audience, marketing now tries to target each individual separately." (Manovich 2001:42).

==As tool for social change==
[[Social movement]] media has a rich and storied history ''(see [[Agitprop]])'' that has changed at a rapid rate since New Media became widely used.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003"&gt;[[Chris Atton|Atton, Chris]] "Reshaping Social Movement Media for a New Millennium." Social Movement Studies, 2, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] of [[Chiapas]], Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of New Media for communiques and organizing in 1994.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003" /&gt; Since then, New Media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity]] was another landmark in the use of New Media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, television, "Will the Revolution be Cybercast?"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indymedia]] movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "New Technologies, TechnoCities, and the Prospects for Democratization"&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a "radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist model of information and communication technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paschal "Reshaping Communications: Technology, Information and Social Change," London:Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical view along these same lines is that people are taking advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "Globalization and Technopolitics"&lt;/ref&gt; Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her "commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle."  In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement's information instantaneously. Of course, some are also skeptical of the role of New Media in Social Movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Herman, "Is a New Worldwide Web Possible? An Explorative Comparison of the Use of ICTs by Two South African Social Movements," African Studies Review, Volume 50, Number 1 (April 2007), pp. 109–131&lt;/ref&gt; Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.&lt;ref&gt;Marmura, Stephen, "A net advantage? The Internet, grassroots activism and American Middle-Eastern Policy," New Media Society 2008; 10; 247&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media has also found a use with less radical social movements such as the [[Free Hugs Campaign]]. Using websites, blogs, and online videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the movement itself. Along with this example the use of high volume blogs has allowed numerous views and practices to be more widespread and gain more public attention. Another example is the ongoing [[Free Tibet Campaign]], which has been seen on numerous websites as well as having a slight tie-in with the band [[Gorillaz]] in their Gorillaz Bitez clip featuring the lead singer [[2D (Gorillaz)|2D]] sitting with protesters at a Free Tibet protest. Another social change seen coming from New Media is trends in fashion and the emergence of subcultures such as [[SMS language|Text Speak]], [[Cyberpunk]], and various others.

Following trends in fashion and [[Text Speak]], New Media also makes way for "trendy" social change. The [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] is a recent example of this. All in the name of raising money for [[ALS]] (the lethal neurodegenerative disorder also known as [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]), participants are nominated by friends via [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and ownmirror to dump a bucket of ice water on themselves, or donate to the ALS Foundation. This became a huge trend through Facebook's tagging tool, allowing nominees to be tagged in the post. The videos appeared on more people's feeds, and the trend spread fast. This trend raised over 100 million dollars for the cause and increased donations by 3,500 percent.

== National security ==
{{See also|Terrorism and social media}}
New Media has also recently become of interest to the global [[espionage]] community as it is easily accessible electronically in [[database]] format and can therefore be quickly retrieved and reverse engineered by national [[governments]]. Particularly of interest to the [[espionage]] community are [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], two sites where individuals freely divulge personal information that can then be sifted through and archived for the automatic creation of dossiers on both people of interest and the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Mind_Your_Tweets:_The_CIA_Social_Networking_Surveillance_System&lt;/ref&gt;

New media also serves as an important tool for both institutions and nations to promote their interest and values (The contents of such promotion may vary according to different  purposes). Some communities consider it an approach of "peaceful evolution" that may erode their own nation's system of values and eventually compromise national security.

==Interactivity==
[[Interactivity]] has become a term for a number of new media use options evolving from the rapid dissemination of [[Internet]] access points, the [[digitalization]] of media, and [[media convergence]]. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information.&lt;ref&gt;Schorr, A &amp; Schenk, M &amp; Campbell, W (2003),''Communication Research and Media Science in Europe'', Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Such a definition replaces the "[[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]]" model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a "[[many-to-many]]" web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, David &amp; Hoynes, William (2003) Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences (third edition), Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In "What is new media?" Vin Crosbie&lt;ref name="Crosbie, 2002"&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc] Crosbie, V. (2002). What is New Media? Retrieved from http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as "one to one", Mass media as "one to many", and finally New Media as [[Individuation]] Media or "many to many".

When we think of interactivity and its meaning, we assume that it is only prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf (1988). "[https://www.academia.edu/533664/Interactivity_From_new_media_to_communication Interactivity: From new media to communication]". Beverly Hills, CA. Pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and there is no longer a limit to what we can do with our creativity.

Interactivity can be considered a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf &amp; Ariel, Yaron (2007), "Assessing Interactivity in Computer-Mediated Research". In: A.N Joinson, K.Y.A McKenna., T. Postmes &amp; U-D. Reips (Eds). The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; different degrees of interactivity,&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry (2002), ''New Media: An Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], UK, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Tony (1997) ''An Introduction to Digital Media'', Routledege, London&lt;/ref&gt; considers digital [[satellite television]] as an example of a new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.

[[Terry Flew]] (2005) argues that "the global interactive games industry is large and growing, and is at the forefront of many of the most significant innovations in new media" (Flew 2005: 101). Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[The Sims Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''. These games, which are developments of "new media," allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from different parts of the world interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of ''The Sims'', "is fascinated by the way gamers have become so attached to his invention-with some even living their lives through it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article The Sun Newspaper Online]&lt;/ref&gt; New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of the world we live in. With the creation of ''Second Life'' and [[Active Worlds]] before it, people have even more control over this virtual world, a world where anything that a participant can think of can become a reality.&lt;ref&gt;http://secondlife.com/whatis/#Be_Creative&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media changes continuously because it is constantly modified and redefined by the interaction between users, emerging technologies, cultural changes, etc.

New forms of New Media are emerging like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with video games and the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and that people want to watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created that the majority of the gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.

==Industry==
The new media industry shares an open association with many market segments in areas such as [[software]]/[[video game design]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[mobile phone|mobile]] and particularly movies, [[advertising]] and [[marketing]], through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the [[Internet]]. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the [[television]] industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar [[interactive advertising]] subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]] have also set up new divisions to study new media. [[Public relations]] firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through [[interactive PR]] practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2010/03/16/public-relations-social-media-results/&lt;/ref&gt; to reach a mass audience of online social network users.

With the rise of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many technical jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed.  What many don't realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not.  New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Gill's Cool, Creative and Egalitarian?&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ideology of new media careers as an egalitarian and stress-free environment is a myth. It is a game of networking and thriving at what you are capable of. Many workers face job instability. Inequality within this field exists due to the informality and flexibility of this career path.

Within the Industry, many Companies have emerged or transformed to adapt to the fast moving exciting opportunities that new media offers. The following companies are great examples of the changing landscape of companies/agencies whom have redeveloped, added or changed services to offer new media services.&lt;ref name="Counting the change – The Economist"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.economist.com/news/business/21583687-media-companies-took-battering-internet-cash-digital-sources-lasty|title=Counting the change|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Based on nationally representative data, a study conducted by [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in five-year intervals in 1998–99, 2003–04, and 2008–09 found that with technology allowing nearly 24-hour media access, the amount of time young people spend with entertainment media has risen dramatically, especially among Black and Hispanic youth.&lt;ref&gt;Rideout V, Foehr U, Roberts D. Generation M2: Media in the lives o 8- to 18- year olds. January 2010, http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/8010.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, 8- to 18-year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes (7:38) to using entertainment media in a typical day (more than 53 hours a week) – about the same amount most adults spend at work per day.  Since much of that time is spent 'media multitasking' (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to spend a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content in those 7½ hours per day. According to the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]], 96% of 18- to 29-year-olds and three-quarters (75%) of teens now own a cell phone, 88% of whom text, with 73% of wired American teens using social networking websites, a significant increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults.aspx|title=Social Media and Young Adults|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|author2=Kristen Purcell |author3=Aaron Smith |author4=Kathryn Zickuhr |date=February 3, 2010|work=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of over 25000 9- to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries found that many underage children use social media sites despite the site's stated age requirements, and many youth lack the digital skills to use social networking sites safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Ólafsson, Kjartan |author3=Staksrud, Elisabeth |title=Risky Social Networking Practices Among "Underage" Users: Lessons for Evidence-Based Policy|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2013|volume=18|issue=3|pages=303|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the new digital media demands a new educational model by parents and educators. The ''parental mediation'' become a way to manage the children’s experiences with Internet, chat, videogames and social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/media-education/educating-in-the-knowledge-of-new-media/|title=Educating in the knowledge of New Media|date=2017-05-24|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend in internet is Youtubers Generation. Youtubers are young people who offer free video in their personal channel on YouTube. There are videos on games, fashion, food, cinema and music, where they offers tutorial or comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/internet-and-social-network/who-are-they-and-why-do-kids-like-them-so-much/|title=YouTubers: Who are they, and why do kids like them so much?|date=2017-02-20|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of cellular phones, such as the [[iPhone]], has created the inability to be in [[social isolation]], and the potential of ruining relationships. The iPhone activates the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love. People show similar feelings to their phones as they would to their friends, family and loved ones. Countless people spend more time on their phones, while in the presence of other people than spending time with the people in the same room or class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindstrom|first=Martin|title=You Love Your iPhone.

==Political campaigns in the United States==
In trying to determine the impact of new media on [[political campaign]]ing and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. [[Television]] is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has had a significant impact on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different [[social media]] platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.

Additionally, their websites are socially connected, engaging voters before, during, and after elections. Email and [[text message]]s are also regularly sent to supporters encouraging them to donate and get involved.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"&gt;Owen, D. (2011). New Media and Political Campaigns. In K. K. Jamieson (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Political Communication Theory and Research. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some existing research focuses on the ways that political campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data and in some cases harness the [[web analytics|analytics]] of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data about the kinds of engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;
One body of existing research into the impact of new media on elections investigates the relationship between voters' use of new media and their level of political activity. They focus on areas such as "attentiveness, knowledge, attitudes, orientations, and engagement" (Owen, 2011). In references a vast body of research, Owen (2011) points out that older studies were mixed, while "newer research reveals more consistent evidence of information gain".&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;

Some of that research has shown that there is a connection between the amount and degree of voter engagement and turnout (Owen, 2011). However, new media may not have overwhelming effects on either of those. Other research is tending toward the idea that new media has reinforcing effect, that rather than completely altering, by increasing involvement, it "imitates the established pattern of [[political participation]]" (Nam, 2012). After analyzing the Citizenship Involvement Democracy survey, Nam (2012) found that "the internet plays a dual role in mobilizing political participation by people not normally politically involved, as well as reinforcing existing offline participation." These findings chart a middle ground between some research that optimistically holds new media up to be an extremely effective or extremely ineffective at fostering political participation.&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2012). Dual effects on the internet on political activism: Reinforcing and mobilizing.Government Information Quarterly, S90–S97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towner (2013) found, in his survey of college students, that attention to new media increases offline and online political participation particularly for young people. His research shows that the prevalence of online media boosts participation and engagement. His work suggests that "it seems that online sources that facilitate political involvement, communication, and mobilization, particularly campaign websites, social media, and blogs, are the most important for offline political participation among young people".&lt;ref&gt;Towner, T. L. (2013). All Political Participation is Socially Networked? New Media and the 2012 Election. Social Science Computer Review, 00(0), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deliberation When gauging effects and implications of new media on the political process, one means of doing so is to look at the deliberations that take place in these digital spaces (Halpern &amp; Gibbs, 2013). In citing the work of several researchers, Halpern and Gibbs (2003) define deliberation to be "the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough discussion. and the notion that in this process of communication the individuals involved weigh carefully the reasons for and against some of the propositions presented by others".&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"&gt;Halpern, D., &amp; Gibbs, J. (2013). Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation? Exploring the affordances of Facebook and YouTube for political expression. Computers in Human Behavior, 1159-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Halpern and Gibbs (2013) "suggest that although social media may not provide a forum for intensive or in-depth policy debate, it nevertheless provides a deliberative space to discuss and encourage political participation, both directly and indirectly". Their work goes a step beyond that as well though because it shows that some social media sites foster a more robust [[political debate]] than do others such as Facebook which includes highly personal and identifiable access to information about users alongside any comments they may post on political topics. This is in contrast to sites like YouTube whose comments are often posted anonymously.&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"/&gt;

== Ethical Issues in New Media Research ==
Due to the popularity of new media, social media websites (SMWs) like Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly popular among researchers (Moreno, Goniu, Moreno, Diekema, 2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Goniu|first2=N.|last3=Moreno|first3=P.S|last4=Diekema|first4=D.|date=2013|title=Ethics of Social Media Research: Common Concerns and Practical Considerations|url=|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=16|pages=708–713|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0334|via=|pmc=3942703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SMWs present new opportunities, they also represent challenges for researchers interested in studying social phenomena online, since it can be difficult to determine what are acceptable risks to privacy unique to social media. Some scholars (e.g. Moreno, Frost &amp; Christakis, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Frost|first2=N.C.|last3=Christakis|first3=D.A|date=2008|title=Research ethics in the MySpace era|url=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=121|pages=157–161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that standard Institutional Review Board (IRB) procedures provide little guidance on research protocols relating to social media in particular.

As a consequence, Moreno et al. (2013) identified three major approaches to research on social media and relevant concerns scholars should consider before engaging in social media research.

=== Observational Research ===
One of the major issues for observational research is whether a particular project is considered to involve human subjects. A human subject is one that “is defined by federal regulations as a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data through interaction with the individual or identifiable private information”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreno et al. (2013) note that if access to a social media site is public, information is considered identifiable but not private, and information gathering procedures do not require researchers to interact with the original poster of the information, then this does not meet the requirements for human subjects research. Research may also be exempt if the disclosure of participant responses outside the realm of the published research does not subject the participant to civic or criminal liability, damage the participant’s reputation, employability or financial standing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given these criteria, however, researchers still have considerable leeway when conducting observational research on social media. Many profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Twitter are public and researchers are free to use that data for observational research.

It should be noted, however, that users have the ability to change their privacy settings on most social media websites. Facebook, for example, provides users with the ability to restrict who sees their posts through specific privacy settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M.A|date=2011|title=Social privacy in networked publics: teens' attitudes, practices and strategies. A decade in internet time.|url=|journal=Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also debate about whether requiring users to create a username and password is sufficient to establish whether the data is considered public or private. Historically, Institutional Review Boards considered such websites to be private,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although newer websites like YouTube call this practice into question. For example, YouTube only requires the creation of a username and password to post videos and/or view adult content, but anyone is free to view general YouTube videos and these general videos would not be subject to consent requirements for researchers looking to conduct observational studies.

=== Interactive Research ===
According to Romano et al. (2013), interactive research occurs when "a researcher wishes to access the [social media website] content that is not publicly available" (pg. 710). Because researchers have limited ways of accessing this data, this could mean that a researcher sends a Facebook user a friend request, or follows a user on Twitter in order to gain access to potentially protected tweets (pg.711). While it could be argued that such actions would violate a social media user's expectation of privacy, Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) argued that actions like "friending" or "following" an individual on social media constitutes a "loose tie" relationship and therefore not sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy since individuals often have friends or followers they have never even met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=July 2007|title=The Benefits of Facebook "Friends:" Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143–1168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survey/Interview Research ===
Because research on social media occurs online, it is difficult for researchers to observe participant reactions to the informed consent process. For example, when collecting information about activities that are potentially illegal, or recruiting participants from stigmatized populations, this lack of physical proximity could potentially negatively impact the informed consent process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another important consideration regards the confidentiality of information provided by participants. While information provided over the internet might be perceived as lower risk, studies that publish direct quotes from study participants might expose them to the risk of being identified via a Google search&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{See also|epistemological break}}

A '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning, as "example".

The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase "revolution of the way of thinking" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). As one commentator summarizes:

{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.

== Kuhnian paradigm shifts ==
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An [[epistemology|epistemological]] paradigm shift  was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and [[history of science|historian of science]] Thomas Kuhn in his book ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire [[World view|worldview]] in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.

There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject [[Karl Popper]]'s model of [[falsifiability]] as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|Mercury's perihelion]] more troubling than the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the [[logical positivists]] in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.

When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of ''crisis,'' according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a ''new'' paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwellian]] [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic worldview]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from [[Max Planck]]: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a ''scientific revolution'' or a ''paradigm shift''. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term ''paradigm shift'' is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.

In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn,&lt;ref&gt;''Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything'', Imprint Academic 2015, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.

== Science and paradigm shift ==

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305–20. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "''On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme''" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. 

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p.&amp;nbsp;12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{See also|Science and Theosophy#New paradigm}}

== Examples of paradigm shifts ==

=== Natural sciences ===
Some of the "classical cases" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:

* 1543 – The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1543 – The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98–112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1687 – The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1783 – The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm Shifts: Technology &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1826 – The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|date=1987|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1859 – The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].
* 1905 – The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83–84, 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1887 to 1905 – The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1919 – The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[General Relativity]].

=== Social sciences ===
In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuhn | first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= 6 |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.
* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Laidler]]. ''Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Say's Law]] dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John Kenneth |year=1975 |title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went |page=223 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-19843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzdkAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, [[John A. Hobson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money |page=366 |quote=Mr. Hobson has flung himself with unflagging, but almost unavailing, ardour and courage against the ranks of orthodoxy. Though it is so completely forgotten to-day, the publication of this book marks, in a sense, an epoch in economic thought. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.
* Later, the movement for [[monetarism]] over [[Keynesian]]ism marked a second divisive shift. Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing [[inflation]], that it was solely a monetary phenomenon, in contrast to the [[Keynesian]] view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important.  Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the [[quantity theory of money]] and shifting [[Phillips curve]], theories they initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., Schwartz, Anna J.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ''Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in 1879, the [[laryngeal theory]] in [[Indo-European linguistics]] postulated the existence of "laryngeal" consonants in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the [[Hittite language]] in the early 20th century. The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists, paving the way for the [[internal reconstruction]] of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo European Linguistics: An Introduction|author=James Clackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied sciences ===
More recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|pages=68–89|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a [[buzzword]], popularized as [[marketing speak]] and appearing more frequently in print and publication.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999). http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Mind The Gaffe'', author [[Larry Trask]] advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase.  It is referred to in several articles and books&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6275610-1.html Cnet.com's Top 10 Buzzwords]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete Idiot's Guide to A Smart Vocabulary"&gt;[http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp "The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142–43, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012026/http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp |date=December 15, 2007 }} {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.

== Other uses ==
The term "paradigm shift" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:
* M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.&lt;ref http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/779.full.pdf&gt;2009. "Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185–202&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two photographs of the Earth from space, "[[Earthrise]]" (1968) and "[[The Blue Marble]]" (1972), are thought to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher H. "Global Warming and the Problem of Policy Innovation: Lessons from the Early Environmental Movement". 2009. http://www.lclark.edu/org/envtl/objects/39-2_Schroeder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Stewart Brand#NASA image of Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Küng]] applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Hans &amp; Tracy, David (ed). ''Paradigm Change in Theology''. New York: Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''.&lt;ref&gt;Küng, Hans. ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''. New York: Anchor Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7835">'''Phonemic awareness''' is a subset of [[phonological awareness]] in which listeners are able to hear, identify and manipulate [[phonemes]], the smallest mental units of [[sound]] that helps to differentiate units of meaning ([[morphemes]]). Separating the spoken word "cat" into three distinct phonemes, [[Voiceless velar stop|{{IPA|/k/}}]], [[Near-open front unrounded vowel|{{IPA|/æ/}}]], and [[Voiceless dental and alveolar stops|{{IPA|/t/}}]], requires phonemic awareness. However, phonemes could not be separated like notes in a song or could be identified in isolation.
The [[National Reading Panel]] has found that phonemic awareness improves children's word [[Reading (process)|reading]] and [[reading comprehension]], as well as helping children learn to spell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas |format= |work=NICHD |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phonemic awareness is the basis for learning [[phonics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.readingonline.org/critical/shanahan/panel.html |title=Critical Issues: The National Reading Panel |work=Reading Online |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phonemic awareness and phonological awareness are often confused since they are interdependent. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear and manipulate individual phonemes. Phonological awareness includes this ability, but it also includes the ability to hear and manipulate larger units of sound, such as [[Syllable_onset#Onset|onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rime]]s and [[syllable]]s.

Studies by Vickie Snider have shown that phonemic awareness has a direct correlation with students' ability to read as they get older.  Phonemic awareness builds a foundation for students to understand the rules of the English language.  This in turn allows each student to apply these skills and increase his or her oral [[Fluency|reading fluency]] and understanding of the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Snider | first = Vicki E. | title = The Relationship between Phonemic Awareness and Later Reading Achievement | jstor = 27542094 | publisher =  JSTOR | year =  1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A research study done by Robert Johnson and Gregory Tweedie applying direct Phonemic Awareness (PA) instruction to young English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners in rural Malaysia showed that those children educated by PA achieved significantly greater test scores than the control group. PA accelerated the acquisition of relevant literacy and numeracy skills in this case. It also suggested that PA might help close the literacy and numeracy education gap between urban pre-school attender and rural non attender children. However, this enhancement needs to be validated by further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=R. C.|last2=Tweedie|first2=M.

Despite the substantial gains in vowel recognition, a downside of using PA, not in this study, is that adult ELLs may negatively perceive PA as a "childish" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tweedie|first=|last2=Johnson|first2=|last3=et al.|date=|year=2015|title=Direct phonemic awareness instruction as a means of improving academic text comprehension for adult English language learners.|url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/jet/article/view/44221/31659|journal=Journal of Educational Thought|volume=48|issue=1-2|pages=81-102|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Phonemic awareness relates to the ability to distinguish and manipulate individual sounds, such as {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ʊ/}}, and {{IPA|/t/}} in the case of ''foot''. The following are common phonemic awareness skills practiced with students:
* Phoneme isolation: which requires recognizing the individual sounds in words, for example, "Tell me the first sound you hear in the word paste" ({{IPA|/p/}}).
* Phoneme identity: which requires recognizing the common sound in different words, for example, "Tell me the sound that is the same in bike, boy and bell" ({{IPA|/b/}}).
* Phoneme substitution: in which one can turn a word (such as "cat") into another (such as "hat") by substituting one phoneme (such as {{IPA|/h/}}) for another ({{IPA|/k/}}).  Phoneme substitution can take place for initial sounds (cat-hat), middle sounds (cat-cut) or ending sounds (cat-cap).
* Oral segmenting: The teacher says a word, for example, "ball," and students say the individual sounds, {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/ɔː/}}, and {{IPA|/l/}}.
* Oral blending: The teacher says each sound, for example, "{{IPA|/b/, /ɔː/, /l/}}" and students respond with the word, "ball".
* Sound deletion: The teacher says a word, has students repeat it, and then instructs students to repeat the word without the first sound. For example, the teacher might say "now say 'bill' without the {{IPA|/b/}}", which students should respond to with "ill".
* Onset-rime manipulation: which requires isolation, identification, segmentation, blending, or deletion of onsets (the single consonant or blend that precedes the vowel and following consonants), for example, j-ump, st-op, str-ong. 
There are other phonemic awareness activities, such as sound substitution, where students are instructed to replace one sound with another; sound addition, where students add sounds to words; and sound switching, where students manipulate the order of the phonemes. These are more complex but research supports the use of the three listed above, particularly oral segmenting and oral blending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Yopp | first = Hallie K. | title = Developing Phonemic Awareness in Young Children | publisher = The Reading Teacher Vol. 45, No. 9, 1992 A Journal of the International Reading Association | url = http://www.reading.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1644">'''Planktology''' is the [[research|study]] of [[plankton]], various small drifting plants, animals and [[microorganism]]s that inhabit bodies of [[water]]. Planktology topics include [[primary production]], [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] and the [[carbon cycle]].

{{stack|[[Image:Plankton collage.jpg|thumb|300px|Composed image of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]]]]}}

Plankton drive the "[[biological pump]]", a process by which the [[ocean]] [[ecosystem]] transports [[carbon]] from the surface [[euphotic zone]] to the ocean's depths. Such processes are vital to [[carbon dioxide sink]]s, one of several possibilities for countering [[global warming]]. Modern planktology includes behavioral aspects of drifting organisms, engaging modern ''[[in situ]]'' imaging devices.

Some planktology projects allow the public to participate [[online]], such as the [[Long-term Ecosystem Observatory]].

'''Priority''' is a fundamental principle of modern [[botanical nomenclature]] and [[zoological nomenclature]]. Essentially, it is the principle of recognising the first valid application of a name to a plant or animal. There are two aspects to this: 
# The first formal scientific name given to a plant or animal [[taxon]] shall be the name that is to be used, called the [[Valid name (zoology)|valid name]] in zoology and [[Correct name (botany)|correct name]] in botany.
# Once a name has been used, no subsequent publication of that name for another taxon shall be valid (zoology) or [[validly published name (botany)|validly published]] (botany).

There are formal provisions for making exceptions to this principle. If an archaic or obscure prior name is discovered for an established taxon, the current name can be declared a ''[[nomen conservandum]]'' (botany) or ''[[conserved name]]'' (zoology), and so conserved against the prior name. Similarly, if the current name for a taxon is found to have an archaic or obscure prior [[homonym (botany)|homonym]], the current name can be declared a ''[[nomen protectum]]'' (zoology) or the older name suppressed (''[[nomen rejiciendum]]'', botany).

==History==
The principle of priority has not always been in place. When [[Carl Linnaeus]] laid the foundations of modern nomenclature, he offered no recognition of prior names. The botanists who followed him were just as willing to overturn Linnaeus's names. The first sign of recognition of priority came in 1813, when [[A. P. de Candolle]] laid out some principles of good nomenclatural practice. He favoured retaining prior names, but left wide scope for overturning poor prior names.&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt;

===In botany===
During the 19th century, the principle gradually came to be accepted by almost all botanists, but debate continued to rage over the conditions under which the principle might be ignored. Botanists on one side of the debate argued that priority should be universal and without exception. This would have meant a one-off major disruption as countless names in current usage were overturned in favour of archaic prior names. In 1891, [[Otto Kuntze]], one of the most vocal proponents of this position, did just that, publishing over 30000 new combinations in his ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]''.&lt;ref name=Nicolson&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dan | last = Nicolson | year = 1991 | title = A history of botanical nomenclature | journal = [[Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden]] | volume = 78 | pages = 33–56 | doi = 10.2307/2399589}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then followed with further such publications in 1893, 1898 and 1903.&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt; His efforts, however, were so disruptive that they appear to have benefited his opponents. By the 1900s, the need for a mechanism for the conservation of names was widely accepted, and details of such a mechanism were under discussion. The current system of "modified priority" was essentially put in place at the [[Cambridge Congress of 1930]].&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt;

==In zoology==
The Principle of Priority is one of the guiding principles of the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'', defined by Article 23. There are exceptions: another name may be given precedence by any provision of the Code or by any ruling of the Commission. It is a fundamental guiding precept that preserves the stability of biological nomenclature. It was first formulated in 1842 by  a committee appointed by the [[British Association]] to consider the rules of zoological nomenclature; the committee's report was written by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]].

==Examples==
* In 1855, [[John Edward Gray]] published the name ''Antilocapra anteflexa'' for a new species of [[pronghorn]], based on a pair of horns. However, it is now thought that his specimen belonged to an unusual individual of an existing species, ''[[Antilocapra americana]]'', with a name published by [[George Ord]] in 1815. The older name, by Ord, takes priority; with ''Antilocapra anteflexa'' becoming a junior [[synonym (zoology)|synonym]].
* In 1856, [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] published the name ''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' for a new species of [[eel]]. However, it was realized in 1893 that the organism described by Kaup was in fact the juvenile form of the [[European eel]] (see [[eel life history]] for the full story). The European eel was named ''Muraena anguilla'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. So ''Muraena anguilla'' is the name to be used for the species, and ''Leptocephalus brevirostris'' must be considered as a junior synonym and not be used. Today the European eel is classified in the genus ''[[Anguilla (genus)|Anguilla]]'' (Garsault, 1764,) so its currently used name is ''Anguilla anguilla'' (Linnaeus, 1758).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2231">In [[programming language theory]], the '''qualification principle''' states that any semantically meaningful syntactic class may admit local definitions. In other words, it's possible to include a ''block'' in any syntactic class, provided that the phrases of that class specify some kind of computation. {{Harv|Watt|1990}}

A common examples for of this principle includes:
* '''block command''' -- a command containing a local declaration, which is used only for executing this command. In the following excerpt from a [[C (programming language)|C]] program, &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; variable declared is local to the surrounding block command:
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
if (a &gt; b) {
    int tmp;
    tmp = a;
    a = b;
    b = tmp;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''block expression''' -- an expression containing a local declaration, which is used only for evaluating this expression. In the following excerpt from [[ML (programming language)|ML]] program, local declaration of &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; can be used only during evaluation of the following expression:

&lt;!-- there is no ML syntax highlighting, use OCaml here :( --&gt;
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
let
    val g = 9.8
in
    m * g * h
end
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''block declaration''' is one containing a local declaration, the bindings produced by which are used only for elaborating the block declaration. In the following excerpt from [[ML (programming language)|ML]] program, local declaration of function &lt;code&gt;leap&lt;/code&gt;, using an auxiliary function &lt;code&gt;multiple&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;!-- there is no ML syntax highlighting, use OCaml here :( --&gt;
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
local
    fun multiple (n: int, d: int) = 
          (n mod d = 0)
in
    fun leap (y: int) = 
          (multiple (y,4)
          andalso not multiple (y, 100))
          orelse multiple (y,400)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5799">'''Rich Donovan''' is a global expert in business development issues surrounding disability and accessibility. He is best known for creating financial instruments that track the intersection of corporate profitability with corporate commitment to disability hiring and best practices. His Return On Disability Index is reported on Bloomberg and has been used as the basis of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN) by [[Barclay’s Bank]] on the [[NYSE Arca]] Stock Exchange.

==Accessibility and Finance Work==

===Development of the Return on Disability Index===

Rich Donovan is a founder of several research and advisory companies that have foregrounded the business case for companies and governments to act on the disability market. In 2008, he founded what is now called '''The Return on Disability Group''' to build metric and models that allow for analysis of corporate activity which help assess how well businesses engage customers and employees with disabilities. The organization’s "Return on Disability Reports" and other models helps companies understand their performance across disability factors that are linked directly to profitability. As well they produce the Return on Disability Indices for the U.S. and Canada markets. These financial tools "recognize public companies that are outperforming in the disability market."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rod-group.com/rod-report/companies |title=The RoD Report |publisher=The Return on Disability Group |access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The RoD US 100 and the RoD Canada 50, are published daily by Bloomberg LP. The indices track the shares of the 100 firms that deal best with disabled people. The Economist notes that in the five years to 2012 the US index had outperformed the broader stock market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=September 8, 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=[[The Economist]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LIME===
In 2006, Rich Donovan founded Lime Connect.   Lime Connect is an organization whose goal is to find employment for people with disabilities.   The idea with Lime Connect is: “to connect with the brightest people with disabilities from all disciplines. Results have been stellar, with the Lime Connect Fellowship Program placing 20 young stars in 2011 alone, six of whom were hired by Google.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essentialaccessibility.com/newsletter/march/feature.html |title=Disability: From Redheaded Stepchild to Golden Girl |publisher=Essential Accessibility |first1=Rich|last1=Donovan|access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies Lime has partnered with include PepsiCo, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, IBM, and TD Bank.&lt;ref name =Carleton&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=2014 |title=Rich Donovan |work=Accessibility Summit: Speaker List |publisher=[[Carleton University]] |access-date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fundamental Concepts===

As one of the early progenitors of the business case for accessibility, Donovan has focused on the following:

* Strategic road maps for companies to do accessibility well. What works within their strategic frameworks.
* What accessibility practices drive value at specific companies that, in turn, drive investor returns
* the notion of Shared value so that the next ten years of growth will come from non-traditional markets such as people with disabilities

==Personal Life and Professional Development==

===Education===

Donovan received his BBA in Finance from the Schulich School of Business at York University (1993 - 1997) and his MBA from Columbia Business School (2000 – 2002). He worked successfully as a trader for Merrill Lynch. Donovan is an avid sailor and father of a son, Maverick, along with his wife, Jenn. He has cerebral palsy.&lt;ref name=Carleton/&gt;

'''Ride height''' (also called '''ground clearance''' or simply '''clearance''') is the amount of space between the base of an automobile [[tire]] and the lowest point (typically the axle); or, more properly, to the shortest distance between a flat, level surface, and the lowest part of a vehicle other than those parts designed to contact the ground (such as tires, tracks, skis, etc.). Ground clearance is measured with standard vehicle equipment, and for cars, is usually given with no cargo or passengers.

[[File:Ford F-250 lifted.jpg|thumb|[[Ford Super Duty#Third generation (2011–present)|Ford F-250]] with aftermarket suspension modifications to increase ride height]]
Ground clearance is a critical factor in several important characteristics of a vehicle. For all vehicles, especially cars, variations in clearance represent a trade-off between [[Automobile handling|handling]] and practicality. A higher ground clearance means that the center of mass of the car is higher, which makes for less precise and more dangerous handling characteristics (most notably, the chance of [[rollover]] is higher). However, it also means that the car is more capable of being driven on roads that are not level, without the road scraping against and likely damaging the chassis and underbody. Higher ride heights will typically adversely affect [[aerodynamic]] properties. This is why [[sports car]]s typically have very low clearances, while [[off-road vehicle]]s and [[SUV]]s have higher ones. Two well-known extremes of each are the [[Ferrari F40]] and the [[Hummer]].

For [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFV), ground clearance presents an additional factor in a vehicle's overall performance: a lower ground clearance means that the vehicle minus the [[chassis]] is lower to the ground and thus harder to spot and harder to hit. The final design of any AFV reflects a compromise between being a smaller target on one hand, and having greater battlefield mobility on the other. Very few AFVs have top speeds at which car-like handling becomes an issue, though rollovers can and do occur. By contrast, an AFV is far more likely to need high ground clearance than a road vehicle.

[[File:Lowered BMW M3.jpg|thumb|BMW E46 "stanced" using aftermarket suspension kit]]
Lowering a car's [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] is a common and relatively inexpensive aftermarket modification. Many people prefer the more aggressive look of a lowered body{{According to whom|date=October 2017}}, and there is an easily realized [[car handling]] improvement from the lower center of gravity. Most passenger cars are produced such that one or two inches of lowering won't increase the probability of damage significantly. On most automobiles, ride height is modified by changing the length of the suspension [[Spring (device)|springs]], and is the essence of many aftermarket suspension kits supplied by manufacturers such as [[Eibach Federn|Eibach]] and [[H&amp;R (automotive manufacturer)|H&amp;R]].

Some cars have used [[underslung frame]]s to achieve a lower ride height and the consequent improvement in center of gravity. The brass-era cars of the [[American Motor Car Company]] are one example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hotrod.com/featuredvehicles/113_0606_25_dodge_roadster/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Self-leveling suspension]] systems are designed to maintain a constant ride height regardless of load. Vehicles not equipped with self-leveling will pitch down at one end when laden; this adversely affects ride, handling, and aerodynamic properties.

Some modern automobiles (such as Audi's [[Audi Allroad Quattro|Allroad Quattro]]) have [[height adjustable suspension|adjustable suspension systems]], which can vary the ride height by locating the suspension mounting points, depending on road conditions and/or the settings selected by the driver.

Other, simpler suspension systems, such as [[coilover]] springs, offer a way of manually adjusting ride height (and often, spring stiffness) by compressing the spring [[in situ]], using a threaded shaft and adjustable knob or nut.

[[Image:MUTCD W10-5.svg|100px|thumb|right|[[Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices|MUTCD]] warning sign for a [[Level  crossing|low-ground-clearance crossing]]]] 18-wheel [[tractor-trailers]] also have to take the ground clearance of both their tractor and especially trailer into consideration on certain areas of uneven terrain, such as raised [[Level crossing|railroad crossings]]. Their extremely long [[wheelbase]] means that such terrain could potentially catch the undercarriage of the trailer in the wide space between the axles, potentially leaving the truck stuck with no means to extricate itself.

In some areas buses are required to have a ground clearance of at least {{convert|100|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090522222432/http://www.transport.sa.gov.au/pdfs/freight/code_conduct_buses.pdf "Code of Practice for Buses", section 3.2: Ground Clearance]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Too much ride height can cause the vehicle to have a higher center of gravity, which could cause the vehicle to be unstable, or even flip.

[[File:Random rubble masonry.jpg|thumb|right|A rubble trench foundation]]
The '''rubble trench foundation''', an ancient construction approach popularized by architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], is a type of [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]] that uses loose stone or rubble to minimize the use of [[concrete]] and improve drainage.&lt;ref&gt;Chappell, Steve (1998) ''The Alternative building sourcebook: for traditional, natural, and sustainable building products and services''. Brownfield, Me.: Fox Maple Press. p. 9. {{ISBN|1889269018}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered more environmentally friendly than other types of foundation because cement manufacturing requires the use of enormous amounts of energy. However, some soil environments are not suitable for this kind of foundation; particularly expansive or poor load-bearing (&lt; 1 ton/sf) soils.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Joseph F. (2002) ''The art of natural building: design, construction, resources''. Gabriola Island, BC: New Society Publishers. p. 111. {{ISBN|0865714339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A rubble trench foundation with a concrete grade beam is not recommended for earthquake prone areas.&lt;ref&gt;Chiras, Daniel D. (2004). ''The new ecological home: the complete guide to green building options''. White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Pub. Co. p. 75. {{ISBN|1931498164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A foundation must bear the structural loads imposed upon it and allow proper drainage of ground water to prevent expansion or weakening of soils and frost heaving. While the far more common concrete foundation requires separate measures to ensure good soil drainage, the rubble trench foundation serves both foundation functions at once.

To construct a rubble trench foundation a narrow trench is dug down below the [[frost line]]. The bottom of the trench would ideally be gently sloped to an outlet. Drainage tile, graded 1":8' to daylight, is then placed at the bottom of the trench in a bed of washed stone protected by filter fabric. The trench is then filled with either screened stone (typically 1-1/2") or recycled rubble. A steel-reinforced concrete grade beam may be poured at the surface to provide ground clearance for the structure.

If an insulated slab is to be poured inside the grade beam, then the outer surface of the grade beam and the rubble trench should be insulated with rigid XPS foam board, which must be protected above grade from mechanical and UV degradation.

The rubble-trench foundation is a relatively simple, inexpensive, and environment-friendly alternative to a conventional foundation, but may require an engineer's approval if building officials are not familiar with it. Frank Lloyd Wright used them successfully for more than 50 years in the first half of the 20th century, and there is a revival of this style of foundation with the increased interest in green building.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3518">The '''safety life cycle''' is the series of phases from initiation and specifications of safety requirements, covering design and development of safety features in a [[safety-critical system]], and ending in decommissioning of that system. This article uses software as the context but the safety life cycle applies to other areas such as construction of buildings, for example. In software development, a process is used (software life cycle) and this process consists of a few phases, typically covering initiation, analysis, design, programming, testing and implementation. The focus is to build the software. Some software have safety concerns while others do not. For example, a Leave Application System does not have safety requirements. But we are concerned about safety if a software that is used to control the components in a plane fails. So for the latter, the question is how safety, being so important, should be managed within the software life cycle.

== What is the Safety Life Cycle? ==

The basic concept in building software safety, i.e. safety features in software, is that safety characteristics and behaviour of the software and system must be specified and designed into the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alberico|first=David|title=Software System Safety Handbook|url=http://www.system-safety.org/Documents/Software_System_Safety_Handbook.pdf|publisher=Joint Services Software Safety Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem for any systems designer lies in reducing the risk to an acceptable level and of course, the risk tolerated will vary between applications. When a software application is to be used in a safety-related system, then this must be borne in mind at all stages in the software life cycle. The process of safety specification and assurance throughout the development and operational phases is sometimes called the ‘safety life cycle’.

== Phases in the Safety Life Cycle ==

The first stages of the life cycle involve assessing the potential system hazards and estimating the risk they pose. One such method is [[fault tree analysis]].

This is followed by a safety requirements specification which is concerned with identifying safety-critical functions (functional requirements specification) and the safety integrity level for each of these functions.&lt;ref name="Storey Safety"&gt;{{cite book|last=Storey|first=Neil|title=Safety-Critical Computer Systems|year=1996|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|isbn=0-201-42787-7|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The specification may either describe how the software should behave to minimize the risk or might require that the hazard should never arise.  

A ‘normal’ process model is then followed with particular attention paid to the validation (inspection, testing etc.) of the system.  Part of that validation should be an explicit safety validation activity.

{{advertisement|date=October 2016}}
The '''Simatic S5 PLC''' is an [[automation]] system based on [[Programmable Logic Controller]]s. It was manufactured and sold by [[Siemens AG]]. Such automation systems [[systems control|control]] process equipment and machinery used in manufacturing. This [[Product lining|product line]] is considered obsolete, as the manufacturer has since replaced it with their newer [[Simatic S7 PLC]]. However, the S5 PLC still has a huge installation base in factories around the world. Most automation systems integrators still have the ability to provide support for the platform.

==Hardware==
The S5 line comes in the 90U, 95U, 101U, 100U, 105, 110, 115,115U, 135U, and 155U chassis styles. The higher the number (except for the 101U), the more sophisticated and more expensive the system. Within each chassis style, several [[CPU]]s are available, with varying speed, memory, and capabilities. Some systems provide redundant CPU operation for ultra-high-reliability control, as used in [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] [[manufacturing]], for example.

Each chassis consists of a [[power supply]], and a backplane with slots for the addition of various option boards. Available options include serial and Ethernet communications, digital input and output cards, [[analog signal processing]] boards, counter cards, and other specialized interface and function modules.

==Software==
The S5 product line is usually programmed with a PC based software programming tool called ''Step 5''. Step 5 is used for programming, testing, and commissioning, and for documentation of programs for S5 PLCs.

The original Step5 versions ran on the [[CP/M|CP/M operating system]]. Later versions ran on [[MS-DOS]], and then versions of Windows through [[Windows XP]]. The final version of Step 5 is version 7.2 (upgradable to version 7.23 Hotfix 1 with patches). No further development of this product line has occurred since that time, due to its announced obsolescence.

In addition to Step5, Siemens offered a proprietary [[State logic]] programming package called Graph5. Graph5 is a sequential [[programming language]] intended for use on machines that normally run through a series of discrete steps. It simulates a [[State machine]] on the S5 platform.

Several third-party programming environments have been released for the S5. Most closely emulate Step5, some adding macros and other minor enhancements, others functioning drastically differently from Step5. One allows Step5 programs to be cross-compiled to and from the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language and [[BASIC]].

==Structured programming==
STEP 5 allows the creation of structured or unstructured programming, from simple AND/OR operations up to complex subroutines. A STEP 5 program may, therefore, contain thousands of statements.

To maintain maximum transparency, STEP 5 offers a number of structuring facilities:
* Block technique - A linear operation sequence is divided into sections and packed into individual blocks.
* Segments - Within blocks, fine structuring is possible by programming subtasks in individual segments.
* Comments - Both a complete program as well as individual blocks or segments and individual statements can be directly provided with comments.

==Methods of representation==
STEP 5 programs can be represented in three different ways:
* Statement List (STL) - The program consists of a sequence of mnemonic codes of the commands executed one after another by the PLC.
* [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LAD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols of the [[circuit diagram]]
* [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols to DIN 40700/ DIN 40719.

Absolute or symbolic designations can be used for operands with all three methods of representation.

In LAD and FBD complex functions and function block calls can be entered via [[function key]]s. They are displayed on the screen as graphical symbols.

There are several program editors, from either genuine Siemens, or from other suppliers. Because Siemens no longer support. So, other Supplier start to develop new STEP5 version which can run on Windows XP, or Windows 7.

== Blocks==
Five types of blocks are available:
* Organization blocks (OB) - for managing the control program
* Programming blocks (PB) - contain the control program structured according to functional or process-oriented characteristics
* Sequence blocks (SB) - for programming sequential controls
* Function blocks (FB) - contain frequently occurring and particularly complex program parts
* Data blocks (DB) - for storing data required for processing the control program.

Some S5 PLCs also have block types FX (Extended Function Blocks), and DX(Extended Data Blocks); these are not distinct block types, but rather are another set of available blocks due to the CPU having more memory and addressing space.

==Operations==
STEP 5 differentiates between three types of operations: 
* Basic operations, (e.g. linking, saving, loading &amp; transferring, counting, comparing, arithmetic operations, module operations) - These can be performed in all three representations.
* Supplementary operations and complex functions, (e.g. substitution statements, testing functions, word-by-word logic operations, decrement/increment and jump functions.) - These can only be executed in STL.
* System operations (direct access the [[operating system]]) - These can only be executed in STL.

==Additional functions==
* Saving user-specific project settings
* Symbol editor
* Automatic generation and updating of [[cross-reference]] lists
* Comparison of user programs
* Transferring blocks to [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] memory modules for programmable controllers
* Rewiring inputs, outputs, flags, timers and counters
* Testing and service functions for startup and maintenance

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

===Vocal registration===
{{Main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

===[[Extended vocal technique]]===

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

===Genres of vocal music===
{{Main|Music genre}}
[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

One study found that both singing and listening to choral music reduces the level of stress hormones and increases immune function.&lt;ref name="Kreutz2004"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown.

Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing.

{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Sociobiology''' is a field of [[biology]] that aims to examine and explain [[social behavior]] in terms of [[evolution]]. It draws from disciplines including [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[evolution]], [[zoology]], [[archaeology]], and [[population genetics]]. Within the study of human [[society|societies]], sociobiology is closely allied to [[Darwinian anthropology]], [[human behavioral ecology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]].

Sociobiology investigates social behaviors such as mating patterns, territorial fights, pack hunting, and the hive society of [[social insect]]s. It argues that just as selection pressure led to animals evolving useful ways of interacting with the natural environment, so also it led to the genetic evolution of advantageous social behavior.

While the term "sociobiology" originated at least as early as the 1940s, the concept did not gain major recognition until the publication of [[E. O. Wilson]]'s book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'' in 1975. The new field quickly became the subject of [[scientific controversy|controversy]].  Critics, led by [[Richard Lewontin]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], argued that genes played a role in human behavior, but that traits such as aggressiveness could be explained by social environment rather than by biology. Sociobiologists responded by pointing to the complex relationship between [[nature and nurture]].

==Definition==

E. O. Wilson defined sociobiology as "the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, E. O. |authorlink=E. O. Wilson |year=1978 |title=On Human Nature |page=x |publisher=Harvard |isbn=978-0674016385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociobiology is based on the premise that some behaviors (social and individual) are at least partly inherited and can be affected by [[natural selection]]. It begins with the idea that behaviors have evolved over time, similar to the way that physical traits are thought to have evolved. It predicts that animals will act in ways that have proven to be evolutionarily successful over time. This can, among other things, result in the formation of complex social processes conducive to evolutionary fitness.

The discipline seeks to explain behavior as a product of natural selection. Behavior is therefore seen as an effort to preserve one's genes in the population. Inherent in sociobiological reasoning is the idea that certain genes or gene combinations that influence particular behavioral traits can be [[Heredity|inherited]] from generation to generation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rethinking The Theoretical Foundation of Sociobiology | author1=Wilson, David Sloan Wilson |author2=Wilson, Edward O. |author2link=E. O. Wilson | journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology | year=2007 | volume=82 | issue=4 | pages=327–348 | doi=10.1086/522809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, newly dominant male lions often kill cubs in the pride that they did not sire. This [[adaptive behaviour|behavior is adaptive]] because killing the cubs eliminates [[competition (biology)|competition]] for their own offspring and causes the nursing females to come into heat faster, thus allowing more of his genes to enter into the population. Sociobiologists would view this instinctual cub-killing behavior as being inherited through the genes of successfully reproducing male lions, whereas non-killing behavior may have died out as those lions were less successful in reproducing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Packer |first1=Craig |last2=Pusey |first2=Anne E. |title=Adaptations of Female Lions to Infanticide by Incoming Males |journal=Am. Nat.|date=1983 |volume=121 |issue=5 |pages=716–728 |url=https://www.cbs.umn.edu/sites/cbs.umn.edu/files/public/downloads/Adaptations_of_female_lions_to_infanticide.pdf |doi=10.1086/284097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Plos wilson.jpg|upright|thumb|[[E. O. Wilson]], a central figure in the history of sociobiology, from the publication in 1975 of his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]'']]

The philosopher of biology [[Daniel Dennett]] suggested that the political philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] was the first sociobiologist, arguing that in his 1651 book ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'' Hobbes had explained the origins of morals in human society from an amoral sociobiological perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Darwin's Dangerous Idea |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1995 |pages=453–454 |isbn=978-0140167344}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geneticist of animal behavior [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]] coined the word ''sociobiology'' at a 1948 conference on genetics and social behaviour which called for a conjoint development of field and laboratory studies in animal behavior research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Life of J.P. Scott |url=https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/neuroscience/john-paul-scott/the-life-of-jp-scott.html |publisher=Bowling Green State University |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levallois |first1=Clement |title=The Development of Sociobiology in Relation to Animal Behavior Studies, 1946–1975 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=2018 |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=419–444 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9491-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With John Paul Scott's organizational efforts, a  "Section of Animal Behavior and Sociobiology" of the ESA was created in 1956, which became a Division of Animal Behavior of the American Society of Zoology in 1958. In 1956, [[E. O. Wilson]] came in contact this emerging sociobiology through his PhD student Stuart A. Altmann, who had been in close relation with the participants to the 1948 conference. Altmann developed his own brand of sociobiology to study the social behavior of rhesus macaques, using statistics, and was hired as a "sociobiologist" at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in 1965.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Wilson's sociobiology is different from [[John Paul Scott (geneticist)|John Paul Scott]]'s or Altmann's, insofar as he drew on mathematical models of social behavior centered on the maximisation of the genetic fitness by [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Robert Trivers]], [[John Maynard Smith]], and [[George R. Price]]. The three sociobiologies by Scott, Altmann and Wilson have in common to place naturalist studies at the core of the research on animal social behavior and by drawing alliances with emerging research methodologies, at a time when "biology in the field" was threatened to be made old-fashioned by "modern" practices of science (laboratory studies, mathematical biology, molecular biology).&lt;ref name=Dobzhansky1966&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dobzhansky |first1=Theodosius |title=Are Naturalists Old-Fashioned? |journal=The American Naturalist |date=September 1966 |volume=100 |issue=915 |pages=541–550 |doi=10.1086/282448}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a specialist term, "sociobiology" became widely known in 1975 when Wilson published his book ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis'', which sparked an intense controversy. Since then "sociobiology" has largely been equated with Wilson's vision. The book pioneered and popularized the attempt to explain the evolutionary mechanics behind social behaviors such as [[altruism]], [[aggression]], and nurturance, primarily in ants (Wilson's own research specialty) and other [[Hymenoptera]], but also in other animals. However, the influence of evolution on behavior has been of interest to biologists and philosophers since soon after the discovery of evolution itself. [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', written in the early 1890s, is a popular example. The final chapter of the book is devoted to sociobiological explanations of human behavior, and Wilson later wrote a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning book, ''[[On Human Nature]]'', that addressed human behavior specifically.&lt;ref name="Levallois 2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Walsh, Bryan | url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/08/30/all-time-100-best-nonfiction-books/slide/on-human-nature-by-edward-o-wilson/ | title=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books |date=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward H. Hagen writes in ''The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology'' that sociobiology is, despite the public controversy regarding the applications to humans, "one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century." "Sociobiology is now part of the core research and curriculum of virtually all biology departments, and it is a foundation of the work of almost all field biologists" Sociobiological research on nonhuman organisms has increased dramatically and continuously in the world's top scientific journals such as ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The more general term [[behavioral ecology]] is commonly substituted for the term sociobiology in order to avoid the public controversy.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Psychology 2005"&gt;The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, edited by David M. Buss, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2005. Chapter 5 by Edward H. Hagen &lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Sociobiologists maintain that [[Human nature|human behavior]], as well as nonhuman animal behavior, can be partly explained as the outcome of natural selection. They contend that in order to fully understand behavior, it must be analyzed in terms of evolutionary considerations.

[[Natural selection]] is fundamental to evolutionary theory. Variants of hereditary traits which increase an organism's ability to survive and reproduce will be more greatly represented in subsequent generations, i.e., they will be "selected for". Thus, inherited behavioral mechanisms that allowed an [[organism]] a greater chance of surviving and/or reproducing in the past are more likely to survive in present organisms. That inherited adaptive behaviors are present in nonhuman [[Species|animal species]] has been multiply demonstrated by biologists, and it has become a foundation of [[evolutionary biology]]. However, there is continued resistance by some researchers over the application of evolutionary models to humans, particularly from within the social sciences, where culture has long been assumed to be the predominant driver of behavior.

[[File:Nikolaas Tinbergen 1978.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Nikolaas Tinbergen]], whose work influenced sociobiology]]

Sociobiology is based upon two fundamental premises:
* Certain behavioral traits are inherited,
* Inherited behavioral traits have been honed by natural selection. Therefore, these traits were probably "adaptive" in the environment in which the species evolved.

Sociobiology uses [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]]'s [[Tinbergen's four questions|four categories of questions]] and explanations of animal behavior. Two categories are at the species level; two, at the individual level. The species-level categories (often called "ultimate explanations") are
* the function (i.e., [[adaptation]]) that a behavior serves and
* the evolutionary process (i.e., [[phylogeny]]) that resulted in this functionality.
The individual-level categories (often called "proximate explanations") are
* the development of the individual (i.e., [[ontogeny]]) and
* the proximate mechanism (e.g., [[brain anatomy]] and [[hormone]]s).

Sociobiologists are interested in how behavior can be explained logically as a result of selective pressures in the history of a species. Thus, they are often interested in [[instinct]]ive, or [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] behavior, and in explaining the similarities, rather than the differences, between cultures. For example, mothers within many species of [[mammals]] – including humans – are very protective of their [[offspring]]. Sociobiologists reason that this protective behavior likely evolved over time because it helped the offspring of the individuals which had the characteristic to survive. This parental protection would increase in frequency in the population. The social behavior is believed to have evolved in a fashion similar to other types of nonbehavioral [[adaptation]]s, such as a coat of fur, or the sense of smell.

Individual genetic advantage fails to explain certain social behaviors as a result of gene-centred selection. E.O. Wilson argued that evolution may also act upon [[social group|groups]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 1975. Chapter 5. "Group Selection and Altruism"&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms responsible for [[group selection]] employ [[paradigms]] and population statistics borrowed from [[evolutionary game theory]]. Altruism is defined as "a concern for the welfare of others". If altruism is genetically determined, then altruistic individuals must reproduce their own altruistic genetic traits for altruism to survive, but when altruists lavish their resources on non-altruists at the expense of their own kind, the altruists tend to die out and the others tend to increase. An extreme example is a soldier losing his life trying to help a fellow soldier. This example raises the question of how altruistic genes can be passed on if this soldier dies without having any children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tessman |first=Irwin |title=Human altruism as a courtship display |journal=Forum |year=1995 |pages=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within sociobiology, a social behavior is first explained as a sociobiological [[hypothesis]] by finding an [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] that matches the observed behavior. Stability of a strategy can be difficult to prove, but usually, it will predict gene frequencies. The hypothesis can be supported by establishing a correlation between the gene frequencies predicted by the strategy, and those expressed in a population.

Altruism between [[social insect]]s and littermates has been explained in such a way. Altruistic behavior, behavior that increases the reproductive fitness of others at the apparent expense of the altruist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Costa-Leonarda |first=Ana Maria |title=Termite Communication during different behavioral activities |journal=In: Witzany G (ed). Biocommunication of Animals |year=2014 |pages=161–190}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some animals has been correlated to the degree of [[genome]] shared between altruistic individuals. A quantitative description of [[infanticide]] by male harem-mating animals when the [[alpha male]] is displaced as well as [[rodent]] female infanticide and fetal resorption are active areas of study. In general, females with more bearing opportunities may value offspring less, and may also arrange bearing opportunities to maximize the [[food]] and protection from mates.

An important concept in sociobiology is that temperament traits exist in an [[ecological]] balance. Just as an expansion of a [[sheep]] population might encourage the expansion of a [[wolf]] population, an expansion of altruistic traits within a gene pool may also encourage increasing numbers of individuals with dependent traits.

Studies of human behavior genetics have generally found behavioral traits such as creativity, extroversion, aggressiveness, and [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] have high [[heritability]]. The researchers who carry out those studies are careful to point out that heritability does not constrain the influence that environmental or cultural factors may have on those traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Wendy |last2=Turkheimer |first2=E. |last3=Gottesman |first3=Irving |last4=Bouchard |first4=Thomas |year=2009 |title=Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=217–220 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Johnson%20%282009%29.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x |pmc=2899491 |pmid=20625474 |quote=Moreover, even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability. For example, height is on the order of 90% heritable, yet North and South Koreans, who come from the same genetic background, presently differ in average height by a full 6 inches (Pak, 2004; Schwekendiek, 2008). |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turkheimer |first=Eric |date=April 2008 |title=A Better Way to Use Twins for Developmental Research |journal=LIFE Newsletter |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–5 |url=http://people.virginia.edu/~ent3c/papers2/Articles%20for%20Online%20CV/Turkheimer%20%282008%29.pdf |accessdate=29 October 2010 |quote=But back to the question: What does heritability mean? Almost everyone who has ever thought about heritability has reached a commonsense intuition about it: One way or another, heritability has to be some kind of index of how genetic a trait is. That intuition explains why so many thousands of heritability coefficients have been calculated over the years. . . . Unfortunately, that fundamental intuition is wrong. Heritability isn't an index of how genetic a trait is. A great deal of time has been wasted in the effort of measuring the heritability of traits in the false expectation that somehow the genetic nature of psychological phenomena would be revealed. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crime|Criminality]] is actively under study, but extremely controversial. There are arguments that in some environments criminal behavior might be adaptive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html The Sociobiology Of Sociopathy: An Integrated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |date=2002-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelist [[Elias Canetti]] also has noted applications of sociobiological theory to cultural practices such as slavery and autocracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elias Canetti]], ''[[Crowds and Power]]''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1981, p. 444-445.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for premise==
Genetic mouse mutants illustrate the power that genes exert on behaviour. For example, the [[transcription factor]] FEV (aka Pet1), through its role in maintaining the [[serotonergic system]] in the brain, is required for normal [[aggression|aggressive]] and [[anxiety]]-like behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks TJ, Fyodorov DV, Wegman LJ, Lelutiu NB, Pehek EA, Yamamoto B, Silver J, Weeber EJ, Sweatt JD, Deneris ES. Pet-1 ETS gene plays a critical role in 5-HT neuron development and is required for normal anxiety-like and aggressive behaviour]. Neuron. 2003 Jan 23;37(2):233-47&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when FEV is genetically deleted from the mouse genome, male mice will instantly attack other males, whereas their wild-type counterparts take significantly longer to initiate violent behaviour. In addition, FEV has been shown to be required for correct maternal behaviour in mice, such that offspring of mothers without the FEV factor do not survive unless cross-fostered to other wild-type female mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerch-Haner | first1 = JK | last2 = Frierson | first2 = D | last3 = Crawford | first3 = LK | last4 = Beck | first4 = SG | last5 = Deneris | first5 = ES | date = Sep 2008 | title = Serotonergic transcriptional programming determines maternal behavior and offspring survival | url = | journal = Nat Neurosci | volume = 11 | issue = 9| pages = 1001–3 | doi=10.1038/nn.2176| pmid = 19160496 | pmc = 2679641 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A genetic basis for instinctive behavioural traits among non-human species, such as in the above example, is commonly accepted among many biologists; however, attempting to use a genetic basis to explain complex behaviours in human societies has remained extremely controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fisher |first1=Helen |title='Wilson,' They Said, 'Your All Wet!' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/wilson-naturalist.html |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=21 July 2015 |date=16 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |title=Sociobiology: the art of storytelling |journal=New Scientist |date=16 November 1978 |volume=80 |issue=1129 |pages=530–533|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tRj7EyRFVqYC&amp;pg=PA530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

[[Steven Pinker]] argues that critics have been overly swayed by politics and a fear of [[biological determinism]],{{efn|Biological determinism was a right wing philosophy underlying the [[social Darwinism|social Darwinian]] and [[Eugenics#History|eugenics movements]] of the early 20th century, and [[History of the race and intelligence controversy|controversies in the history of intelligence testing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Allen |first1=Garland E. |title=The Roots of Biological Determinism: review of The Mismeasure of Man by Stephen Jay Gould |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1984 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=141–145 |jstor=4330882 |doi=10.1007/bf00397505}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} accusing among others [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] of being "radical scientists", whose stance on human nature is influenced by politics rather than science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pinker, Steven | authorlink=Steven Pinker |title=The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2002 |page=149 |isbn=978-0-14-200334-3 |quote=A surprising number of intellectuals, particularly on the left, do deny that there is such a thing as inborn talent, especially intelligence.

Gould grouped sociobiology with [[eugenics]], criticizing both in his book ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Gould, Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |year=1996 |title=The Mismeasure of Man |page=Introduction to the Revised Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noam Chomsky]] has expressed views on sociobiology on several occasions. During a 1976 meeting of the [[Sociobiology Study Group]], as reported by [[Ullica Segerstråle]], Chomsky argued for the importance of a sociobiologically informed notion of human nature.{{sfn|Segerstråle|2000|p=205}} Chomsky argued that human beings are biological organisms and ought to be studied as such, with his criticism of the "[[blank slate]]" doctrine in the social sciences (which would inspire a great deal of Steven Pinker's and others' work in evolutionary psychology), in his 1975 ''Reflections on Language''.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1975), ''Reflections on Language'':10. New York: Pantheon Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky further hinted at the possible reconciliation of his anarchist political views and sociobiology in a discussion of [[Peter Kropotkin]]'s ''[[Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution]]'', which focused more on altruism than aggression, suggesting that anarchist societies were feasible because of an innate human tendency to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (1995). [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199505--.htm#TXT2.23 "Rollback, Part II."] ''Z Magazine'' 8 (Feb.): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson has claimed that he had never meant to imply what ''ought'' to be, only what ''is'' the case. However, some critics have argued that the language of sociobiology readily slips from "is" to "ought",&lt;ref name=lrk84/&gt; an instance of the [[naturalistic fallacy]]. Pinker has argued that opposition to stances considered anti-social, such as [[ethnic nepotism]], is based on [[morality|moral]] assumptions, meaning that such opposition is not [[falsifiable]] by scientific advances.&lt;ref name=Pinker2002&gt;Pinker, Steven (2002). ''The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature''. New York: Viking. p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this debate, and others related to it, are covered in detail by {{harvtxt|Cronin|1993}}, {{harvtxt|Segerstråle|2000}}, and {{harvtxt|Alcock|2001}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2986">'''Squeeze job''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mms.gov/glossary/sq-sy.htm | publisher=[[Minerals Management Service]] | title=Offshore Minerals Management Glossary SQ-SY | accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''squeeze cementing''' is a term often used in the [[oilfield]] to describe the process of injecting [[cement]] [[slurry]] into a zone, generally for pressure-isolation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=squeeze | publisher=[[Schlumberger]] | title=Oilfield Glossary | accessdate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Background==
The term probably originated from the concept that enough water is "squeezed" out of the slurry to render it unflowable, so the portion that has actually entered the zone will stay in place when the squeeze pressure is removed.  After surface indications (e.g., pressure reaching a predetermined maximum) that a squeeze has been attained, any still-pumpable cement slurry remaining in the [[drill pipe]] or tubing ideally can be reverse circulated out before it sets.

Usually the zone to be squeezed is isolated from above with a packer (and possibly from below with a bridge plug), but sometimes the squeezing pressure is applied to the entire [[Casing (borehole)|casing]] string in what is known as a '''bradenhead squeeze''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mms.gov/glossary/bo-by.htm | publisher=[[Minerals Management Service]] | title=Offshore Minerals Management Glossary BO-BY | accessdate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (named for an old manufacturer of [[casing head]]s).

Even if a drilling rig is on location, pumping operations usually are done by a service company's cementing unit that can easily mix small batches of cement slurry, measure displacement volume accurately to spot the slurry on bottom, then pump at very low rates and high pressures during the squeeze itself, and finally measure volumes accurately again when reversing out any excess slurry.  A '''squeeze manifold''' is a compact arrangement of valves and pressure gauges that allows monitoring of the drill pipe and casing pressures throughout the job, and facilitates quick switching of the pumping pressure to either side while the fluid returning from the other side of well is directed to the mud pit or a disposal pit or tank.

The generic term "squeeze" also can apply to injection of generally small volumes of other liquids (e.g., treating fluids) into a zone under pressure.  '''Bullhead squeeze''' (or just plain [[bullheading]]) refers to pumping kill-weight [[Drilling mud|mud]] down the casing beneath closed [[blowout preventer]]s in a [[Blowout (well drilling)|kick-control]] situation when it isn't feasible to circulate in such from bottom.

'''''Tempo giusto''''' ({{IPA-it|ˈtɛmpo ˈd͡ʒusto}}) is a musical term that means “in exact time”, often directing a return to strict time following a period of [[tempo rubato|rubato]]. or to play in “strict time” or “suitable time”.

==General==
The literal meaning of the term is 'in exact time'. Its most common meaning is to indicate a return to the main tempo after a temporary change (e.g. a [[rallentando]]).&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. 'Tempo giusto' in Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. www.oxfordmusiconline.com. Accessed 20 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and 18th centuries ([[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Classical period (music)|early Classical]]), ''tempo giusto'' referred to the idea that each [[Metre (music)|meter]] has its own 'ideal' tempo. The larger the beat value of the meter, the slower the tempo. Therefore, meters with beat values of a minim/half note (e.g. {{music|time|2|2}}, {{music|time|3|2}}) should be performed with a slow tempo; those with quaver/eighth note beats (e.g. {{music|time|3|8}}) are fast; while those with crotchet/quarter note beats (e.g. {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|4|4}}) are performed at a moderate or middling tempo.

The composer and music theorist [[Johann Kirnberger]] (1776) refined this idea by instructing the performer to consider the following details in combination when determining the best performance tempo of a piece: the tempo giusto of the meter, the tempo term (''[[Allegro (music)|Allegro]]'', ''[[Adagio (music)|Adagio]]'', etc., if there is one, at the start of the piece), the particular rhythms in the piece (taking account of the longest and shortest notes), the 'character' of the piece, and the piece's genre (whether it was a [[minuet]], [[sarabande]], [[gigue]], etc.). In this way, an experienced musician could rely on his/her (informed) intuition to find the 'right' tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Kirnberger, Johann Philipp. 1771–76. Die Kunst des reinen Satzes in der Musik. 2 vols. Berlin: Christian Friedrich Boß. Reprint vol. 1 Berlin und Königsberg: G. J. Decker und G. L. Hartung, 1774. Trans. David Beach and Jurgen Thym. 1982. The Art of Strict Musical Composition.  New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, a composer will mark a piece ''tempo giusto'' to request the performer to use his/her experience in this way: that is, to intuit the correct tempo from the structure and nature of the piece itself.&lt;ref&gt;David Fallows. 'Tempo giusto' in Grove Music Online. Oxford University Press. www.oxfordmusiconline.com. Accessed 20 Feb 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-18th century, the notion of each meter having an 'ideal tempo' fell out of fashion, as composers started preferring to indicate tempo with tempo terms and (later, in the nineteenth century) with [[Metronome marking|metronome markings]].

==Life Movement==

Although tempo giusto is only sparsely sprinkled through musical time, it has recently reemerged.  The term has given rise to a whole life movement, which advises the modern world to stop plowing through life at breakneck speed, and to start living instead at the “right tempo." Man is told to live in accordance with his own inner tempo.&lt;ref&gt;Honoré, Carl. ''In Praise of Slowness: Challenging the Cult of Speed.'' San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic director of the [[Madison Symphony Orchestra]], Maestro [[John DeMain]], has said, “[n]ow that I think about it, the idea of tempo giusto describes just about everything I do or aspire to."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jess. "John DeMain: In Search of Tempo Giusto." ''Madison Magazine, August 2001.'' http://www.madisonmusicreviews.org/doc/p_200108_demain.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tomb of Ferdowsi''' ({{lang-fa|آرامگاه فردوسی}}) is a tomb complex composed of a white marble base, and a decorative edifice erected in honor of the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Ferdowsi]] located in [[Tus, Iran]], in [[Razavi Khorasan province]]. It was built in the early 1930s,&lt;ref name=r&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ferdowsi-iii |title=Ferdowsi, Abul-qasem. Mausoleum|last=A.

The construction of the mausoleum as well as its aesthetic design is a reflection of the cultural, and geo-political status of [[Iran]] at the time.

==Background==
[[Ferdowsi]], the influential [[Persian language|Persian]] poet and author of the Persian epic, [[Shahnameh]] died in 1020{{nbsp}}AD in the [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], [[Iran]] (Persia), in the same city in which he was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Poetics and Politics of Iran's National Epic, the Shahnameh |author=Mahmoud Omidsalar|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|date=Nov 2011|pages=52–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQrIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+died+at&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpEzU5aiBYfx0gG694GQDw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20died%20at&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For all his literary contribution, Ferdowsi was not recognized during his life. It was only after his death that his poems won him admiration. For hundreds of years, his resting place was nothing more than a minor dome-shrine erected by a [[Ghaznavid]] ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], without any permanent edifice in place in the garden of his house where Ferdowsi's daughter had originally buried him.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; In the beginning years of the 20th{{nbsp}}century [[Iran]] started to realize his critical role in defining the [[National symbols of Iran|identity of Iran]].&lt;ref name=s2&gt;{{cite book|title=A Persian Odyssey: Iran Revisited|author=Rami Yelda|publisher=AuthorHouse|year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Kbj21wrwwEC&amp;pg=PT168&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vZUzU6_QHKixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdosi Tomb2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|One façade of the poet's mausoleum]]
It was not until 1934 that the Iranian government, then under the control of [[Reza Shah]], first king of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]], recognized the cultural and literary value of Ferdowsi and erected a permanent tomb in his honor.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; A [[Ferdowsi Millennial Celebration|millennial celebration]] was also held for the poet, to which were invited scholars from several countries, including [[Soviet Tajikistan]], [[India]], [[Armenia]], and [[Europe]] ([[Nazi Germany|Germany]], [[France]], [[U.K.|England]]). Funds were collected, mainly donations from [[Parsi]] scholars, to enable the building of a [[statue]] for the poet at his tomb site.{{clarification needed|date=June 2015}} The Pahlavi family used Ferdowsi to advance Iran's cultural prestige, but in doing so nearly cost Ferdowsi his tomb since, after the [[Islamic revolution]], frustrations with the [[Shah of Iran]] nearly led to destruction of the tomb by the revolutionaries.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Drinking Arak Off a [cleric]'s Beard: A Journey Through the Inside-Out Worlds of Iran and Afghanistan|author=Nicholas Jubber|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2010|pages=61–2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DblrRc7mCmsC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=islamic+revolution+ferdowsi+tomb&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=H6UzU4jTDJOqsQSIy4CwCQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20revolution%20ferdowsi%20tomb&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Panorama of Ferdowsi's tomb, [[Tus, Iran]]]]
The tomb was originally designed by the Iranian [[architect]], [[Haj Hossein Lurzadeh]] who aside from Ferdowsi's tomb also created some 842 [[mosque]]s, as well as the private palace of Ramsar, part of the decoration of the Marmar palace, the Imam Hossein Mosque in [[Tehran]], the Motahari Mosque, and various parts of the Hazrat-i-Seyyed-o-Shouhada [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine]] in [[Karbala]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=s4&gt;{{cite book|title=The Book of Iran: The History of Iranian Art|author=Habibollah Ayatollahi|publisher=Alhoda UK|year=2003|pages=291–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Al0jpyRDGe8C&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=Haj+Hossein+Lurzadeh+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AqgzU6qeBubUsAS0mYCYBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Haj%20Hossein%20Lurzadeh%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The present design of the structure is credited mainly to [[Karim Taherzadeh]], who replaced the old dome-shaped design by Lurzadeh with a modern cubical design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nationalizing Iran: culture, power, and the state, 1870–1940|author=Afshin Marashi|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2011|pages=126–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=488CSG25AzcC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=tomb+of+ferdowsi+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Hr40U4e1AvK-sQSbwIKwBA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20ferdowsi%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdowsi's tomb, which resembles the [[tomb of Cyrus the Great]], is built in style of [[Achaemenid architecture]]. There is a clear link between this choice of architectural style and the politics of Iran at the time. Four years before Reza Shah came to power in 1922, a group of secular Iranian reformists had created the "[[Society for the National Heritage of Iran|Society for National Heritage]]" (SNH, or in Persian ''anjoman-e asar-e meli'').&lt;ref name=s3&gt;{{cite book|title=Culture and Cultural Politics Under Reza Shah: The Pahlavi State, New Bourgeoisie and the Creation of a Modern Society in Iran|author=Bianca Devos, Christoph Werner|publisher=Routledge|date=Aug 22, 2013|pages=101–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SWAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=architectural+element+of+tomb+of+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jqszU72vJqixsQTfmIGgCA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=architectural%20element%20of%20tomb%20of%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composed mostly of western-educated, pro-reform intellectuals such as [[Abdolhossein Teymourtash]], [[Hassan Pirnia]], [[Mostowfi ol-Mamalek]], [[Mohammad Ali Foroughi]], Firuz Mirza Firus Nosrat al-Dowleh, and [[Keikhosrow Shahrokh]], the SNH was critical in obtaining the funds from the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Keikhosrow Shahrokh, Iran's [[Zoroastrian]] representative to the Iranian parliament, was particularly active in reviving Achaemenid and [[Sassanid architecture]] in Iran in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=s3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Architectural Conservation|author=Jukka Jokilehto|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|section=9.1.5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UandAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT505&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+tomb+architecture&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ar4zU8P-MdHMsQSyx4GoBA&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20tomb%20architecture&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural Details==

The basic structure of the tomb is rectangular with a large garden surrounding the structure and interacting with the structure in the [[Persian gardens|Persian style of gardening]] known as [[Charbagh|Char-bagh]] (or Chaharbagh translating to ''four gardens'' in Persian). In the center of the cross created by the legs of the garden surrounding it, is an edifice made of primarily white [[marble]]. The edifice can be divided into a "wide chamber" that lies at the base and a cubical erection on top, with four pillars surrounding it and scenes from the epic of Shahnameh and text ornating it. The body of the poet is actually interred in the center of the rectangular wide chamber underneath the overlying four [[Column|pillars]] cube.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; There are twelve (12) steps leading from the lowest point of the wide chamber all the way to the level of the cube. The wide base has a total height of 16 m. The edifice has equal dimensions of 30 m on each side.

The following are schematic diagrams of the aerial view of the tomb's wide base and edifice section and their topography:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A unique feature of the design of Ferdowsi's tomb has been its resemblance to that of Cyrus the Great in [[Pasargadae]]. Cyrus's tomb also has a rectangular structure seating atop a rectangular, gradually elevating base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis restored: an essay on ancient Assyrian and Persian architecture, Volume 5|author=James Fergusson|publisher=J. Murray|year=1851|pages=214–216 &amp; 206–209 (Zoroaster Cube: pp. 206) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Us0TAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=tomb+of+cyrus+dimensions&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RVo7TZf-HYGBlAeEioXrBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tomb%20of%20cyrus%20dimensions&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resemblance is intentional as the designer of this edifice intended to revoke the original Achaemenid style of architecture. In fact every other facet of the edifice has a Zoroastrian symbol known as [[Faravahar]]. This is not coincidental. There are multiple applications of this in the [[Achaemenid architecture]] mainly in [[Persepolis]] in [[Fars province]] today. The "Society for National Heritage of Iran" (SNH) heavily relied on the use of Faravahar as this was the symbolic representation of [[ancient Iran]] since Achaemenid times.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;&lt;ref name=s3/&gt; Many construction in the 1930s, including the then [[National Bank of Iran]] use Faravahar which is not unexpected considering that the same architect that created Ferdowsi's tomb also created the National Bank of Iran.&lt;ref name=s4/&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

A closer look at the edifice points out that there are four columns each at the corner of the rectangular structure with two half-buried columns that protrude as deep [[friezes]] on each facet of the structure. Each frieze column has a box, followed by a two horn bull sign which is very much similar if not the exact imitation of the Persepolis column design. The columns are ornated with [[Fluting (architecture)|fluting]] 3/4 of the way down with the last portion spared. The overall effect is intended to create a grand gesture. The columns are as high as the edifice which is 30 meters high. (the edifice is also 30 m wide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.where-is-iran.com/Historical-Monument-In-Iran/Tombs-Khorassan-Razavi-Iran.aspx |title=Ferdowsi Tomb, Toos-Khorasan-Iran |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date= |website= Where is Iran |publisher= |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marble decorations are used to ornate the siding and the floor of the "wide base" structure as well the wall. Persian flower designs (concentric flower designs composed of a flower with seven (7) ovaloid pellets surrounding a central circle), and hexagonal marble designs are commonly used in the structure.

==Historical Context==
[[File:Rpferdosi.jpg|thumb|right|Reza Shah Pahlavi officially opening the mausoleum of Ferdowsi for public visiting upon conclusion of Ferdowi Millenary conference]]
[[Iran]]'s history has been closely tied to geopolitical changes that has taken place since the establishment of the [[Achaemenid empire]] in [[Persis]] all the way to the modern day Iran. Two major events are of critical importance in Iran's history specially its literary history as it pertained to Ferdowsi: [[Arab conquest of Persia]] and the [[Mongolia]]n invasion of Persia.

Ferdowsi lived his life as a poor man constantly moving from court to court, and eventually died a poor widower, having lost his only son.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], at one point was an opulent city in the [[greater Khorasan]] region but it was repeatedly sacked by [[Oguz Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Uzbeks]] from the steppe.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; This and the growing influence of [[Mashad]] as a political and religious center within Khorasan shaped Ferdowsi's experience and in many way influenced his writing as Tus lost prestige. Additionally, Arabic had found prestige in lands conquered by the Arabs and there was threat of [[Middle Persian]] being lost in favor of [[Arabic]]. Ferdowsi's role is critical in that using the least number of loan-words he transferred the [[Middle Persian]] (Pahlavi) into Modern [[Persian language|Persian]] (Farsi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Iran: Empire of the Mind|first=Michael |last=Axworthy|authorlink=Michael Axworthy|publisher=Basic Books|pages=66–8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wGl_Gu6BwxYC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+arabic+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rAY0U9_5Iu_JsQT-p4GoBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20arabic%20language&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the time frame preceding the construction of the mausoleum, nationalistic feelings in Iran were high.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite book|title=The Soul of Iran: A Nation's Struggle for Freedom|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2010|pages=40–50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za59PAytkFwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=reza+shah+ferdowsi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pBQ0U9LJHNHmsAST3ILoCQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=reza%20shah%20ferdowsi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a renewed sense of national identity partly due to the pressures felt by foreign powers including the constant Anglo-Persian political struggle specially over the issues of oil, and partly due to inability of the [[Qajar]] dynasty from protecting Iranian lands in central Asia to the Russians and in the east to the British. [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] (AIOC) was an important source of contention for Iranians. One journalist studying during this time period reflects his and his colleagues personal experience:

{{quote|We supported Reza Shah, and we wanted to support his effort to create a modern nation state, to lift us from our backwardness. At this time we talked about Pan-Iraniasm, or reuniting Afghanistan with Iran. We also talked of nationalism. Ferdowsi became very popular partly because of Reza Shah's support for him, and also partly because of the nationalistic impulses the shahnameh inspired.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;}}

The architecture of Ferdowsi's tomb is also influenced by poet's own personal life, reflecting a constant struggle between the poor poet and the lazy king, and adversity and hope. The Society for National Heritage in 1930s drawing on poet's attempt to revitalize the Persian language, also attempted to revitalize Persian culture and Iranian identity through architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Power of Iranian Narratives: A Thousand Years of Healing|author=Laleh Shahideh|publisher=University Press of America|year=2004|pages=125–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHjArCjZ27sC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=Ferdowsi+Iranian+identity&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=-Qw0U8K4CZDjsATc4oGgBw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ferdowsi%20Iranian%20identity&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was in many ways taken literary with Persian poems from Shahnameh etched into the white marble facets of the edifice of the poet's mausoleum.

After the Iranian revolution, both tomb of Ferdowsi and even mausoleum of Cyrus the Great survived the initial chaos. One of the most dangerous threats to the structure was that it would be equated with the late Pahlavi dynasty by the new regime and destroyed. It however was not and was instead embraced by the new local government since Ferdowsi was a devout Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Persian Pilgrimages: Journeys Across Iran|author=Afshin Molavi|publisher=W.

==Interior Design==

[[File:Ferdowsi tomb3.jpg|thumb|right|The tomb of Ferdowsi with the accompanying text. To see the translation, see the text on the left.]]
Ferdowsi's Shahnameh inspires tales of heroic act by [[protagonist]]s fighting against their antagonists. In that sense it is a [[national epic]] that encompasses not only fictional and literary figures but also incorporates parts of the history of pre-Islamic Iran. This has led to the interior of the edifice of Ferdowsi to reflect the same heroic scenes.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; The chief architect responsible for the design of the interior of the tomb of Ferdowsi is [[Feraydoon Sadeghi]] who created deep frieze scenes using three dimensional statues each depicting a scene from Shahnameh. [[Rostam]], the hero of the book of Shahnameh is the focus of the majority of the scenes inside of the edifice. As Shahnameh is essentially a text, artistic recreation of its heroic scenes are multiple.&lt;ref name=r/&gt; Centered inside the edifice surrounding by the frieze scenes and other artistic endeavors is the [[tomb stone]] of the poet. Etched in the tomb stone in Farsi (Persian) is the description of Ferdowsi's contribution to the Persian-speakers and at the end it ends by denoting the poet's date of birth, date of death, and the date at which the mausoleum was built.

The [[Persian language|Persian]] content of the tomb is as follows:

&lt;blockquote lang="fa" style="direction: rtl; unicode-bidi: embed;"&gt;بنام خداوند جان و خرد. این مکان فرخنده آرامگاه استاد گویندگان فارسی‌زبان و سراینده داستان‌های ملی ایران، حکیم ابوالقاسم فردوسی طوسی است که سخنان او زنده‌کننده کشور ایران و در دل مردم این سرزمین جاودان است&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[English language|English]] translation is roughly as follows:

{{quote|In the name of the God who created life. This place is the resting place of he (Hakim Abul-qasem Ferdowsi Tusi) who has advanced the art of language among Persian speakers, and the holder of the national epic of Iran and its national stories. His words have given a new life to Iran, and he has a place in the hearts of its people.}}

Today Ferdowsi's tomb is one of the most photographed in Iran.&lt;ref name=s2/&gt; Millions of visitors from various [[provinces of Iran]] come to see the tomb every year. Foreign dignitaries, tourists, and other Persian-Speaking civilians from [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[Middle East]] also visit the site.

The '''Treaty of Tolentino''' was a peace treaty between [[Revolutionary France]] and the [[Papal States]], signed on 19 February 1797 and imposing terms of surrender on the Papal side. The signatories for France were the [[French Directory]]'s Ambassador to the Holy See, François Cacault, and the rising General [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and opposite them four representatives of [[Pope Pius VI|Pius VI]]'s [[Curia]]. 
 
It was part of the events following the invasion of [[Italy]] in the early stages of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Having defeated the Austrians at the [[Siege of Mantua (1796–1797)|Battle of Mantua]], at the Arcola Bridge and in the [[Battle of Rivoli]], Napoleon had no more enemies in northern Italy and was able to devote himself to the Papal States. Following nine months of negotiations between France and the Papal States, in February 1797 9,000 French soldiers invaded the Papal [[Romagna]] Region, leaving the Pope no choice but to accept the French terms.

==Terms==

The treaty added 15 million [[French livre|livre]] to the indemnity of 21 millions extracted from the Papal States at the [[Armistice of Bologna|preceding armistice signed at Bologna]]—36 million in all. 

In addition, the papal city of [[Avignon]] and its territory, the [[Comtat Venaissin]], which had been occupied by French forces at an early stage of the Revolution, were formally ceded to France - putting a definite end to half a millennium of Papal rule. 

The [[Romagna]] region - as noted, already invaded by the French - was also ceded by the Papal States and included in the newly created [[Cisalpine Republic]]. 

The treaty also formalized the confiscation of artistic treasures from the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Over a hundred paintings and other works of art were to go to the [[Louvre]]  in [[Paris]]. The French commissioners reserved the right to enter any building, public, religious or private, to make their choice and assessment of what was to be taken to France. This part of the treaty was extended to apply to all of Italy in 1798 by treaties with other Italian states. 

Other conditions imposed on the Papal States included a compensation to the family of the journalist [[Hugh de Basseville]], killed by a crowd in Rome for having allegedly "insulted the Pope", and giving consent to the stationing of French troops in [[Ancona]] until the end of the war.

==Criticism==

Of the French terms, the confiscation of artistic works - or, as many considered it, theft and plunder - came under criticism and its legitimacy questioned. Among the fiercest opponents was [[Quatremère de Quincy]] who in 1796 wrote a pamphlet, ''Letters in Miranda'', in which he affirmed the strong relationship between a work of art and  the place in which it was intended, asserting that "eradicating the context in which the work was created irreparably impairs its legibility". 

Of the confiscated works of art, a bronze statue by [[Giunio Bruto]] remains in Paris. However, most of the works were restored after Napoleon's fall, and Bruto's main works are now located in Vatican Gardens in Rome.

The '''Vegetable Production System''' ('''Veggie''') is a plant growth system developed and used by [[NASA]] in outer space environments. The purpose of Veggie is to provide a self-sufficient and sustainable food source for astronauts as well as a means of recreation and relaxation through therapeutic gardening.&lt;ref name=Massa&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160006558.pdf |title=Growth Chambers on the International Space Station for Large Plants |conference=8th International Symposium on Light in Horticulture. 22–26 May 2016.

Veggie is part of an overarching project concerning research of growing crops in zero gravity. Among the goals of this project are to learn about how plants grow in a weightless environment and to learn about how plants can efficiently be grown for crew use in space.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt; Veggie was designed to be low-maintenance, using low power and having a low launch mass. Thus, Veggie provides a minorly regulated environment with minimal control over the atmosphere and temperature of the module. The successor to the Veggie project is the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH), components of which will be delivered to the [[International Space Station]] during the [[Cygnus CRS OA-7]] and [[SpaceX CRS-11]] missions in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-plant-habitat-will-increase-harvest-on-international-space-station |title=New Plant Habitat Will Increase Harvest on International Space Station |publisher=NASA |first=Linda |last=Herridge |date=2 March 2017 |accessdate=15 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in 2018 the Veggie-3 experiment was tested with plant pillows and root mats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spaceref.com/international-space-station/nasa-space-station-on-orbit-status-6-february-2018---celebrating-10-years-of-esas-columbus-module.html|title=NASA Space Station On-Orbit Status 6 February 2018 - Celebrating 10 Years of ESA's Columbus Module - SpaceRef|website=spaceref.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals is to grow food for crew consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spaceref.com/international-space-station/nasa-space-station-on-orbit-status-6-february-2018---celebrating-10-years-of-esas-columbus-module.html|title=NASA Space Station On-Orbit Status 6 February 2018 - Celebrating 10 Years of ESA's Columbus Module - SpaceRef|website=spaceref.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crops tested at this time include [[cabbage]], [[lettuce]], and [[mizuna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spaceref.com/international-space-station/nasa-space-station-on-orbit-status-6-february-2018---celebrating-10-years-of-esas-columbus-module.html|title=NASA Space Station On-Orbit Status 6 February 2018 - Celebrating 10 Years of ESA's Columbus Module - SpaceRef|website=spaceref.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==

A Veggie module weighs less than {{convert|8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and uses 90&amp;nbsp;watts.&lt;ref name=data_sheet&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techport.nasa.gov/view/10498 |title=Vegetable Production System (Veggie) Project |series=TechPort |publisher=NASA |accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of three parts: a lighting system, a bellows enclosure, and a reservoir.&lt;ref name=Zabel&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://sciences.ucf.edu/class/wp-content/uploads/sites/58/2017/02/Zabel_Review_Analysis_40yr_Space_Plant_Growth_Systems_LifeSciencesSpaceR....pdf |title=Review and analysis of over 40 years of space plant growth systems |journal=LIfe Sciences in Space Research |first1=P. |last1=Zabel |first2=M. |last2=Bamsey |first3=D. |last3=Schubert |first4=M. |last4=Tajmar |volume=10 |pages=1–16 |date=August 2016 |doi=10.1016/j.lssr.2016.06.004 |bibcode=2016LSSR...10....1Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lighting system regulates the amount and intensity of light plants receive, the bellows enclosure keeps the environment inside the unit separate from its surroundings, and the reservoir connects to plant pillows where the seeds grow.

=== Lighting system ===

Veggie's lighting system consists of three different types of colored [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]: red, blue, and green. Each color corresponds to a different light intensity that the plants will receive.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt; Although the lighting system can be reconfigured, the following table shows the default settings and their corresponding intensities in micromoles per second per square meter.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Setting !! Red !! Blue !! Green
|-
| Low || {{val|120|10}}%|| {{val|30|10}}% || -

| Medium || {{val|240|10}}% || {{val|60|10}}% || -

| High || {{val|360|10}}% || {{val|90|10}}% || -
|-
| On || - || - || {{val|30|5}}%
|-
| Potential || 550 || 150 || 100
|}

In addition to this lighting system, Veggie also uses opaque bellows to obstruct external sources of light.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;

=== Bellows enclosure ===

The bellows enclosure controls the flow and pressure of air within the container. The bellows are made from a [[fluoropolymer|fluorinated polymer]] and connected to the lighting system at its top and a baseplate at its bottom. Power and cooling is provided to the hardware that powers the bellows by [[ExPRESS Rack]]s.&lt;ref name=Massa /&gt;  Although the bellows regulate air flow and air pressure, temperature and humidity are left controlled by the surrounding environment of the Veggie module.&lt;ref name=Zabel/&gt;

=== Reservoir ===

The reservoir of the Veggie module contains and provides water to the [[plant pillow]]s in which plants grow. The plant pillows contain all other material such as fertilizer and seeds for the plant to grow. Seeds are oriented inside the sticky plant pillow so that their roots will grow downwards into the substrate provided by the plant pillow and that their stems will grow upwards outside of the plant pillow.&lt;ref name=video&gt;{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9aR2-7sOjg |title=ScienceCasts: Historic Vegetable Moment on the Space Station |series=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |work=YouTube.com |date=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results ==

In 2010, [[Desert Research and Technology Studies]] (Desert RATS) performed operational tests of the Vegetable Production System with lettuce. The three lettuce cultivars that were initially planted yielded positive results, growing and being consumed in 14 days. The Desert RATS team reported uniformly positive psychological results from the test crew.&lt;ref name="Stutte2011"&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110014431 |title=Operational Evaluation of VEGGIE Food Production System in the Habitat Demonstration Unit |conference=41st International Conference on Environmental Systems. 17–21 July 2011.

'''Viral metagenomics''' is the study of viral genetic material sourced directly from the environment rather than from a host or natural reservoir. The goal is to ascertain viral diversity in the environment that is often missed in studies targeting specific potential reservoirs. It reveals important information on [[virus]] evolution and the [[genetic diversity]] of the viral community without the need for isolating [[viral species]] and cultivating them in the laboratory. With the new available techniques that exploit [[Next-generation sequencing|NGS]], it was possible to study the [[virome]] of some ecosystems, even if the analysis has still some issues, in particular for the lack of universal markers. Some of the first metagenomic studies of viruses were done with ocean samples, and revealed that most of the sequences of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] viruses had no matches in databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Angly FE, Felts B, Breitbart M, Salamon P, Edwards RA, Carlson C, Chan AM, Haynes M, Kelley S, Liu H, Mahaffy JM, Mueller JE, Nulton J, Olson R, Parsons R, Rayhawk S, Suttle CA, Rohwer F|date=2006|title=The marine viromes of four oceanic regions|journal=PLoS Biology|volume=4|issue=11|page=e368|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040368|pmc=1634881|pmid=17090214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Culley|first1=A.

== The Global Virome Project ==
The aim of the Global Virome Project is to expand the viral discovery to reduce the risk of harm for new viral large-scale outbreak. It is centered on the massive collection and sequencing of the majority of the planet’s unknown viruses. In fact, it was estimated that between 631,000 to 827,000 yet-to-be-discovered viral species in animal reservoirs (as mammal and bird host) are estimated to have a [[Zoonosis|zoonotic potential]]. Total transparency of the data acquired, and the correlated possible development of some medical products (vaccine) are two main benefits of this project.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Dennis|last2=Daszak|first2=Peter|last3=Wolfe|first3=Nathan D.|last4=Gao|first4=George F.|last5=Morel|first5=Carlos M.|last6=Morzaria|first6=Subhash|last7=Pablos-Méndez|first7=Ariel|last8=Tomori|first8=Oyewale|last9=Mazet|first9=Jonna A. K.|date=2018-02-23|title=The Global Virome Project|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/359/6378/872|journal=Science|language=en|volume=359|issue=6378|pages=872–874|doi=10.1126/science.aap7463|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29472471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main limit of this project is the cost. To analyse the majority of viruses with a zoonotic potential, the total cost has been estimated around $1.2 billion. Another GVP’s aim is also to improve the possibility to detect with low cost sequencing viruses also in developing countries in order to avoid possible outbreaks''.'' For a worldwide sample collection some network between different agencies and nations must be created. For example, the USAID (agency for international development) EPT (Emerging Pandemic Threats) PREDICT project is included in this plan and it is focused on the study of the biology of some dangerous viruses, such as [[Ebola virus|Ebola]], [[Lassa fever]], [[Rift Valley fever]] and [[avian influenza]]. PREDICT project was founded also to discover new viral species in the animal reservoir host and individuate the main characteristics that can cause the viral transmission to human, to avoid the viral outbreak in the population. Next-generation sequencing can help the massive sequencing of this viral genome samples collected, allowing the increase of speed and efficiency and moreover reducing the cost of sequencing. To validate the possibility for these new-discovered viruses to be transmitted from animal to human, new approaches must be developed for the study of their [[Pathogenicity factor|pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Charles|date=2018-10-11|title=The virome hunters|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4268|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=En|volume=36|issue=10|pages=916–919|doi=10.1038/nbt.4268|issn=1087-0156|pmid=30307913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Virome Project could help the current pandemic surveillance, diagnosis techniques and prevention strategies, as far as helping for pre-emptive production of vaccine and other countermeasures for candidate high-risk viruses. Another benefit of this research could be a deeper comprehension of the viral biology. Its discovers can be applied not only for medical need, but also in other field as the agricultural and food one, for example to enhance biosecurity of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Methods ==
=== Metagenomic approach ===
It is used to sequence all the microbial genomes in a sample by using the [[Shotgun sequencing|Shotgun]] approach. Its aim is to identify all the genes present in the sample, mainly in order to provide information about drug-resistance. The sensitivity of this method is affected by the presence of contaminating nucleic acids from the host and other microorganisms. This method has been used for the sequencing of viruses like [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV) and [[Hepatitis C|HCV]]. It may be used also to inform about cancer evolution and integrated virus genomes in cases of virus-associated cancers. This method requires a low number of [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] cycles, so the consequent risk of contamination is decreased. Although no primers or probes are required, the cost to obtain enough data is high.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Houldcroft|first=Charlotte J.|last2=Beale|first2=Mathew A.|last3=Breuer|first3=Judith|date=2017-01-16|title=Clinical and biological insights from viral genome sequencing|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2016.182|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=15|issue=3|pages=183–192|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.182|issn=1740-1526|pmid=28090077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PCR amplicon enrichment ===
Its aim is to identify the organism and in order to do that, it enriches a portion of the genome of the virus before sequencing. For the amplification it uses specific primers for a highly-conserved target sequence. This method has been used to track Ebola virus and [[Zika virus]] during their outbreaks or to sequence the whole genome of [[Human cytomegalovirus|HCMV]]. Another possible application is the monitoring of mutations associated to drug-resistance in order to administer the more efficient drug to the patient. Although this method is cheaper than the metagenomic approach and has a great specificity and sensitivity, it has some limits: it requires many PCR cycles so it can introduce mutations and contaminants and the primers may be subjected to mismatches.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Target enrichment ===
It is an overlapping PCR method. It doesn’t require a culture step because it sequences the whole viral genome directly from the clinical sample. Small [[Oligonucleotide|oligonucleotides]], complementary to the target, are used as probes for a [[Hybridization assay|hybridization]] reaction. The probes can be bound to a solid phase or to [[Magnetic bead|magnetic beads]] in liquid phase. Capture is followed by a small number of PCR cycles and Shotgun sequencing. This method can be used to compare the genome of healthy cells and of tumoral cells in cases of virus-associated cancer. It has been used to characterize HCV, [[Hsv 1|HSV-1]], HCMV and other viruses. The presence of overlapping probes increases the tolerance for primer mismatches but their design requires high cost and time so a rapid response is limited. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Zodiacal Light.webm|thumb|Astronomers at [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]]'s sites often see zodiacal light.]]

'''Zodiacal light''' (also called '''false dawn'''&lt;ref&gt;https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120116.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/zodiacal-lights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://earthsky.org/astronomy-essentials/everything-you-need-to-know-zodiacal-light-or-false-dawn&lt;/ref&gt; when seen [[dawn|before sunrise]]) is a faint, [[photon diffusion|diffuse]], and roughly triangular white glow that is visible in the [[night sky]] and appears to extend from the [[Sun]]'s direction and along the [[zodiac]], straddling the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/Z/zodiacal_cloud.html |title=Zodiacal cloud |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Science |first=David |last=Darling |authorlink=David J. Darling}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sunlight]] [[light scattering by particles|scattered]] by [[cosmic dust|interplanetary dust]] causes this phenomenon. Zodiacal light is best seen during [[twilight]] after [[sunset]] in [[spring (season)|spring]] and before [[sunrise]] in [[autumn]], when the zodiac is at a steep angle to the horizon. However, the glow is so faint that [[moonlight]] and/or [[light pollution]] outshine it, rendering it invisible.

The brightness of zodiacal light decreases with distance from the Sun. In naturally dark night skies, the glow is visible as a band along the entire zodiac, completely straddling the ecliptic. In fact, zodiacal light spans the entire sky and largely&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Reach |first=W. T. |year=1997 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1997ASPC..124...33R&amp;amp;db_key=AST |title=The structured zodiacal light: IRAS, COBE, and ISO observations |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributes to the total natural light in a clear and moonless night sky. Another phenomenon – a faint but slightly brighter oval glow – directly [[antisolar point|opposite]] of the Sun's direction is the [[gegenschein]], which is caused by [[backscatter]]ed sunlight.

The interplanetary dust in the [[Solar System]] collectively forms a thick, pancake-shaped cloud called the [[interplanetary dust cloud|zodiacal cloud]], which straddles the [[ecliptic]] plane. The [[particle size]]s range between 10 and 300 [[micrometre]]s, most with a mass around 150 [[microgram]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Peucker-Ehrenbrink |first1=Bernhard |last2=Schmitz |first2=Birger |title=Accretion of extraterrestrial matter throughout earth's history |pages=66–67 |publisher=Springer |date=2001 |isbn=0-306-46689-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Viewing ==
[[File:Submillimeter Array Night.jpg|thumb|left|Zodiacal light seen behind the [[Submillimeter Array]] from the summit of [[Mauna Kea]]]]

In the mid-latitudes, the zodiacal light is best observed in the western sky in the spring after the evening [[twilight]] has completely disappeared, or in the eastern sky in the autumn just before the morning twilight appears.  The zodiacal light appears as a column, brighter at the horizon, tilted at the angle of the ecliptic.  The light scattered from extremely small dust particles is strongly [[forward scattering]], although the zodiacal light actually extends all the way around the sky, hence it is brightest when observing at a small angle with the Sun.  This is why it is most clearly visible near sunrise or sunset, when the sun is blocked, but the dust particles nearest the line of sight to the sun are not. The dust band that causes the zodiacal light is uniform across the whole ecliptic.

The dust further from the ecliptic is almost undetectable except when viewed at a small angle with the sun.  Thus it is possible to see more of the width at small angles toward the sun, and it appears wider near the horizon, closer to the sun under the horizon.

== Origin ==

The source of the dust has been long debated. Until recently, it was thought that the dust originated from the tails of active [[comet]]s and from collisions between [[asteroid]]s in the [[asteroid belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=2006DPS....38.4101E

Over 85 percent of the dust is attributed to occasional fragmentations of Jupiter-family comets that are nearly [[Extinct comet|dormant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/0004-637X/713/2/816

The dust in meteoroid streams is much larger, 300 to 10,000 [[micrometre]]s in diameter, and falls apart into smaller zodiacal dust grains over time.
[[File:Romantic Sunset over the VLT.jpg|thumb|right|Colorful center of the [[Milky Way]] and the zodiacal light above the [[Very Large Telescope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Sunset over the VLT|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1516a/|website=www.eso.org|publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]]|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Poynting–Robertson effect]] forces the dust into more circular (but still elongated) orbits, while spiralling slowly into the Sun. Hence a continuous source of new particles is needed to maintain the zodiacal cloud. [[Comet]]ary dust and dust generated by collisions among the [[asteroid]]s are believed to be mostly responsible for the maintenance of the dust cloud producing the zodiacal light and the [[gegenschein]].

Particles can be reduced in size by collisions or by space weathering. When ground down to sizes less than 10 micrometres, the grains are removed from the inner Solar System by solar radiation pressure. The dust is then replenished by the infall from comets. Zodiacal dust around nearby stars is called [[exozodiacal dust]]; it is a potentially important source of noise for directly imaging [[extrasolar planets]]. It has been pointed out that this exozodiacal dust, or hot debris disks, can be an indicator of planets, as planets tend to scatter the comets to the inner Solar System.

In 2015, new results from the secondary ion dust spectrometer COSIMA on board the [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''ESA/Rosetta'']] orbiter confirmed that the parent bodies of interplanetary dust are most probably Jupiter-family comets such as comet [[67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rita Schulz |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/nature14159.html |title=Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko sheds dust coat accumulated over the past four years |work=Nature (letter)|date=12 February 2015|issue=7538 |pages=216–218 |doi=10.1038/nature14159 |volume=518|bibcode = 2015Natur.518..216S |display-authors=etal |pmid=25624103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zodiacal light is produced by sunlight reflecting off dust particles in the Solar System known as [[cosmic dust]]. Consequently, its [[spectroscopy|spectrum]] is the same as the [[sun|solar]] spectrum. The material producing the zodiacal light is located in a lens-shaped volume of space centered on the sun and extending well out beyond the [[orbit]] of Earth. This material is known as the [[interplanetary dust cloud]]. Since most of the material is located near the plane of the Solar System, the zodiacal light is seen along the [[ecliptic]]. The amount of material needed to produce the observed zodiacal light is quite small. If it were in the form of 1&amp;nbsp;mm particles, each with the same [[albedo]] (reflecting power) as Earth's [[moon]], each particle would be 8&amp;nbsp;km from its neighbors. The [[gegenschein]] may be caused by particles directly opposite the Sun as seen from Earth, which would be in full [[lunar phase|phase]].

According to Nesvorný and Jenniskens, when the dust grains are as small as about 150 micrometres in size, they will hit the Earth at an average speed of 14.5&amp;nbsp;km/s, many as slowly as 12&amp;nbsp;km/s. If so, they pointed out, this [[comet dust]] can survive entry in partially molten form, accounting for the unusual attributes of the [[micrometeorites]] collected in Antarctica, which do not resemble the larger [[meteorites]] known to originate from [[asteroids]]. In recent years, observations by a variety of spacecraft have shown significant structure in the zodiacal light including dust bands associated with debris from particular [[minor planet|asteroid families]] and several cometary trails.

== Cultural significance ==
According to [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''[[Kosmos (Humboldt)|Kosmos]]'', Mexicans were aware of the zodiacal light before 1500.&lt;ref name="ley196104"&gt;{{Cite magazine

According to some sources, he explained it by dust particles around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Petrus Matheus Marie Jenniskens|title=Meteor Showers and Their Parent Comets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpajMuyXG8AC&amp;pg=PA531|date=14 September 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85349-1|page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Grun|title=Interplanetary Dust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWRKx_QulUcC&amp;pg=PA58|date=9 August 2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-42067-5|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that it was first explained this way by [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], in 1684,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven J.

=== Importance to Islam ===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
The [[Islam]]ic prophet [[Muhammad]] described zodiacal light in reference to the timing of the [[salat|five daily prayers]], calling it the "false dawn" ({{lang|ar|الفجر الكاذب}} ''{{transl|ar|al-fajr al-kādhib}}''). Muslim oral tradition preserves numerous sayings, or [[hadith]], in which Muhammad describes the difference between the light of false dawn, appearing in the sky long after sunset, and the light of the first band of horizontal light at sunrise, the "true dawn" ({{lang|ar|الفجر الصادق}} ''{{transl|ar|al-fajr al-sādiq}}''). According to the vast majority of Muslim scholars, [[astronomical dawn]] is considered the true dawn. Practitioners of Islam use Muhammad's descriptions of zodiacal light to avoid errors in determining the timing of daily prayers. Such practical descriptions and applications of astronomical observations were vital to the golden age of [[Islamic astronomy]].

Use of the term "false dawn" in this context should not be confused with [[false sunrise]], which is a different, unrelated optical phenomenon.

=== Brian May ===
In 2007, [[Brian May]], lead guitarist with the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]], completed his [[thesis]], ''A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud'', thirty-six years after abandoning it to pursue a career in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=May|first1=Brian|title=A Survey of Radial Velocities in the Zodiacal Dust Cloud|url=https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780387777054|website=Springer|publisher=[[Springer Nature]]|accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to submit it only because of the minimal amount of research on the topic undertaken during the intervening years. May describes the subject as being one that became "trendy" again in the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;Terri Gross interviews Brian May, [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128935865 "National Public Radio show [[Fresh Air]]"]&lt;/ref&gt;
