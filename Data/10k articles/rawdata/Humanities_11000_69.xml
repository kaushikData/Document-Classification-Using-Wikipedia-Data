*'''March''': [[Amoco Cadiz]] tanker runs aground off the coast of [[France]], spilling {{convert|1.6|Moilbbl|m3}}of [[crude oil]]. (Largest crude spill to date.)
*'''June''' [[Iran]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] block efforts of [[OPEC]] price hawks to fix the price of OPEC oil in a currency more stable than the [[U.S. dollar]]. Say world economy cannot support associated price increases. Are accused by hawks of being U.S. agents.
*'''September''': Shah puts Iran under military rule. Muslim leader [[Abdollah Nouri]] arrested in crackdown of opposition groups.
*'''October''': Iranian strikes; departure of foreign technicians. Pipeline fire drops [[Iraq]]i production from {{Convert|600000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} to {{Convert|300000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}.
*'''November''': Iranian oil production starts dropping.
*'''December''': Iranian production hits {{convert|1.5|Moilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}} in mid-December; 500,000 on December 27, a 27-year low. OPEC production rises 1.6 MMBD over two months due to increased Saudi production.
*'''December 17''': OPEC decides on a 14.5 percent price increase for 1979, to be implemented quarterly.

[[File:Badilisha Poetry Exchange.jpg|thumb|Badilisha Poetry X-Change 2009]]

'''Badilisha Poetry X-Change''' is a platform dedicated to showcasing poetry from Africa and the [[African Diaspora]]. The project came out of recognising the lack of documentation of African poets, on the African continent and in the rest of the world. Its aims are to fill this void as well as create a comprehensive global archive of Pan-African poets that can accessed internationally. First launched in 2008 as a poetry festival, the Spier Poetry Exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africacentre.net The Africa Centre.]&lt;/ref&gt; by nonprofit organisation [[Africa Centre]] in [[Cape Town]], the festival centred on various aspects of developing, celebrating, archiving and documenting poetry and voices.&lt;ref&gt;Malika Ndlovu&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Spier Poetry Exchange changed to the Badilisha Poetry X-Change (taking its name from the [[kiSwahili]] expression "Badilisha", which means to change, exchange and transform). Although different in name, Badilisha Poetry X-Change continues the "exchange" between poets, creating spaces and platforms for programmed poetry interventions, workshops and presentations. Its existence continues to provide new and established Pan-African voices a space of celebration, documentation, proliferation, and self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;http://badilishapoetry.com/en/about-badilisha-africa-centre//&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Badilisha Poetry X-Change Live==
Based in Cape Town, South Africa, Badilisha Poetry X-Change Live is the physical manifestation of Badilisha. Events in the past have included week-long poetry interventions that showcase poets from the African Continent and its [[Diaspora]]. Each live intervention has focused on expanding [[performance poetry]] beyond entertainment into a medium for social activism, through workshops, seminars and masterclasses. Badilisha Live has had three poetry festivals, each featuring a line-up of poets from Africa and its Diaspora. Past festivals have featured [[D'bi Young]], [[Kwame Dawes]], [[Anis Mojgani]], Ngoma Hill, [[Aryan Kaganof]], [[Warsan Shire]], [[Lemn Sissay]], Emile Jansen, [[Phillippa Yaa de Villiers]], [[Megan Hall]] and [[Dorothea Smartt]].

In 2010, Badilisha Poetry X-Change expanded beyond its geographical boundaries into the online radio platform '''Badilisha Poetry Radio'''. Badilisha Poetry Radio is a poetry podcast platform that is dedicated to poets of Africa and the Diaspora. It showcases a range of voices from across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Mbali Vilakazi&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists are activist that use poetry as their art form.

==Badilisha Poetry Radio==
[[Badilisha Poetry Radio]], which launched on 30 April 2010, presents new voices and poetic genres. Currently there are more than 300 poets featured. This is dedicated to podcasting poets from Africa and the Diaspora. Each week the curator uploads poets of diverse styles, genre and topics from different corners of the globe. Poets can submit their work electronically via the website.&lt;ref&gt;http://badilishapoetry.com/submission-info-podcast/&lt;/ref&gt; The podcasts are available on Badilisha Poetry Radio and iTunes and can be downloaded.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5156">A '''barbarism''' is a non-standard [[word]], [[sentence (linguistics)|expression]] or [[pronunciation]] in a [[language]], particularly one regarded as an error in [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], while a ''[[solecism]]'' is an error in [[syntax]].&lt;ref&gt;"Livy's Patavinitas," [[Kurt Latte]], ''Classical Philology'', Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1940), pp. 56–60&lt;/ref&gt; The label was originally applied to mixing [[Ancient Greek]] or [[Latin]] with other languages. It expanded to indicate any inappropriate words or expressions in [[classical studies]], and eventually to any language considered unpolished or rude.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=barbarism, n. |year=1885 |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |editor=James Murray |location=London |publisher=Clarendon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used mainly for the written language. With no accepted technical meaning in modern linguistics, the term is little used by contemporary descriptive scientists.&lt;ref name="McArthur"&gt;{{cite book|last=McArthur|first=Roshan |editor=R. McArthur &amp; T. McArthur|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280637-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The word ''barbarism'' was originally used by the [[Greeks]] for foreign terms used in their language. ("Barbarism" is related to the word "barbarian"; the [[ideophone]] "bar-bar-bar" was the ancient Greek equivalent of modern English "blah-blah-blah", meant to sound like [[gibberish]] — hence the negative connotation of both ''barbarian'' and ''barbarism'').&lt;ref&gt;See ''Barbarism'' (etymology) The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.  2000.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=December 2016}}

The earliest use of the word in English to describe inappropriate usage was in the sixteenth century to refer to mixing other languages with Latin or Greek, especially in texts treating Classics.&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt; By the seventeenth century ''barbarism'' had taken on a more general, less precise sense of unsuitable language. In ''The History of Philosophy'', for example, Thomas Stanley declares, "Among the faults of speech is ''Barbarisme'', a phrase not in use with the best persons, and ''Solecisme'', a speech incoherently framed" {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=Thomas|title=The History of Philosophy|year=1656|publisher=H. Moseley and T. Dring|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hybrid word]]s, which combine [[affix]]es or other elements borrowed from multiple languages, were sometimes decried as barbarism. Thus the authors of the ''Encyclopædia Metropolitana'' criticized the French word ''{{lang|fr|linguistique}}'' ("linguistics") as "more than ordinary barbarism, for the Latin substantive ''lingua'' is here combined, not merely with one, but with two Greek particles".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Stoddart|author2=William Hazlitt|title=Encyclopædia Metropolitana; or, System of Universal Knowledge|year=1858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such mixing is generally considered standard in contemporary English.&lt;ref name="McArthur" /&gt;

Although ''barbarism'' has no precise technical definition, the term is still used in non-technical discussions of language use to describe a word or usage as incorrect or nonstandard.&lt;ref name="McArthur" /&gt; [[Gallicism]]s (use of [[French language|French]] words or idioms), [[List of German expressions in English|Germanism]]s, [[Hispanism]]s, and so forth in [[English language|English]] can be construed as examples of barbarisms, as can [[Anglicism]]s in other languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==In the Russian language==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Russian language]] of noble classes was severely "barbarized" by the French language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lev Uspensky]], ''[http://speakrus.ru/uspens/ch8.html A Word about Words]'', Ch. 8 {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Карский Е. Ф., О так называемых барбаризмах в русском языке (краткий отчёт Виленской 2 гимназии), Вильна, 1886:&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, speaking in French had become not only fashionable but also had become a distinction of a properly groomed person. One may see a prominent example of this in [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.  While the cream of the high society could afford themselves a genuine French ''gouvernante'' ([[governess]], i.e., female live-in tutor), the provincial "upper class" had problems with this. Still, the desire to show off their education produced what [[Aleksander Griboyedov|Griboyedov]] in his ''[[Woe from Wit]]'' termed "the [[Confusion of tongues|mixture of the tongues]]: French with [[Nizhny Novgorod|Nizhegorodian]]" (смешенье языков: французского с нижегородским). The French-Nizhegorodian was often used for comical effect in literature and theatre.

A '''comedy festival''' is a celebration of comedy with many shows, venues, comedy performers (such as stand up comics, sketch troupes, variety performers, etc.) and is held over a specific block of time. Normally, each festival has a diverse range of comedy themes and genres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8388">'''Conceptual semantics''' is a framework for semantic analysis developed mainly by [[Ray Jackendoff]] in 1976. Its aim is to provide a characterization of the conceptual elements by which a person understands words and sentences, and thus to provide ''an explanatory semantic representation'' (title of a Jackendoff 1976 paper).  ''Explanatory'' in this sense refers to the ability of a given linguistic theory to describe how a component of language is acquired by a child (as proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]]; see [[Levels of adequacy]]).

Recently, conceptual semantics in particular, and [[lexical semantics]] in general, have taken on increasing importance in linguistics and psycholinguistics.  Many contemporary theories of [[syntax]] (how sentences are constructed from individual words) rely on elements that are idiosyncratic to words themselves.  As a result, a sound theory accounting for the properties of  the meanings of words is required.

==Meaning and decomposition==

Jackendoff has claimed that the goal of conceptual semantics is to investigate:

{{Quote|text="...how linguistic utterances are related to human cognition, where cognition is a human capacity that is to a considerable degree independent of language, interacting with the perceptual and action systems as well as language."|sign=|source=(Jackendoff 2006:355)}}

Conceptual semantics distinguishes a single, universal meaning to a word. Instead of having a lexical semantic meaning in addition to the conceptual representation of the actual referent, here the two are combined into what Jackendoff calls "lexical concepts" (Murphy 2010:59). Conceptual semantics is considered to be not just a linguistic theory, but a theory on human cognition. Like many semantic theories, Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptualization. Just as one of the ways a physical scientist tries to understand matter is by breaking it down into progressively smaller parts, so a scientific study of conceptualization proceeds by breaking down, or decomposing, meanings into smaller parts. However, this decomposition cannot go on forever, for at some point, meanings can no longer be broken down.

This is the level of conceptual structure, the level of mental representations which encode the human understanding of the world, containing the primitive conceptual elements out of which meanings are built, plus their rules of combination. Conceptual semantics does not work with a mental dictionary, in the classical sense. There are no definitions attached to concepts and reference, only the idea of the concept or reference itself. Just as generative syntax posits a finite set of syntactic categories and rules for combining them, so, too, does Conceptual Semantics posit 'a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination' governing their interaction (Jackendoff 1990: 9). Jackendoff refers to this set of primitives and the rules governing them as the 'grammar of sentential concepts' (Jackendoff 1990: 9).

His starting point is a close analysis of the meanings of lexemes dedicated to bringing out parallelisms and contrasts which reveal the nature of the conceptual structures underlying them. Jackendoff considers the lexicon to be made of three parts: phonological, syntactic, and conceptual. These three aspects of a concept give a "full picture of a word" (Murphy 2010:60). What his method shows, he says, is that the psychological organization on which meaning rests 'lies a very short distance below the surface of everyday lexical items –
and that progress can be made in exploring it' (1991: 44).
Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptual structure, in which the concepts underlying word
meaning are broken down into their smallest elements: conceptual primitives envisaged as the semantic equivalents of phonological features. Conceptual Semantics posits 'a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination' governing their interaction. The conceptual structure of a lexical item is an element with zero or more open argument slots, which are filled by the syntactic complements of the lexical item.

== Semantic structures ==
Conceptual semantics breaks lexical concepts up into ontological categories: events, states, places, amounts, things, and property, to name a few. These ontological categories are called semantic primes, or semantic primitives. Jackendoff poses that any concept in the human brain can be expressed using these semantic primes. Conceptual semantics is compositional, in that the meanings of phrases, clauses, and sentences can be determined from the lexical concepts that make them up. (Murphy 2010:66)

==Problems==

Jackendoff's system has been criticised for its highly abstract primitives, which linguists such as Wierzbicka (2007a, 2007b) and Goddard (1998, 2001) have called "obscure". The main reason for this is because one requires special training to understand them, and they often must be translated into plain English to be communicated. Another criticism often raised against conceptual semantics is that it is arbitrary. In its current state, there are no clear procedures for determining when a primitive is justified. Another criticism Wierzbicka and Goddard have raised is that the theory was formulated around and applied only to English, though it claims to be universal.

Jackendoff responds to these criticisms by saying:{{quote|source=(Jackendoff 1990)|In fact, an isolated primitive can never be justified: a primitive makes sense only in the context of the overall system of primitives in which it is embedded. With this proviso, however, I think a particular choice of primitives should be justified on the grounds of its capacity for expressing generalizations and explaining the distribution of the data. That is, a proposed system of primitives is subject to the usual scientific standards of evaluation.|}} &lt;!--(1991: 12) ''--&gt;

'''Cursive''' (also known as '''script''' or '''longhand''', among other names{{efn|Also known as '''handwriting''', '''looped writing''', '''joint writing''', '''joined-up writing''', or '''running writing'''}}) is any style of [[penmanship]] in which some characters are written joined together in a flowing manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. Formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. The writing style can be further divided as "looped", "[[Italic script|italic]]" or "connected".

The cursive method is used with a number of alphabets due to its improved writing speed and infrequent pen lifting. In some alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke.

== Descriptions ==
Cursive is a style of penmanship in which the symbols of the language are written in a [[wikt:conjoin|conjoin]]ed and/or ''flowing'' manner, generally for the purpose of making writing faster. This writing style is distinct from "printscript" using [[block letters]], in which the letters of a word are unconnected and in Roman/Gothic letterform rather than joined-up script. Not all cursive [[copybook (education)|copybook]]s join all letters: formal cursive is generally joined, but casual cursive is a combination of joins and pen lifts. In the [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Latin script|Latin]], and [[Cyrillic (script)|Cyrillic]] alphabets, many or all letters in a word are connected, sometimes making a word one single complex stroke. In [[cursive Hebrew|Hebrew cursive]] and [[Roman cursive]], the letters are not connected. In Maharashtra there is a version of Cursive called [[Modi alphabet|'Modi']]

=== Subclasses ===

==== Ligature ====
Ligature is writing the letters of words with lines connecting the letters so that one does not have to pick up the pen or pencil between letters.  Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called "cursive" (as opposed to uncial) though the letters do not connect.

==== Looped ====
[[file:Looped cursive sample.jpg|thumb|alt=The first verse of "Good King Wenceslas" in cursive|Looped cursive as taught in Britain in mid-20th century]]
In ''looped cursive'' penmanship, some [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]s and [[descender]]s have loops which provide for joins.  This is generally what people refer to when they say "cursive".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==== Italic ====
''[[italic script|Cursive italic]]'' penmanship—derived from [[chancery cursive]]—uses non-looped joins or no joins. In italic cursive, there are no joins from g, j, q or y, and a few other joins are discouraged.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704631504575531932754922518 |title=How Handwriting Boosts the Brain |first=Gwendolyn |last=Bounds |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 5, 2010 |publisher=[[Dow Jones &amp; Company|Dow Jones]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0099-9660 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2015}} Italic penmanship became popular in the 15th-century Italian Renaissance. The term "italic" as it relates to handwriting is not to be confused with [[italic type]]d letters that slant forward. Many, but not all, letters in the handwriting of the Renaissance were joined, as most are today in cursive italic.

== Origin ==
The origins of the cursive method are associated with practical advantages of writing speed and infrequent pen-lifting to accommodate the limitations of the [[quill]]. Quills are fragile, easily broken, and will spatter unless used properly. Steel [[dip pen]]s followed quills; they were sturdier, but still had some limitations. The individuality of the provenance of a document (see [[Signature]]) was a factor also, as opposed to machine [[font]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Jean (1997). ''Writing: The Story of Alphabets and Scripts'', London: Thames and Hudson Ltd. ['[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cursive was also favored because the writing tool was rarely taken off the paper.
The term ''cursive'' derives from the 18th century [[Italian language|Italian]] ''corsivo'' from [[Medieval Latin]] ''cursivus'', which literally means ''running''. This term in turn derives from [[Latin]] ''currere'' ("to run, hasten").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=cursive|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cursive|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(also known in Bengali as "professional writing"{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) the letters are more likely to be more curvy in appearance than in standard Bengali handwriting. Also, the horizontal supporting bar on each letter ([[Bengali alphabet#The matra|''matra'']]) runs continuously through the entire word, unlike in standard handwriting. This cursive handwriting often used by literature experts differs in appearance from the [[Bengali script|standard Bengali alphabet]] as it is free hand writing, where sometimes the alphabets are complex and appear different from the standard handwriting.

{{Main|Roman cursive}}
[[File:Hocgracili.jpg|thumb|right|Example of old Roman cursive]]
''Roman cursive'' is a form of handwriting (or a [[script (styles of handwriting)|script]]) used in [[ancient Rome]] and to some extent into the [[Middle Ages]]. It is customarily divided into old (or ancient) cursive, and new cursive. Old Roman cursive, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the [[Latin alphabet]], and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. New Roman, also called [[minuscule cursive]] or later cursive, developed from old cursive. It was used from approximately the 3rd century to the 7th century, and uses letter forms that are more recognizable to modern eyes; "a", "b", "d", and "e" have taken a more familiar shape, and the other letters are proportionate to each other rather than varying wildly in size and placement on a line.

{{Main|History of the Greek alphabet}}
[[File:Greek manuscript cursive 6th century.png|thumb|right|Ancient Greek cursive script, 6th century A.D.]]

The [[Greek alphabet]] has had several cursive forms in the course of its development. In antiquity, a cursive form of handwriting was used in writing on [[papyrus]]. It employed slanted and partly connected letter forms as well as many [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s. Some features of this handwriting were later adopted into Greek minuscule, the dominant form of handwriting in the medieval and early modern era. In the 19th and 20th centuries, an entirely new form of cursive Greek, more similar to contemporary Western European cursive scripts, was developed.

== Western Europe ==
During the Middle Ages, the flowing, connected cursive script of the Arabic language inspired Western Christian scholars to develop similar cursive scripts for Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Eastern Mysteries: An Encyclopedic Guide to the Sacred Languages &amp; Magickal Systems of the World (Key of It All) |author=Hulse, David Allen | publisher=Llewellyn Publications | year=2002 | isbn=978-1567184280 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sWHjIxkvXYEC | page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scripts then became the basis for all of the Latin-based cursive scripts used in Europe.

=== English ===
[[File:letter.posted.in.1894.arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cursive in English letter from 1894]]
[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in ''secretary hand''&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131-3: By William Shakespeare, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) {{ISBN|0-944435-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Cursive writing was used in English before the [[Norman conquest]]. [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] typically include a boundary clause written in [[Old English]] in a cursive script. A cursive handwriting style—[[secretary hand]]—was widely used for both personal correspondence and official documents in England from early in the 16th century.

Cursive handwriting developed into something approximating its current form from the 17th century, but its use was neither uniform, nor standardized either in England itself or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]. In the English colonies of the early 17th century, most of the letters are clearly separated in the handwriting of [[William Bradford (1590-1657)|William Bradford]], though a few were joined as in a cursive hand. In England itself, Edward Cocker had begun to introduce a version of the French ''[[Ronde script (calligraphy)|ronde]]''&lt;!-- sic --&gt; style, which was then further developed and popularized throughout the [[British Empire]] in the 17th and 18th centuries as [[round hand]] by John Ayers and William Banson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whalley|first=Joyce Irene|title=The Art of Calligraphy, Western Europe &amp; America|year=1980|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London|isbn=0-906223-64-4|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the American colonies, on the eve of their independence from the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], it is notable that [[Thomas Jefferson]] joined most, but not all the letters when drafting the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. However, a few days later, [[Timothy Matlack]] professionally re-wrote the presentation copy of the Declaration in a fully joined, cursive hand. Eighty-seven years later, in the middle of the 19th century, [[Abraham Lincoln]] drafted the [[Gettysburg Address]] in a cursive hand that would not look out of place today.

Note that not all such cursive, then or now, joined all of the letters within a word.

[[File:HandwritingOfOneJohnJay(NotTheFamousOne).jpg|thumb|right|Cursive handwriting from the 19th-century USA.]]
In both the British Empire and the United States in the 18th and 19th centuries, before the typewriter, professionals used cursive for their correspondence. This was called a "fair hand", meaning it looked good, and firms trained their clerks to write in exactly the same script.

In the early days{{when|date=June 2017}} of the [[post office]], letters were written in cursive&amp;nbsp;– and to fit more text on a single sheet, the text was continued in lines [[Crossed letter|crossing at 90 degrees from the original text]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arrow of Chaos: Romanticism and Postmodernity|last = Livingston|first = Ira|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1997|isbn = 0816627959|location = |pages = 143|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ySwihw-VVP4C&amp;pg=PT143#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter = The Romantic Double-Cross: Keats's Letters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Block letters were not suitable for this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Although women's handwriting had noticeably different particulars from men's, the general forms were not prone to rapid change. In the mid-19th century, most children were taught the contemporary cursive; in the United States, this usually occurred in second or third grade (around ages seven to nine). Few simplifications appeared as the middle of the 20th century approached.{{citation needed|date=December 2009}}

After the 1960s, a movement originally begun by [[Paul Standard]] in the 1930s to replace looped cursive with cursive italic penmanship resurfaced. It was motivated by the claim that cursive instruction was more difficult than it needed to be: that conventional (looped) cursive was unnecessary, and it was easier to write in cursive italic. Because of this, a number of various new forms of cursive italic appeared, including [[Getty-Dubay]], and [[Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting]]. In the 21st century, some of the surviving cursive writing styles are [[Spencerian script|Spencerian]], [[Palmer Method]], [[D'Nealian]], and Zaner-Bloser script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/from-punishing-to-pleasurable-how-cursive-writing-is-looping-back-into-our-hearts/2018/08/31/aa180b9c-aa06-11e8-a8d7-0f63ab8b1370_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.88491996752d] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest forms of new technology that caused the decline of handwriting was the invention of the [[ballpoint pen]], patented in 1888 by John Loud. Two brothers, László and György Bíró, further developed the pen by changing the design and using different ink that dried quickly. With their design, it was guaranteed that the ink would not smudge, as it would with the earlier design of pen, and it no longer required the careful penmanship one would use with the older design of pen. After World War II, the ballpoint pen was mass-produced and sold for a cheap price, changing the way people wrote. Over time the emphasis of using the style of cursive to write slowly declined{{quantify|date=August 2017}}, only to be later impacted by other technologies such as the phone, computer, and keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How The Ballpoint Pen Killed Cursive|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/08/ballpoint-pens-object-lesson-history-handwriting/402205/|website = The Atlantic|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Decline of Handwriting|last = Enstrom|first = E.A.|date = 1965|journal = The Elementary School Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cursive has been in decline throughout the 21st century due to its perceived lack of necessity. The Fairfax Education Association, the largest teachers' union in Fairfax County, Virginia, has called cursive a "dying art". Many consider cursive too tedious to learn and believe that it is not a useful skill.&lt;ref name="Shapiro"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Cursive handwriting is disappearing from public schools|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/education/cursive-handwriting-disappearing-from-public-schools/2013/04/04/215862e0-7d23-11e2-a044-676856536b40_story.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |date = 2013-04-04|access-date = 2015-10-30|issn = 0190-8286|first = T.

On the 2006 [[SAT]], a United States post-secondary education entrance exam, only 15 percent of the students wrote their essay answers in cursive.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Handwriting Is on the Wall |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=11 October 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001475_2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, students might be discouraged from using cursive on standardized tests due to exams written in hard to read handwriting receive less marks, and some graders may have difficulties reading cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/22/exam-markers-complain-about-students-blue-ink-scribbles|title=Poor handwriting 'may hinder students' chances of exam success'|first=Richard|last=Adams|date=21 August 2016|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 survey of 200 teachers of first through third grades in all 50 American states, 90 percent of respondents said their schools required the teaching of cursive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Schools debate: Is cursive writing worth teaching? |newspaper= [[USA Today]] |date=23 January 2009 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2009-01-23-cursive-handwriting_N.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 nationwide survey found elementary school teachers lacking formal training in teaching handwriting to students. Only 12 percent of teachers reported having taken a course in how to teach it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graham|first=Steve|author2=Harris, Karen R. |author3=Mason, Linda |author4=Fink-Chorzempa, Barbara |author5=Moran, Susan |author6=Saddler, Bruce |title=How do primary grade teachers teach handwriting?

In 2012, the American states of [[Indiana]] and [[Hawaii]] announced that their schools will no longer be required to teach cursive (but will still be permitted to), and instead will be required to teach "keyboard proficiency". Since the nationwide proposal of the [[Common Core State Standards]] in 2009, which do not include instruction in cursive, the standards have been adopted by 44 states as of July 2011, all of which have debated whether to augment them with cursive.&lt;ref name="TIME Newsfeed"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/06/typing-beats-scribbling-indiana-schools-can-stop-teaching-cursive/?iid=nfmostpopular |title=Typing Beats Scribbling: Indiana Schools Can Stop Teaching Cursive |first=Kayla  |last=Webley |work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]] |date=6 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/01/hawaii-no-longer-requires_n_915402.html "Hawaii No Longer Requires Teaching Cursive In Schools"].

==== Conservation efforts and cognitive benefits ====
Many historical documents, such as the United States Constitution, are written in cursive—the inability to read cursive therefore precludes one from being able to fully appreciate such documents in their original format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Reasons Kids Should Still Learn Cursive Writing|url = http://time.com/2820780/five-reasons-kids-should-still-learn-cursive-writing/|website = TIME.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Katy|last = Steinmetz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the decline in the day-to-day use of cursive, it is being reintroduced to the curriculum of schools in the United States.

=== German ===
Up to the 19th century, [[Kurrent]] (also known as ''German cursive'') was used in German language longhand. Kurrent was not used exclusively, but in parallel to modern cursive (which is the same as English cursive). Writers used both cursive styles: location, contents and context of the text determined which style to use. A successor of Kurrent, [[Sütterlin]], was widely used in the period 1911-1941 until the Nazi Party banned it, and German speakers brought up with Sütterlin continued to use it well into the post-war period.

Today, three different styles of cursive writing are taught in German schools, the {{ill|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|de|Lateinische Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (introduced in 1953), the {{ill|Schulausgangsschrift|de|Schulausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1968), and the {{ill|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|de|Vereinfachte Ausgangsschrift|vertical-align=sup}} (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grundschrift-schreibschrift.de|title=Grundschrift-Schreibschrift|work=grundschrift-schreibschrift.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German National Primary Schoolteachers' Union has proposed replacing all three with [[Grundschrift]], a simplified form of non-cursive handwriting adopted by [[Hamburg]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/29/germany-teachers-handwriting-schools-schreibschrift|title=German teachers campaign to simplify handwriting in schools|author=Helen Pidd|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Russian ==
[[File:Russian Cursive Cyrillic.svg|thumb|right|The standard modern Russian Cyrillic cursive alphabet with uppercase and lowercase letters, used in school education.]]
{{main|Russian cursive}}
The ''Russian Cursive [[Cyrillic]]'' alphabet is used (instead of [[Russian alphabet|the block letters]]) when handwriting the modern [[Russian language]]. While several letters resemble Latin counterparts, many of them represent different sounds. Most handwritten Russian, especially personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet. Most children in Russian schools are taught in the 1st grade how to write using this Russian script.

== Chinese ==
Cursive forms of [[Chinese written language|Chinese characters]] are used in calligraphy; "running script" is the [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive]] form and [[Cursive script (East Asia)|"rough script"]] (mistakenly called "grass script" due to misinterpretation) is the cursive. The running aspect of this script has more to do with the formation and connectedness of strokes ''within'' an individual character than with connections between characters as in Western connected cursive. The latter are rare in [[hanzi]] and in the derived Japanese [[kanji]] characters which are usually well separated by the writer.

'''Ella Sophia Armitage''' (3 March 1841 – 20 March 1931) was an English historian and archaeologist.

==Life==
Armitage was born '''Ella Sophia Bulley''' in [[Liverpool]], the second daughter of Samuel Marshall Bulley, a cotton merchant, and Mary Rachel Raffles.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite book|last=Counihan|first=Joan|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Armitage , Ella Sophia (1841–1931)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In October 1871 she was one of the first students to enter [[Newnham College]], Cambridge. Two of her sisters also attended Newnham, including [[Amy Bulley]] who sat the tripos.&lt;ref name=amy&gt;Linda Walker, ‘Bulley , (Agnes) Amy (1852–1939)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2010 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48686, accessed 22 Feb 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 Ella became the college's first research student.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-92038-8|page=52|chapter=Armitage, Ella Sophia A (Bulley) (1841–1931)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year she married the Reverend Elkanah Armitage, with whom she would have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Counihan|first=Joan|title=Mrs Ella Armitage, John Horace Round, G. T. Clark and Early Norman Castles|journal=Anglo-Norman Studies|year=1986|volume=8|pages=73–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1877 to 1879 she taught history at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]], Manchester with her sister Amy.&lt;ref name=amy/&gt; In Manchester she developed her interest in mediaeval earthworks and castles.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie" /&gt; In 1887 she became the first woman on the school board at [[Rotherham]], and in 1894 she was appointed assistant commissioner to [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]] on the Royal Commission on Secondary Education to investigate girls' education in Devon.

Armitage – along with [[John Horace Round]], George Neilson, and [[Goddard Henry Orpen]] – proved in a string of publications that British [[motte-and-bailey]] castles, which had previously been assumed to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, were not constructed until after the 1066 [[Norman conquest of England]]. Her book ''The Early Norman Castles of the British Isles'' is considered a seminal work on the subject.&lt;ref name="DNB" /&gt;

In [[English (language)|English]] [[grammar]], a '''false singular''' occurs when a [[Grammatical number|singular]] [[noun]] ending in a ''s'' or ''z'' sound is understood as a [[plural]] from which a new singular is constructed.  The false singular is a form of [[back-formation]].

Some false singulars become standard English.  For example, ''[[pea]]'' was originally a false singular from ''pease'' pl. ''peasen''.  (The old word remains in the phrase ''pease porridge''.)

The non-standard historical forms ''Chinee'' and ''Portuguee'' are also false singulars, from ''Chinese'' and ''Portuguese''.

{{For|a full list of Gladiators events around the world|Category:Gladiators (franchise)}}
{{Unreferenced|date=September 2017}}
'''''Gladiators''''' is a [[sports entertainment]] television show that was an international success during the 1990s and early 2000s with versions of the show being filmed for local broadcasters in the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], [[Sweden]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Denmark]]. However, [[Russia]], [[Germany]], and [[the Bahamas]] would also compete in international shows during the series, despite the fact that they did not have their own domestic series.

After a lengthy break, ''Gladiators'' was revived in 2008 in the UK, the US and [[Australia]]; in 2009 [[Lebanon]] created their own series featuring competitors from all over the [[Arab]] region and most recently [[Sweden]] has brought back their version which is proving most successful of all revivals, with a new revival in [[Finland]] is set for broadcast in 2017.

The concept of the show is that athletic members of the public battle against the show's own Gladiators (often semi-professional or ex-athletes) to claim points in several [[Gladiators events|events]] that require speed, strength and skill. In the final event of the show, "The Eliminator" the contenders race against each other (with starting times based on previous events), with the first to finish winning the episode and moving onto the next round.

A children's derivative of the concept was also made in the US, called ''[[Gladiators 2000]]'' (1994–1996). A UK variant of this was aired starting in 1995, called ''[[Gladiators: Train 2 Win]]''.

==History==

===1990s success===
The initial concept for the show by Dan Carr and John C. Ferraro was held in [[Erie, Pennsylvania|Erie]], [[Pennsylvania]], in the [[United States|USA]] before being sold to Samuel Goldwyn Productions/MGM where the format was adapted and televised as ''[[American Gladiators]]'' with the first series airing over 1989–90. As the show progressed, new events were introduced along with new Gladiators, sometimes retiring previous Gladiators.

Following the success of ''American Gladiators'', other countries began to produce their own versions of the show with the [[UK]] and [[Finland]] starting production in 1992. ''American Gladiators'' had already picked up a cult following in the UK after being shown on late night TV. The [[Gladiators (UK TV series)|UK]], most noticeably adapted the concept into a large arena (the [[National Indoor Arena]] in [[Birmingham]]), glamorising the show, often adapting events from the American series as well as introducing many of their own, often more high-tech. Winners from the UK and Finnish series would then go over to America, to film a special show of ''American Gladiators'' in which they competed against the current American champions along with selected athletes from other territories such as [[Japan]] and the [[Bahamas]] and [[South Korea]].

In early 1995, the first full scale international competition was launched in which selected Gladiators from the American, Finnish and British series competed against contender champions from those three countries. A fourth country, Russia was added but as they did not have their own domestic series, the Gladiators and contenders were hand-picked by Russian TV producers. The Finnish series ceased production after [[International Gladiators 1]].

In 1995, [[Gladiators (Australian TV series)|Australia]] began production of their own show, basing it on the UK series. After the first series, a three part 'Ashes' mini series was filmed in Australia, in which a selection of British and Australian Gladiators faced champions from the opposing countries. Australia then went on to compete in [[International Gladiators 2]] along with the UK and America. Russia also returned, even though they still did not have a domestic series. [[Germany]] and [[South Africa]] also competed even though they too did not have their own domestic series.

===Decline===
After [[International Gladiators 2]], the ''American Gladiators'' series ceased production due to falling ratings, although a live dinner show ran in Florida between 1996 and 1998. The UK and Australia continued to produce their own editions of the show, with the UK continuing to add new events to its roster (retiring some due to safety reasons) with Australia adding events from the UK series in its second and third series.

In 1996, the UK and Australia faced each other again in 'the Ashes 2' this time held in the UK Gladiator arena and an Australia vs. Russia mini series was filmed in Australia with two of the Russian Gladiators who had appeared in International Gladiators 2 appearing alongside new faces. After both of the mini series were filmed and aired, the Australian show was cancelled due to falling ratings, even though plans for a fourth series had commenced, which would include a brand new event that would be exclusive to Australia.

In 1997, South Africa competed against the UK in the Springbok Challenge held in the UK Gladiator arena, despite the fact that they did not have their own domestic series. Only one of the South African Gladiators who appeared in International Gladiators 2 appeared.

In 1999, it was announced that due to falling ratings, the UK series was to be axed. A final mini series in which past champions competed was filmed. It was at this time that South Africa finally began production of [[MTN Gladiators|their own series]] and in 2000, a team of UK Gladiators and contenders went over to film the Springbok Challenge 2, a series filmed exclusively for South African TV only.

===New millennium===
With the South African production in full swing, other territories began producing their own versions. [[Sweden]] began producing their own version in 2000 under the name "''Gladiatorerna''", with the old UK apparatus being shipped over. Short lived series in [[Nigeria]] (2002) and [[Denmark]] (2003) followed.

In 2001, the South African series was overhauled, but it proved unpopular with viewers and the show was axed. Sweden continued to produce ''Gladiators'', creating an event unique to the series, Spidercage, before being axed in 2004.

===The revival===
In August 2007, [[NBC]] confirmed that a revival of ''American Gladiators'' would be produced by [[Reveille Productions]] and [[MGM Television]] to air mid season during early 2008. In addition to events from the original show, the series drew elements from the 1990s UK series as well as being updated for the new millennium in which several events would be played over water. The UK also produced a revival of ''Gladiators''. In September 2007, the [[Seven Network]] in Australia announced that it too was reviving ''Gladiators'', although unlike the American revival, the Australian revival was to follow the lines of its predecessor rather than be overhauled.

The first episode of the new ''[[American Gladiators (2008 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' premiered on Sunday 6 January 2008 proving to be a ratings hit. A seconds season was instantly commissioned. At the same time, it was announced that [[Sky One]] were commissioning a [[Gladiators (revival UK TV series)|UK revival]] which would follow the basis set by the American revival.

The [[Gladiators (2008 Australian TV series)|Australian revival]] premiered on 30 March 2008 with the UK series starting on Sunday 11 May. Both revivals proved instant ratings hits for their respective channels. On 12 May 2008, the second season of the American show began, with the series being moved to a bigger arena.

Due to low ratings, the Seven Network placed filming for a second series on hold and released the Gladiators from their holding contracts. NBC similarly have yet to commission a third series due to ratings for the second series being lower than expected.

The [[Gladiators (revival UK TV series)|UK revival]] first aired in August 2008, a second series aired in January 2009. On 20 May 2009, the UK series was axed by the new controller for Sky 1, Stuart Murphy.

The Arab World launched its own version in 2009 featuring Contenders and Gladiators from all over the Arab region. It only lasted one season.

In 2012, the Swedish Gladiators, known as "Gladiatorerna", made a return to television and the revived show has proved very successful with 3 seasons so far filmed and screened, making it the most successful and longest lasting revival of the franchise. In July 2014, it was announced a 4th season would be made. This is due to be screened in early 2015.

In July 2014, Arthur A. Smith company announced plans to bring American Gladiators back again for the third time and were shopping the idea to networks to give it a home.

In August 2018, Actor [[Seth Rogen]] and Evan Goldberg announced plans to bring American Gladiators back again for the fourth time and are shopping the idea to distributors who are interested in the revival.

==Other Ventures==
===Broadband Website===
On January 28, 2008 a broadband website will pay homage to the original series called ''americangladiators.com'' where it features clip of the original which all have been re-digitalized as clips would reintroduce original Gladiators and give fans an update on where they are today. Future segments would also include "Best Hits" and stunts that were performed on the show.

===Tour===
In 2008, MGM, Reveille and Flor-Jon Films Inc. revealed a special ''American Gladiators'' U.S. cross-country tour.

===Cartoon===
MGM along with Johnny Ferraro have put into development a cartoon series based on the show but has never aired.

===Movie===
In 2009, Johnny Ferraro wanted to bring a live-action movie of ''American Gladiators''. Former Legendary Pictures chief marketing officer Scott Mednick was producing the film where the goal was to create an action story that takes place inside the world Ferraro created.

==Format==
In a standard Gladiators show, two female and two male contenders face each other and the Gladiators in anywhere from four to seven events. The line up of events differs across each show with different Gladiators playing the different events dependent on their skill type. Towards the end of the initial UK and American series, the male and female contenders did not necessarily play the same events. Contenders score points for winning against the Gladiators, with the winner having a time advantage in the last event the contenders compete in, the Eliminator.

The winner of the Eliminator goes through to the next round (or wins the series) unless a qualifying time is needed for the next round.

Shows are usually presented by a male and female host (with the exception of all but two seasons of the original American Gladiators, which were presented by two male hosts), as well as a main [[referee]] (often wearing a striped black and white shirt, in the style of an American football referee) presiding over events, handing out disqualifications or red and yellow cards to contenders or Gladiators if needed. A [[timekeeper]] is often present behind the referee but these are not always referred to or provide a speaking role. An unseen commentator will provide play by play accounts (again with the exception of the original American Gladiators series, where the on-screen hosts also provided the play by play)

The show is filmed in front of a live studio audience made up of fans and supporters of the contenders. It is not uncommon for the cameras to focus on particular crowd members or banners. Some incarnations of the show such as the Australian and original UK series have [[cheerleaders]] to provide background entertainment.

==Events==
There have been 35 events involving Gladiators (as well as the Eliminator) across the incarnations. Four of the events have an alternate name in certain territories. A different selection of the events will be played in each episode. No single territory has had all thirty five events on its roster. The UK had the biggest number of events during its initial run with twenty three events.

All events were created by either the American or UK series with the exception of "Soccer Shootout" (South Africa) and "Spidercage" (Sweden). The UK notably adapted some of the American events, with the adaptations becoming the standard design for the concept. For example, the UK version of "Skytrack" would later be adopted by the Australian and American revival series whereas the UK concept of the American event "Tug-o-War" known as "Tilt" eventually superseded Tug-o-War for the 2008 American revival.

Over the course of the original UK and American series, several events were dropped, often due to safety reasons. The Eliminator was the only event which was played in every episode across every territory.

==The Gladiators==
There have been more than 300 Gladiators across all participating territories. Inevitably, there has been some repeat usage of names, and there have been seven instances where the same name has been used twice in a territory for a televised series. The original American Gladiators had two different Gladiators named Lace, and the names Siren and Titan have been used in both the original and revival formats of the American show. The names Amazon, Panther, Siren and Warrior have been used for both the original and revived UK shows. The name Valkyria was used both in the original and revived series in Sweden. The names Panther, Ice, Scorpio, Lightning, Blade, Cyclone, Fierce/Hurja, Flash, Force, Shadow, Thunder, Viper, Nitro, Terminator, Cobra, Rebel, Hurricane, Laser, Phoenix, Destroyer, Rocket, Dynamite (as Miss Dynamite), Bullit as (Bullet) and Delta have been used for both male and female Gladiators.

Most Gladiators come from either a bodybuilding or athletic background. Seven Olympic athletes have competed as Gladiators: Amazon ([[Sharron Davies]]) (UK), Nightshade ([[Judy Simpson]]) (UK), Rebel ([[Jennifer Stoute]]) (UK), Olympia ([[Tatiana Grigorieva]]) (AUS Revival), Hurricane ([[Breaux Greer]]) (US Revival), Predator ([[Du'aine Ladejo]]) (UK Revival) and Battleaxe ([[Shirley Webb]]) (UK Revival).

There have been a few instances where contenders have become Gladiators. Minna Ryynänen, a quarter-finalist from the first series of Finnish Gladiators, returned as Gladiator Safiiri for the next series. UK season 3 and International Gladiators 1 champion Eunice Huthart became Gladiator Blaze. However, Eunice only competed as Blaze in non televised live shows, opting to perform as herself in future televised episodes. Australian series 2 champion and International Gladiators 2 runner up Lourene Bevaart became Glacier, American Gladiators 2008 series 1 champions Monica Carlson and Evan Dollard becoming Jet and Rocket respectively (this was actually mentioned as part of the "prize package" for this season) and after a seven-year gap, Gladiatorerna season 5 winner Patrick Lessa joined the Swedish team for the 2012 revival as Gladiator Baron Samedi.

Only two Gladiators have played for two different domestic series in differing countries; Vulcan ([[John Seru]]) who was originally an Australian Gladiator who transferred to the UK team for Season 7 upon the end of the Australian series and Fox (Tammy Baker) who transferred from the UK to the South African team when the UK series finished. Laser (Tina Andrew), a UK Gladiator went on to compete as Sheena, a member of a South African team for the Springbok Challenge 1. However, she did not compete in the domestic South African series.

Some Gladiators have died since their Gladiator careers ended, including Siren and Hawk from the original American Gladiators, Dynamite and Spartak from Russia, Zeke and Indra from Sweden, Sahara from South Africa, Ninja from Japan and Viking from Finland.

==Location==
[[File:Hampi 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Hampi is set in a rocky terrain. Above: one of the many Vijayanagara market ruins, with Tungabhadra River in the background]]

Hampi is situated on the banks of the [[Tungabhadra River]] in the eastern part of central Karnataka near the state border with [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is {{convert|376|km}} from [[Bangalore]], {{convert|385|km}} from [[Hyderabad]] and {{convert|266|km}} from [[Belgaum]]. The closest railway station is in [[Hosapete]] (Hospet), {{convert|13|km|miles}} away. During the winter, overnight buses and trains connect Hampi with [[Goa]], [[Secunderabad]] and Bangalore.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=154–155}} It is {{convert|140|km}} southeast of the [[Badami cave temples|Badami]] and [[Aihole]] archaeological sites.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=154–155}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=85–87}}

==Texts and history==
The toponym ''Hampi''—traditionally known as ''Pampa-kshetra'', ''Kishkindha-kshetra'' or ''Bhaskara-kshetra''—is derived from Pampa, another name of goddess [[ in Hindu theology. According to mythology, the maiden Parvati resolves to marry the loner ascetic [[Shiva]].{{sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|pp=503–505}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=46–52, 42–44}} Her parents learn of her desire and discourage her, but she pursues her desire. Shiva is lost in yogic meditation, oblivious to the world; Parvati appeals to the gods for help to awaken him and gain his attention. Indra sends the god [[Kamadeva|Kama]]—the Hindu god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection—to awake Shiva from meditation. Kama reaches Shiva and shoots an arrow of desire.{{sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|pp=503–505}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=46–52, 42–44}} Shiva opens his third eye in his forehead and burns Kama to ashes. Parvati does not lose her hope or her resolve to win over Shiva; she begins to live like him and engage in the same activities—asceticism, [[yogi]]n and [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapasya]]—awakening him and attracting his interest. Shiva meets Parvati in disguised form and tries to discourage her, telling her Shiva's weaknesses and personality problems.{{sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|pp=503–505}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=46–52, 42–44}} Parvati refuses to listen and insists in her resolve. Shiva finally accepts her and they get married.{{sfn|James Lochtefeld|2002|pp=503–505}}{{sfn|David Kinsley|1988|pp=46–52, 42–44}} According to ''[[Sthala Purana]]'', Parvati (Pampa) pursued her ascetic, yogini lifestyle on Hemakuta Hill, now a part of Hampi, to win and bring ascetic Shiva back into householder life.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=14–15}} Shiva is also called Pampapati (lit. "husband of Pampa").{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=14–15}} The river near the Hemakuta Hill came to be known as Pampa river.&lt;ref name="Verghese2002p6"&gt;{{harvnb|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=6–7, 40, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word Pampa morphed into the [[Kannada]] word Hampa and the place Parvati pursued Shiva came to be known as Hampe or Hampi.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=14–15}}&lt;ref name="Verghese2002p6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASI&gt;{{cite book|author=D. Devakunjari|title=World Heritage Series: Hampi|publisher=Eicher Goodearth Ltd, New Delhi – for [[Archaeological Survey of India]]|ISBN=81-87780-42-8|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was an early medieval era pilgrimage place known as Pampakshetra. Its fame came from the [[Kishkindha]] chapters of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'', where [[Rama]] and [[Lakshmana]] meet [[Hanuman]], [[Sugriva]] and the monkey army in their search for kidnapped [[Sita]]. The Hampi area has many close resemblances to the place described in the epic. The regional tradition believes that it is that place mentioned in the Ramayana, attracting pilgrims.&lt;ref name="KaminskyLong2016p75"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold P. Kaminsky|author2=Roger D.

The Vijayanagara Empire built its capital around Hampi, calling it Vijayanagara. They expanded the infrastructure and temples. According to Nicholas Gier and other scholars,&lt;ref name="Howard2011p77"/&gt; by 1500 CE Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably India's richest.

They invested in roads, waterworks, agriculture, religious buildings and public infrastructure.

According to historical memoirs left by Portuguese and Persian traders to Hampi, the city was of metropolitan proportions; they called it "one of the most beautiful cities". While prosperous and in infrastructure, the Muslim-Hindu wars between Muslim Sultanates and Vijayanagara Empire continued.

===Archaeological site===
Hampi and its nearby region remained a contested and fought-over region claimed by the local chiefs, the Hyderabad Muslim [[nizam]]s, the Maratha Hindu kings, and Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan of Mysore through the 18th century.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=51}} In 1799, Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed when the British forces and [[Wadiyar dynasty]] aligned. The region then came under British influence.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=51}} The ruins of Hampi were surveyed in 1800 by Scottish Colonel [[Colin Mackenzie]], first [[Surveyor General of India]]. Mackenzie wrote that the Hampi site was abandoned and only wildlife live there. The 19th-century speculative articles by historians who followed Mackenzie blamed the 18th-century armies of Haidar Ali and the Marathas for the damage to the Hampi monuments.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=51}}

The Hampi site remained largely ignored until the mid-19th century, when [[Alexander Greenlaw]] visited and photographed the site in 1856.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=50–51}} He created an archive of 60 [[calotype]] photographs of temples and royal structures that were standing in 1856. These photographs were held in a private collection in the United Kingdom and were not published until 1980.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=50–51}} They are the most valuable source of the mid-19th-century state of Hampi monuments to scholars.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=50–51}}

A translation of the memoirs of [[Abdul Razzaq]], a Persian envoy in the court of Devaraya II (1424–1446), published in the early 1880s described some monuments of the abandoned site. This translation, for the first time, uses Arabic terms such as "zenana" to describe some of the Hampi monuments.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=52–53}} Some of these terms became the names thereafter. Alexander Rea, an officer of the Archaeological Survey department of the [[Madras Presidency]] within British India, published his survey of the site in 1885.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=52–53}} [[Robert Sewell (historian)|Robert Sewell]] published his scholarly treatise ''A Forgotten Empire''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sewell, [https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.77323/2015.77323.Forgotton-Empire#page/n9/mode/2up The Forgotton Empire], George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1924 Reprint (Orig year: 1900)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1900, bringing Hampi to the widespread attention of scholars.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=52–53}} The growing interest led Rea and his successor Longhurst to clear and repair the Hampi group of monuments.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=52–53}}

Hampi is located in hilly terrain formed by granite boulders {{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=13–14}} The Hampi monuments comprising the UNESCO world heritage site are a subset of the wider-spread Vijayanagara ruins. Almost all of the monuments were built between 1336 and 1570 CE during the Vijayanagara rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_hampi.asp Hampi], Archaeological Survey of India&lt;/ref&gt; The site has about 1,600 monuments and covers {{convert|41.5|sqkm|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name=unescosum/&gt;

The Hampi site has been studied in three broad zones; the first has been named the "sacred centre" by scholars such as Burton Stein and othersl;&lt;ref name="Stein1989p31"/&gt; the second is referred to as the "urban core" or the "royal centre"; and the third constitutes the rest of metropolitan Vijayanagara. The sacred centre, alongside the river, contains the oldest temples with a history of pilgrimage and monuments pre-dating the Vijayanagara empire.&lt;ref name="Stein1989p39"/&gt; The urban core and royal centre have over sixty ruined temples beyond those in the sacred centre, but the temples in the urban core are all dated to the Vijayanagara empire. The urban core also includes public utility infrastructure such as roads, an aqueduct, water tanks, mandapa, gateways and markets, monasteries{{refn|group=note|According to Anila Verghese and Dieter Eigner, literary and epigraphical data evidence the existence of Advaita-Smarta ''[[matha]]s'' (monasteries), as well as Shaiva and Vaishnava monasteries – both Sri Vaishnavism and Dvaita Vaishnavism ''mathas''.

Most of the monuments are Hindu; the temples and the public infrastructure such as tanks and markets include reliefs and artwork depicting Hindu deities and themes from Hindu texts.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=20–22}} There are also six Jain temples and monuments and a Muslim mosque and tomb.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=20–22}} The architecture is built from the abundant local stone; the dominant style is [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian]], with roots in the developments in Hindu arts and architecture in the second half of the 1st millennium in the Deccan region.{{sfn|Michael W.

====Virupaksha temple and market complex====
The Virupaksha temple is the oldest shrine, the principal destination for pilgrims and tourists, and remains an active Hindu worship site.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=58–65}} Parts of the Shiva, Pampa and Durga temples existed in the 11th-century; it was extended during the Vijayanagara era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Geographic|title=Sacred Places of a Lifetime: 500 of the World's Most Peaceful and Powerful Destinations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNqDFSxR8-MC&amp;pg=PA123|year=2008|publisher=National Geographic Society|isbn=978-1-4262-0336-7|pages=123–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The temple is a collection of smaller temples, a regularly repainted, {{convert|50|m|adj=on}} high [[gopuram]], a Hindu monastery dedicated to [[Vidyaranya]] of [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition, a water tank (''Manmatha''), a community kitchen, other monuments and a {{convert|750|m}}-long ruined stone market with a monolithic Nandi shrine on the east end.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=58–65}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=38–42}}{{sfn|Michael W.

The temple faces eastwards, aligning the sanctums of the Shiva and Pampa Devi temples to the sunrise; a large gopuram marks its entrance. The superstructure is a pyramidal tower with pilastered storeys on each of which is artwork including erotic sculptures.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=58–65, 155}} The gopuram leads into a rectangular court that ends in another, smaller gopuram dated to 1510 CE. To its south side is a 100-column hall with Hindu-related reliefs on all four sides of each pillar.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=60–63}} Connected to this public hall is a community kitchen, a feature found in other major Hampi temples. A channel is cut into the rock to deliver water to the kitchen and the feeding hall.

The sanctum of the temple has a ''[[mukha-linga]]''; a Shiva [[linga]] with a face embossed with brass.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=64}} The Virupaksha temple also has smaller shrines for two aspects of Parvati-Pampa and Bhuvaneshwari to the north of the main sanctum.{{sfn|George Michell|1977|pp=150–151}} The compound has a northern gopura, smaller than the eastern gopura, that opens to the Manmatha tank and a pathway to the river with stone reliefs related to the ''Ramayana''.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=62–66}} To the west of this tank are shrines of Shaktism and Vaishnavism traditions, such as those for Durga and Vishnu respectively.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=62–66}}{{sfn|Adam Hardy|1995|pp=130–131, 330}} Some of the shrines on this pilgrim's path were whitewashed in the 19th century under orders of the British India officer F.W.

According to local tradition, the Virupaksha is the only temple that continued to be a gathering place of Hindus and frequented by pilgrims after the destruction of Hampi in 1565. The temple attracts large crowds; an annual [[fête]] with a chariot procession to mark the marriage of Virupaksha and Pampa is held in spring, as is the solemn festival of [[Maha Shivaratri]].{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=58–65, 155}}

To the north of this road and middle of the market is a large Pushkarani—a public utility-stepped water tank with an artistic pavilion in its centre. Next to the tank is a public hall (mandapa) for people to sit.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=70–72}}

The temple opens to the east; it has a gateway with reliefs of all ten avatars of [[Vishnu]] starting with [[Matsya]] at the bottom. Inside is the ruined temple for Krishna and small, ruined shrines for goddesses.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=70–72}} The temple compound is layered into mandapas, including an outer and an inner enclosure. The compound has two gopuram entrances. Inside, a 25 (5x5)-bay open mandapa leads to a 9 (3x3)-bay enclosed mandapa.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=70–71}} The original image of Balakrishna (baby Krishna) in its sanctum is now in a Chennai museum. A modern road passes in front of the eastern gopura, linking Kamalapuram to Hampi. The western gopuram has friezes of battle formation and soldiers.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=70–72}}

South of the Krishna temple's exterior are two adjacent shrines, one containing the largest monolithic Shiva Linga and the other with the largest monolithic Yoga-[[Narasimha]] avatar of [[Vishnu]] in Hampi.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=70–72}} The {{convert|3|m}} Shiva Linga stands in water in a cubical chamber and has three eyes sketched on its top. South of this is the shrine for a {{convert|6.7|m}}-high Narasimha—the man-lion avatar of Vishnu—seated in a yoga position. The Narasimha monolith originally had goddess Lakshmi with him, but it shows signs of extensive damage and a carbon-stained floor—evidence of attempts to burn the shrine down. The statue has been cleaned and parts of the shrine have been restored.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=70–72}}

====Achyutaraya temple and market complex====
The Achyutaraya temple, also called the Tiruvengalanatha temple, is about {{convert|1|km|miles}} east of Virupaksha temple and a part of its sacred centre is close to the Tungabhadra River. It is referred to be in Achyutapura in inscriptions and is dated to 1534 CE. It is one of the four largest complexes in Hampi.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=47–48}} The temple is unusual because it faced north. It is dedicated to Vishnu.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=105–107}} In Vijayanagara times, the temple was traditionally approached from the river, first past a ceremonial tank then along the market street with a broad road. The temple had an outer gopuram leading into a courtyard with a 100-column hall and an inner gopuram leading to the Vishnu temple.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=105–107}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S.

====Vitthala temple and market complex====
[[File:15th-16th century ruins of market and Vaishnavism Vitthala temple, Hampi Hindu monuments Karnataka.jpg|thumb|left|Vitthala temple gopuram and market.]]

The [[Vithoba|Vitthala]] temple and market complex is over {{convert|3|km|miles}} north-east of the Virupaksha temple near the banks of the Tungabhadra River. It is the most artistically sophisticated Hindu temple in Hampi, and is part of the sacred centre of Vijayanagara. It is unclear when the temple complex was built, and who built it; most scholars date it to a period of construction in the early-to-mid-16th century.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=98–103}} The inscriptions include male and female names, suggesting that the complex was built by multiple sponsors. The temple was dedicated to [[Vitthala]], a form of Krishna also called Vithoba.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=98–103}} The temple opens to the east, has a square plan and features an entrance gopuram with two side gopurams. The main temple stands in the middle of a paved courtyard and several subsidiary shrines, all aligned to the east.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=98–103}}

[[File:Vittala temple complex Rath MS.jpg|thumb|The Garuda shrine in the form of stone chariot at Vitthala temple.]]
The Vitthala temple has a ''Garuda shrine'' in the form of a stone chariot in the courtyard; it is an often-pictured symbol of Hampi. Above the chariot is a tower, which was removed during the late 19th-century restorations. In the front of the stone chariot is a large, square, open-pillared, axial ''sabha mandapa'', or community hall.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=98–103}} The mandapa has four sections, two of which are aligned with the temple sanctum. The mandapa has 56 carved stone beams of different diameters, shape, length and surface finish that produces musical sounds when struck; according to local traditional belief, this hall was used for public celebrations of music and dancing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Patil | first=Hemant A. | last2=Gajbhar | first2=Shrishail S. | title=Acoustical analysis of musical pillar of great stage of Vitthala temple at Hampi, India | publisher=IEEE | journal= Signal Processing and Communications| year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4673-2014-6 | doi=10.1109/spcom.2012.6290213 | pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kumar | first=Anish | last2=Jayakumar | first2=T. | last3=Rao et al | first3=C.

The mandapa links to an enclosed ''pradakshina patha'' for walking around the sanctum. Around this axial mandapa are (clockwise from east); the Garuda shrine, the Kalyana mandapa (wedding ceremonies), the 100-columned mandapa, the Amman shrine and the Utsav mandapa (festival hall). The walled enclosure covers aboput {{convert|1.3|ha|acres}} with colonnaded verandahs lining the compound walls. In the south-east corner is a kitchen with a roof window ([[clerestory]]).{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=98–103}}&lt;ref name=dieter127/&gt;&lt;ref name=mack24&gt;{{cite journal|author= Alexandra Mack| title= The temple district of Vitthalapura| journal= Marg: a magazine of the Arts| year= 2001| volume = 53| issue = 1| pages=24–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the temple compound, to its east-south-east, is a colonnaded market street almost {{convert|1|km|miles|spell=in}} long; all of which is now in ruins. To the north is another market and a south-facing shrine with reliefs of Ramayana scenes, Mahabharata scenes and of Vaishnava saints. The north street ended in a temple honouring the Hindu philosopher [[Ramanuja]].{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=98–103}}&lt;ref name=Dallapiccola109/&gt; The region around the Vitthala temple was called Vitthalapura. It hosted a Vaishnava [[matha]] (monastery), designed as a pilgrimage centre centred around the [[Alvar]] tradition. It was also a centre for craft production according to inscriptions found.&lt;ref name=dieter127/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dallapiccola109/&gt;&lt;ref name=mack24/&gt;

====Hemakuta hill monuments====
The Hemakuta hill lies between the Virupaksha temple complex to the north and the Krishna temple to the south. It is a collection of modestly sized monuments that are the best-preserved examples of pre-Vijayanagara and early-Vijayanagara temples and construction. The site has several important inscriptions, is easily accessible and provides views of the some parts of Hampi and the fertile, agricultural valley that separates the sacred centre from the urban core with its royal centre.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=66–69}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=37–39}}

[[File:Temples on the Hemakuta Hill.jpg|thumb|Hemakuta hill temples]]

The hill has more than thirty small-to-moderate-sized temples, together with water cisterns, gateways and secular pavilions.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=37–39}} They latest examples are dated to the early 14th century.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=37–39}}{{sfn|George Michell|1995|pp=28–29}} Some of the structures are differently-sized prototypes of temples or mandapas, assembled from blocks of stones. Others are completed monuments of different designs, such as the ''Phamsana'' style.{{sfn|Vinayak Bharne|Krupali Krusche|2014|pp=72–74}} Two temple groups in this style look similar; each has a triple vimana consisting of square sanctums with each set connected to its own shared square mandapa.{{sfn|George Michell|1995|pp=28–29}} The towers (shikaras) on these are pyramidal granite structures consisting of eleven stacked, shrinking squares and a top in the Deccan-style square kalasha finial.{{sfn|George Michell|1995|pp=28–29}} Both sets are Shiva temples with triple linga; early sources misidentified these as Jain temples because of their simple exterior and interior walls. One of these groups has a historically important inscription that records that [[Kampila]] built the monument in the early 14th century. This inscription links Hampi with the [[Kampili kingdom]] and suggests an association of the Kampili history with that of Vijayanagara Empire that followed it.{{sfn|George Michell|1995|pp=28–29}} The style of temples on the Hemakuta hill suggest it may have been a study centre for experimenting with different types of Hindu temples. The styles present include those of the Chalukya period, the Rashtrakuta period and later periods. It may also have been the template for the original Virupaksha temple, which was later greatly expanded with gopuram, mandala and other additions. A similar monument  dedicated to Narasimha, the man-lion avatar of Vishnu, is located east of Hampi; an inscription near it states that it was operating in 1379 CE.{{sfn|George Michell|1995|pp=28–29}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=37–39}}

The Hemakuta hill also has monuments with two monolithic [[Ganesha]]; the Kadalekalu Ganesha and the Sasivekalu Ganesha.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=68–69}} The Kadalekalu Ganesha, named after Ganesha's ''gram''-shaped belly, is  in the middle of Hampi's sacred centre on the east side of the hill near Matanga.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=27, 36–37}} A colonnaded, open mandapa leads to the sanctum, which houses a monolithic image of Ganesha more than {{convert|4.5|m}} high, which was carved ''in-situ'' from extant rock. Ganesha's tusk and other parts have been damaged, but the left hand—which holds a rice cake treat with his trunk reaching out for it—has survived.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=66–69}}

The Sasivekalu Ganesha, named after Ganesha's mustard seed-shaped belly, is near the Krishna temple south-west of the Kadalekalu Ganesha. It is a {{convert|2.4|m|ft}}-high monolith that was also carved ''in-situ'' from extant rock. The Sasivekalu Ganesha is carved with his mother Parvati, in whose lap he sits. She is only visible from the back of the statue. The monument is housed inside an open-pillared mandapa; the left hand and tusk have been damaged.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=68–69}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=36–37}}

The Hazara Rama temple, referred to as the Ramachandra temple in inscriptions, occupied the western part of the urban core in the royal centre section of Hampi. This temple was dedicated to Rama of the ''Ramayana'' fame, and an avatar of Vishnu. It was the ceremonial temple for the royal family. The temple is dated to the early 15th century and is attributed to [[Deva Raya|Devaraya I]].{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=84–86}} The temple's outer walls portray the Hindu Mahanavami ([[Vijayadashami|Dasara]]) and the spring [[Holi]] festival procession and celebrations in parallel bands of artwork.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=84–86}} The lowest band shows marching elephants, above it are horses led by horsemen, then soldiers celebrated by the public, then dancers and musicians, with a top layer depicting a boisterous procession of the general public. The depiction mirrors the description of festivals and processions in surviving memoirs of Persians and Portuguese who visited the Vijayanagara capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna Libera Dallapiccola|title=The Ramachandra Temple at Vijayanagara|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RS4ASa7WCfMC|year=1992|publisher=American Institute of Indian Studies|isbn=978-81-85425-27-6|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna L Dallapiccola|editor=DV Devaraj, CS Patil|title=Vijayanagara, Progress of Research|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fStuAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Directorate of Archaeology &amp; Museums|pages=128–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner walls of the temple has friezes containing the most extensive narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]''.&lt;ref name=roger273/&gt;{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=84–86}} The temple has an entrance mandapa and a [[yajna]] ceremony hall, whose ceiling is designed to ventilate fumes and smoke through the roof. Inside the main mandapa are four intricately carved pillars in the Hoysala style; these carving include depictions of Rama, Lakshmana and Sita of [[Vaishnavism]], Durga as Mahishasuramardini of [[Shaktism]] and Shiva-Parvati of [[Shaivism]].{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=84–86}} Images are missing from the square sanctum.

====Kodandarama temple and riverside monuments====
The Kodandarama temple complex lies near the Tungabhadra River, and is north of Achyutaraya temple. The temple overlooks [[Chakratirtha]], where the Tungabhadra turns northwards towards the Himalayas. The river banks, considered holy, accommodate a Vijayanagara-era ghat and mandapa facilities for bathing. In front of the temple is a ''dipa stambha'' (lighting pillar) under a Pipal tree, and inside is a sanctum dedicated to Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=108–109}} Nearby, and continuing until Kotitirtha to its north, are a number of smaller shrines, dedicated to Vitthala, Anjaneya, Shiva linga and other deities. On the rock face are reliefs of Anantashayana Vishnu (reclining Vishnu creating the cosmic cycle, Ranganatha), friezes narrating the legends of Narasimha and Prahlada, and the twenty-four avatars of Vishnu according to the Puranic tradition of Vaishnavism. Near the river is a rock carved with Shaivism's 1,008 lingas.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=108–109}}

[[File:Pattabhirama temple in Hampi 1.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Pattabhirama temple in Hampi suburbs]]

====Pattabhirama temple complex====
The Pattabhirama temple complex is in the southern suburban centre outside the sacred centre and the urban core, about {{convert|500|m|yards}} from the ASI Hampi museum.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=93–94}} It was at the nucleus of economic and cultural activity of this suburb, now located north-east of Kamalapura. The complex, also known as Varadevi Ammana Pattana, was likely built in the early 16th century and dedicated to Rama (Vishnu avatar).{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=93–94}} The complex has a main temple, a colonnaded courtyard inside an enclosure and a 64 (8x8 square)-pillared and roofed mandapa in front of the sanctum. The complex and the sanctum face east; the normal entrance was through the eastern gopura.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=93–94}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=73–74}} The ruins suggest the gopuram had six tiers. The Pattabhirama temple included a 100-pillared hall—likely a feeding hall—attached to the southern wall of the enclosed compound. The pillars have reliefs depicting Hindu themes which include gods, goddesses, a scene from a Hindu text, yoga and namaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. M.

====Mahanavami platform, public square complex====
The Mahanavami platform, also called the "Great Platform", "Audience Hall", "Dasara" or "Mahanavami Dibba" monument, is within a {{convert|7.5|ha|acres|adj=on}} enclosure at one of the highest points inside the royal centre (urban core). It has ceremonial structures.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=88–89}}&lt;ref name="Dallapiccola1998p27"/&gt; It is mentioned in the memoirs of foreigners who visited Vijayanagara, some calling it the "House of Victory".{{refn|The memoirs of the Portuguese who visited and traded with Vijayanagara mention it.&lt;ref name=fritz44/&gt;}} The largest monument in this complex has three ascending square stages leading to a large, square platform that likely had a wooden mandapa above it.

Archaeological excavations in 1990 revealed twenty-three wells and cisterns in the Hampi-Vijayanagara metropolis. Of these, thirteen were found outside the city walls in the suburbs, and ten inside. Of these were twelve at roadsides, eight near temples, ten in residential areas and two were used for irrigation within the urban core. More water structures were found in Daroji valley for agriculture. According to archaeologists Kathleen Morrison and Carla Sinopoli, the Hampi water infrastructure was for the use of travellers, rituals, domestic use and irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Morrison Carla Sinopoli (1991), ''Archaeological Survey in the Vijayangara Metropolitan Region: 1990'', in Vijayanagara: Progress of Research, Editors: DV Devaraj, CS Patil, pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major temples in Hampi have an embedded kitchen and 100-or-more-pillared feeding halls.&lt;ref name=Dallapiccola109/&gt;&lt;ref name=mack59/&gt; Hampi also had a dedicated public ''Bhojana shala'' (house of food) where numerous ''thali'' (dish) were carved in series in a rock on both sides of a water channel. One example is found near an octagonal fountain in the south of the royal centre;{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=74}} according to epigraphical sources, this Hampi ''bhojan shala'' was a ''utada kaluve'' or "canal connected with eating".{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|p=30}}

In the east of the royal centre lies the Gajashala, or elephant stables, which consist of eleven square chambers aligned north-south. The openings to the stables are arched; above ten chambers are alternating fluted and plain domes. In the middle of the stables are stairs to reach the roof.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=82–83}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=70–72}}

{{double image|right|Lotus Mahal Pavilion MS.jpg|180|Elephants stables.jpg|180|Lotus Mahal (left) and elephant stables: syncretic style monuments.}}

The Zenana enclosure is close to the elephant stables; it was thus named in a Persian memoir whose 19th-century translation was an early introduction to Hampi ruins for many.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=52–53}} The name "Zenana" is a misnomer, states George Michell, because it gives the impression that the women of Vijayanagar royalty lived here; its design and location makes that highly unlikely.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=77–78}} The Zenana enclosure contains the Lotus Mahal, the latter being a two-storeyed pavilion in the royal centre.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=77–81}} The Lotus Mahal combines a symmetrical, square, Hindu mandala design with lobed arches, vaults and domes of the Indo-Islamic style. Its basement and pyramidal towers are based on Hindu temple architecture.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=77–81}} Like almost all of the structures in Hampi's royal centre, this monument has no inscriptions nor epigraphs mentioning it and therefore dating it and establishing its function with evidence has been difficult. The Lotus Mahal and other structures in the Hampi urban core, however, were not built with Muslim patronage, unlike the tombs in the various Muslim quarters of the city. These buildings reflect the assimilative approach of the Vijayanagara Hindu rulers. Lotus Mahal looks like a syncretic, congested space and its purpose is unclear. Speculations include it being a council hall.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=77–81}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=68–70}}

====Other Hindu temples and monuments====

In the sacred centre near the southern banks of the Tungabhadra River and close to the Vitthala temple complex, are gateways and a monument now called the King's Balance.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|p=49}}{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=102–103}} The latter is similar to those found at the entrances of South Indian Hindu temples for the ''tula-purush-[[dāna]]'' or ''thulabharam'' ceremonies in which a person gives a gift by weight equal to, or greater than, their body weight.{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|p=49}}{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|pp=102–103}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rao | first=Nalini | title=Royal religious beneficence in pre-modern India: social and political implications | journal=International Journal of Dharma Studies | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=4 | issue=1 | date=2016-07-19 | doi=10.1186/s40613-016-0030-z | pages=7–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vijayanagara rulers built forts, fortified gateways and watchtowers after their dynasty was founded from the ruins of a war and for security from repeated raids and invasion. Hindu-style corbelled arches are the most common gateways and watchtowers in Hampi.{{refn|group=note|The Hampi builders also included Islamic style arches in fortified gateways at some places.}} One such gateway is located south-east of Ganagitti Jain temple;{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=95}} it incorporate a central barbican wall designed to entrap and confuse a stranger aiming for a surprise, while frequent visitors knew the three changes of direction before the gateway. These functional Hindu monuments are identifiable by a legendary Hindu character incorporated into them, such as of Bhima of the Mahabharata's Pandava fame. Another such gate is found on the north-east road to Talarighat Hindu monument and the Vitthala temple.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=95}}{{sfn|Anila Verghese|2002|pp=57–58}}

The Hampi site has over 1,600 surviving ruins—mostly Hindu—spread over a wide area.&lt;ref name=unescosum/&gt; Other significant monuments include a temple near the octagonal bath for [[Saraswati]], a Hindu goddess of knowledge and music; a temple in the suburbs for Ananthasayana Vishnu; an Uddana Virbhadra temple for Shiva and Vishnu; a shrine for Kali, the fierce form of Durga unusually shown holding a ball of rice and a ladle;{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=73}} an underground temple in the royal centre; a Sugriva cave temple;{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=104}} the Matanga hill monuments; the Purandaradasa temple dedicated to the scholar musician famed for the [[Indian classical music#Carnatic music|Carnatic music]] tradition; the Chandrashekhara temple for Shiva near the Queen's bath monument; and the Malyavanta hill dedicated to Rama-Sita-Lakshmana and Shiva. The Malyavanta hill features several shrines including the Raghunatha temple and a row of Shiva lingas carved in stone.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=96}}

===Jain monuments===
Reliefs of [[Jain]] temples at Hampi includes [[Hemkut Jain temples]], Ratnantraykut, Parsvanath Charan and Ganagitti Jain temples. Most of the idols are now missing from these temples, which were built in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaindharmonline.com/pilgri/hampi.htm Jain: Hampi]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ganagitti temple complex====
[[File:GANIGITTI TEMPLE-Dr. Murali Mohan Gurram (1).jpg|thumb|Ganagitti Jain temple]]

The Ganigitti Jain temple is near Bhima's gate in the south-east of the urban core section of Hampi. In front of it is a monolithic lamp pillar.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=95}} The temple faced north; it is dated to 1385 CE, during the rule of Hindu king Harihara II, based on an inscription in the temple.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=95}} It is dedicated to Tirthankara [[Kunthunatha]] and has plain walls, a pillared mandapa and a square sanctum from which the Jina's statue is missing. There are capitals on the pillars and the doorways have decoration. Over the sanctum is a Dravidian-style, narrowing square, pyramidal tower. Other monuments in the temple compound are in ruins.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=95}}

====Other Jain temples and monuments====
A cluster of Jain and Hindu temples are co-located about {{convert|150|meters|yards}} east of the elephant stables. One north-facing temple is dedicated to [[Parshvanatha]] Tirthankara. It was built by King Devaraya II and dates to 1426 CE, per an inscription in the temple. In front of the temple are two ruined temples; one of Shiva and the other dedicated to [[Mahavira]].{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=83}} Jain Tirthankaras are also included in reliefs inside Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dallapiccola | first=A.L. | title=Ceiling Paintings in the Virupaksha Temple, Hampi | journal=South Asian Studies | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=13 | issue=1 | year=1997 | issn=0266-6030 | doi=10.1080/02666030.1997.9628525 | pages=55–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smith | first=Alan | title=Rock-cut Features at Vijayanagara | journal=South Asian Studies | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=15 | issue=1 | year=1999 | doi=10.1080/02666030.1999.9628564 | pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

===Muslim monuments===
[[File:Tomb enroute to Hampi.JPG|thumb|Ahmad Khan tomb in Hampi]]
The Hampi site includes a Muslim quarter with Islamic tombs, two mosques and a cemetery. These are neither in the sacred centre nor in the royal centre of the Hampi site. Some Muslim monuments are a part of the urban core while others are in the suburbs where most Vijayanagara residents lived. These are in the north-east valley of the urban core, where settlements of Hindus and Jains are also found. Much of this region is deeply silted and the soil conceals abandoned temples, roads, water tanks, gateways and residential quarters.&lt;ref name="Vatsyayan1991p198"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Fritz|author2=George Michell|editor=Kapila Vatsyayan|title=Concepts of Space, Ancient and Modern|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1a7XZdH1V0C&amp;pg=PA198 |year=1991|publisher=Abhinav |isbn=978-81-7017-252-9|pages=198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=97}}

====Ahmad Khan mosque and tomb ====
There is a Muslim monument in the south-east of the urban core on the road from Kamalapura to Anegondi, before Turuttu canal in the irrigated valley. This monument was first built in 1439 by Ahmad Khan, a Muslim officer in the army of Hindu king Devaraya II. The monuments include a mosque, an octagonal well and a tomb. The mosque lacks a dome and is a pillared pavilion, while the tomb has a dome and arches.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=97}} Other Muslim monuments and a graveyard were added later near the Ahmad Khan's legacy.{{sfn|Fritz|Michell|2016|p=97}}

In the memoirs of [[Niccolò de' Conti]], an Italian merchant and traveller who visited Hampi about 1420, the city had an estimated circumference of {{convert|60|miles|km}} and it enclosed agriculture and settlements in its fortifications. In 1442, [[Abd-al-Razzāq Samarqandī|Abdul Razzaq]], who visited from Persia, described it as a city with seven layers of forts, with outer layers for agriculture, crafts and residence, the inner third to seventh layers very crowded with shops and bazaars (markets).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carla M. Sinopoli|title=The Political Economy of Craft Production: Crafting Empire in South India, c.1350–1650|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3nHg-eKWuIC&amp;pg=PA146|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-44074-5|pages=146–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1520, [[Domingo Paes]], a Portuguese traveller, visited Vijayanagara as a part of trade contingent from Portuguese Goa. He wrote his memoir as ''Chronica dos reis de Bisnaga'', in which he stated Vijayanagara was "as large as Rome, and very beautiful to the sight&amp;nbsp;... the best provided city in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold P.

[[Cesare Federici]], an Italian merchant and traveller, visited a few decades after the 1565 defeat and collapse of the Vijayanagara Empire. According to Sinopoli, Johansen and Morrison, Federici described it as a very different city. He wrote, "the citie of Bezeneger (Hampi-Vijayanagara) is not altogether destroyed, yet the houses stand still, but emptie, and there is dwelling in them nothing, as is reported, but Tygres and other wild beasts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carla Sinopoli|author2=Peter Johansen|author3=Kathleen Morrison|editor=Steven E.

The historian [[Will Durant]], in his ''Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization'' recites the story of Vijayanagara and calls its conquest and destruction a discouraging tale. He writes, "its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace" may at any time be overthrown by war and ferocious violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Will Durant|authorlink=Will Durant|title=Our Oriental Heritage: The Story of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ru4LPyMAxxkC&amp;pg=PT579 |year=2011| publisher=Simon and Schuster| isbn=978-1-4516-4668-9| page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|[[Hampi (town)|Hampi]]'s history, ruins and temples made it an early site for offbeat tourism in the 1960s and after.

The '''Hamshahri Corpus''' ({{lang-fa|'''پیکره همشهری'''}}) is a sizable [[Persian language|Persian]] corpus based on the Iranian newspaper ''[[Hamshahri]]'', one of the first online [[Persian language|Persian]] newspapers in Iran. It was in initially collected and compiled by Ehsan Darrudi at DBRG Group&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/ DBRG News] Database Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; of [[University of Tehran]]. Later a team headed by Ale Ahmad &lt;ref name=ham&gt;[http://dbrg.ut.ac.ir/hamshahri/ Hamshahri] Database Research Group&lt;/ref&gt; built on this corpus and created the first Persian Text Collection suitable for information retrieval evaluation tasks.

This corpus was created by crawling the online news articles from the [[Hamshahri]]'s website and processing the HTML pages to create a standard text corpus for modern [[Information Retrieval]] experiments.

== Version 1.0 ==
The collection contains more than 160,000 articles covering the following subject categories: politics, city news, economics, reports, editorials, literature, sciences, Society, foreign news, sports, etc. The size of the documents varies from short news (under 1 KB) to rather long articles (e.g. 140 KB) with the average of 1.8 KB. 

The corpus is available in several formats for download:&lt;ref name=ham/&gt;
* Tagged Text: 560 MB
* In SQL Server 2000 Tables: 712 MB

== Version 2.0 ==
The second release of Hamshahri Corpus was launched on 20 October 2008. It offers several new features and improvements:
* '''More News:''' 323,616 Text Stories in 3206 XML files (a file for each day)
* '''Increased Time Span:''' From 22 June 1996 to 13 May 2007
* '''Bigger in Size:''' 1.42 GB uncompressed
* '''Standard Container:''' Unicode XML
* '''Included Images:''' images have been extracted from the news and preserved (available in an additional package), which makes it suitable for Image Retrieval tasks.
* '''Categorized News:''' the news stories have been categorized semi-automatically (appropriate for Text Categorization and Classification tasks).

The corpus is available for download in XML format.

The '''Jorvik Viking Centre''' is a [[museum]] and visitor attraction in [[York]], England, containing lifelike mannequins and life-size dioramas depicting Viking life in the city. It was created by the [[York Archaeological Trust]] in 1984.  Its name is derived from ''Jórvík'', the [[Old Norse]] name for the city of York. 

== Background ==
[[File:Jorvik underfloor 05 May 2107.jpg|thumb|left|Under a glass floor, the original archeological dig is reproduced with actual timbers]]
Cravens, a firm of [[confectionery|confectioners]] was founded in 1803. Cravens relocated from their factory in Coppergate in central York in 1966. Between 1976 and 1981, after the factory was demolished, and prior to the building of the [[Coppergate Shopping Centre]] (an open-air pedestrian shopping centre which now occupies the enlarged site), the York Archaeological Trust, a charity founded in 1972 by [[Peter Addyman]], conducted extensive [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] in the area. Well-preserved remains of some of the [[lumber|timber]] [[building]]s of the [[Viking]] city of [[Scandinavian York|Jorvík]] were discovered, along with [[workshop]]s, [[fence]]s, animal pens, [[outhouse|privies]], pits and [[water well|well]]s, together with durable materials and artefacts of the time, such as [[pottery]], [[metalworking|metalwork]] and [[bone]]s. Unusually, [[wood]], [[leather]], [[textile]]s, and plant and animal remains from the period around 900&amp;nbsp;AD, were also discovered to be preserved in oxygen-deprived wet [[clay]]. In all, over 40,000 objects were recovered.

The trust recreated the excavated part of Jorvik on the site, peopled with figures, sounds and smells, as well as [[sty|pigsties]], [[fish market]] and [[latrine]]s, with a view to bringing the Viking city fully to life using innovative interpretative methods. The Jorvik Viking Centre, which was designed by John Sunderland, opened in April 1984. Since its formation, the Centre has had close to 20&amp;nbsp;million visitors.

== Today ==

[[File:Jorvik frying pan 05 May 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Cooking pan in the museum]]
In 2001, the centre was refurbished and enlarged at a cost of £5&amp;nbsp;million, a further investment of £1&amp;nbsp;million followed in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Jorvik|url=http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/|work=Jorvik Viking Centre|publisher=York Archaeological Trust|accessdate=25 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These investments were used to "intensify the message" at Jorvik, and included such changes as extending the ride time to 12 minutes, as well as adding more high-tech elements, which included a hike in "the technology and animation elements," and increasing "the sensory stimuli to include smells, more sounds, heat, cold and damp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koranteng|first=Juliana|title=Jorvik Viking Centre used as TiLE example|journal=Amusement Business|date=25 June 2001|volume=113|issue=25|pages=1|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/209428449|accessdate=25 February 2012}} {{dead link|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Visitors are taken back to 5:30&amp;nbsp;pm 25 October 975&amp;nbsp;AD in a time-capsule, and then embark on a tour of a reconstructed Viking settlement which includes voices speaking in [[Old Norse]]{{Clarify|date=December 2017|reason=What do the experts say? "Wilkom in Jorvik", as in legend, isn't Old Norse.}}, as well as aromas and "life-like animated figures, made by laser technology from skeletons found on the site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Peter|title=High-tech wizardry beams Jorvik visitors into Viking past|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/253242602/135161C83E067E526E5/2?accountid=12599|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=Edmonton Journal|date=16 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond this is an extensive museum area, which combines an exhibition of some 800 finds from the site with interactive displays and the opportunity to learn about tenth-century life and to discuss it with "Viking" staff. Among the exhibits is a replica of the [[Coppergate Helmet]], which was found near the site of the centre and is now in the [[Yorkshire Museum]]. A new museum was opened on 13 February 2010, coinciding with the start of the annual Viking Festival in York. The centre contains new exhibitions and features.

===Jorvik Viking models===
[[Graham Ibbeson]] created the lifelike mannequins used in the Jorvik experience.  At first the faces of these mannequins were modelled from modern day people.  Through advances in [[Forensic facial reconstruction|facial reconstruction technology]] eight new mannequins have been modelled through this process, which uses a low-powered laser beam and a video camera.  These recreations were based on skulls found in a Viking age cemetery, although there is no guarantee that the skulls were Norse, and there is the possibility that they were [[Saxon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Phoebe-Lou|title=From York to Yorvik|journal=The Atlantic Monthly|date=March 1995|volume=275|issue=3|pages=46–50&lt;!--|accessdate=25 February 2012--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viking Festival ===
The centre also organizes an annual Viking Festival that takes place in the second week of February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/viking-festival/ |title=Viking Festival |publisher=Jorvik Viking Centre |accessdate=1 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223191518/http://www.jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/viking-festival/ |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is set up in tradition of an ancient Viking festival known as "Jolablot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northyorkshire/iloveny/2004/viking/|title=Jolablot comes to York!|date=April 2004|work=Where I Live North Yorkshire|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival includes Combat re-enactment involving volunteers from all over the world.

=== "Time Warp" experience ===
Jorvik Viking Centre is not billed as a museum but as an “experience”; this type of educational representation of the past, known as a “Time Warp” experience, has become increasingly popular with the creation of Jorvik.  It inspired other such sites as the “Canterbury Pilgrims Way” where visitors can join [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s pilgrimage.&lt;ref name="trips"&gt;{{cite news|title=These trips really take you back in time|newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|date=14 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015 flood damage ===
The centre was significantly affected by the [[Storm Desmond|flooding in Northern England]] in December 2015 with extensive water damage to the building and exhibits. The most valuable Viking artifacts were moved to prevent damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35192138|title=UK floods: Storm Frank threatens more misery|date=December 2015|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum reopened on 8 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jorvik-viking-centre.co.uk/|title=Jorvik {{!}}|publisher=Jorvik Viking Centre|access-date=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public response ==
The Jorvik Viking Centre has been called "''one of Britain's most popular attractions.''"&lt;ref name="purists"&gt;{{cite news|title=Purists rage, but alas, poor Yorvik's doing well|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/243586302/135161C83E067E526E5/14?accountid=12599|accessdate=25 February 2012|newspaper=The Vancouver Sun|date=4 February 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC spoke of the "Time Warp" experience as "a new art form".&lt;ref name="trips"/&gt;

=== Criticisms ===
The Jorvik Centre has been criticized as a “pop-up book view of history.”&lt;ref name="trips"/&gt; and its presentation of the past has been labelled “Disney-like”.&lt;ref name="purists"/&gt; Anthony Gaynor, one of the creators of the Centre, responded by stating: "We're making history accessible and enjoyable to the general public. You can't do that if you wrap it in a lot of academic foliage."&lt;ref name="purists"/&gt;

In late 2013 and early 2014, it was widely reported in English-language media outlets that [[Ragnarök]], a series of cataclysmic events foretold in [[Norse mythology]], would occur on 22 February 2014. Apparently patterned after the [[2012 phenomenon]], the claim was at times attributed to a "Viking Calendar".&lt;ref name="FEB-22-2014-EXAMPLES"&gt;Examples include the [[Daily Mail]] ("[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2507778/Will-world-end-100-days-Sounding-ancient-trumpet-York-warns-Viking-apocalypse-22-February-2014.html#ixzz2u5W7mQ7P Will the world end in 100 days? Sounding of ancient trumpet in York warns of Viking apocalypse on 22 February 2014]", 15 November 2013), [[People.com]] ("[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20789160,00.html What to Expect from the Norse Apocalypse]", 22 February 2014), and [[International Business Times]] ("[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ragnarok-2014-all-about-norse-term-that-heralds-viking-apocalypse-photos-1437506 All About the Norse Term That Heralds Viking Apocalypse]", 22 February 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; No such calendar is known to have existed, and the source was a "prediction" made to media outlets by the Jorvik Viking Centre, and intended to draw attention to an event that the institution was to hold on that date. The Jorvik Viking Centre was criticized for intentionally or unintentionally misleading the public; however, in an article on the incident, Joseph S. Hopkins perceives the media response as an example of a broad revival of interest in the Viking Age and ancient Germanic topics.{{sfn|Hopkins|2014|pages=7–12}}

==Biography==
Muñoz was born in [[Havana]], Cuba in 1967, shortly before relocating with his parents to the [[Cuban exile]] enclave of Hialeah, Florida, the same year. He received his undergraduate education at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] in 1989 with a B.A. in Comparative Literature. In 1994, he completed his doctorate from the Graduate Program in Literature at [[Duke University]], where he studied under the tutelage of queer theorist [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]]. He wrote about artists, performers, and cultural figures including [[Vaginal Davis]], [[Nao Bustamante]], [[Carmelita Tropicana]], [[Isaac Julien]], [[Jorge Ignacio Cortiñas]], [[Kevin Aviance]], [[James Schuyler]], [[Richard Fung]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat|Basquiat]], [[Pedro Zamora]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. His work is indebted to the work of [[Chicana feminism|Chicana feminists]]: [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Chela Sandoval]], and [[Norma Alarcón]],&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; members of the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical thinkers such as [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Theodor W. Adorno|Theodor Adorno]], and [[Walter Benjamin]], and the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]].

Muñoz died in [[New York City]] in December 2013.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uminnpressblog"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.uminnpressblog.com/2013/12/highly-regarded-author-and-professor.html?spref=tw | title=Highly regarded author and professor José Esteban Muñoz dies  | accessdate=2013-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was working on what would have been his third book, ''The Sense of Brown: Ethnicity, Affect and Performance,'' to be published by Durham: [[Duke University Press]]. In addition to his two single authored books, Muñoz co-edited the books ''Pop Out: Queer Warhol'' (1996) with [[Jennifer Doyle]] and Jonathan Flatley and ''Everynight Life: Culture and Dance in Latin/o America'' (1997) with Celeste Fraser Delgado. Along with [[Ann Pellegrini]], José Muñoz was the founding series editor for [[New York University Press|NYU Press]]'s influential Sexual Cultures book series which premiered in 1998. Grounded in [[women of color]] feminism, this book series specializes in titles "that offer alternative mappings of queer life in which questions of race, class, gender, temporality, religion, and region are as central as sexuality" and was foundational to the establishment of queer of color critique.&lt;ref&gt;"Sexual Cultures." ''NYU Press''. Accessed May 17, 2016. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://nyupress.org/series/sexual-cultures/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.
&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz also worked on the initial Crossing Borders Conference in 1996, which focused on Latin America and Latino queer sexualities.[http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/the-sense-of-jose/] He was a Board Member of [[City University of New York|CUNY]]'s [[Center for Lesbian and Gay Studies|CLAGS: The Center for LGBTQ Studies]] and editor of the Journal ''[[Social Text]] and Women and Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Shortly after his death, CLAGS instituted an award in his honor, given to LGBTQ activists who integrate Queer Studies into their work. The inaugural recipient of the award was [[Janet Mock]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Conversation with Janet Mock|url=https://clags.org/event/a-conversation-with-janet-mock/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Spring of 2016, the Department of Performance Studies at New York University inaugurated the distinguished José Esteban Muñoz Memorial Lecture; speakers have included [[Fred Moten]], José Quiroga, and [[Judith Butler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tisch.nyu.edu/performance-studies/events-affiliations/jem|title=Annual José Esteban Muñoz Memorial Lecture|last=|first=|date=|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and areas of interest ==
Muñoz challenges and questions contemporary mainstream gay and lesbian politics. He argues that present gay and lesbian politics, whose political goal is [[Gay Rights|gay rights]], [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], and [[Sexual orientation and military service|gays in the military]], are trapped within the limiting normative time and present.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Following [[Ernst Bloch|Ernst Bloch's]], ''The Principle of Hope'', Muñoz is interested in the socially symbolic dimension of certain aesthetic processes that promote [[political idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muñoz|first=José Esteban|date=2007|title=Cruising the Toilet: LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka, Radical Black TRaditions, and Queer Futurity|url=|journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz re-articulates queerness as something "not yet here."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Queerness "is that thing that lets us feel that this world is not enough."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Muñoz reconceptualizes queerness from [[identity politics]] and brings it into the field of [[aesthetics]]. For Muñoz, [[Queer aesthetics]], such as the visual artwork of [[Vaginal Davis]], offers a blueprint to map future social relations. Queerness in Muñoz's conceptualization, is a rejection of "straight time", the "here and now" and an insistence of the "then and there."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity|last=Muñoz|first=Jose Esteban|publisher=NYU Press|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz proposes the concept of "disidentificatory performances," as acts of transgression and creation, by which racial and sexual minorities, or minoritarian subjects articulate the truth about [[cultural hegemony]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Muñoz critiques [[Lee Edelman]]'s book "No Future" and the concept of queer death drive that results in Muñoz theorization of queer futurity or queer sociality.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Queer futurity thus "illuminates a landscape of possibility for minoritarian subjects through the aesthetic-strategies for surviving and imagining utopian modes of being in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarado|first=Leticia|date=July 2015|title="What Comes after Loss?": Ana Mendieta after José|journal=Small Axe |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=104–110|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ephemera as evidence ===
Muñoz first introduced his concept of ephemera as evidence in the 1996 issue of ''Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory.'' The idea that performance is ephemeral is essential to the field of [[performance studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage|last=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first=Barbara|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Muñoz claims that [[Ephemerality|ephemera]] does not disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perform, Repeat, Record: Live Art in History|last=|first=|publisher=Intellect Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1-84150-489-6|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ephemera in the Muñozian sense, is a modality of "anti-rigor" and "anti-evidence" that reformulates understandings of [[The Materiality Turn|materiality]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Building on [[Raymond Williams]]' concept of "structures of feeling",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marxism and Literature|last=Williams|first=Raymond|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz claims that the ephemeral, "traces, glimmers, residues, and specks of things," is distinctly material, though not always solid. Framing the performative as both an intellectual and discursive event, he begins by defining queerness as a possibility, a modality, of the social and the relational, a sense of self-knowing. He argues that queerness is passed on surreptitiously due to the fact that the trace of queerness often leaves the queer subject vulnerable for attack.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muñoz|first=José Esteban|date=1996-01-01|title=Ephemera as Evidence: Introductory Notes to Queer Acts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07407709608571228|journal=Women &amp; Performance |volume=8|issue=2|pages=5–16|doi=10.1080/07407709608571228|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz's definition of ephemera is influenced by Paul Gilroy's ''The Black Atlantic'' "as part of the exchange of ephemera that connects and makes concert a community."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As a result, Muñoz states, queerness has not been able to exist as "visible evidence" rather it has had to exist in fleeting moments. Thus, queer performances stand as [[evidence]] of queer possibilities and queer worldmaking. Muñoz understands [[Marlon Riggs]]' ''[[Tongues Untied]]'' and ''Black Is, Black Ain't'', as examples of an ephemeral witnessing of Black queer identity. In 2013,  Muñoz was a collaborator on the exhibit, ''An Unhappy Archive'' for the [[Brooklyn Museum]]. The goal of the exhibit was to question the normative definition of happiness through the use of texts, posters, books, and drawings. The title of the project is a reference to [[Sara Ahmed]]'s concept of the "unhappy archive." According to Ahmed, the unhappy archive is a collective project rooted in [[Feminist theory|feminist]]-queer and [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] politics. Other collaborators include [[Ann Cvetkovich]], Karin Michalski, Sabian Baumann, [[Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/feminist_art_base/sabian-baumann|title=Brooklyn Museum: Sabian Baumann|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz departs from [[Peggy Phelan]]'s argument that the ontology of performance lies in its disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unmarked: The Politics of Performance|last=Phelan|first=Peggy|date=1993-02-19|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415068222|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz parts from this view as it is confined to a narrow view of time. He suggests live performance exists ephemerally then without completely disappearing after it vanishes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Disidentification ===
Muñoz's theory of disidentification builds on [[Michel Pêcheux]]'s understanding of disidentification and subject formation by examining how minoritarian subjects, those whose identities render them a minority (i.e. [[queer]] [[people of color]]), negotiate identity in a majoritarian world that punishes, and attempts to erase the existence of, those who do not fit the normative subject (i.e.[[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]], [[cisgender]], [[White people|white]], [[middle class]], [[male]]). Muñoz notes how queer people of color, as a result of the effects of [[colonialism]] have been placed outside dominant racial and sexual ideology, namely white normativity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ward|first=Jane|date=2008-09-01|title=White Normativity: The Cultural Dimensions of Whiteness in a Racially Diverse LGBT Organization|url=http://spx.sagepub.com/content/51/3/563|journal=Sociological Perspectives|volume=51|issue=3|pages=563–586|doi=10.1525/sop.2008.51.3.563|issn=0731-1214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heteronormativity]]. In his own words, "disidentification is about managing and negotiating historical trauma and systemic violence."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The disidentificatory subject does not assimilate (identify) nor reject (counter identify) dominant ideology. Rather, the disidentificatory subject employs a third strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pérez|first=Emma|date=2003-01-01|title=Queering the Borderlands: The Challenges of Excavating the Invisible and Unheard|jstor=3347351|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=24|issue=2/3|pages=122–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, "tactically and simultaneously works on, with, and against, a cultural form."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics|last=Muñoz|first=José Esteban|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-8166-3015-8|location=Minnesota|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from being a process of identification,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Case|first=Sue‐Ellen|last2=Abbitt|first2=Erica Stevens|date=2004-03-01|title=Disidentifications, Diaspora, and Desire: Questions on the Future of the Feminist Critique of Performance|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/380627|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=29|issue=3|pages=925–938|doi=10.1086/380627|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; disidentification is also a survival strategy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through disidentification, the disidentifying subject is able to rework the cultural codes of the mainstream to read themselves into the mainstream,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaked|first=Nizan|date=2008-01-01|title=Phantom Sightings: Art after the Chicano Movement|jstor=40068561|journal=American Quarterly|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1057–1072}}&lt;/ref&gt; a simultaneous insertion and subversion. By the mode of disidentification, queer subjects are directed towards the future. Through the use of shame and "misrecognition through failed [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]], queer collectivity neither assimilates nor strictly opposes the dominant regime," but works on strategies that result in queer counterpublics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

His theory on disidentification is foundational to understandings of queer of color performance art and has proved indispensable across a wide variety of disciplines. Muñoz's argument is in conversation with [[Stefan Brecht]]'s theory on "queer theater." Brecht argues that queer theater inevitably turns into humor and passive repetition, ultimately, falling apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Queer Theatre, The original theatre of the City of New York, From the mid-60s to the mid-70s, Book 2.|last=Brecht|first=Stefan|publisher=New York/London: Methuen|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz, is weary of Brecht's theory as it doesn't seem to consider the work of artists of color and also ignores the use of humor as a didactic and political project.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Muñoz argues that the work of queer artists of color is political and will remain political as long as the logic of dominant ideology exists.

=== Counterpublics ===
In ''Disidentifications,'' Muñoz defines counterpublics as "communities and relational chains of resistance that contest the dominant public sphere."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Counterpublics have the capacity of world-making through a series of cultural performances that disidentify with the normative scripts of [[whiteness]], [[Heteronormativity|heternormativity]], and [[misogyny]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/7538901/Locating_Hope_and_Futurity_in_the_Anticipatory_Illumination_of_Queer_Performance._Book_review_of_Jos%25C3%25A9_Mu%25C3%25B1oz_s_Cruising_Utopia_the_Then_and_There_of_Queer_Futurity|title=Locating Hope and Futurity in the Anticipatory Illumination of Queer Performance.

=== Cruising utopia ===
In Cruising Utopia, José Muñoz develops a critical methodology of hope to question the present and open up the future. He draws on Ernst Bloch's Marxist inspired analysis of hope, [[temporality]], and [[utopia]], and looks at "inspirational moments from the past in order to (re)imagine the future."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediationsjournal.org/articles/queer-principles-of-hope|title=Review of Cruising Utopia: The Then and There of Queer Futurity : Mediations : Journal of the Marxist Literary Group|website=www.mediationsjournal.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book, Muñoz revisits a series of queer art works from the past to envision the political potentiality within them. He draws on the queer work of [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Fred Herko]], [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones]], [[Ray Johnson]], [[Jill Johnston]], Jack Smith, [[James Schuyler|James Schulyer]], [[Elizabeth Bishop]] and [[Samuel R. Delany|Samuel Delany's]] and [[Eileen Myles]] queer memoirs of the 60s and 70s.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Muñoz develops a hermeneutics of "trace and residue to read the mattering of these works, their influence and world-making capacity."&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; This world-making capacity allows for a queer futurity. Muñoz develops an argument for about queerness as horizon, hope, and futurity.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

Queer futurity is a literary and queer cultural theory that combines elements of [[utopia]]nism, [[historicism]], [[Speech act|speech act theory]], and [[Ideal (ethics)|political idealism]] in order to critique the present and current dilemmas faced by [[queer people of color]], but also to revise, interrogate, and re-examine the [[death drive]] in [[queer theory]]. Queer futurity or "queer sociability" addresses themes and concerns of minoritarian subjects through a [[performance]] and [[aesthetics]] lens, encompassing a range of media and artists with a shared interest in envisioning queer futures that stem from minoritarian subject experiences.  According to [[Fred Moten]], "Jose's queerness is a utopian project whose temporal dimensionality is manifest not only as projection into the future but also as projection of a certain futurity into and onto the present and the past."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/the-beauty-of-jose-esteban-munoz/|title=The Beauty of José Esteban Muñoz {{!}} boundary 2|last=boundary2|website=www.boundary2.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queerness also has a spatial dimension, "insofar as it is located in displacement" such as virtual chats, disappearing clubs, gentrified neighborhoods and venues, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/the-beauty-of-jose-esteban-munoz/|title=The Beauty of José Esteban Muñoz {{!}} boundary 2|last=boundary2|website=www.boundary2.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of queer sociability has expanded beyond the fields of [[Performance studies|Performance Studies]], [[Queer theory|Queer Theory]], and [[Gender and Women Studies]] and has been used by various scholars to address issues of [[Black Diaspora Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Territories of the Soul|last=Ellis|first=Nadia|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caribbean Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/listening-ephemerality-and-queer-fidelity/|title=Listening, Ephemerality, and Queer Fidelity|last=Stadler|first=Gustavus|date=March 10, 2016|website=boundary2.org|publisher=The B2 Review|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Musicology|musicolog]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;y.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/listening-ephemerality-and-queer-fidelity/|title=Listening, Ephemerality, and Queer Fidelity {{!}} boundary 2|last=boundary2|website=www.boundary2.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The elements of queer sociability has not only created the field of [[queer of color critique]] but has been the center of special journal issues such as the Virtual Special Issue: José Esteban Muñoz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://explore.tandfonline.com/page/ah/rwap-vsi|title=Virtual Special Issue: José Esteban Muñoz|last=|first=|date=|website=Queer Acts|publisher=Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chusma ===
Muñoz theorizes chusmeria or chusma, as a form of behavior that is in excess of normative comportment. Chusmeria is "a form of behavior that refuses bourgeois comportment and suggests Latinos should not be too black, too poor, or too sexual, among other characteristics that exceed normativity."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Queer theorist Deborah Vargas uses chusmeria to inform her theory of ''lo sucio'', "the dirty, nasty, and filthy" of society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vargas|first=Deborah|date=|title=Ruminations of Lo Sucio as a Latino Queer Analytic|url=|journal=American Quarterly |volume=66 |issue=3 |doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Muñozian sense, "lo sucio" persistently lingers as the "yet to be".

=== Sense of feeling brown ===
Muñoz began to theorize on brown affect in his piece "Feeling Brown: Ethnicity and Affect" in Ricardo Bracho's ''The Sweetest Hangover'' (and Other STDs). In this article, Muñoz wanted to focus on ethnicity, affect, and performance in order to question the U.S. national affect and highlight the affective struggles that keep minoritatrian subjects from accessing normative identity politics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muñoz|first=José Esteban Muñoz|date=2000|title=Feeling Brown: Ethnicity and Affect in Ricardo Bracho's "The Sweetest Hangover (And Other STDS)|url=|journal=Theatre Journal |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=67–79|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muñoz undertaking was to move beyond notions of ethnicity as "what people are" and instead understand it as a performative "what people do."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Muñoz describes how race and ethnicity are to be understood as "affective" differences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Affective differences are the "ways in which different historically coherent groups 'feel' differently and navigate the material world on a different emotional register."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the piece "Feeling Brown", Muñoz discussed the notion of racial performativity as a form of political doing based on the recognition of the effects of race. Thus, "feeling brown" is a modality of recognizing the affective particularities coded to specific historical subjects, like the term [[Latino (demonym)|Latina]]. He emphasized that Brown feelings "are not individualized affective particularity" but rather is a collective mapping of self and others.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The turn from identity to affect resulted in Muñoz coneptualization of the "Brown Commons" as the key point in which race is experienced as a feeling, as an affective specificity. Licia Fiol-Matta describes Jose's "Cubanity" as a "disidentity, a feeling brown, part of a brown undercommons and as an artistic manifestation of the sense of brown."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/the-sense-of-jose/|title=The Sense of José {{!}} boundary 2|last=boundary2|website=www.boundary2.org|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Latinidad as an affective difference, "José gave us a road map or toolkit to point us in the direction of the gap, wound, or hole of displacement as a necessary condition for interpretation to take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boundary2.org/2014/03/the-sense-of-jose/|title=The Sense of José {{!}} boundary 2|last=boundary2|website=www.boundary2.org|access-date=2016-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and impact ==
After his death, a special issue of the journal ''Boundary 2'', themed "The Beauty of José Esteban Muñoz", was published.

Deborah Paredez describes Muñoz as key to the practice of a critical and ethical attentiveness to a wide range of performances by Latina/o artists and for helping scholars listen to the melody of what is like to feel brown.

In 2014, Muñoz's concept of ''ephemera as evidence'' was the theme for a Visual AIDS exhibit,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/events/detail/ephemera-as-evidence-visual-aids-exhibition|title=Ephemera As Evidence|last=AIDS|first=Visual|website=Visual AIDS|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; curated by Joshua Lubin-Levy and Ricardo Montez. The exhibit took its name from Muñoz's 1996 essay, ''Ephemera as Evidence: Introductory Notes to Queer Acts''. Featuring [[Visual arts|visual art]], [[performance art]], and [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] projects, ''Ephemera as Evidence'' explores how the [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis forged new relationships of [[temporality]]. The exhibit, which ran from June 5 to June 24 at La Mama Galleria, featured works from [[Nao Bustamante]], [[Carmelita Tropicana]], Benjamin Fredrickson, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artforum.com/index.php?pn=picks&amp;id=47279&amp;view=print|title="Ephemera as Evidence" - artforum.com / critics' picks|website=artforum.com|access-date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muñoz's disidentification theory has also influenced other thinkers in the field. In ''Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability,'' Robert McRuer, draws on Muñoz's theory of disidentification to articulate and imagine "collective disidentifications" made possible when putting queer and crip theory in conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|publisher=NYU Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8147-5713-0|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Archive and the Repertoire: Performing Cultural Memory in the Americas|last=Taylor|first=Diana|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8223-8531-8|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ann Cvetkovich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Depression: A Public Feeling|last=Cvetkovich|first=Ann|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=0-8223-5238-9|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roderick Ferguson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique|last=Ferguson|first=Roderick A.|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2004|isbn=978-0816641291|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jack Halberstam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=In a Queer Time and Place: Transgender Bodies, Subcultural Lives|last=Halberstam|first=Jack|publisher=NYU Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8147-3584-8|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have cited and applied Muñoz to their own work. Muñoz was also influential to the field of Queer of Color Critique. In the book ''Aberrations in Black'', Roderick Ferguson employs Muñoz's disidentification theory to reveal how the discourses of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] are used to articulate theories of racial difference in the field of [[sociology]]. Moreover, disidentification theory has been used by an array of scholars to apply a queer of color critique to various themes such as [[identity politics]], [[queer temporality]], [[homonationalism]], and diaspora and native studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Andrea|date=2010|title=QUEER THEORY AND NATIVE STUDIES The Heteronormativity of Settler Colonialism|url=|journal=GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies |volume=16 |issue=1–2  |pages=41–68|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the art collective, [[My Barbarian]], was selected to participate in "Alternate Endings",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/album/3139847|title=ALTERNATE ENDINGS videos on Vimeo|website=vimeo.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; a video program put on by Visual AIDS, for the 25th anniversary of [[Day Without Art|Day With(out) Art]]. Begun in 1989, the annual event is meant to commemorate the AIDS crisis and give artists a platform to display work that reflects and responds to the history of HIV/AIDS. Titled, "Counterpublicity", the video performance is based on Muñoz's essay on [[Pedro Zamora]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the embodied performance, the three artists recreate scenes from [[The Real World: San Francisco]] in an exaggerated manner, critically examining the politics of [[reality television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/108349379|title=My Barbarian - Counterpublicity (2014)|website=Vimeo|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrics for the piece were adapted from Muñoz's theory of counterpublic spheres. In a panel, My Barbarian said, "the video is a remembrance within a remembrance: to Pedro Zamora and to José Esteban Muñoz."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.visualaids.org/blog/detail/tavia-nyongo#_edn3|title=The video is a remembrance within a remembrance: to Pedro Zamora and to José Esteban Muñoz.|last=AIDS|first=Visual|website=Visual AIDS|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video premiered at Outfest in Los Angeles.

[[Xandra Ibarra]], La Chica Boom use of "spics" is influenced by Muñoz's Sense of Brown and Counterpublics. For Muñoz, spics are epithets linked to questions of affect and excess affect. Ibarra's performances of "la Virgensota Jota" and "La tortillera"&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; are ways to re-inhabit toxic languages for the purpose of remapping the social or what Muñoz described as disidentificatory performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Muñoz has seminal influence on many American scholars and artists, among them Robert McRuer, [[Roderick Ferguson]], [[Daphne Brooks]], Nadia Ellis, [[Juana María Rodríguez]], [[Deborah Paredez]], and [[Ann Cvetkovich]].

The '''''Journal of Contemporary Religion''''' is a triannual [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] which covers anthropological, sociological, psychological, and philosophical aspects of religion.

== History and format ==
The journal was established in 1985 as ''Religion Today'' by the Centre for New Religions at [[King's College London]]. Its founding [[editor-in-chief|editor]] was [[Peter B. Clarke]] (later at [[Wolfson College, Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;Arweck, Elisabeth. ''Researching new religious movements: responses and redefinitions'', p. ix, Routledge 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-415-27755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stark, Rodney; Finke, Roger. ''Acts of faith: explaining the human side of religion''. University of California Press 2000, p. 16, {{ISBN|978-0-520-22202-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew&gt;Clarke, Peter Bernard. ''New Religions in Global Perspective: A Study of Religious Change in the Modern World'', Routledge 2006, p. 46, {{ISBN|978-0-415-25748-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal, which changed its name to the current title in 1995,&lt;ref name=ClarkeNew /&gt; is published by [[Routledge]]. Its current editor is [[Elisabeth Arweck]] ([[University of Warwick]]); Peter B. Clarke, who died in June 2011, will remain listed as co-editor until the end of the year out of respect for his contributions to the field.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite journal |title=Peter B.

[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=159825&amp;sectioncode=26 "Social science &amp; humanities journals: Prayers for today"], ''[[Times Higher Education]]''. Retrieved 2010-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

An issue of the triannual journal typically features five or six major articles.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; Other content includes conference reports, research notes, book reviews and review articles, and articles are sometimes illustrated with graphics or photographs.&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' stated in a 1997 review of the journal that "The contributors are invariably academics, mainly from North America and Europe. The style ranges from the homely, almost chatty at times, to the more formal. The articles, however, are on the whole scholarly and, as advertised, treat of a wide range of subjects, from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University|Brahma Kumaris]] to [[Sahaja Yoga]], from the '[[Toronto Blessing]]' to the nature of [[fundamentalism]], from 'The Protestant eruption into modern Brazilian politics' to 'Deconfessionalisation in the Netherlands' (in the last three decades or so). There are fieldwork reports, ethnographic accounts, and historical and conceptual studies. The standard of research and analysis is what one would expect from a good academic journal."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt; The review criticised the small number and seemingly arbitrary selection of book reviews, but concluded by stating that "On the whole, then, the journal is a valuable research tool and source of new knowledge for scholars, teachers and others interested in studying the phenomenon of contemporary religion. With nothing really comparable available in the field, it is highly recommended."&lt;ref name=THE /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8474">'''Karl Barth's views on Mary''' agreed with much [[Roman Catholic]] dogma but disagreed with the Catholic veneration of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. [[Karl Barth|Barth]], a leading 20th-century theologian, was a [[Reformed Protestant]]. Aware of the common dogmatic tradition of the early Church, Barth fully accepted the dogma of Mary as the [[Mother of God]]. Through Mary, Jesus belongs to the human race. Through Jesus, Mary is Mother of God.

==Background==

===Theology of Karl Barth===
Karl Barth (May 10, 1886 &amp;ndash; December 10, 1968) a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Reformed]] theologian, was one of the most important Christian thinkers of the 20th century. Beginning with his experience as a pastor, he rejected the predominant [[liberal Christianity|liberal]] theology typical of 19th-century [[Protestantism]], especially [[Germany|German]], and instead embarked on a unique theological path, often labelled [[neo-orthodoxy]] by critics (a label emphatically rejected by Barth himself), that emphasized the sovereignty of God particularly through his innovative doctrine of [[predestination|election]]. Barth's theology swept through Europe and Britain.

Barth was originally trained in German [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Liberal Christianity|Liberalism]] under such teachers as [[Wilhelm Herrmann]], but reacted against this theology at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]].  His reaction was fed by several factors, including his commitment to the German and Swiss [[International League of Religious Socialists|Religious Socialist]] movement surrounding men like [[Hermann Kutter]], the influence of the [[Biblical Realism]] movement surrounding men like [[Christoph Blumhardt]] and [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and the impact of the [[skepticism|skeptical philosophy]] of [[Franz Overbeck]].

===Epistle to the Romans===
In his commentary ''[[The Epistle to the Romans]]'' (Ger. ''Der Römerbrief''; particularly in the thoroughly re-written second edition of 1922) Barth argued that the God who is revealed in the cross of [[Jesus]] challenges and overthrows any attempt to ally God with human cultures, achievements, or possessions.  Many theologians believe this work to be the most important theological treatise since [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]'s ''[[On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers]].''

In the decade following the First World War, Barth was linked with a number of other theologians, actually very diverse in outlook, who had reacted against their teachers' liberalism, in a movement known as "[[Dialectical Theology]]" &lt;ref&gt;(Ger. ''Dialektische Theologie'').&lt;/ref&gt;  Other members of the movement included [[Rudolf Bultmann]], [[Eduard Thurneysen]], [[Emil Brunner]], and [[Friedrich Gogarten]].

==Marian views==

===The nativity mystery===

* ''The nativity mystery  “conceived from the [[Holy Spirit]] and born from the [[Virgin Mary]]”,  means,  that God became human, truly human out of his own grace. The miracle of the existence of Jesus , his “climbing down of God” is: Holy Spirit and Virgin Mary! Here is a human being, the Virgin Mary,  and as he comes from God, Jesus comes also from this human being. Born of the Virgin Mary means a human origin for God.  Jesus Christ is not only truly God, he is human like every one of us. He is human without limitation. He is not only similar to us, he is like us''.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Dogmatik im Grundriss,  1947, 125,127&lt;/ref&gt;

This means to Barth, God's presence in our world, His presence as man among men and therefore God's revelation to humanity. It also means humanity's reconciliation with God. To Barth,  this happened and still happens,  it is the substance of the Christmas message.

This God is conceived where we all are conceived. He is born of Mary. She who conceived and bore Him, plays our part in the wonder of Christmas, for it concerns us. God has come to us. "Disguised in our flesh and blood, is the Eternal God."

=== Virgin Birth ===
The [[Nicene Creed]] says: ''Et incarnatus est de Spiritu Sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est'' ("and he [God the Son] became body from the Virgin Mary and was made man").  In Barth's theology – in contrast to much of the contemporary liberal theology – this statement is interpreted to mean the [[dogma]] of the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|Virgin Birth]]. It means that Jesus as a human does not have a father, in the same way that as the Son of God he has no mother. The Holy Spirit, through whom Mary conceived, is not just any spirit, it is God himself whose act must be understood spiritually and not physically.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic I, 2,  219&lt;/ref&gt;   Mary is "full of grace" according to Barth, but this grace is not earned but totally given to her. This is quite similar to Catholic teaching, in which Mary, "by sheer grace," received the fullness of grace from God at the moment of her conception, that she might give her consent at the annunciation.&lt;ref&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church, 722&lt;/ref&gt;  Barth argues that the Church adopted its doctrine of the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]] not because of Mary, but in defence of its [[Christology]].

=== Mother of God ===

Karl Barth states that as a Christian and theologian, he  does not reject the description of Mary as the "Mother of God." To him, this is a legitimate expression of Christological truth. The description of Mary as the "Mother of God" was and is sensible, permissible and necessary as an auxiliary Christological proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, I, 2, Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark, 1963, 138)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2004-1"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God (2 pts.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA138|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-05069-4|pages=138–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of the Catholic view ===
Barth on the other hand sees the term "Mother of God," as "being overloaded by the so-called Mariology of the Roman Catholic Church".&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, 138&lt;/ref&gt; 
He considered the Roman Catholic veneration of Mary a terrible mistake and heresy.

* ''Where ever Mary is venerated, and devotion to her takes place, there the Church of Christ does not exist''.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics Study Edition 3: The Doctrine of the Word of God I.2 § 13-15|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=APXR1E0m_AkC&amp;pg=PA145|date=2 September 2010|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-02766-5|pages=145–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* ''Mariology is an excrescence, i.e., a diseased construct of theological thought. Excrescences must be excised.'' &lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatik, I, 2, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barth2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karl Barth|title=Church Dogmatics: The doctrine of the word of God (2 pts.)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Po0rhLSFx0wC&amp;pg=PA139|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-567-05069-4|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He warns however, of extending this critique too far:
{{quote|It is not recommended that we should base our repudiation [of Marian doctrine] on the assertion that there has taken place here an irruption from the heathen sphere, an adoption of the idea, current in many non-Christian religions, of a more or less central and original female or mother deity. In dogmatics you can establish everything and nothing from parallels from the history of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Church Dogmatics, Vol. 1, p. 143).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

And, Barth equally attacks Protestant theology on this issue: "For justice sake, one has to say, that the Protestant rejection of Roman Catholic mariology and Marian cult is dishonest, as long as Protestantism is caught in the same unreal problem".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kirchliche Dogmatic, I,2,160&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close friend of [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], who published about him. Barth’s dogmatic theology was partly based on [[Thomas Aquinas]], although he departed from Aquinas on many characteristically Catholic points.

This is an overview of '''Women's Suffrage activism and local politics''' as experienced in [[Leigh, Lancashire]] between 1900 and 1914.   

== 1900 to 1909 ==

In October 1900 Mrs A Urmston of the Leigh Co-operative Women's Guild,&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Cooperative Women's Guild Monthly Reports. Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote to Leigh's MP, [[C. P. Scott]] asking him to vote favourably on Women's Suffrage Bills. He answered in the affirmative.&lt;ref&gt;Guardian Archive, Women's Suffrage collection GDN/123/54 and 55 Archive + Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 [[Henry Yorke Stanger]], Leigh County Court Judge and MP for [[Kensington North]], introduced a private member's Women's Suffrage Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Hansard February 1908 on line&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 2 September 1910&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 15 July 1909, [[Women's Social and Political Union]] activists, [[Annie Kenney]], [[Jennie Baines]], [[Mabel Capper]], [[Charlotte Marsh]] and [[Florence Clarkson]] attempted to force their way into Leigh Co-operative Hall to disrupt the Liberal Party's guest speaker, [[Lewis Harcourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 16 July 1909&lt;/ref&gt; After a violent struggle, Clarkson of Oxford Road, Manchester was arrested and bailed at £10.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 16 July 1909 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day when tried in Leigh Police Station's Day Room,&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 16 July 1909 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; she refused to pay the 20 [[shilling]] fine imposed and was sentenced to fourteen days in the second division at [[Strangeways]] Gaol in Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;Borough of Leigh Court Register Volume 3 16 July 1909&lt;/ref&gt;  There she went on [[hunger strike]] but did not serve her full sentence without food, denying herself food for 65 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 6 August 1909&lt;/ref&gt;

==  National Union of Women’s Suffrage Societies ==

During the General Election of January 1910, members of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS) visited Leigh to collect signatures for their Voters’ Petition.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 28 January 1910 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  They aimed to prove that male voters were in favour of votes for women.  With the cooperation of local suffragists, 2,843 signatures were collected at Leigh polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Archive + M50 Women's Suffrage Collection Reel 3&lt;/ref&gt;  After which, a banner stating "2,843 Men of Leigh Demand Women’s Suffrage" was used to advertise suffrage meetings in the town.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Crawford, Women's Suffrage Movement:A Reference Guide&lt;/ref&gt; A similar banner, bearing the same legend was used in the "Prison to Citizenship Constitutional Demonstration" in London on 18 June 1910.&lt;ref&gt;British Pathe News: Various Suffrage Material Religion, Politics, Trade and Industry stills 137,138,139&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1910 the [[North of England Society for Women's Suffrage]] began a consciousness raising campaign in Leigh.&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1910 the Leigh branch of the NUWSS, the Leigh Women’s Suffrage Society, was formed. Its first secretary was Miss F.P. Hindshaw BA,&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies Women's Suffrage Collection M50 Reel 3 Manchester Archives +&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Miss L. Cook of 13 Railway Road.&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies Women's Suffrage Collection M50 Reel 3 Manchester Archives &lt;/ref&gt; Membership of the Leigh branch was not gendered and non party. The campaign took the form of a series of public meetings and debates led by prominent pro-suffrage workers, supported by local interested parties and out of town speakers, including the Liberal Association President, and editor and proprietor of the Manchester Guardian, C.P. Scott. Other key speakers included Mrs F.T. Swanwick, suffragist and editor of the NUWSS paper the [[Common Cause]]: [[Kathleen Courtney]], secretary of the North of England Society for Women’s Suffrage; Lisbeth Simms of the Women’s Labour League;  Margaret Robertson BA Manchester Society/NUWSS organiser: and a Manchester councillor, [[Margaret Ashton]], founder member of the Women’s Trade Union League and chairperson of the NUWSS. The women spoke on why women needed and deserved the vote whilst attempting to discredit opponents' arguments. They stressed their non militancy, non party and law abiding credentials to address a degree of fear by women of becoming identified with the "shrieking sisterhood" (WSPU). Locally there were immediate and legitimate reasons for unease and fear.  When Margaret Robertson spoke at a [[National Union of Teachers]] Association meeting in Leigh, some male members in the audience "moodily twirled their moustaches and gazed at the floor" and the chairman "kept a few from that energy of opposition that often ends in blows".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 6 November 1911 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  This latent aggression on occasion resulted in violence, and in one instance was condoned by the local press.  When a socialist in Tyldesley was mobbed for hanging out a ‘Votes for Women’ banner, Leigh Chronicle opined "he asked for it" and "deserved what he got".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 1913 Wigan Archives Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political associations==

A proportion of the town's women had organised into political associations before the campaign.  The Leigh Women’s Liberal Association was particularly large. Three hundred women were taken by train from [[Westleigh, Greater Manchester|Westleigh]] to [[Lowton]], to be thanked for their part in MP [[Peter Raffan]]'s 1910 Parliamentary election campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 12 August 1910 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town hall&lt;/ref&gt; From 1910 to 1914 the women held tea meetings where between 100 and 200 attendees were addressed by speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 15 November 1911 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Female Conservatives organised in either Women’s Unionist or Conservative Associations. These were large organisations, with sufficient kudos to attract the Rt Hon [[Austen  Chamberlain]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 24 November 1911 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the Labour Party was in its infancy, it was formed in July 1908,&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence from Leigh Trades Council to the Labour Representation Committee and George Brown, Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; it had an  active women's section.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal July 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women’s Labour League==

The [[Women's Labour League]] was a Labour Party pressure group, formed in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Collette, ''For Labour and for Women: The Women's Labour League 1906-1918''&lt;/ref&gt; It promoted and supported  both male and female candidates for parliamentary or municipal office and [[Boards of Guardians]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Collette, For Labour and for Women: The Women's Labour League.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1911  WLL branches were established at [[Bamfurlong, Greater Manchester|Bamfurlong]], [[Ashton in Makerfield]], [[Golborne]], [[Lowton]], Leigh and [[Tyldesley]].&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Annual Reports WLL/1/163 to 165, Labour Party Archives, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;  The Leigh Labour Party was ambitious. Tom Greenall was its first Parliamentary candidate for the General Election of January 1910 and it was increasing its membership of Leigh Council.

==Mrs G Mottram==

The Lowton and Leigh WLL branches had a committed and able leader, Mrs G Mottram, who was a founder and secretary for the Lowton and Leigh branches.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Annual Reports, WLL/1.163 to 165 Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; The  branches were small, 20 in Lowton and 60 in Leigh,&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League WLL Labour Party Archive, People's Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt; 
but they made an impact during Leigh’s municipal elections. Mrs Mottram stood, unsuccessfully, as a candidate for Leigh Rural District Council and the Leigh Guardians' elections in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League The League Leaflet February 1913, Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum Mancheste&lt;/ref&gt;  She attended WLL Conferences – at [[Earlestown]] she argued for equal pay for women and she was a member of the Leigh Insurance Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Leaflet February 1913, Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum&lt;/ref&gt; During WW1 she agitated for Municipal Lodging Houses for women munitions workers, was a member of the Leigh War 
Emergency Workers Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Borough of Leigh Minute Book, General Purposes Committee, 16 May 1916, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; She was a member of Leigh’s Naval and Military War Pensions Committee and helped devise systems to aid Leigh’s Disabled Soldiers and Sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Records, The League Leaflet February 1913 Labour Party Archive, People's History Museum, Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilitating working class membership==

Like [[Ellen Wilkinson]], who became a Labour MP, cabinet minister, and leader of the [[Jarrow March]]ers, working in Tyldesley,&lt;ref&gt;Red Ellen Wilkinson, Matt Perry&lt;/ref&gt;  Mrs Mottram was both a WLL and NUWSS organiser.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Labour League Annual Reports, Labour Party Archive,&lt;/ref&gt;. In 1910 the NUWSS launched its Friends of Women's Suffrage Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Stanley Holton, Feminism and Democracy: Women's Suffrage and Reform Politics 1900-1918&lt;/ref&gt;. It enabled people who could not afford membership fees to become members simply by pledging their allegiance which widened the demographic and increased the membership. From a membership of 21,571 in 1910, by 1913 39,000 "friends" had enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra Stanley Holton, Feminism and Democracy: Women's Suffrage and Reform Politics in Britain 1900-1918&lt;/ref&gt; From 200 branches in 1910 there were 602 in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, NUWSS on line&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time NUWSS leaders, particularly in the North, increasingly identified with the working clases and for an industrial town like Leigh this was particularly pertinent.

==Leigh municipal elections 1912== 

Mrs Mottram’s feminism and Labour politics came together during Leigh’s 1912 and 1913 municipal elections.  Mr J L Prescott, the successful Labour candidate for St Mary’s Ward in 1912, acknowledged that the work of Mrs Mottram and the Women’s Labour League co-workers had been a big factor in his success against the Liberal J. Sargent.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Chronicle 8 November 1912 Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Mrs Mottram’s co-workers were drawn from the women’s sections of all Leigh’s political parties.  

In 1912 Mrs Nessie Egerton Stewart Brown, President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Women’s Liberal Association warned that its members were losing patience with the Lancashire and Cheshire Liberal Association’s refusal to discuss the question of Women’s Suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Manchester Guardian Cuttings Book, Letter from Mrs Egerton Stewart Brown May 1912, John Rylands Library Manchester&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time Leigh’s Liberal women were offered an alternative.  The NUWSS, which contained a large Liberal contingent, disappointed by the Liberal Party’s continual rejection of women’s suffrage reached an agreement with the Labour Party.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 24 May 1912 Wigan Arches Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party was the only party to pledge its complete support for Women’s Suffrage, the NUWSS agreed to support Labour Parliamentary and municipal candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 25 May 1912, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conservative Party in the main, were anti-women’s suffrage.  In the 1913 St Mary’s Ward, Conservative Councillor W.R.Boydell fighting for re-election in 1913 had no women helpers, despite there being a large Women’s Unionist Association in the ward.  The victor, Labour’s J.H. Wright, when praising the WLL canvassers, commented that Boydell had had to do "all the spade work himself".&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal 8 November 1913, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall&lt;/ref&gt; W.R. Boydell and George Hunter, Liberal Councillor for St Mary’s in 1911, was a proven women’s suffragist.  In 1911, at the request of the NUWSS, Leigh Council was one of 146 County, Borough and District Councils , to petition Parliament in support of enfranchising women householders. In council, it was Councillor Hunter who moved the resolution with Councillor Boydell seconding.&lt;ref&gt;Borough of Leigh Proceedings of the Council, 1910-1911 page 185 9 May 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wider involvement== 

Throughout this period the NUWSS called on its member societies to take part in the mass demonstrations and rallies.  As a significant proportion of the participants were northern working women, prominent among these being [[pit brow women]] and mill workers, in all probability some Leigh women were represented.  Despite details of ordinary women’s personal involvement being hard to find, there is evidence that members of the Leigh Women’s Suffrage Society spent weeks making goods to sell on the Leigh, Wigan, Farnworth and Eccles stall at the 1912 NUWSS fund-raising bazaar at the [[Midland Hotel, Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Journal February 1912, Wigan Archives, Leigh Town Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Union of Women's Suffrage Collection M50 Reel 3 Manchester Archives +&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently 18 [[UNESCO World Heritage sites]] in [[Greece]].&lt;ref name="Greece list"&gt;{{citation |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/gr |title=Greece: Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2012-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, 16 are inscribed based on [[World Heritage site#Cultural criteria|"cultural"]] criteria, while the remaining two ([[Mount Athos]], [[Meteora]]) are inscribed for meeting both "cultural" and "natural" criteria. Five of the sites are located on [[Greek islands|islands]], one is distributed between the islands and the mainland, with the remaining 12 exclusively on the mainland.  This first site to be inscribed was the [[Temple of Apollo at Bassae]] in 1986, the most recent is the [[Philippi]], inscribed in 2016.  There are an additional 14 sites on the tentative list.

| Although geographically distant from each other, these three monasteries belong to the same typological series and share the same aesthetic characteristics. The churches are built on a cross-in-square plan with a large dome supported by squinches defining an octagonal space. In the 11th and 12th centuries they were decorated with superb marble works as well as mosaics on a gold background, all characteristic of the 'second golden age of [[Byzantine art]]'.

| The Old [[Corfu (city)|Town of Corfu]], on the [[Island of Corfu]] off the western coasts of [[Albania]] and Greece, is located in a strategic position at the entrance of the [[Adriatic Sea]], and has its roots in the 8th century BC. The three forts of the town, designed by renowned Venetian engineers, were used for four centuries to defend the maritime trading interests of the [[Republic of Venice]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the course of time, the forts were repaired and partly rebuilt several times, more recently under [[United States of the Ionian Islands|British rule]] in the 19th century. The mainly neoclassical housing stock of the Old Town is partly from the Venetian period, partly of later construction, notably the 19th century. As a fortified Mediterranean port, Corfu’s urban and port ensemble is notable for its high level of integrity and authenticity.

| Founded in 315 B.C., the provincial capital and sea port of [[Thessalonika]] was one of the first bases for the spread of Christianity. Among its Christian monuments are fine churches, some built on the Greek cross plan and others on the three-nave basilica plan. Constructed over a long period, from the 4th to the 15th century, they constitute a diachronic typological series, which had considerable influence in the [[Byzantine Empire]].

| In a small valley in the [[Peloponnesus]], the shrine of [[Asklepios]], the god of medicine, developed out of a much earlier cult of [[Apollo]], during the 6th century BC at the latest, as the official cult of the city state of Epidaurus. Its principal monuments, particularly the temple of Asklepios, the Tholos and the Theatre - considered one of the purest masterpieces of Greek architecture – date from the 4th century. The vast site, with its temples and hospital buildings devoted to its healing gods, provides valuable insight into the healing cults of Greek and Roman times.

The [[Hellenistic]] theatre and funerary [[heroon]] (temple) were supplemented with Roman buildings such as the [[Roman Forum|forum]]. Later the city became a [[Early centres of Christianity|centre of the Christian faith]] following the visit of the [[Apostle Paul]] in 49-50 CE. The remains of its [[basilica]]s constitute an exceptional testimony to the early establishment of Christianity.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F079071-0007, Bonn, Nachrichtenagentur Reuters.jpg|thumbnail|Reuters, Bonn 1988]]

A '''news agency''' is an organization that gathers [[news]] reports and sells them to subscribing news organizations, such as [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s and [[All-news radio|radio]] and [[News broadcasting|television]] [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]]. A news agency may also be referred to as a &lt;!--do not link these, as they will just redirect back to news agency--&gt;'''wire service''', '''newswire''', or '''news service'''.

Although there are many news agencies around the world, three global news agencies, [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP), [[Associated Press]] (AP) and [[Reuters]], have offices in most countries of the world and cover all areas of information. All three began with and continue to operate on a basic philosophy of providing a single objective news feed to all subscribers; they do not provide separate feeds for conservative or liberal newspapers. [[Jonathan Fenby]] explains the philosophy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To achieve such wide acceptability, the agencies avoid overt partiality. Demonstrably correct information is their stock in trade. Traditionally, they report at a reduced level of responsibility, attributing their information to a spokesman, the press, or other sources. They avoid making judgments and steer clear of doubt and ambiguity. Though their founders did not use the word, objectivity is the philosophical basis for their enterprises – or failing that, widely acceptable neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fenby, ''The International News Services'' (1986) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
Only a few large newspapers could afford bureaus outside their home city. They relied instead on news agencies, especially [[Havas]] (founded 1835) in France and the [[Associated Press]] (founded 1846) in the United States. Former Havas employees founded [[Reuters Group|Reuters]] in 1851 in Britain and [[Wolffs Telegraphisches Bureau|Wolff]] in 1849 in Germany; Havas is now [[Agence France-Presse (AFP)]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Fenby, ''The International News Services'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; For international news, the agencies pooled their resources, so that Havas, for example, covered the French Empire, South America and the Balkans and shared the news with the other national agencies. In France the typical contract with Havas provided a provincial newspaper with 1800 lines of telegraphed text daily, for an annual subscription rate of 10,000 francs. Other agencies provided features and fiction for their subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Zeldin, ''France: 1848–1945'' (1977) 2: 538–539&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1830s, France had several specialized agencies. Agence Havas was founded in 1835 by a Parisian translator and advertising agent, [[Charles-Louis Havas]], to supply news about France to foreign customers. In the 1840s, Havas gradually incorporated other French agencies into his agency. Agence Havas evolved into [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Broderick |first=James F. |authorlink= |author2=Darren W.

[[Guglielmo Stefani]] founded the [[Agenzia Stefani]], which became the most important press agency in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy from the mid-19th century to World War II]], in [[Turin]] in 1853.

The development of the telegraph in the 1850s led to the creation of strong national agencies in England, Germany, Austria and the United States. But despite the efforts of governments, through telegraph laws such as in 1878 in France, inspired by the British [[Telegraph Act]] of 1869 which paved the way for the nationalisation of telegraph companies and their operations, the cost of telegraphy remained high.

In the United States, the judgment in ''Inter Ocean Publishing v. Associated Press'' facilitated competition by requiring agencies to accept all newspapers wishing to join. As a result of the increasing newspapers, the Associated Press was now challenged by the creation of [[United Press Associations]] in 1907 and [[International News Service]] by newspaper publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1909. Driven by the huge U.S. domestic market, boosted by the runaway success of radio, all three major agencies required the dismantling of the "cartel agencies" through the Agreement of 26 August 1927. They were concerned about the success of U.S. agencies from other European countries which sought to create national agencies after the First World War. Reuters had been weakened by war censorship, which promoted the creation of newspaper cooperatives in the Commonwealth and national agencies in Asia, two of its strong areas. After the Second World War, the movement for the creation of national agencies accelerated, when accessing the independence of former colonies, the national agencies were operated by the State. Reuters, became cooperative, managed a breakthrough in finance, and helped to reduce the number of U.S. agencies from three to one, along with the internationalization of the Spanish [[EFE]] and the globalization of Agence France-Presse.

In 1924, [[Benito Mussolini]] placed Agenzia Stefani under the direction of [[Manlio Morgagni]], who expanded the agency's reach significantly both within Italy and abroad. Agenzia Stefani was dissolved in 1945, and its technical structure and organization were transferred to the new [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]] (ANSA). Wolffs was taken over by the Nazi regime in 1934, and Reuters continues to operate as a major international news agency today.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/25/us-reuters-baroness-idUSTRE50O1GV20090125 "Baroness Reuter, last link to news dynasty, dies"], ''Reuters'', January 25, 2009. Retrieved February 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1865, Reuter and Wolff signed agreements with Havas's sons, forming a cartel designating exclusive reporting zones for each of their agencies within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentalhistory.org/revcomm/timelines/ch7-telegraph/ "Ch 7 Telegraph"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801114401/http://www.environmentalhistory.org/revcomm/timelines/ch7-telegraph/ |date=2013-08-01 }}, ''Revolutions in Communication: Media history from Gutenberg to the digital age'' (2010). Retrieved February 12, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, the major agencies were provided with new opportunities in television and magazine, and news agencies delivered specialized production of images and photos, the demand for which is constantly increasing. In France, for example, they account for over two-thirds of national market.&lt;ref name="SgDdai"&gt;« Statistiques d’entreprises des industries culturelles », par Valérie Deroin, Secrétariat général Délégation au développement et aux affaires internationales au sein du Département des études, de la prospective et des statistiques [http://www.culturecommunication.gouv.fr/content/.../Cchiffres08_4.pdf]{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial services==
News agencies can be [[corporations]] that sell news (e.g., [[Press Association]], [[Thomson Reuters]] and [[United Press International]]). Other agencies work cooperatively with large media companies, generating their news centrally and sharing local news stories the major news agencies may choose to pick up and redistribute (i.e., [[Associated Press]] (AP), [[Agence France-Presse]] (AFP) or American Press Agency (APA)) and Indian Press Agency [[Press Trust of India|PTI]].

Governments may also control news agencies: China ([[Xinhua]]), France ([[Agence France-Presse]]), Russia ([[ITAR-TASS]]), and several other [[countries]] have government-funded news agencies which also use information from other agencies as well.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd-Barrett, Oliver, ed. (2010). ''[http://llibreria.gencat.cat/product_info.php?products_id=4585 News Agencies in the Turbulent Era of the Internet]''. Generalitat de Catalunya. {{ISBN|978-84-393-8303-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial newswire services charge businesses to distribute their news (e.g., [[Business Wire]], [[Globe Newswire|GlobeNewswire]], [[Marketwire]], [[PR Newswire]], [[PR Web]], and [[Cision|CisionWire]]).

The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used [[telegraphy]]; today they frequently use the [[Internet]]). Corporations, individuals, analysts, and [[intelligence agencies]] may also subscribe.

News sources, collectively, described as [[alternative media]] provide reporting which emphasizes a self-defined "non-corporate view" as a contrast to the points of view expressed in [[corporate media]] and government-generated news releases. [[Internet]]-based [[alternative news agency|alternative news agencies]] form one component of these sources.

==Associations==
There are several different associations of news agencies. [[European Alliance of News Agencies|EANA]] is the European Alliance of Press Agencies, while the [[Organization of Asia-Pacific News Agencies|OANA]] is an association of news agencies of the Asia-Pacific region. [[MINDS International|MINDS]] is a global network of leading news agencies collaborating in new media business.

The '''Osler Library''', a branch of the [[McGill University Library]], is [[Canada|Canada's]] foremost scholarly resource in the [[history of medicine]], and one of the most important [[library|libraries]] of its type in [[North America]].

==Collection==
The nucleus of the Library is the collection of 8,000 rare and historic works on the history of medicine and allied subjects presented to the Faculty of Medicine of [[McGill University]] by [[Sir William Osler]] (1849–1919). Sir William's original collection is described in the printed catalogue (also available as an e-book), ''[http://mcgill.worldcat.org/oclc/191819027 Bibliotheca Osleriana]'', and information on the whole of the printed collection and much of the manuscript collections is listed in the [http://muse.mcgill.ca/F McGill University online catalogue]. Since the opening of the Library in 1929, the collection has continued to grow by purchase, gift, and transfer (particularly, in the latter case, of older health-related books from McGill's former Medical Library and [https://www.mcgill.ca/library/branches/lsl Life Sciences Library.])

In addition to the Osler Library's holdings of rare and old books, there is a strong circulating collection of current secondary works and modern editions of historic texts, as well as a reference collection, archives and manuscripts, portraits and artifacts. In particular, the Osler Library has a large collection of [[incunabula]] (over 150 volumes), an outstanding collection of editions of the works of [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (author of ''[[Religio Medici]]'', the 17th century classic), and a collection of some 30,000 19th century French medical theses, primarily from Paris.

The total number of works currently housed in the library is approximately 100,000, and includes books old and new, as well as "periodicals about the history of the health sciences and related areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Osler Library of the History of Medicine|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/library/branches/osler/about|website=McGill Library|accessdate=25 September 2015|quote=the collection [...] has grown to around 100,000 works including older, rare materials as well as current books and periodicals about the history of the health sciences and related areas.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Osler Library has also a number of their collections and exhibitions digitized over the years.

In 1965, both  the contents of the library and the interior oak paneling and shelving were moved to their present location within the newly built [[McIntyre Medical Sciences Building]]. At that time the "Wellcome Camera" was added to the library with the financial assistance of the [http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/ Wellcome Trust].  Initially most of the windows on the first floor of the Camera were provided with stained-glass coats-of-arms; one for each of the twelve Canadian universities which then had medical faculties. In 1985 four additional coats-of-arms were added; only the coat-of-arms of the [[Northern Ontario School of Medicine]] is currently missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bensley|first1=Edward H.|last2=Groen|first2=Frances|last3=Wallis|first3=Faith|last4=Hicks|first4=Lorraine|last5=Ricci|first5=Elizabeth|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/library/files/library/No48February1985.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2015|title=Osler Library Newsletter|issue=48|publisher=McGill University|date=February 1985|location=Montreal, Canada|page=2|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Osler Library was further expanded and renovated in 2001-02 and in 2014.

In the design of the Osler Library everything has been subordinated to the books themselves; those in the Osler Room are arranged in full view behind glazed doors. The fittings and furnishings of the Osler Library were designed by Nobbs &amp; Hyde&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osler Library Montreal, Canada, (7/1922-3/1923)|url=http://cac.mcgill.ca/nobbs/search/detail.php?projectid=231|work=The architecture of Percy Erskine Nobbs digital exhibition|publisher=McGill University Library|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stained glass window in the Osler Room depicts the staff and serpent, symbols of healing associated with the Greek god Asclepius, and a held-out book representing the university.

After their deaths, the ashes of both Sir William and Lady Osler were placed in a niche within the library so that they continue to be surrounded by Sir William's favourite books.

'''Paul Belloni Du Chaillu''' (July 31, 1831 (disputed){{snd}}April 29, 1903) was a French-American traveler, [[zoologist]], and [[anthropologist]].  He became famous in the 1860s as the first modern European outsider to confirm the existence of [[gorilla]]s, and later the [[Pygmy]] people of [[central Africa]].  He later researched the [[prehistory of Scandinavia]].

==Early life and parentage==
There are conflicting reports of both the year and place of his birth.  The year is variously given as 1831 (the consensus of modern scholars),{{sfn|Bucher|1979|pp=17}}&lt;ref name="McCook"&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/301931 "It May Be Truth, but It Is Not Evidence": Paul du Chaillu and the Legitimation of Evidence in the Field Sciences, Stuart McCook, ''Osiris'', 2nd Series, Vol. 11, Science in the Field (1996), pp. 177-197]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litencyc"/&gt; 1835, or 1839; the date when given is July 31.  Accounts usually cite either Paris or [[New Orleans]]&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&amp;UID=1323 | title=Paul Belloni Du Chaillu | publisher=[[The Literary Encyclopedia]] | accessdate=March 12, 2013 | author=Miller, John William}}&lt;/ref&gt; as his likely place of birth.  A contemporary obituary quotes a statement made by Du Chaillu referring to "the United States, my country by adoption, and ... France, my native land."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1775671 Obituary: Paul Belloni du Chaillu], [[E. G. Ravenstein]], ''[[The Geographical Journal]]'', Vol. 21, No. 6 (Jun., 1903), pp. 680-681&lt;/ref&gt;  His grave marker identifies his place of birth as [[Louisiana]], and the year as 1839.

However, the most reliable information comes from the memoirs of his personal friend [[Edward Clodd]]. Clodd mentioned [[New York City|New York]] as another claimed location but asserted that Du Chaillu's true birthplace was the French [[Indian Ocean]] island territory of [[Île Bourbon]] (now called [[Réunion]]).  He further claimed that his mother was a [[mulatto]] woman.{{sfn|Clodd|1926|pp=71-4}} In 1979, historian Henry H. Bucher presented evidence to back Clodd's view, including records of Du Chaillu's father. Bucher argued that Du Chaillu, as a member of the European scientific community, would have tried to obfuscate or conceal the family history that would have labeled him a [[quadroon]]. In the 19th century atmosphere of [[scientific racism]], great apes and [[Sub-Saharan Africans]] were often linked as sharing a small [[cranial capacity]] and an inborn inability to achieve civilization. Du Chaillu's credibility as an African explorer and gorilla expert would have suffered due to his black heritage as a result. Indeed, comments in a let by Du Chaillu's contemporary, the ethnologist of Africa [[Mary Kingsley]], indicate that at least some scientists who thought poorly of  Du Chaillu knew of his ancestry or other discrediting information about him.{{sfn|Bucher|1979|pp=28-30}}

In his youth, he accompanied his father, a French trader in the employment of a Parisian firm, to the west coast of Africa where, at a station on the [[Gabon Estuary|Gabon]], he was educated by missionaries and acquired an interest in and knowledge of the country, its natural history, its natives, and their languages before emigrating to the U.S. in 1852.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Du Chaillu, Paul Belloni|volume=8|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Africa==
He was sent in 1855 by the [[Academy of Natural Sciences]] at [[Philadelphia]] on an African expedition.  Until 1859, he explored the regions of [[West Africa]] in the neighborhood of the equator, gaining considerable knowledge of the delta of the [[Ogooué River]] and the estuary of the Gabon.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  During his travels from 1856 to 1859, he observed numerous [[gorilla]]s, known to non-locals in prior centuries only from an unreliable and ambiguous report credited to [[Hanno the Navigator]] of [[Carthage]] in the 5th century BC and known to scientists in the preceding years only by a few skeletons.  He brought back dead specimens and presented himself as the first white European person to have seen them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://museumvictoria.com.au/history/gorillas.html A History of Museum Victoria: Melbourne 1865: Gorillas at the Museum&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at [[Museum Victoria]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent expedition, from 1863 to 1865, enabled him to confirm the accounts given by the ancients of a [[pygmy]] people inhabiting the African forests.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  Du Chaillu sold his hunted gorillas to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London and his "[[cannibal]] skulls" to other European collections; a fine cased group shot by Du Chaillu may be seen in the [[Ipswich Museum]] in [[Suffolk]], England. Narratives of both expeditions were published, in 1861 and 1867 respectively, under the titles ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa, with Accounts of the Manners and Customs of the People, and of the Chace of the Gorilla, Crocodile, and other Animals''; and ''A Journey to Ashango-land, and further penetration into Equatorial Africa''.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; While in Ashango Land in 1865, he was elected King of the Apingi tribe.  A later narrative, ''The Country of the Dwarfs'' was published in 1872. 
[[File:French explorer Paul du Chaillu at close quarters with a gorilla.jpg|thumb|right|Drawing of Du Chaillu at close quarters with a gorilla]]
At the time, he was in great demand on the public lecture circuits of New York, London, and Paris. Although there were initial challenges of his accounts, they came to be accepted, although ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' speculated that "possibly some of the adventures he described as happening to himself were reproductions of the hunting stories of natives."&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In addition to his zoological work on gorillas, Du Chaillu collected and identified a number of new species to science. He was the first person to scientifically describe the [[giant otter shrew]] (''Potamogale velox''), taking precedence over [[John Edward Gray]]'s description of the same animal as a mouse instead. He also collected the type specimens for the [[southern needle-clawed bushbaby]] (''Euoticus elegantulus''), the [[hammer-headed bat]] (''Hypsignathus monstrosus''), and the [[African pygmy squirrel]] (''Myosciurus pumilio''), all West African species. Despite not being an ornithological collector, he collected the types specimens for thirty-nine valid species of African birds.{{sfn|Conniff|2011|pp=301–2}} Du Chaillu collected the type series of ''Amnirana albolabris'' (Hallowell, 1856) from Gabon.

==Northern Europe==
After some years' residence in America, during which he wrote several books for the young based on his African adventures, Du Chaillu turned his attention to northern Europe.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; After a visit to northern Norway in 1871, over the following five years, he made a study of customs and antiquities in Sweden, Norway, [[Lapland (region)|Lapland]] and Northern Finland. He published in 1881 ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIXOAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Land of the Midnight Sun]'' (dedicated to his friend [[Robert Winthrop]] of New York), as a series of Summer and Winter Journeys, in two volumes.

His 1889 work ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/The_viking_age.html?id=1HgJAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y The Viking Age]'', also in two volumes, was a very broad study of the early history, manners, and customs of the ancestors of the English-speaking nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Viking Age'' by Paul B. Du Chaillu|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=April 1890|volume=170|pages=347–369|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=coo.31924065563631;view=1up;seq=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; He labored for eight and a half years and carefully read hundreds of Sagas that describe the life of the people who inhabited the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] from the [[Stone Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]] (including literary remains). This scholarly work demonstrates what is now generally recognized, the importance of the [[Norsemen|Norse]], including Norway, Sweden, and Denmark to the cultural dimension and transformation of [[British Isles]] during the fifth to eleventh centuries. This view was then unfamiliar and was ridiculed by Canon [[Isaac Taylor (canon)|Isaac Taylor]]. This book, in two volumes, is now a very collectible item.  In 1900, he also published ''The Land of the Long Night''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Paul DuChaillu Gravesite.jpg|thumb|The gravesite of Paul DuChaillu in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]
Du Chaillu was a friend of [[Edward Clodd]] and was present at one of Clodd's [[Whitsun]] gatherings at Strafford House, [[Aldeburgh]], [[Suffolk]], in company with [[John Rhys]], [[Grant Allen]], [[York Powell]] and [[Joseph Thomson (explorer)|Joseph Thomson]].  He was a member along with a variety of mostly literary figures in author [[J. M. Barrie]]'s amateur [[cricket (sport)|cricket]] team, the "[[Allahakbarries]]".

He died following a stroke of paralysis at [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], while on a scholarly visit to Russia as part of his research on the Scandinavian peoples.{{sfn|Conniff|2011|pp=303}} He is interred at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]].

'''Pig Latin''' is a [[language game]] or [[argot]] in which words in [[English language|English]] are altered, usually by adding a fabricated [[suffix]] or by moving the [[Syllable#Onset|onset]] or initial [[consonant]] or [[consonant cluster]] of a word to the end of the word and adding a [[vocalic]] [[syllable]] to create such a suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dictionary.com/e/pig-latin/|title=What exactly is Pig Latin, is it a language? And how is it a mystery? - Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|date=2010-10-05|work=Everything After Z by Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is to [[Obfuscation|conceal the words]] from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to [[Latin language|Latin]] is a deliberate [[misnomer]]; Pig Latin is simply a form of [[argot]] or [[jargon]] unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

==Origins and history==
Early mentions of pig Latin or hog Latin describe what we would today call [[dog Latin]], a type of parody Latin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Examples of this predate even [[Shakespeare]], whose 1598 play, ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', includes a reference to dog Latin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | website=The Straight Dope | url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2163/whats-the-origin-of-pig-latin | title=What's the origin of pig Latin?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''Costard:''' Go to; thou hast it ad dungill, at the fingers' ends, as they say.&lt;br&gt;
'''Holofernes:''' O, I smell false Latine; dunghill for unguem. | Love's Labour's Lost, William Shakespeare}}

An 1866 article describes a "hog latin" that has some similarities to current Pig Latin. The article says, "He adds as many new letters as the boys in their 'hog latin,' which is made use of to mystify eavesdroppers. A boy asking a friend to go with him says, 'Wig-ge you-ge go-ge wig-ge me-ge?' The other, replying in the negative, says, 'No-ge, I-ge wo-ge.' "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA638&amp;lpg=PA638&amp;dq=%22He+adds+as+many+new+letters+as+the+boys+in+their+%22hog+latin,%22%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=llFXqy226B&amp;sig=s89ZY3kpFsimFFr2f3F-gbN5KdA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjegITDjtrJAhWNoYMKHfmGACIQ6AEIGzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22He%20adds%20as%20many%20new%20letters%20as%20the%20boys%20in%20their%20%22hog%20latin%2C%22%22&amp;f=false|work=The Galaxy: A Magazine of Entertaining Reading, Volume 1|page=638|title=Sound and Sense|date=1886|author=Wakeman, George|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is similar to [[Língua do Pê]].

Another early mention of the name was in ''[[Putnam's Magazine]]'' in May 1869 "I had plenty of ammunition in reserve, to say nothing, Tom, of our pig Latin. 'Hoggibus, Piggibus et shotam damnabile grunto,' and all that sort of thing," although the jargon is dog Latin.

''[[The Atlantic]]'' January 1895 also included a mention of the subject: "They all spoke a queer jargon which they themselves had invented. It was something like the well-known 'pig Latin' that all sorts of children like to play with."

The modern version of Pig Latin appears in a 1919 [[Columbia Records]] album containing what sounds like the modern variation, by a singer named [[Arthur Fields]]. The song, called [https://archive.org/details/PigLatinLove Pig Latin Love], is followed by the subtitle "I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day".&lt;ref&gt;'''I Always Wondered:''' [http://ialwayswondered.jarrettgreen.com/2011/05/25/where-did-pig-latin-come-from/ Where did Pig Latin come from?]&lt;br/&gt;The consensus seems to be that the version of Pig Latin we know today, was born sometime in the 20th century. In 1919 Columbia records released an album with Arthur Fields singing “Pig Latin Love”. The Subtitle “I-Yay Ove-Lay oo-yay earie-day” indicates that this is the modern form of Pig Latin we recognize today. I was able to scrounge up a photograph of the 1919 sheet music on eBay. Below the Pig Latin subtitle is the translation, “(I love you dearie)”, suggesting that perhaps this form of Pig Latin hadn’t taken root among the general public yet.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Three Stooges]] used it on multiple occasions, most notably ''[[Tassels in the Air]]'', a 1938 short where [[Moe Howard]] attempts to teach [[Curley Howard]] how to use it, thereby conveying the rules to the audience. In an earlier (1934) episode, ''[[Three Little Pigskins]]'', [[Larry Fine]] attempts to impress a woman with his skill in Pig Latin, but it turns out that she knows it, too. No explanation of the rules is given.  A few months prior in 1934, in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short film]] ''[[Washee Ironee]]'', Spanky tries to speak to an Asian boy by using Pig Latin.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcMWkY-Wlkk#t=10m35s&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ginger Rogers]] sang a verse of [[We're in the Money]] in pig Latin in an elaborate [[Busby Berkeley]] production number in the film [[Gold Diggers of 1933]],  ({{cite video|title=Trippy Ginger Rogers Pig Latin |quote=YouTube}}).  The film, the third highest grossing of that year, was inducted into the National Film Registry and that song included in the all time top 100 movie songs by the American Film Institute. [[Merle Travis]] ends his song ''When My Baby Double Talks To Me'' with the phrase, "What a aybybay", where the last word is Pig Latin for "baby".

A 1947 newspaper question and answer column describes the pig Latin as we understand it today. It describes moving the first letter to the end of a word and then adding "ay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19470128&amp;id=d44tAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=SJ0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4502,48597&amp;hl=en|work=Reading Eagle|page=12|title=Answers to Questions - The Haskins' Service|date=28 January 1947|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two Pig Latin words that have entered into mainstream American English are "{{lang|en|[[wikt:ixnay|ixnay]]}}" or "icksnay", the Pig Latin version of "{{lang|en|[[wikt:nix#English|nix]]}}" (itself a borrowing of [[German language|German]] ''nichts''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/127424 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;), which is used as a general [[Negative (language)|negative]]; and "{{lang|en|[[wikt:amscray|amscray]]}}", Pig Latin for "{{lang|en|[[wikt:scram#English|scram]]}}", meaning "go away" or "get out of here".&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=Barry J.|title=Secret Language: Codes, Tricks, Spies, Thieves, and Symbols|date=2010|publisher=OUP Oxford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAhYqpnC2H8C&amp;pg=PR48-IA149&amp;dq=ixnay+pig+latin&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiputrKgrnUAhUJOz4KHTRJBlUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=ixnay%20pig%20latin&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lexicogenesis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

==Rules==
For words that begin with [[consonant]] sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/piglatin.htm|title=Useful phrases in Pig Latin (IgpaAtinlay)|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"pig" = "igpay"
*"latin" = "atinlay"
*"banana" = "ananabay"  
*"happy" = "appyhay"
*"duck" = "uckday"
*"me" = "emay"
*"too" = "ootay"
*"will" = "illway"
*"real" = "ealray"
*"simple" = "implesay"
*"say" = "aysay"
*"bagel" = "agelbay"
*"fail" = "ailfay"
*"poo" = "oopay"
*"party" = "artypay"
*"lonely" = "onelylay"
*"friends" = "iendsfray"
*"Lauren"" = "aurenlay"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Speak-Pig-Latin|title=How to Speak Pig Latin|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"smile" = "ilesmay"
*"string" = "ingstray"
*"stupid" = "upidstay"
*"glove" = "oveglay"
*"trash" = "ashtray"
*"floor"= "oorflay"
*"store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "way" or "yay" to the end (or just "ay"). Examples are:
*"eat" = "eatway" or "eatay"
*"omelet" = "omeletway" or "omeletay"
*"are" = "areway" or "areay"
*"egg" = "eggway" or "eggay"
*"explain" = "explainway"
*"always" = "alwaysway" or "alwaysay"
*"ends" = "endsway" or "endsay"
*"honest" = "honestway"
*"I"= "Iway"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:
*"every" = "eryevay"
*"another" = "otheranay"
*"under" = "erunday"
*"island" = "andislay"
*"elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in [[English language|English]]. [[Pronunciation]] of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.&lt;!--emma  = emmway
Please do not add new examples here unless they really do follow a similar pattern as Pig Latin (moving a single phoneme cluster from one part of the word to another and adding something extra). Do not add examples of language games that generate words through different patterns (such as, for example, adding nonsense syllables in between vowels or after words, shuffling the order of syllables, or systematically replacing certain phonemes with others. The preceding list is not exhaustive). Such examples should instead be added to the [[Language game]] article.--&gt;

==Current usage==
Pig Latin is mainly used in fun.{{cn|date=September 2018}} It is also used by children or young adults to hide conversation from older people. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: "ehay isay eryvay illysay" = "he is very silly".{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==In other languages==
&lt;!--

--&gt;
In the German-speaking area, varieties of Pig Latin include [[Kedelkloppersprook]], which originated around [[Hamburg]] harbour, and [[Mattenenglisch]] that was used in the ''Matte'', the traditional [[working class|working-class]] neighborhood of [[Bern]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} Though Mattenenglisch has fallen out of use since the mid-20th century, it is still cultivated by [[voluntary association]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} A characteristic of the Mattenenglisch Pig Latin is the complete substitution of the first vowel by ''i'', in addition to the usual moving of the initial consonant cluster and the adding of ''ee''.

The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] equivalent of Pig Latin is Fikonspråket ("Fig language" – see [[Language game#List of common language games|Language game § List of common language games]]).

The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] Pig Latin is called Kontinkieli ("container language"). After each word you add the word kontti "container", then switch the first syllables, So every sentence is converted to twice as many pseudo-words. For example,"wikipedia" --&gt; "wikipedia kontti" --&gt; "kokipedia wintti". So converting the sentence "I love you" ("Minä rakastan sinua") would result in "konä mintti kokastan rantti konua sintti".

Another equivalent of Pig Latin is used throughout the [[Slavic language|Slavic]]-speaking parts of the [[Balkans]]. It is called "Šatra" (/sha-tra/)or "[[Šatrovački]]" (/shatro-vachki/) and was used in crime-related and street language. For instance, the Balkan slang name for [[marijuana]] (trava - meaning "grass") turns to "vutra"; the Balkan slang name for [[cocaine]] (belo - meaning "white") turns to lobe, a [[pistol]] (pištolj) turns to štoljpi, [[brother|bro]] (brate) turns to tebra. In the past few years it has become widely used between teenage immigrants in former [[Yugoslavia]]n countries.

In [[Italian language|Italian]], the ''[[Farfallino alphabet|alfabeto farfallino]]'' uses a similar encoding.

[[French language|French]] has the ''[[Louchébem|loucherbem]]'' (or ''louchébem'', or ''largonji''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/largonji|title=LARGONJI : Définition de LARGONJI|date=|publisher=Cnrtl.fr|accessdate=2014-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) coded language, which supposedly was originally used by butchers (''boucher'' in French).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/lfr_0023-8368_1991_num_90_1_6200|title=''Larlépem largomuche du louchébem.

Example: ''combien'' (how much) = ''lombienquès''. Similar coded languages are ''[[verlan]]'' and ''langue de feu'' (see [[:fr:Javanais (argot)]]. A few louchébem words have become usual French words: ''fou'' (crazy) = ''loufoque'', ''portefeuille'' (wallet) = ''larfeuille'', ''en douce'' (on the quiet) = ''en loucedé''. Also similar is the widely used French argot ''[[verlan]]'', in which the syllables of words are transposed. Verlan is a French slang that is quite similar to English pig Latin. It is spoken by separating a word into syllables and reversing the syllables.

Verlan was first documented as being used as far back as the 19th century. Back in the 19th century it was spoken as code by criminals in effort to conceal illicit activities within conversations around other people, even the police. Currently, Verlan has been increasingly used in areas just outside major cities mainly populated by migrant workers. This language has served as a language bridge between many of these migrant workers from multiple countries and origins and has been so widely and readily used that it has spread into advertising, film scripts, French rap and hip-hop music, media, in some French dictionaries and in some cases, words that have been Verlanned have actually replaced their original words. The new uses of Verlan and how it has become incorporated into the French culture has all happened within just a few decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://proxy.umpqua.edu/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=STND&amp;sw=w&amp;u=umpqua&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA90553064&amp;asid=b0475de0be51d24e83abf3ddb8258678|title=Backward runs French.

The syndrome is thought to be localized to villages in several states of [[India]], including [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Orissa]], and [[Chhattisgarh]], and has been reported by tens of thousands of individuals.&lt;ref name="Welle"&gt;{{cite news | title = Medicine challenges Indian superstition | newspaper = Deutsche Welle World | date = December 31, 2012 | accessdate = March 26, 2013|first=Shaikh Azizur |last=Rahman|url=http://www.dw.de/medicine-challenges-indian-superstition/a-16489334 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more prevalent in areas with little access to education.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

[[Witch doctors]] offer oral cures, which they claim will dissolve the puppies, allowing them to pass through the digestive system and be excreted "without the knowledge of the patient".&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt;

Doctors in India have tried to educate the public about the dangers of believing in this condition.&lt;ref name="Radio"/&gt; Most sufferers are referred to psychiatric services, but in rare instances patients fail to take anti-[[rabies]] medication in time, thinking that they have puppy pregnancy syndrome and thus the witch doctor's medicine will cure them.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scientific"/&gt; This is further compounded by witch doctors stating that their medicine will fail if sufferers seek conventional treatment.&lt;ref name="Welle"/&gt;

'''Regulatory capture''' is a form of [[government failure]] which occurs when a [[regulatory agency]], created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special [[interest group]]s that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Regulatory Capture Definition | url = http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-capture.asp | publisher = Investopedia  | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When regulatory capture occurs, the interests of firms or political groups are prioritized over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss for society. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".

For [[public choice theory|public choice theorists]], regulatory capture occurs because groups or individuals with a high-stakes interest in the outcome of policy or regulatory decisions can be expected to focus their resources and energies in attempting to gain the policy outcomes they prefer, while members of the public, each with only a tiny individual stake in the outcome, will ignore it altogether.&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl"&gt;Timothy B.

Regulatory capture theory is a core focus of the branch of public choice referred to as the [[Regulatory economics|economics of regulation]]; economists in this specialty are critical of conceptualizations of governmental regulatory intervention as being motivated to protect [[public good]]. Often cited articles include Bernstein (1955), Huntington (1952), Laffont &amp; Tirole (1991), and Levine &amp; Forrence (1990). The theory of regulatory capture is associated with [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate economist [[George Stigler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =Regulatory Capture 101: Impressionable journalists finally meet George Stigler | url=https://online.wsj.com/articles/regulatory-capture-101-1412544509  |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of its main developers.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Amann (Ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=akSneB10pJ0C&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Regulating Development: Evidence from Africa and Latin America''] Google Books. Edward Elgar Publishing (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;14. {{ISBN|978-1-84542-499-2}}. Retrieved April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Likelihood of regulatory capture is a risk to which an agency is exposed by its very nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Adams, Sharon Hayes, Stuart Weierter and John Boyd, [http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf "Regulatory Capture: Managing the Risk"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720083041/http://www.iceaustralia.com/apsacc2011/pdf/papers07/day1_24oct07/StreamA2/RegulatoryCaptureManagingTheRisks_JohnBoyd.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} ICE Australia, International Conferences and Events (PDF) (October 24, 2007). Retrieved April 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that a regulatory agency should be protected from outside influence as much as possible. Alternatively, it may be better to not create a given agency at all lest the agency become victim, in which case it may serve its regulated subjects rather than those whom the agency was designed to protect. A captured regulatory agency is often worse than no regulation, because it wields the authority of government. However, increased transparency of the agency may mitigate the effects of capture. Recent evidence suggests that, even in mature democracies with high levels of transparency and media freedom, more extensive and complex regulatory environments are associated with higher levels of corruption (including regulatory capture).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with federalism ===
There is substantial academic literature suggesting that smaller government units are easier for small, concentrated industries to capture than large ones. For example, a group of states or provinces with a large timber industry might have their legislature and/or their delegation to the national legislature captured by lumber companies. These states or provinces then becomes the voice of the industry, even to the point of blocking national policies that would be preferred by the majority across the whole [[federation]]. Moore and Giovinazzo (2012) call this "distortion gap".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254440445_The_Distortion_Gap_Policymaking_under_Federalism_and_Interest_Group_Capture|title=The Distortion Gap: Policymaking under Federalism and Interest Group Capture|first1=Ryan|last1=T.

The opposite scenario is possible with very large industries, however. Very large and powerful industries (e.g. energy, banking, [[Military–industrial complex|weapon system construction]]) can capture national governments, and then use that power to block policies at the federal, state or provincial level that the voters may want,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Economic rationale===
The idea of regulatory capture has an obvious economic basis, in that vested interests in an industry have the greatest financial stake in regulatory activity and are more likely to be motivated to influence the regulatory body than dispersed individual consumers,&lt;ref name="nyt-tbl" /&gt; each of whom has little particular incentive to try to influence regulators. When regulators form expert bodies to examine policy, this invariably features current or former industry members, or at the very least, individuals with contacts in the industry. Capture is also facilitated in situations where consumers or taxpayers have a poor understanding of underlying issues and businesses enjoy a knowledge advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmr.berkeley.edu/search/articleDetail.aspx?article=5779|title=Thin Political Markets: The Soft Underbelly of Capitalism|website=cmr.berkeley.edu|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists, such as Jon Hanson and his co-authors, argue that the phenomenon extends beyond just political agencies and organizations. Businesses have an incentive to control anything that has power over them, including institutions from the media, academia and popular culture, thus they will try to capture them as well. This phenomenon is called "deep capture".&lt;ref&gt;Jon D. Hanson and David G. Yosifon, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=938005 ''The Situation: An Introduction to the Situational Character, Critical Realism, Power Economics, and Deep Capture''] Abstract at [[Social Science Research Network]].

Regulatory public interest is based on market failure and welfare economics. It holds that regulation is the response of the government to public needs. Its purpose is to make up for market failures, improve the efficiency of resource allocation, and maximize social welfare. Posner pointed out that the [[public interest theory]] contains the assumption that the market is fragile, and that if left unchecked, it will tend to be unfair and inefficient, and government regulation is a costless and effective way to meet the needs of social justice and efficiency. Mimik believes that government regulation is a public administration policy that focuses on private behavior. It is a rule drawn from the public interest. Irving and Brouhingan saw regulation as a way of obeying public needs and weakening the risk of market operations. It also expressed the view that regulation reflects the public interest.

== Development ==
The review of the United States' regulation of history at the end of the 19th century, especially the regulation of railway tariffs by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in 1887, revealed that regulations and market failures are not relevant. At least until the 1960s, in terms of regulatory experience, regulation was developed in the direction of favoring producers, and regulation increased the profits of manufacturers within the industry. In potentially competitive industries such as the trucking industry and the taxi industry, regulations allow pricing to be higher than cost and prevent entrants.In the natural monopoly industries such as the electric power industry, there are facts that regulation has little effect on prices, so the industry can earn profits above normal profits. Empirical evidence proves that regulation is beneficial to producers.

These empirical observations have led to the emergence and development of regulatory capture theory. Contrary to regulatory public interest theory, regulation capture theory holds that the provision of regulation is adapting to the industry's need for regulation, that is, the legislator is controlled and captured by the industry in regulation, and the regulation institution is gradually controlled by the industry. That is, the regulator is captured by the industry.The basic view of the regulatory capture theory is that no matter how the regulatory scheme is designed, the regulation of an industry by a regulatory agency is actually "captured" by the industry. The implication is that regulation increases the profits of the industry rather than social welfare.

The above-mentioned regulatory capture theory is essentially a purely capture theory in the early days, that is, the regulators and legislators were captured and controlled by the industry. The later regulatory models such as Stiegler (Stigler Model)-Pelzmann (Pelzmann Model)-Becker (Becker Model) belong to the regulatory capture theory in the eyes of Posner (1974) and others. Because these models all reflect that regulators and legislators are not pursuing the maximization of public interests, but the maximization of private interests, that is, using "private interest" theory to explain the origin and purpose of regulation. Aton (1986) argues that Stigler's theoretical logic is clear and more central than the previous "capture theory" hypothesis, but it is difficult to distinguish between the two.

Regulatory capture theory has a specific meaning, that is, an experience statement that regulations are beneficial for producers in real life. In fact, it is essentially not a true regulatory theory. Although the analysis results are similar to the Stigler model provide interpretation and support for the regulatory capture theory is beneficial for producers, however the analysis methods of the latter are completely different. Stigler used standard economic analysis methods to analyze the regulation behavior, then created a new regulatory theory - regulatory economic theory. Of course, different divisions depend on the criteria for division, and they essentially depend on the researchers' different understanding of specific concepts.

Justice Douglas’ dissent in [[Sierra_Club_v._Morton#Justice Douglas' dissent|Sierra Club v Morton]] describes concern that regulatory agencies become too favorable with their regulated industries.

== Types ==
There are two basic types of regulatory capture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobinproject.org/sites/tobinproject.org/files/assets/Kwak%20-%20Cultural%20Capture%20and%20the%20Financial%20Crisis.pdf |title=Preventing Regulatory Capture |first1=Daniel |last1=Carpenter |first2=David A. |last2=Moss |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2004 |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corralling Capture |url=https://www.law.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publication/370256/doc/slspublic/corrralling_caputure.pdf |first=David Freeman |last=Engstrom |publisher=Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy |accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Materialist capture''', also called ''financial capture'', in which the captured regulator's motive is based on its material self-interest. This can result from bribery, [[Revolving door (politics)|revolving doors]], political donations, or the regulator's desire to maintain its government funding. These forms of capture often amount to [[political corruption]].
* '''Non-materialist capture''', also called ''cognitive capture'' or ''cultural capture'', in which the regulator begins to think like the regulated industry. This can result from interest-group lobbying by the industry.
Another distinction can be made between capture retained by big firms and by small firms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yadin|first=Sharon|date=2015|title=Too Small to Fail: State Bailouts and Capture by Industry Underdogs|url=http://law.capital.edu/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=35862|journal=43 Capital University Law Review 889|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Stigler mainly referred, in his work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|date=1971|title=The Theory of Economic Regulation|url=|journal=2 BELL J.

====Nuclear Regulatory Commission====
According to [[Frank N. von Hippel]], despite the 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] in Pennsylvania, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) has often been too timid in ensuring that America's 104 commercial reactors are operated safely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nuclear power is a textbook example of the problem of "regulatory capture"—in which an industry gains control of an agency meant to regulate it. Regulatory capture can be countered only by vigorous public scrutiny and Congressional oversight, but in the 32 years since Three Mile Island, interest in nuclear regulation has declined precipitously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/opinion/24Von-Hippel.html?_r=2&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=frank%20von%20hippel&amp;st=cse |title=It Could Happen Here |author=Frank Von Hippel |date=March 23, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A year-long [[Associated Press]] (AP) investigation showed that the NRC, working with the industry, has relaxed regulations so that aging reactors can remain in operation.&lt;ref name="ap-jdonn"&gt;Jeff Donn, [http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2011/06/20/us_aging_nukes_part_1/index.html "U.S. nuclear regulators weaken safety rules"] Salon.com (June 20, 2011).

However, a paper by Stanford University economics professors John B. Taylor and Frank A. Wolak compared the financial services and nuclear industries. While acknowledging both are susceptible in principle to regulatory capture, they concluded regulatory failure – including through regulatory capture – has been much more of a problem in the financial industry and even suggested the financial industry create an analog to the [[Institute of Nuclear Power Operations]] to reduce regulatory risk.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.stanford.edu/~johntayl/Drell-Shultz_NuclearEnterprise_ch13.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Inadequate inspections are reviewed by expert panels drawn primarily from academia and rarely challenge the agency.&lt;ref name="nyt-januke" /&gt; Critics say the main weakness in Japan's nuclear industry is weak oversight.&lt;ref name="nyt-nomf"&gt;Norimitsu Onishi and Martin Fackler, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/world/asia/17japan.html "Japanese Officials Ignored or Concealed Dangers"] ''The New York Times'' (May 16, 2011).

Both the ministry and the agency have ties with nuclear plant operators, such as [[Tokyo Electric]].

====Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW)====
In 1996, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (Japan)|Ministry of Health and Welfare]] (now combined with the Ministry of Labour) came under fire over the [[HIV-tainted blood scandal (Japan)|scandal of HIV-tainted blood]] being used to treat [[hemophiliac]]s.&lt;ref name="jpri"&gt;Masao Miyamoto, [http://www.jpri.org/publications/workingpapers/wp23.html "Mental Castration, the HIV Scandal, and the Japanese Bureaucracy"] Japan Policy Research Institute (August 1996).

Although warned about HIV contamination of blood products imported from the U.S., the ministry abruptly changed its position on heated and unheated blood products from the U.S., protecting the [[Green Cross (Japan)|Green Cross]] and the Japanese [[pharmaceutical industry]], keeping the Japanese market from being inundated with heat-treated blood from the United States.&lt;ref name="jpri" /&gt; Because the unheated blood was not taken off the market, 400 people died and over 3,000 people were infected with HIV.&lt;ref name="jpri" /&gt;

Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say the major task of the ministry is the protection of industry, rather than of the population.&lt;ref name="jpri" /&gt; In addition, bureaucrats get ''[[amakudari]]'' jobs at related industries in their field upon retirement, a system which serves to inhibit regulators.&lt;ref name="jpri" /&gt; Moriyo Kimura, a critic who works at MHLW, says the ministry does not look after the interests of the public.&lt;ref name="jatimes" /&gt;

'''STSAT-2B''', or '''Science and Technology Satellite 2B''', was a [[South Korea]]n [[satellite]] which was lost in the failure of the second flight of the [[Naro-1]] [[launch vehicle|carrier rocket]]. It was to have been operated by the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]], and was intended to demonstrate technology for future spacecraft. The satellite had a mass of {{convert|100|kg}},&lt;ref name="NASA-general"/&gt; and was expected to operate for at least two years.&lt;ref name="NASA-support"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/sts2_support.html|title=ILRS Mission Support Status|work=STSAT-2 Satellite Information|last=Noll|first=Carey|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525223347/http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/sts2_support.html|archivedate=25 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

STSAT-2B was originally intended to operate alongside a second spacecraft, [[STSAT-2A]]; however STSAT-2A was lost in 2009 after the payload fairing of its carrier rocket failed to separate, leaving the rocket unable to achieve orbit.&lt;ref name="2A Failure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2009/08/26/15/0601000000AEN20090826005500320F.HTML|title=S.

==Instruments==
The primary instrument aboard STSAT-2B was the [[Dual-channel Radiometer for Earth and Atmosphere Monitoring]], or DREAM, which would have measured the [[brightness temperature]] of the Earth at 23.8&amp;nbsp;GHz and 37&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?reload=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F10688%2F33744%2F01606350.pdf%3Farnumber%3D1606350&amp;authDecision=-203  Dual-channel radiometers for Earth and atmosphere monitoring (DREAM) on micro satellite STSAT-2]&lt;/ref&gt; The secondary payload, the [[Laser Retroreflector Array]] or LRA was to have been used for the Satellite Laser Ranging experiment, which was intended to determine the parameters of the satellite's orbit with a greater degree of precision. Data collected by the secondary payload would have been used to calibrate DREAM, to conduct [[geodesy|geodetic]] research, and to evaluate the performance of the carrier rocket.&lt;ref name="NASA-support"/&gt; Due to lower manufacturing tolerance, the retroreflectors on STSAT-2B would have provided greater precision than those intended on STSAT-2A.&lt;ref name="NASA-retro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/sts2_reflector.html|title=RetroReflector Array (RRA) Characteristics|work=STSAT-2 Satellite Information|last=Noll|first=Carey|publisher=NASA|accessdate=24 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524053741/http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/list_of_satellites/sts2_reflector.html|archivedate=24 May 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of technological experiments were also to have been conducted; investigating [[attitude control]] systems, and testing [[pulsed plasma thruster]]s, [[star tracker]]s, a [[Sun sensor]], as well as an experimental onboard computer, and data relay at rates of up to 10 megabits per second.&lt;ref name="NASA-support"/&gt;

==Launch==
STSAT-2B was launched by a Naro-1 rocket, flying from the [[Naro Space Center|Naro Space Centre]]. The launch was the second flight of the Naro-1, which consisted of a modified [[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]] first stage manufactured by [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center|Khrunichev]],&lt;ref name="FirstStage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=101717&amp;code=Ne2&amp;category=2|title=First-Stage Engine of Naro-1 to Arrive on Weekend|date=2 April 2010|publisher=Arirang|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a South Korean [[solid-fuel rocket|solid-fuelled]] upper stage. The previous Naro-1 launch was that of STSAT-2A, which occurred in August 2009 and ended in failure.&lt;ref name="2A Failure"/&gt;

The launch was initially scheduled to occur on 9 June 2010, during a two-hour [[launch window]] opening at 07:30 UTC (16:30 local time). Further launch attempts were available at the same time each day until 19 June 2010.&lt;ref name="LaunchDate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arirang.co.kr/News/News_View.asp?nseq=102266&amp;code=Ne2&amp;category=2|title=Korea to Launch 2nd Naro Space Rocket on June 9|author=Jang Ji-yun|date=20 April 2010|publisher=Arirang|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch attempt on 9 June 2010 was scrubbed after the launch pad's fire suppression system activated for no apparent reason.

Education has been seen as a key to socioeconomic mobility, and the advertisement appealed to Americans' belief in the possibility of self-betterment as well as threatening the consequences of downward mobility in the great [[income inequality]] existing during the [[Industrial Revolution]].]]

'''Socioeconomic mobility in the United States''' refers to the upward or downward movement of Americans from one [[social class]] or [[economic stratification|economic]] level to another,&lt;ref&gt;Random House Unabridged Dictionary second edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  through job changes, inheritance, marriage, connections, tax changes, innovation, illegal activities, hard work, lobbying, luck, health changes or other factors.

This vertical mobility can be the change in [[socioeconomic status]] between parents and children ("[[Intergenerational mobility|inter-generational]]"); or over the course of a lifetime ("intra-generational").

Socioeconomic mobility typically refers to "relative mobility", the chance that an individual American's income or social status will rise or fall in comparison to other Americans,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polity.co.uk/cbs3/PDF/Glos.pdf Glossary from politybooks.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but can also refer to "absolute" mobility, based on changes in living standards in America.

In recent years, several studies have found that vertical intergenerational mobility is lower in the US than in some European countries.&lt;ref name=DeParle&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/05/us/harder-for-americans-to-rise-from-lower-rungs.html?sq=mobility&amp;st=cse&amp;scp=1&amp;pagewanted=all Harder for Americans to Rise From Lower Rungs] | By JASON DePARLE | January 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; US social mobility has either remained unchanged or decreased since the 1970s.&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hungerford | first1 = Thomas L. | title = Changes in the distribution of income among tax filers between 1996 and 2006: The role of labor income, capital income, and tax policy | publisher = Congressional Research Service | date = December 29, 2011 | url = http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/crs-1.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hungerford | first1 = Thomas L. | title = How income mobility affects income inequality: US evidence in the 1980s and the 1990s | journal = Journal of Income Distribution | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–103 | publisher = Ad Libros Publications Inc. in association with [[York University|York University, Canada]] | date = March 2011 | url = http://pi.library.yorku.ca/ojs/index.php/jid/article/view/17971 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1506&amp;context=key_workplace Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Bradbury | first1 = Katherine | title = Trends in U.S. family income mobility, 1969–2006 (working paper no. 11-10 | publisher = Federal Reserve Bank of Boston | location = Boston, Mass | date = October 20, 2011 | url = http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2011/wp1110.htm }} [http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/wp/wp2011/wp1110.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted by the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] found that the bottom quintile is 57% likely to experience upward mobility and only 7% to experience downward mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Urahn, Susan K., et al.

A 2013 [[Brookings Institution]] study found [[income inequality in the United States|income inequality]] was increasing and becoming more permanent, sharply reducing social mobility.&lt;ref name=BrookingsPerm&gt;{{cite web|title=Inequality Rising and Permanent Over Past Two Decades|url=http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/latest-conference/2013-spring-permanent-inequality-panousi|work=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity|publisher=Brookings Institution|accessdate=23 March 2013|author=Vasia Panousi|author2=Ivan Vidangos|author3=Shanti Ramnath|author4=Jason DeBacker|author5=Bradley Heim|date=Spring 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408151547/http://www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/latest-conference/2013-spring-permanent-inequality-panousi|archivedate=8 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large academic study released in 2014 found US mobility overall has not changed appreciably in the last 25 years (for children born between 1971 and 1996), but a variety of up and down mobility changes were found in several different parts of the country. On average, American children entering the labor market today have the same chances of moving up in the income distribution (relative to their parents) as children born in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=not&gt;{{cite news|last=LEONHARDT|first=DAVID|title=Upward Mobility Has Not Declined, Study Says|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/23/business/upward-mobility-has-not-declined-study-says.html?_r=0|accessdate=January 23, 2014|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chetty&gt;{{cite web|last=Chetty|first=Raj|title=NBER WORKING PAPER SERIES, WHERE IS THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY?

However, because US income inequalities have increased substantially, the consequences of the "birth lottery" - the parents to whom a child is born - are larger today than in the past. US wealth is increasingly concentrated in the top 10% of American families, so children of the remaining 90% are more likely to be born at lower starting incomes today than the same children in the past.  Even if they are equally mobile and climb the same distance up the US socioeconomic ladder as children born 25 years earlier, the bottom 90% of the ladder is worth less now, so they gain less income value from their climb ... especially when compared to the top 10%.&lt;ref name=not/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chetty/&gt;

==Popular perception==
Many Americans strongly believe the U.S. is a "Land of Opportunity" that offers every child an equal chance at [[Social mobility|social]] and [[economic mobility]].  That Americans rise from humble origins to riches, has been called a "civil religion",&lt;ref name=DeParle/&gt; "the bedrock upon which the American story has been anchored",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/05useconomics_morton.aspx Economic Mobility: Is the American Dream Alive and Well?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503130834/http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2007/05useconomics_morton.aspx |date=2012-05-03 }} Economic Mobility Project| May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and part of the American identity (the [[American Dream]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ego4u.com/en/read-on/countries/usa/american-dream English grammar 4U online]|

"In general, the American Dream can be defined as being the opportunity and freedom for all citizens to achieve their goals and become rich and famous if only they work hard enough."&lt;/ref&gt;) This theme is celebrated in the lives of famous Americans such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Henry Ford]],&lt;ref name=DeParle/&gt; and in popular culture (from the books of [[Horatio Alger myth|Horatio Alger]] and [[Norman Vincent Peale]] to the song [[The Jeffersons#Theme song|"Movin' on Up"]]&lt;ref&gt;the theme song of the 1975–85 TV sitcom ''[[The Jeffersons]]''&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''The American Dream Report''''', a study of the Economic Mobility Project, found that Americans surveyed were more likely than citizens of other countries to agree with statements like:
* "People get rewarded for intelligence and skill", 
* "People get rewarded for their efforts";
and less likely to agree with statements like:
* "Coming from a wealthy family is 'essential' or 'very important' to getting ahead,"
* "Income differences in my country are too large" or
* "It is the responsibility of government to reduce differences in income."&lt;ref name=emp/&gt;

In the US only 32% of respondents agreed with the statement that forces beyond their personal control determine their success.  In contrast, a majority of European respondents agreed with this view in every country but three (Britain, the Czech Republic and Slovakia).&lt;ref name=economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/3518560?story_id=3518560 Ever higher society, ever harder to ascend] Whatever happened to the belief that any American could get to the top? economist.com 29 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brookings Institution]] found Americans surveyed had the highest belief in [[meritocracy]]—69% agreed with the statement "people are rewarded for intelligence and skill"—among 27 nations surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/reports/2008/~/media/CFF85818FBB34CF695503470B623EB31.ashx International Comparisons of Economic Mobility] Julia Isaacs| brookings.edu, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intergenerational mobility==

===Current state===

The correlation between parents' income and their children's income in the United States is estimated between .4 and .6. {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

If a parent's income had no effect on a child's opportunity for future upward mobility, approximately 20% of poor children who started in the bottom quintile (in the bottom 20% of the US range of incomes) would remain there as poor adults.  At the other end of income spectrum, if children were born into wealthy families in the top 20%, only 20% would stay in that top income category if their mobility opportunities were equal to every other child's in the country.

But long-term income statistics show this isn't happening.  Mobility opportunities are different for poor and wealthy children in the US. Parental incomes and parental choices of home locations while raising children appear to be major factors in that difference. According to a 2012 Pew Economic Mobility Project study&lt;ref name=Pew&gt;{{cite web|last=Urhan|first=Susan|title=Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility Across Generations|url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/reports/economic_mobility/PursuingAmericanDreampdf.pdf|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts}}&lt;/ref&gt; 43% of children born into the bottom quintile (bottom 20%) remain in that bottom quintile as adults. Similarly, 40% of children raised in the top quintile (top 20%) will remain there as adults. Looking at larger moves, only 4% of those raised in the bottom quintile moved up to the top quintile as adults. Around twice as many (8%) of children born into the top quintile fell to the bottom.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt; 37% of children born into the top quintile will fall below the middle. These findings have led researchers to conclude that "opportunity structures create and determine future generations' chances for success. Hence, our lot in life is at least partially determined by where we grow up, and this is partially determined by where our parents grew up, and so on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howell-Moroney|first=Michael|title=The Tiebout Hypothesis 50 Years Later|journal=Public Administration Review|year=2008|volume=68|page=101|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00840.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous instances of great economic and social mobility include [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Henry Ford]],&lt;ref name=DeParle/&gt; Additional popular examples of upward social mobility between generations in America include [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Bill Clinton]], who were born into working-class families yet achieved high political office in adult life.

Several large studies of mobility in developed countries in recent years have found the US among the lowest in mobility.&lt;ref name=DeParle/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAP&gt;CAP: ''[http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2006/04/b1579981.html Understanding Mobility in America]'' – April 26, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; One study (“Do Poor Children Become Poor Adults?")&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt;&lt;ref name=emp&gt;[http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP%20American%20Dream%20Report.pdf Economic Mobility Project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Corak, Miles. 2006.

Research on Economic Inequality, 13 no. 1:143–88.&lt;/ref&gt; found that of nine developed countries, the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] had the lowest intergenerational vertical social mobility with about half of the advantages of having a parent with a high income passed on to the next generation.  The four countries with the lowest "intergenerational income elasticity", i.e. the highest social mobility, were [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and [[Canada]] with less than 20% of advantages of having a high income parent passed on to their children. (see graph)&lt;ref name="CAP"/&gt; Nobel Prize-winning economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] contends that "Scandinavian countries changed their education systems, social policies and legal frameworks to create societies where there is a higher degree of mobility.

According to journalist Jason DeParle
&lt;blockquote&gt;At least five large studies in recent years have found the United States to be less mobile than comparable nations. A project led by Markus Jantti, an economist at a Swedish university, found that 42 percent of American men raised in the bottom fifth of incomes stay there as adults. That shows a level of persistent disadvantage much higher than in Denmark (25 percent) and Britain (30 percent)—a country famous for its class constraints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.iza.org/dp1938.pdf American Exceptionalism in a New Light: A Comparison of Intergenerational Earnings Mobility in the Nordic Countries, the United Kingdom and the United States] Markus Jäntti et al.| January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, just 8 percent of American men at the bottom rose to the top fifth. That compares with 12 percent of the British and 14 percent of the Danes.
Despite frequent references to the United States as a classless society, about 62 percent of Americans (male and female) raised in the top fifth of incomes stay in the top two-fifths, according to research by the Economic Mobility Project of the Pew Charitable Trusts. Similarly, 65 percent born in the bottom fifth stay in the bottom two-fifths.&lt;ref name=DeParle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP_FamiliesAcrossGenerations_ChapterI.pdf Economic mobilities of Families Across Generations] Brookings Institution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:The Great Gatsby Curve.png|right|thumb|Intergenerational immobility versus economic inequality.|450px]]
In 2012, a graph plotting the relationship between income inequality and intergenerational social mobility in the United States and twelve other developed countries—dubbed "The Great Gatsby Curve"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlenzner/2012/03/26/the-great-gatsby-curve-is-a-threat-to-the-american-dream/ Income Inequality From Generation To Generation] Robert Lenzner|  forbes.com| 26.3.2012&lt;/ref&gt;—showed "a clear negative relationship" between inequality and social mobility.&lt;ref name=krugman&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (January 15, 2012) [https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/the-great-gatsby-curve/ "The Great Gatsby Curve"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Yonatan (August 11, 2016) [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2796563 "The Great Gatsby Curve Revisited - Understanding the Relationship Between Inequality and Intergenerational Mobility"] SSRN.com&lt;/ref&gt; Countries with low levels of inequality such as [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]] had some of the greatest mobility, while the two countries with the high level of inequality—Chile and Brazil—had some of the lowest mobility. The curve was introduced in a speech by chairman of the [[Council of Economic Advisers]] [[Alan Krueger]],&lt;ref name=krugman/&gt; and the President’s Economic Report to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nber.org/erp/ERP_2012_Complete.pdf Economic Report of the President.

[[Philip Alston]], the United Nations special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, asserted in a 2017 report on an investigation of extreme [[poverty in the United States]] that "The American Dream is rapidly becoming the American Illusion since the US now has the lowest rate of social mobility of any of the rich countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Pilkington|first=Ed|title=Trump turning US into 'world champion of extreme inequality', UN envoy warns|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/15/america-un-extreme-poverty-trump-republicans|newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location= |date=December 15, 2017|access-date=December 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute mobility===
Even though mobility has gone down, most Americans still have more income than their parents. A 2007 study "Economic Mobility Project: Across Generations", using [[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]], found 67% of Americans who were children in 1968 had higher levels of real family income in 1995–2002 than their parents had in 1967–1971&lt;ref name="MAG"&gt;[http://www.economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/EMP_Across_Generations.pdf  Economic Mobility of Families Across Generations]. Julia B. Isaacs. 13 November 2007. Economic Mobility Project, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; (although most of this growth in total family income can be attributed to the increasing number of women who work since male earnings have stayed relatively stable throughout this time&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt;) As to whether this  figure is higher or lower than other countries is difficult to say as this type of measure has not been done for other countries.&lt;ref name="MAG"/&gt;

==Intragenerational mobility==

Another form of mobility—"[[Social mobility#Inter- and Intra-generational mobility|intra-generational]]"—is the change in class and/or income experienced by individuals during their lifetime. Intra-generational mobility renders the meaning of "short-term" inequality ambiguous, since high intra-generational mobility suggests that those who are currently less well-off (for instance the young) will move up the class or income scale later in life.

How strong Intra-generational mobility is in the US is disputed.&lt;ref name="debate" /&gt; Supporting relatively high levels of intragenerational mobility, Thomas A. Garrett&lt;ref name=notsobad&gt;Thomas A. Garrett. [http://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/itv/articles/?id=1920 U.S. Income Inequality: It’s Not So Bad]. Inside the Vault. Spring 2010. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.&lt;/ref&gt; reported on a US Treasury study of income mobility from 1996 to 2005. This found  "There was considerable income mobility of individuals in the U.S. economy during the 1996 through 2005 period as over half of taxpayers moved to a different income quintile over this period"; 80 percent of taxpayers had incomes in quintiles as high or higher in 2005 than they did in 1996, and 45 percent of taxpayers not in the highest income quintile moved up at least one quintile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/incomemobilitystudy03-08revise.pdf Income Mobility in the U.S. from 1996 to 2005]. Report of the DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY. November 13, 2007. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer than half (between 40–43%) "of those in the top 1 percent in 1996 were still in the top 1 percent in 2005. Only about 25 percent of the individuals in the top 1/100th percent in 1996 remained in the top 1/100th percent in 2005." The study reassured Americans "the opportunity for upward mobility" in America despite their concern about the "long-term trend of increasing income inequality in the U.S. economy" After-tax income of the top 1% earners has grown by 176% percent from 1979 to 2007 while it grew only 9% for the lowest 20%.

However others describe the data as reflecting less mobility. A 2007 inequality and mobility study found the pattern of annual and long-term earnings inequality "very close", and the population at top income levels in America "very stable" and had "not mitigated the dramatic increase in annual earnings concentration since the 1970s."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~wk2110/bin/mobility-short.pdf Uncovering the American Dream: Inequality and Mobility in Social Security Earnings Data since 1937] Wojciech Kopczuk, Emmanuel Saez, Jae Song, September 15, 2007, Figure 4B&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 [[Congressional Budget Office|CBO]] study on "Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007" also found multi-year household income distribution in America "only modestly" more equal than annual income.&lt;blockquote&gt;Given the fairly substantial movement of households across income groups over time, it might seem that income measured over a number of years should be significantly more equally distributed than income measured over one year. However, much of the movement of households involves changes in income that are large enough to push households into different income groups but not large enough to greatly affect the overall distribution of income. Multi-year income measures also show the same pattern of increasing inequality over time as is observed in annual measures.&lt;ref name=cbo&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12485 Congressional Budget Office: Trends in the Distribution of Household Income Between 1979 and 2007]. October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, "many people who have incomes greater than $1 million one year fall out of the category the next year—but that’s typically because their income fell from, say, 1.05 million to 0.95 million, not because they went back to being middle class."&lt;ref name=cbo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (November 3, 2011)[https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/millionaire-for-a-day/ "Millionaire For A Day"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] complains that conservatives have resorted to "extraordinary series of attempts at statistical distortion" in claiming high levels of mobility.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Studies by the [[Urban Institute]] and the [[US Treasury]] have both found that about half of the families who start in either the top or the bottom quintile of the income distribution are still there after a decade, and that only 3 to 6 percent rise from bottom to top or fall from top to bottom.&lt;ref name=debate&gt;[[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] (December 19, 2001) [http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-income-distribution-debate "The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate"] Prospect.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
While in any given year, some of the people with low incomes will be "workers on temporary layoff, small businessmen taking writeoffs, farmers hit by bad weather"—the rise in their income in succeeding years is not the same 'mobility' as poor people rising to middle class or middle income rising to wealth. It's the mobility of "the guy who works in the college bookstore and has a real job by his early thirties." &lt;ref name=debate/&gt;

==Causes and issues==
Explanations for the relatively low level of social mobility in the US include the better access of affluent children to superior schools and preparation for schools so important in an economy where pay is tilted toward educated workers; high levels of immigration of unskilled laborers and low rate of unionization, which leads to lower wages among the least skilled;  public health problems, like obesity and diabetes, which can limit education and employment;&lt;ref name=DeParle/&gt; the sheer size of the income gap between the rich which makes it harder to climb the proverbial income ladder when the rungs are farther apart;&lt;ref name=Noah&gt;[[Timothy Noah|Noah, Timothy]] (January 13, 2012) [http://www.tnr.com/blog/timothy-noah/99651/white-house-heres-why-you-have-care-about-inequality "White House: Here's Why You Have To Care About Inequality"] ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; poverty, since those with low income have significantly lower rates of mobility than middle and higher income individuals.&lt;ref name=Drum/&gt; The factors which affect social mobility vary across the United States as does social mobility which in favored areas is much higher than in less favored areas.&lt;ref name=SummaryHarvardJuly2013a&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendren|first=Nathaniel |author2=[[Raj Chetty]] |author3=Patrick Kline |author4=[[Emmanuel Saez]]|title=Summary of Project Findings, July 2013|date=July 2013|url=http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/website/IGE/Executive%20Summary.pdf|publisher=equality-of-opportunity.org|format=Revised draft|quote=There are some areas in the U.S. where a child's chances of success do not depend heavily on his or her parents’ income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

Multiple reports have found that education promotes economic mobility.&lt;ref name="pewstates.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility in the United States|url=http://www.pewstates.org/research/reports/pursuing-the-american-dream-85899403228|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|title=Downward Mobility from the Middle Class: Waking Up from the American Dream|url=http://www.pewstates.org/research/reports/downward-mobility-from-the-middle-class-85899380141|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Promoting Economic Mobility by Increasing Postsecondary Education|url=http://www.pewstates.org/research/reports/promoting-economic-mobility-by-increasing-postsecondary-education-85899376351|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report “Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility Across Generations” found that a four-year college degree promotes upward mobility from the bottom and prevents downward mobility from the middle and top.  For instance, having a four-year college degree makes someone born into the bottom quintile of income three times more likely to climb all the way to top as an adult.&lt;ref name="pewstates.org"/&gt;

The difference has worsened since 1979 when the average college graduate made 38% more than the average high school graduate. By 2011 college graduates averaged made 75% more income.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve chairman, [[Ben Bernanke]] cited by journalist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] in [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/brooks-the-wrong-inequality.html?_r=1 The Wrong Inequality] By DAVID BROOKS| nyt.com |31 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; "Mobility" to the "class" of college graduates has declined. Those born with parents who graduated from college have far better odds of graduating from college than those born to high school graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/01/opinion/brooks-the-wrong-inequality.html?_r=1 The Wrong Inequality] By [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]]| nyt.com |31 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars (such as Isabel Sawhill) have complained about the effect of education on mobility
&lt;blockquote&gt;“At virtually every level, education in America tends to perpetuate rather than compensate for existing inequalities. The reasons are threefold. First, the [[K–12 (education)|K through 12]] education system is simply not very strong and thus is not an effective
way to break the link between parental background and a child’s eventual success. … Second, because K–12 education is financed largely at the state and local level, resources devoted to education are closely linked with where people live and with the property wealth of their neighbors. For this and other reasons, poor children tend to go to poor schools and more advantaged children to good schools. … Finally, access both to a quality preschool experience and to higher education continues to depend quite directly on family resources.”&lt;ref&gt;2006 Policy Brief of the Brookings Institution, Isabel Sawhill (2006:3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Others (Robert M. Hauser) have defended educational attainment as also freeing "individuals from the constraints of their social origins."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/cdewp/98-12.pdf Intergenerational Economic Mobility in the United States,  Measures, Differentials and Trends] Robert M. Hauser| April 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poverty===
Comparing the US with one high-mobility state (Denmark), journalist Kevin Drum concluded that lack of mobility for [[Poverty in the United States#Child poverty|the poorest children in the United States]] seems to be the primary reason for America's lag behind other developed countries.&lt;ref name=Drum&gt;Kevin Drum (5 January 2011). [http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/01/social-mobility-america "Social Mobility in America: It's All About the Poor"] motherjones.com&lt;/ref&gt; A study from the Economic Mobility Project found that growing up in a high-poverty neighborhood increases Americans’ risk of experiencing downward mobility and explains a sizable portion of the black-white downward mobility gap. The report’s analysis also showed that black children who experience a reduction in their neighborhood’s poverty rate have greater economic success in adulthood than black children who experience poverty rates that increase or are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neighborhoods and the Black-White Mobility Gap|url=http://www.pewstates.org/research/reports/neighborhoods-and-the-black-white-mobility-gap-85899376433|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and race===
Reports analyzing the economic mobility of African-Americans compared to that of whites have found stark differences. One report found that 53 percent of blacks born in the bottom income quintile remain there as adults, while only 33 percent of whites do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pursuing the American Dream: Economic Mobility in the United States|url=http://www.pewstates.org/research/reports/pursuing-the-american-dream-85899403228|publisher=Pew Charitable Trusts Economic Mobility Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has also found that the children of black middle-class families are more likely to fall out of the middle class.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

Despite the increased presence of blacks and women in the work force over the years, women and non-whites hold jobs with less rank, authority, opportunity for advancement and pay than men and whites,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/reich/reports/ceiling1.pdf African American women are farther behind white women in jobs, says Center of American progress. Fact Finding Report of the Federal Glass Ceiling Commission], 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_and_men_at_work.html?id=1RxgAAAAIAAJ Women and men at work]'' Reskin, B., &amp; Padavic, I. (1994), Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press&lt;/ref&gt; a "[[glass ceiling]]" being said to prevent them from occupying more than a very small percentage in top managerial positions.

One explanation for this is seen in the networks of genders and ethnic groups. The more managers there are in an employees' immediate work environment, the higher the employees chances of interacting and spending time with high status/income employees, the more likely these employees are to be drawn on for promotion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/256204?origin=JSTOR-on-page Men's and Women's Networks: A Study of Interaction Patterns and Influence in an Organization] Academy of management Journal 28:2 [[Daniel J. Brass]], 1985"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ibarra | first1 = Herminia | year = 1992 | title = Homophily and Differential Returns: Sex Differences in Network Structure and Access in an Advertising Firm | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 422–47 | doi=10.2307/2393451| jstor = 2393451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the 1990s, the vast majority of all clerical and office workers are women, but made up less than half of all managers. Less than 15% of all managers were minorities, while roughly a quarter of all clerical and office employees were. The networks of women and minorities are simply not as strong as those of males and whites, putting them at a disadvantage in status/income mobility.

For women, another explanation for this "glass ceiling" effect in the American work force is the job-family trade off.&lt;ref&gt;Data from the 1996 General Social Survey examined the trade-offs that women and men made as they attempted to balance their employment and family obligations, and the multiple ways that gender affects those trade-offs (Davis &amp; Smith 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; While both men and women feel that a conflict exists between job and family, women with children, particularly married women, are more likely to either temporarily leave the labor force or cut back on employment by using flex time, working part-time or part of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Carlisle, W.

A. (1992).''Women, men and time: Gender differences in paid work, housework, and leisure.'' New York: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the outcome is lower mobility, since [[part-time]] employment is usually lower paying employment, with less chance of promotion into a higher status job or likelihood of a return to full-time employment for at least a few years.

Others have pointed out that men have statistically been willing to accept job conditions that women were not, such as working outside in extreme weather, working where you can become physically dirty on a regular basis, working more hours, etc.  This is based on survey information, and shows that it is difficult to make direct comparisons ('apples to apples').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=men+have+statistically+been+willing+to+accept+job+conditions+that+women+were+not,+such+as+working+outside+in+extreme+weather,+working+where+you+can+become+physically+dirty+on+a+regular+basis,+working+more+hours&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=koQ6nXYjjv&amp;sig=2-OvIhdFi5wZP_0q1sY9y8ptM1w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oNEdT6OOAcrM2AXvguHmCw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=men%20have%20statistically%20been%20willing%20to%20accept%20job%20conditions%20that%20women%20were%20not%2C%20such%20as%20working%20outside%20in%20extreme%20weather%2C%20working%20where%20you%20can%20become%20physically%20dirty%20on%20a%20regular%20basis%2C%20working%20more%20hours&amp;f=false Gender and Rural Development] Alexander von Humboldt| p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservatives also question the extent of gender discrimination arguing that competition between firms would lead them to bid up wages of any group if they provided the same or better value of work for less pay as employees.

===Immigration===

According to economist [[George J. Borjas]], most immigrants to the US are at "a sizable earning disadvantage" compared to native-born workers, and the earnings of different groups of immigrants vary widely. Borjas found that intergenerational upward economic mobility averaging a 5% to 10% in increase in income from the first to the second generation of immigrants although there was wide variation among ethnic groups. Other research suggests that length of time resided in the U.S. narrows the occupational gap between Hispanic immigrants and non-Hispanic whites and U.S.-born Hispanic counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagofed.org/digital_assets/publications/working_papers/2004/wp2004_15.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, ''The Occupational Assimilation of Hispanics in the U.S.'', 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Overcoming [[language barrier]]s and adjusting to the new environment and culture to American society creates barriers for new [[immigrants]], and "there is significant economic 'catching up' between the first and second generations" (second generation being defined as child with at least one parent not born in the United States). This intergenerational mobility includes poor as well as middle income groups, although among the high income Borjas noted a regression towards the mean  or equalizing tendency in income/status, whereby children of very successful immigrants tended to have lower, not higher, incomes/status than their parents, becoming successful but not as successful.&lt;ref&gt;George J. Borjas, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3844791 Making It In America: Social Mobility in the Immigrant Population]'' Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of incarceration===

According to some researchers, [[United States incarceration rate|America's high incarceration (imprisonment) rate]], and "[[War on Drugs]]" policies,  have created an underclass with severely limited social mobility. Within the United States the prison population has been steadily increasing since the early 1970s and has now surpassed two million, making it the highest per capita rate in the world. This boom has been fueled to a large extent by the [[War on Drugs]] starting in the 1980s.  In addition to the mobility handicaps of imprisonment, this "war" has effectively created a poor, immobile class by denying one of the most important tools for social mobility—education—in a number of ways

# The drug war has combined with [[Zero tolerance (schools)|public school zero-tolerance policies]] to remove tens of thousands of adolescents from their public schools.
# Denial of higher education funding has been adopted as an additional punishment for drug offenders.
# The war on drugs siphons drug users out of society and into prison.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenson, Eric; Eva S. Nilsen (2002-05-16). How to construct an underclass, or how the War on Drugs became a war on education (PDF). Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of [[prisoner education|education for convicted felons]] is compounded with difficulties in finding employment. These two factors contribute towards a high recidivism rate and downward social mobility.

===Tax expenditures===
[[Tax expenditure]]s, partial exemption of the poor from taxation through reliance on [[progressive tax|progressive income taxes]] rather than [[sales tax]]es for revenue or tax rebates such as the [[earned income tax credit]] loosely correlate with income mobility with areas which tax the poor heavily such as the [[Deep South]] showing low mobility.&lt;ref name=HarvardJuly2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendren|first=Nathaniel |author2=[[Raj Chetty]] |author3=Patrick Kline |author4=[[Emmanuel Saez]]|title=The Economic Impacts of Tax Expenditures Evidence from Spatial Variation Across the U.S|date=July 2013|url=http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/tax_expenditure_soi_whitepaper.pdf|publisher=equality-of-opportunity.org|format=Revised draft|quote=We focus on intergenerational mobility because many tax expenditures are loosely motivated by the goal of expanding opportunities for upward income mobility for low-income families. For example, deductions for education and health costs, progressive federal tax deductions for state income taxes, and tax credits aimed at low-income families such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) all are targeted toward providing increased resources to low income families with children.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT72213&gt;{{cite news|title=In Climbing Income Ladder, Location Matters: A study finds the odds of rising to another income level are notably low in certain cities, like Atlanta and Charlotte, and much higher in New York and Boston.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/business/in-climbing-income-ladder-location-matters.html|accessdate=July 22, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 22, 2013|author=David Leonhardt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The literature that supports this claim acknowledges that nontrivial confounds are inherent to this line of inquiry, however.

===Other factors===
Significant correlations have been found between intergenerational mobility and [[economic inequality]], economic and racial [[residential segregation]], measures of K-12 school quality (such as test scores and high school dropout rates), [[social capital]] indices, and measures of [[Family structure in the United States|family structure]] (such as the fraction of single parents in an area)&lt;ref name=SummaryHarvardJuly2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hendren|first=Nathaniel |author2=[[Raj Chetty]] |author3=Patrick Kline |author4=[[Emmanuel Saez]]|title=Summary of Project Findings, July 2013|date=July 2013|url=http://obs.rc.fas.harvard.edu/chetty/website/IGE/Executive%20Summary.pdf|publisher= equality-of-opportunity.org|format=Revised draft|quote=we found significant correlations between intergenerational mobility and income inequality, economic and racial residential segregation, measures of K-12 school quality (such as test scores and high school dropout rates), social capital indices, and measures of family structure (such as the fraction of single parents in an area)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of study==

Sociologists Blau and Duncan collected mobility data along with the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1962.  The data included information on occupational family backgrounds.  In 1962, 56.8% of sons with fathers who had occupations in upper nonmanual ended up with occupations in the same level.  Only 1.2% of sons with fathers who had farming occupations ended up in upper nonmanual occupations.  In 1973, these differences increased.  59.4% of sons with fathers in upper nonmanual occupations achieved occupations of this same level and 0.9% of sons with fathers in farming occupations ended up in upper nonmanual occupations.  However, the occupational structure is more rigid towards the top and bottom.  Those in lower nonmanual occupations, and upper and lower manual occupations were more likely to be vertically mobile.  Upper nonmanual occupations have the highest level of occupational inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;Kerbo, Harold. "Social Stratification and Inequality" (1996) pp. 331–32 {{ISBN|0-07-034258-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s studies found that only 20 percent of the income gap persisted between generations in America, according to the Christian Science monitor. However, by 2003 improvements in econometrics showed that poverty could endure over several generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0127/p21s01-coop.html Francis, David R."'Upward Mobility' In Real Decline, Studies Charge."] ''The Christian Science Monitor''. 27 Jan. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soro Mik'aya Patjxa''' is a high-altitude archaeological site located in the Ilave Basin in Peru, about {{convert|30|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the current shoreline of [[Lake Titicaca]]. Soro Mik'aya Patjxa was a seasonal residential site that was reused consistently by hunter-gatherers over a period of over a thousand years.

==Description==
Situated on a [[fluvial terrace]], the site was first identified by [[Mark Aldenderfer]] in 1995.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1299}} The excavated portion of Soro Mik'aya Patjxa consists of one [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|cultural layer]] of interest. 13 pits were excavated at the site.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1300}} The site was occupied at least 1,500 years before the advent of low-level agriculture in the region at around 5,000 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Watson|Haas|2017|p=4}} 

==Artefacts==
Over 80,000 [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] were recovered at the site. The artefact assemblage at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa consists primarily of flaked lithics, and also includes bones, [[ground stone]]s, charred plant remains, pigment stones ([[red ocher]]) and ceramic [[sherd]]s.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1302}}{{sfn|Haas|Stefanescu|Garcia-Putnam|Aldenderfer|2017|p=Supplementary}} As the ceramic sherds were found to stylistically post-date 1,000 AD, the sherds are considered to be intrusive.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1302}}

==Human remains==
The remains of 16 individuals were recovered from pit burials at the site. Five of the crania from the site exhibit signs of [[artificial cranial deformation|intentional cranial modification]].{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1304}} [[Isotope analysis|Isotopic analysis]], estimates of travel distance to nearby lower elevation areas, demographic profiling, and the evidence for the high use of local lithic materials suggest that the individuals at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa were permanent inhabitants of a high-altitude environment.{{sfn|Haas|Stefanescu|Garcia-Putnam|Aldenderfer|2017|}}

==Diet==
The people at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa likely relied heavily on hunting large, terrestrial mammals and intensive processing and consumption of plants.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1310}} [[Projectile point]]s dominate the flaked lithic assemblage at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1309-1310}} Additionally, the faunal assemblage is dominated by large mammals, most likely coming from ''[[Hippocamelus antisensis]]'' and the [[vicuña]]. The remains of [[guinea pig]], ''[[Lagidium viscacia]]'' and [[Orestias (fish)|carache fish]] were also identified from the small faunal remains at the site. The majority of the faunal bones recovered from the site shows evidence of burning.{{sfn|Haas|Llave|2015|p=1310}} 

The presence of large quantities of ground stones at the site and dental wear analysis indicate that the consumption of plants was an important part of the diet at Soro Mik'aya Patjxa. Only one of the 251 teeth recovered from the site shows evidence for [[dental caries]], a low rate which is typical of hunter-gatherers. Dental wear analysis suggests a diet typical of terrestrial hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Watson|Haas|2017|p=9-10}} Dental wear analysis also reveals evidence for lingual surface attrition of the maxillary anterior teeth (LSAMAT), a condition which has been linked with the intensive consumption of [[tubers]] by hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Watson|Haas|2017}}

==Archaeogenetics==
In 2018, researchers successfully sequenced the genome from ''SMP5'', a 50-55 male directly dated to around 6800 BP. ''SMP5'' shares a genetic component with later ancient DNA samples from the Lake Titicaca region, a component that is also found in modern Andean populations. When compared against modern populations, ''SMP5'' shows closest genetic affinity for the [[Quechua people]] and the [[Aymara people]]. Unlike later ancient individuals sequenced from the Lake Titicaca region, ''SMP5'', along with ''USR1'' from the [[Upward Sun River site]], ''[[Anzick-1]]'', [[Kennewick man]], and the individual tested from the [[Saqqaq culture]], shows a genetic affinity for modern [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|Siberian populations]], especially the [[Yakuts]].{{sfn|Lindo|Haas|Hofman|Apata|2018}}

He was an associate professor of Business Administration at the [[University of Haifa]] as well as a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'', a publication of the [[Middle East Forum]] think tank.

==Biography==
Steven Plaut was born in [[Philadelphia]]. In 1981, Plaut [[aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel with his family. He died on January 17, 2017, in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]] at the age of 65 after battling cancer for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gotlieb|first1=Andy|title=Former Philadelphian, University of Haifa Professor Steven Plaut Dies at 65|url=http://jewishexponent.com/2017/01/19/former-philadelphian-university-haifa-professor-steven-plaut-dies-65/|accessdate=20 January 2017|work=Jewish Exponent|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levi Julian|first1=Hana|title=Professor Steven Plaut, z’l|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/news/breaking-news/professor-steven-plaut-zl/2017/01/19/|accessdate=21 January 2017|work=The Jewish Press|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic career===
Plaut received his [[Bachelor of Arts|undergraduate degree]] from [[Temple University]] in Philadelphia and his [[Master of Arts|MA]] from [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. He received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from [[Princeton University]],&lt;ref name=ProCon&gt;{{cite web|title=Steven Plaut, PhD|url=http://deathpenalty.procon.org/view.source.php?sourceID=006291|work=ProCon.org|accessdate=7 April 2014|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; specializing in international and urban economics and later in [[finance]]. Plaut worked at the [[Federal Reserve Bank]].&lt;ref name=ProCon/&gt; Before his professorship at the Haifa University, he taught at [[Oberlin College]], the [[Technion]], [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[University of California, Irvine|UC Irvine]], [[Central European University]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[University of Nantes]], and Athens Laboratory for Business Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plaut|first=Steven|title=Steven Plaut, CV attachment|url=http://economics.ceu.edu/people/steven-plaut|publisher=Central European University|accessdate=22 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130143846/http://economics.ceu.edu/people/steven-plaut|archivedate=30 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary career===
In his 1985 book titled ''The Joy of Capitalism'', Plaut argues for [[free market]] economics and compares the profit motive to the [[libido]]. In the book he discusses energy, housing, banking and agricultural policy as well as equality and income distribution.

In his 2002 book ''The Scout'' Steven Plaut describes his near-death experience as a [[kidney cancer]] patient at an [[intensive care]] ward. The historical novel is a series of life stories exchanged between him and another patient in the ward, an Israeli [[Bedouin]] scout.

===Political views===
Steven Plaut was an outspoken critic of the Israeli-Arab peace process and Israel's unilateral withdrawal policy. Since the [[Oslo Accords]], he argued that Arab leaders would continue to seek the destruction of Israel through violence and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plaut|first=Steven|title=The Oslo Final Solution|url=http://conservativetruth.org/opinionet/archives/stevenplaut/06-22-02.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205235822/http://conservativetruth.org/opinionet/archives/stevenplaut/06-22-02.shtml|archivedate=2012-02-05|accessdate=2016-01-22|deadurl=yes|publisher=Conservative Truth|date=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his political writings are criticisms of [[Nakba Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plaut|first=Steven|title=Op-Ed: Happy Nakba Day!|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/11654#.UVYXlpPvuSo|work=Israel National News|accessdate=29 March 2013|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plaut|first=Steven|title=The ‘Nakba’ Debunked|url=https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/94805/nakba-debunked-steven-plaut|accessdate=18 June 2018|date=1 June 2011|df=}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plaut was critical of many Israeli left-wing figures,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plaut|first=Steven|title=Personal Blog|url=http://stevenplaut.blogspot.co.il/|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some Americans such as [[Michael Lerner (rabbi)|Michael Lerner]] and [[Norman Finkelstein]], whom he described as [[self-hating Jew]]s and apologists for terrorism that are promoting the destruction of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Plaut|first=Steven|title=Stupid Left, Satanic Left|url=http://www.thejewishpress.com/news_article.asp?article=1870|work=Jewish Press|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427085537/http://www.thejewishpress.com/news_article.asp?article=1870|archivedate=2005-04-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaut was opposed to what he saw as left-wing extremism in Israeli universities, and was actively involved in Isracampus, a self-proclaimed watchdog organization that publicizes anti-Israel people and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Page|url=http://www.isracampus.org.il/|work=IsraCampus|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nesher|first=Talila|title=10 percent of Israeli academics labeled 'anti-Zionist' by campus watchdogs|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/10-percent-of-israeli-academics-labeled-anti-zionist-by-campus-watchdogs-1.408535|work=Haaretz|accessdate=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Canadian ''[[The Jewish Tribune (Canada)|Jewish Tribune]]'', he denounced [[Anarchists Against the Wall]], a group protesting the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] which he said was composed of "violent hooligans and anarcho-fascist thugs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Plaut |first=Steven |title=Pepe Le Pew makes aliyah and protects the Jews |url=http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/200907221846/Pepe-Le-Pew-makes-aliyah-and-protects-the-Jews.html |accessdate=22 July 2009 |newspaper=The Jewish Tribune |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090727093000/http://www.jewishtribune.ca/TribuneV2/index.php/200907221846/Pepe-Le-Pew-makes-aliyah-and-protects-the-Jews.html |archivedate=July 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''The most important lesson of recent years, and it is by now understood by everyone except university leftists and anti-Israel journalists, is that nothing will really put an end to the terror and rockets from Gaza other than some good old-fashioned R&amp;D – Reoccupation and Denazification. Everything else is a delusion. Israel must re-occupy the Gaza Strip, subject it to martial law, and carry out a decades-long program of Denazification.''

==Libel case==
Plaut was sued for libel by [[Neve Gordon]], a faculty member at the [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] Department of Politics and Government, claiming that Plaut slandered him in certain articles and alleged e-mails. In May 2006, the [[Nazareth]] Magistrate's Court ruled in favor of Gordon, and ordered Plaut to pay Gordon 80,000 shekels in compensation plus 15,000 shekels in legal fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Ira|title=U.S.-born professor guilty of libeling colleague|url=http://www.haaretz.com/u-s-born-professor-guilty-of-libeling-colleague-1.189859|accessdate=29 March 2013|newspaper=Haaretz|date=9 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides [[appeal]]ed to the Nazareth District Court, and in February 2008, the court reversed three out of four of the libel claims but upheld a libel judgment relating to the fourth, a publication in which Plaut called Gordon a "Judenrat Wannabe". It reduced the damages to 10,000 shekels (about $2,700) on the basis that, in the court's view, Plaut was entitled to criticize Gordon.&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web

==Letter to Turkish Prime Minister==
In March 2013, a letter from Plaut was received by the office of [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], Prime Minister of Turkey. The letter condemned as illegal Turkey's occupation of [[Northern Cyprus]] and attacked the Turkish Prime Minister, accusing him  of being behind the Gaza Flotilla "terrorist attack" on Israeli soldiers. Plaut apologized for Israel not killing a larger number of "terrorists" on the flotilla ship. He claimed it was time to give back "occupied Constantinople" to its "true owner", namely, Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Netanyahu'nun özrü İsrailli profesörü çılgına çevirdi |url=http://www.zaman.com.tr/dis-haberler_netanyahunun-ozru-israilli-profesoru-cilgina-cevirdi_2070169.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329081438/http://www.zaman.com.tr/dis-haberler_netanyahunun-ozru-israilli-profesoru-cilgina-cevirdi_2070169.html |archivedate=29 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Zaman (newspaper)|Zaman]] |date=26 March 2013 |language=Turkish |agency=[[Cihan News Agency|Cihan]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Köseoğlu |first=Ferhan |title=Netanyahu'nun özrü İsrailli profesörü çılgına çevirdi |url=http://dunya.milliyet.com.tr/netanyahu-nun-ozru-israilli-profesoru-cilgina-cevirdi/dunya/dunyadetay/26.03.2013/1685582/default.htm |accessdate=29 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Milliyet]] |date=26 March 2013 |language=Turkish |agency=Cihan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boums.JPG|thumb |alt=Boums lake |Boums Lake in [[Haute-Garonne]], one of the many lakes near Toulouse suspected to have held the 'cursed' riches]]

The '''Gold of Tolosa''' (also the '''''aurum Tolosanum''''') existed as a hoard of treasures plundered from Greece (allegedly the sanctuary of [[Apollo]] at [[Delphi]]) in 279 BC by [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invaders]] of the [[Volcae]] (often denoted incorrectly as [[Galatians (People)|Galatians]], despite the later migration of some Volcae Tectosagi to Galatia). It was often noted that, during the siege of Apollo's sanctuary at Delphi, the Gallic leader, [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]], was badly wounded (many contemporary sources state some kind of [[divine]] intervention, and the battle was lost against a combined force of [[Thracians]], [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], [[Triballi]] and [[Illyrians]]). Many, after their fortunes reversed, retreated back into the Balkans, some to the Volcae heartlands, and many others back to Gaul itself, dumping their plunder into the lakes near Tolosa (modern-day [[Toulouse]]), believing that the loot was cursed. The faltering of Brennus's ''great expedition'', however, helped create the Gallic exclaves around [[Tylis]] and in [[Galatia]], the latter of which remaining ''de facto'' independent for centuries to come. 

For the curse to be lifted, according to Celtic [[paganism]], the treasure had to be offered back to the Celtic gods, and so was left in the lakes. Other guilty warriors hid their treasure in the vegetation around the lakes. The lakes at Tolosa were used many years thereafter as a place of pagan worship, but nobody (who believed in the curse) dared recover the glinting treasures from the sandy lake bed. Some of the treasures, however, did find their way into the temples of Tolosa, but the same religious taboo of their theft still presided.

== Roman history of Tolosa and Strabo's account ==
[[File:Volcae Arecomisci and Tectosages (migrations).svg|thumb |alt=The course of Volcae migration in the 3rd centuries BC |The course of Volcae tribal migration throughout the 3rd centuries BC, noting the destination of some Tectosages and the Arecomisci to the area around Tolosa]]

''And it is further said that the [Volcae] ''Tectosages'' shared in the expedition to [[Delphi]];  and even the treasures that were found among them in the city of [[Toulouse]] by [[Quintus Servilius Caepio|Caepio]], a general of the Romans, were, it is said, a part of the valuables that were taken from [[Delphi]], although the people, in trying to consecrate them and propitiate the god, added thereto out of their personal properties, and it was on account of having laid hands on them that Caepio ended his life in misfortunes — for he was cast out by his native land as a temple-robber, and he left behind as his heirs female children only, who, as it turned out, became prostitutes, as [[Timagenes]] has said, and therefore perished in disgrace.''  [Note that Strabo here is mistaken, since Caepio did have a [[Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger|son]], the maternal grandfather of [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], the principal assassin of [[Julius Caesar]].]

However, in 105 BC, the proconsul of [[Cisalpine Gaul]], [[Quintus Servilius Caepio]], reported the discovery of the gold at Tolosa to the Senate, and was charged with sending the treasure back to Rome. Over 50,000 15&amp;nbsp;lb. bars of gold and 10,000 15&amp;nbsp;lb. bars of silver were found. The gold disappeared en route, with Strabo mentioning that "''it was on account of laying hands on them that Caepio ended his life in misfortunes...''". It was reported that the gold was stolen by a band of marauders, with many contemporaries and modern historians believing that Caepio himself had hired them. Indeed, Caepio did go on to lose the [[Battle of Arausio]] by his hubris, and was prosecuted for corruption by the Senate. He spent the rest of his days in exile at [[Smyrna]], tried for the loss of his army by [[Gaius Norbanus]]. The curse was reported to have continued with his son, [[Quintus Servilius Caepio the Younger]], who fought for Rome in the [[Social War (91–88 BC)|Social War]]. He barely escaped an accusation of ''maiestas'' ('diminution of the majesty of the people of Rome') after disputing with the tribune [[Marcus Livius Drusus (tribune)|Marcus Livius Drusus]] who was also his brother-in-law, and ''princeps senatus'' [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]]. Caepio perished in an ambush executed by the general [[Quintus Poppaedius Silo]]. The gold of Tolosa itself was never found, and was said to have been passed all the way down to the last heir of the ''Caepiones'', [[Marcus Junius Brutus]].

''But however, the account of [[Poseidonius]] is more plausible:  for he says that the treasure that was found in Tolosa amounted to about fifteen thousand talents (part of it in sacred lakes), unwrought, that is, merely gold and silver bullion;  whereas the temple at Delphi was in those times already empty of such treasure, because it had been robbed at the time of the sacred war by the [[Phocians]];  but even if something was left, it was divided by many among themselves;  neither is it reasonable to suppose that they reached their homeland in safety, since they fared wretchedly after their retreat from Delphi and, because of their dissensions, were scattered, some in one direction, others in another.  But, as has been said both by Poseidonius and several others, since the country was rich in gold, and also belonged to people who were god-fearing and not extravagant in their ways of living, it came to have treasures in many places in Celtica;  but it was the lakes, most of all, that afforded the treasures their inviolability, into which the people let down heavy masses of silver or even of gold.   At all events, the Romans, after they mastered the regions, sold the lakes for the public treasury, and many of the buyers found in them hammered mill-stones of silver.   And, in Tolosa, the temple too was hallowed, since it was very much revered by the inhabitants of the surrounding country, and on this account the treasures there were excessive, for numerous people had dedicated them and no one dared to lay hands on them.''

''All above quotes:'' '''''[[Geographica]]''''' ([[Strabo]]), ''Book IV Chapter I''

The lakes at Tolosa were also briefly mentioned in Cicero's ''On the Nature of the Gods'' (Chapter 30), referencing political scandal in the late [[Roman Republic]]: "''Consider other judicial inquiries, the one in reference to the gold of Tolosa, and the one on the Jugurthine conspiracy...''".

'''''The Incredibles''''' is an American [[media franchise]] created by Pixar Animation Studios. [[Brad Bird]] wrote and directed both films, and [[Craig T. Nelson]], [[Holly Hunter]], [[Sarah Vowell]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] are part of the cast. The first film, ''[[The Incredibles]]'', was released in November 2004 and received acclaim from critics, winning the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. The second film, ''[[Incredibles 2]]'', was released in June 2018, received mostly positive reviews and set the record for best opening weekend for an animated film with $183 million. The series has grossed a combined $1.873 billion worldwide.

==Films==

===''The Incredibles'' (2004)===
{{main|The Incredibles}}
A family of superheroes, while trying to live a quiet suburban life after superheroes are deemed illegal, are forced into action to save the world.

===''Incredibles 2'' (2018)===
{{main|Incredibles 2}}
In an effort to reinstate the public's trust in superheroes, Helen (Elastigirl) is chosen by a telecommunications corporation to pull off a publicity stunt while her husband Bob (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for their kids, Violet, Dash and Jack-Jack.

===Future films===
Following the release of ''Incredibles 2'', director [[Brad Bird]] acknowledged that the film's truncated production schedule resulted in many plotlines and ideas he had for the film being cut from the final version. He cited Pixar's decision in October 2016 to swap the release dates of ''[[Toy Story (franchise)#Toy Story 4|Toy Story 4]]'' and ''Incredibles 2'', which meant that Bird’s film lost a full year of production. Bird stated that the lingering plotlines could lead to a third installment, just as they did with the second. "There were a lot of ideas that we had on this film that could be [used]... whether it's another ''Incredibles'' film, or something else."&lt;ref name=EW/&gt; Cast members including [[Samuel L. Jackson]] and [[Sophia Bush]] have expressed interest in reprising their roles. "I wouldn't ever rule it out," said producer [[John Walker (film producer)|John Walker]] of a potential third film. "And if past is prologue, it'll be another 14 years — and a lot of people will probably need oxygen to make a third one."&lt;ref name=EW&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/06/17/incredibles-3-potential-brad-bird/|title=Could there be an Incredibles 3? Director Brad Bird weighs in|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|last=Snetiker|first=Marc|date=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jack-Jack Attack'' (2005)===
{{Main article|Jack-Jack Attack}}
A short film was released on March 15, 2005 on the first film's DVD release, entitled ''Jack-Jack Attack.'' Bird returned to write and direct the short. It was originally conceived to be part of the first film, but decided to make it into a short. The short takes place during the events of the first film and follows Kari as she babysits Jack-Jack while discovering his newly awakened superpowers in the process.

===''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' (2005)===
{{main article|Mr. Incredible and Pals}}
Another short film titled ''Mr. Incredible and Pals'' was also included on the first film's DVD release.

It follows Mr. Incredible, Frozone, and their rabbit pal Mister Skipperdoo's attempt to prevent a bridge from being destroyed. [[Craig T. Nelson]] and [[Samuel L. Jackson]] appear in character as Mr. Incredible and Frozone respectively in the short's commentary track.

===''Auntie Edna'' (2018)===

A short film entitled '' Auntie Edna'' was released on October 23, 2018 included with the digital release of ''Incredibles 2''  and on November 6, 2018 with the film's DVD and Blu-ray release. In a similar manner to ''Jack-Jack Attack'', the short follows Edna during the events of ''Incredibles 2'' as she babysits Jack-Jack while coping with his newly discovered powers.

==Production==
===Production for the first film===
''The Incredibles'' as a concept dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during a period in which he tried to break into film.&lt;ref name="dvdint1"&gt;

Animation]] and was in the process of directing his first feature, ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch02"/&gt; Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; He stated, "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But I think that what was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie."&lt;ref&gt;Paik, Karen. (2007) ''To Infinity and Beyond!: The Story of Pixar Animation Studios,'' Chronicle Books LLC, pg. 236–37.&lt;/ref&gt; After the box office failure of ''The Iron Giant'', Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"&gt;Price, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PixarTouch02"&gt;Price, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

He imagined it as a homage to the 1960s comic books and [[spy film]]s from his boyhood and he initially tried to develop it as a [[Traditional animation#Cels|2D cel animation]].&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; When ''The Iron Giant'' became a [[box office bomb]], he reconnected with old friend [[John Lasseter]] at [[Pixar]] in March 2000 and pitched his story idea to him.&lt;ref name="IGNint"/&gt; Bird and Lasseter knew each other from their college years at [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch04"/&gt; Lasseter was sold on the idea and convinced Bird to come to Pixar, where the film would be done in [[computer animation]]. The studio announced a multi-film contract with Bird on May 4, 2000,&lt;ref name="PixarTouch03"/&gt; breaking Pixar's mold of having directors who had all risen through the ranks. ''The Incredibles'' was written and directed solely by Brad Bird, a departure from previous Pixar productions which typically had two or three directors and as many screenwriters.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch06"&gt;Price, p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it would be the company's first film in which all characters are human.&lt;ref name="PixarTouch04"&gt;Price, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production for the second film=== 
Following the first film, [[Brad Bird]] directed his next film for Pixar, ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]'', which was released in June 2007. Near its premiere, Bird said he was open to an idea of a sequel to ''The Incredibles'', but only if it could be even better than the original. He stated, "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=21218 | title=Bird on Toy Story 3 and The Incredibles 2 | date=June 22, 2007 | accessdate=June 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 2013 interview, Bird reiterated his interest in a sequel: "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have—because I love those characters, and love that world." He added: "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head. I have many, many elements that I think would work really well in another ''Incredibles'' film, and if I can get 'em to click all together, I would probably wanna do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/brad-bird-incredibles-sequel-i-523427 | title=Brad Bird on 'Incredibles' Sequel: 'I Would Probably Wanna Do That' (Q&amp;A) | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]| date=May 16, 2013 | accessdate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While publicizing the first film, Bird had already conceptualized the eventual approach where Bob and Helen would switch roles, and Jack-Jack would develop multiple powers yet known by the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/la-et-me-incredibles-2-premiere-20180606-story.html | title = 'Incredibles 2' team on the sequel's 14-year gap, and putting Elastigirl center stage | first = Christina | last = Schoellkopf | date = June 7, 2018 | accessdate = June 8, 2018 | work = [[The Los Angeles Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Um-Shmum''' ({{lang-he-n|או"ם שמום}}, where ''um'' is the Hebrew acronymic pronunciation for "[[U.N.]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew|או"ם}} pronounced "oom", acronym for {{Hebrew|אומות}} (pr. "oomot") "nations, peoples", and {{Hebrew|מאוחדות}} (pr. "m'ookhadot") "united"; "the U.N." is {{Hebrew|האומות המאוחדות}} (pronounced "ha-oomot ha-m'ookhadot").&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Shm-reduplication|"shm"-prefix]] signifies dismissal, contempt or irony) is a phrase coined by the Israeli [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Minister of Defense]] (and former [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]]) [[David Ben-Gurion]] on 29 March 1955 during a debate within the Israeli cabinet regarding his plan to take the [[Gaza Strip]] from [[Egypt]] in response to the increasing [[Palestinian fedayeen|fedayeen]] [[terror attack]]s.
This utterance towards the [[United Nations]] is an expression that reflects, even as to date, the way many Israelis feel about the institution.

The original expression was uttered as a response to Prime Minister [[Moshe Sharett]], who had stated in the previous cabinet session that if it hadn't been for the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine#The vote|UN resolution of 1947]], the State of Israel would not have been founded. According to Sharett's account in his diary, Ben-Gurion shouted: "Not at all! Only the daring of the Jews founded this country, and not some ''Um-Shmum'' resolution."&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Sharett, ''Yoman ishi'' [=Personal Diary], vol. 3, Tel-Aviv: Sifriyat Ma'ariv, 1978, p. 874 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Kofi Annan]] quoted this phrase while visiting the [[Knesset]] (Israeli Parliament) and made a rebutting [[pun]] himself by saying that in the world that we live in today, "without the UM we will all have ''klum''" (''klum'' is part of expressions that mean "nothing" in Hebrew).&lt;ref&gt;{{Hebrew|כלום}} (pronounced kloom).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mwcnews.net/focus/letters-to-editors/13648-netanyahu-un.html Full Transcript: Netanyahu's 2011 UN Speech], MWC News Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Umbertide''' ({{IPA-it|umˈbɛrtide|It}}) is a town and ''[[comune]]'' (township) of [[Italy]], in the [[province of Perugia]] and  in northwestern [[Umbria]], at the confluence of the Reggia river and the [[Tiber]]. It is 30&amp;nbsp;km (19&amp;nbsp;mi) North of [[Perugia]] and 20&amp;nbsp;km (12&amp;nbsp;mi) South of [[Città di Castello]]. With 16,607 inhabitants according to the 2017 census, Umbertide is one of the larger towns of Umbria; and basically flat. It is an industrial center producing machine tools, textiles, packaging material, and ceramics. Olive oil is produced, especially in Pierantonio and in its southwestern part.

==Economy==

Umbertide is an important centre of automotive factories. There is the headquarters of Tiberina holding, a car components group. Other important companies are Proma, Modulo and [[Terex]] [[Genie]].

== History==
Umbertide or the surrounding area was inhabited in pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] and Roman times. At the top of Monte Acuto has been discovered an umbrian fortification ("castelliere").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacantinadinunzio.it/lacantinadinunzio/gli_eventi_3_files/poster4definitivo.pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328135751/http://www.lacantinadinunzio.it/lacantinadinunzio/gli_eventi_3_files/poster4definitivo.pdf |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nineteenth‑century archaeologist [[Mariano Guardabassi]] even attributed a small building at Lame, about 1&amp;nbsp;km from the center of the modern town, to the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]], although this is by no means certain The Roman town of ''Pitulum Mergens'', destroyed by [[Totila]] in the mid-6th century, may account for Roman remains in S.&amp;nbsp;Maria delle Sette. In its present incarnation, Umbertide was founded in the 8th or 10th century, depending on the scholar; its original name was Fratta, and it received its present name in 1863 in honor of then Crown Prince [[Umberto I|Umberto]] and of [[Hubert, Duke of Spoleto|Uberto]] or Umberto [[margrave of Tuscany]], whose four sons, Adalberto, Ingilberto, Benedetto and Bonifacio, according to tradition, rebuilt the town in 796 on the ruins of ''Pitulum Mergens''.

==Main sights==
Although there are remains of the medieval walls,  a few medieval houses, and part of the [[Rocca di Umbertide]], or citadel, many of Umbertide's best monuments are of later periods.

*Churches
**''[[Santa Maria della Reggia, Umbertide|Santa Maria della Reggia]]'' is the main church in town, a collegiate church often referred to simply as the ''Collegiata'': it is an octagonal 16th century brick building topped by an elegant cupola, housing a few paintings by [[Niccolò Circignani]]. 
**[[Santa Maria della Pietà, Umbertide|''Santa Maria della Pietà'']] with the attractive funerary chapel of the counts of Sorbello, is late medieval and [[Renaissance]] church. 
**[[Santa Croce, Umbertide|''Santa Croce'']] is a 17th‑century church, now housing a painting gallery, including a ''Deposition'' by [[Luca Signorelli]]. 
**[[San Francesco, Umbertide|''San Francesco'']] is the largest church, built in [[Gothic architecture]]: in the early 21st century it was undergoing a major restoration that promised to be protracted. 
**''Cristo Risorto'' twentieth‑century church.

Beyond the city limits, the township's principal monuments are:
*Castle of Civitella Ranieri, 5&amp;nbsp;km (3&amp;nbsp;mi) NE, one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in Umbria.
*Abbey of S. Salvatore di Montecorona 4&amp;nbsp;km (2.5&amp;nbsp;mi) S, which has a beautiful eleventh‑century crypt with early Romanesque capitals and naïve 18th century painted ceilings.
*[[Castello di Polgeto|Castle of Polgeto]], a medieval structure
*Abbey church of S. Bartolomeo de' Fossi, sited on a sharp ridge with distant views on either side
*[[Borgo Santa Giuliana]]: a walled medieval village of

'''Voter suppression''' is a strategy to influence the outcome of an [[election]] by discouraging or preventing specific groups of people from [[voting]]. It is distinguished from [[political campaigning]] in that campaigning attempts to change likely voting behavior by changing the opinions of potential voters through persuasion and organization. Voter suppression, instead, attempts to reduce the number of voters who might vote against a candidate or proposition.

The tactics of voter suppression range from minor changes to make voting less convenient,  to physically intimidating and even physically attacking prospective voters, which is illegal. Voter suppression can be effective if a significant number of voters are intimidated or disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="Powers"&gt;{{cite news | last = Powers | first = Scott |author2=David Damron | title =Analysis: 201,000 in Florida didn't vote because of long lines | newspaper = [[Orlando Sentinel]] | location = Orlando, FL | date = January 29, 2013 | url =http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2013-01-29/business/os-voter-lines-statewide-20130118_1_long-lines-sentinel-analysis-state-ken-detzner | accessdate = 2016-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Shelby v.

==Examples==

===Australia===
In Australia, it is mandatory for citizens to enroll to vote and it is their responsibility to update their enrollment when they change their address. Even so, it is estimated that about 6% of eligible Australian voters are not enrolled, or are enrolled incorrectly. These are disproportionately younger voters, many of whom might neglect to enroll when they attain [[voting age]].

In 2006, the [[Howard Government]] legislated to close the electoral roll much earlier once an election was called. While previously, voters had been allowed seven days of grace after an election had been called to arrange or update their enrollment, new voters were now allowed only until 8:00 pm on the day that the electoral [[Writ of election|writ]] was issued to lodge their enrollment form, while those who needed to update their addresses were allowed three days. In Australia, the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] effectively has the right to determine the date of the election, so long as constitutional rules regarding the maximum term of the parliament are adhered to. This measure was therefore likely to result in many newer voters being precluded from voting in the first election for which they were eligible because the time to arrange their enrollment once an election is called had been greatly reduced.

The measure was widely seen as an attempt at voter suppression aimed at younger voters,&lt;ref&gt;Orr, Graeme [http://inside.org.au/court-by-surprise-the-high-court-upholds-voting-rights/ "Court by surprise: the High Court upholds voting rights"], 6 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who surveys had shown are more likely than the general population to vote for the then opposition, the [[Australian Labor Party]], or the [[Australian Greens|Greens]].&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Ron [http://resources.news.com.au/files/2011/07/22/1226099/942923-aus-file-young-voters.pdf "Youth Federal Election Voting Intentions: A Statistical and Graphical Analysis of Newspoll Quarterly Data 1996–2010"], The Whitlam Institute, June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Government denied that they were trying to suppress some voters, insisting that the purpose of the reform was to smooth the administration of elections and to reduce the possibility of electoral fraud. This was in spite of the fact that the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] had requested no such reform, there was no evidence of significant electoral fraud and that the Australian Electoral Commission had been dealing with hundreds of thousands of late enrollments without significant problems for decades.

In July 2010, the [[Left-wing politics|left-leaning]] lobby group [[GetUp!]] launched a challenge to this law. The [[High Court of Australia]] expedited the hearing so that a ruling could be made in time for the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]]. The majority ruling struck down early closing of the roll, reinstating the old rule allowing voters seven days grace to arrange or update their enrollment.

Australian citizens of the ages 16 or 17 can enroll online&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/enrol/ enroll online]&lt;/ref&gt; so that when they turn 18 they are able to vote.

=== Canada ===
Shortly before the [[Canadian federal election, 2011|Canadian 2011 Federal Election]], vote suppression tactics were [[2011 Canadian federal election voter suppression scandal|exercised by issuing robocalls and live calls to notify voters]] that their polling station had changed. The locations offered by these messages were intentionally false, often to lead voters several hours from the correct stations, and often identified themselves illegally as coming from [[Elections Canada]].&lt;ref name="canconrobocall"&gt;{{cite news

In litigation brought by [[The Council of Canadians]], a federal court found that such fraud had occurred and had probably been perpetrated by someone with access to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]]'s voter database, including its information about voter preferences.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"&gt;{{cite news | last = MacCharles| first = Tonda| title = Robocalls: Widespread but ‘thinly scattered’ vote suppression didn’t affect election, judge rules| newspaper = [[Toronto Star]] | date = May 23, 2013 | url = https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2013/05/23/robocalls_widespread_but_thinly_scattered_vote_suppression_didnt_affect_election_judge_rules.html | accessdate = 2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court stated that the evidence did not prove that the Conservative Party or its successful candidates were directly involved.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;  It did, however, criticize the Conservative Party for making “little effort to assist with the investigation”.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;  The court did not annul the result in any of six [[Electoral district (Canada)|ridings]] where the fraud had occurred, because it concluded that the number of votes affected had been too small to affect the outcome.&lt;ref name="MacCharles"/&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Voter suppression in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], elections are administered locally, and forms of voter suppression vary among jurisdictions. At the founding of the country, the right to vote in most states was limited to property-owning white males.&lt;ref name="Carroll2003"&gt;Bret Carroll.

In 2013, discriminatory [[voter ID laws]] arose following the Supreme Court's decision to strike down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which some argue amount to voter suppression among African-Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childress|first1=Sarah|title=With Voting Rights Act Out, States Push Voter ID Laws|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/with-voting-rights-act-out-states-push-voter-id-laws/|work=FRONTLINE|publisher=PBS|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childress|first1=Sarah|title=Supreme Court Strikes Blow to Voting Rights Act: What's Next?|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/supreme-court-strikes-blow-to-voting-rights-act-whats-next/|work=FRONTLINE|publisher=PBS|date=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, federal judges have overturned voting restrictions in several states on the grounds that they were intentionally discriminatory. In North Carolina, Republican lawmakers requested data on various voting practices, broken down by race. They then passed laws that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans. Among other things, they cut back on early voting.&lt;ref name="wpnc"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=July 29, 2016 |title=Appeals court strikes down North Carolina’s voter-ID law |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/appeals-court-strikes-down-north-carolinas-voter-id-law/2016/07/29/810b5844-4f72-11e6-aa14-e0c1087f7583_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the North Carolina GOP sent out a press release celebrating the decline in early voting by African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=NBC News |date=November 7, 2017 |title=Black Turnout Down in North Carolina After Cuts to Early Voting |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/black-turnout-down-north-carolina-after-cuts-early-voting-n679051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Mother Jones |date=November 7, 2016 |title=North Carolina GOP Brags About How Few Black People Were Able to Vote Early |url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/north-carolina-gop-brags-about-how-few-black-people-were-able-vote-early/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, a voter ID law requiring a driver's license, passport, military identification, or gun permit, was repeatedly found to be intentionally discriminatory. The state's election laws could be put back under the control of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). Under Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]], however, the DOJ has expressed support for Texas's ID law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Atlantic |date=August 24, 2017 |title=A Court Strikes Down Texas's Voter ID Law For the Fifth Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sessions was accused by [[Coretta Scott King]] in 1986 of trying to suppress the black vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=January 10, 2017 |title=Read the letter Coretta Scott King wrote opposing Sessions’s 1986 federal nomination |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/01/10/read-the-letter-coretta-scott-king-wrote-opposing-sessionss-1986-federal-nomination/}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ID law in North Dakota, which would have disenfranchised large numbers of Native Americans, was also overturned.&lt;ref name="nprvote"&gt;{{cite web |website=NPR |date=August 2, 2016 |title=As November Approaches, Courts Deal Series Of Blows To Voter ID Laws |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/02/488392765/as-november-approaches-courts-deal-series-of-blows-to-voter-id-laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wisconsin, a federal judge found that the state's restrictive voter ID law led to "real incidents of disenfranchisement, which undermine rather than enhance confidence in elections, particularly in minority communities"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyp.is/Mrc_rAC9EeiVTFMDt_YwQA/elections.wi.gov/sites/default/files/news/petersonruling_pdf_14890.pdf|title=Case: 3:15-cv-00324-jdp Document #: 234 In the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;; and, given that there was no evidence of widespread voter impersonation in Wisconsin, found that the law was "a cure worse than the disease." In addition to imposing strict voter ID requirements, the law cut back on early voting, required people to live in a ward for at least 28 days before voting, and prohibited emailing absentee ballots to voters.&lt;ref name="nprvote" /&gt;

Other controversial measures include shutting down [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] (DMV) offices in minority neighborhoods, making it more difficult for residents to obtain voter IDs;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=CNN |title=DOT launches investigation in Alabama over DMV closures |date=December 9, 2015 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/09/politics/alabama-dmv-closures-voting-rights/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Esquire |title=The State of Alabama Has Fully Lost Its Mind |date=April 12, 2017 |url=http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a54465/alabama-bentley-resign-church-police/}}&lt;/ref&gt; shutting down polling places in minority neighborhoods;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Nation |title=There Are 868 Fewer Places to Vote in 2016 Because the Supreme Court Gutted the Voting Rights Act |date=November 4, 2016 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/there-are-868-fewer-places-to-vote-in-2016-because-the-supreme-court-gutted-the-voting-rights-act/}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematically depriving precincts in minority neighborhoods of the resources they need to operate efficiently, such as poll workers and voting machines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Long Lines at Minority Polling Places |date=September 24, 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/25/opinion/long-lines-at-minority-polling-places.html?_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and purging voters from the rolls shortly before an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Ruling Preserves Voting Rights for Thousands in North Carolina |date=November 4, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/05/us/north-carolina-voting-rights.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, voter fraud is cited as a justification for such laws even when the incidence of voter fraud is low. In Iowa, lawmakers passed a strict voter ID law with the potential to disenfranchise 260,000 voters. Out of 1.6 million votes cast in Iowa in 2016, there were only 10 allegations of voter fraud; none were cases of impersonation that a voter ID law could have prevented.  Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate, the architect of the bill, admitted, "We've not experienced widespread voter fraud in Iowa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=The Nation |title=Iowa’s New Voter-ID Law Would Have Disenfranchised My Grandmother |date=April 13, 2017 |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/iowas-new-voter-id-law-would-have-disenfranchised-my-grandmother/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, President Donald Trump established the [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity]], purportedly for the purpose of preventing voter fraud. Critics have suggested its true purpose is voter suppression. The commission is led by Kansas attorney general [[Kris Kobach]], a staunch advocate of strict voter ID laws and a proponent of the Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a national database designed to check for voters who are registered in more than one state by comparing names and dates of birth. Researchers at Stanford University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Microsoft found that for every legitimate instance of double registration it finds, Crosscheck's algorithm returns approximately 200 false positives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=June 30, 2017 |title=How Trump’s nationwide voter data request could lead to voter suppression |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/06/30/how-trumps-nationwide-voter-data-request-could-lead-to-voter-suppression/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kobach has been repeatedly sued by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) for trying to restrict voting rights in Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2017 |title=The Man Behind Trump’s Voter-Fraud Obsession |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news| url= https://theintercept.com/2016/10/27/voter-suppression-is-the-real-election-scandal/ |title=Voter Suppression is the Real Election Scandal| work=[[The Intercept]]|date= October 27, 2016| author=Speri, Alice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12620">'''Whitecapping''' was a violent lawless movement among farmers that occurred specifically in the [[United States]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was originally a ritualized form of extralegal actions to enforce community standards, appropriate behavior, and traditional rights.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Chris and Green, Len, eds. ''Crime and Deviance in Canada: Historical Perspectives.'' 1st ed. Toronto:Canadian Scholars' Press Inc, 2005. pp 54&lt;/ref&gt; However, as it spread throughout the poorest areas of the rural South after [[American Civil War|the Civil War]], white members operated from economically driven and anti-black biases. States passed laws against it, but whitecapping continued into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

After it was institutionalized in formal law, its legal definition became more general than the specific movement itself: "Whitecapping is the crime of threatening a person with violence. Ordinarily, members of the minority groups are the victims of whitecapping."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/w/whitecapping/|title=Whitecapping Law and Legal Definition {{!}} USLegal, Inc.|last=Inc.|first=US Legal,|website=definitions.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitecapping was associated historically with such insurgent groups as [[The Night Riders]], [[Bald Knobbers]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. They were known for committing "extralegal acts of violence targeting select groups, carried out by vigilantes under cover of night or disguise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=3008|title=Night Riders – Encyclopedia of Arkansas|website=www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=United States District Courts and Judges of Arkansas, 1836–1960|last=Ross|first=Frances Mitchell|publisher=University of Arkansas Press; 1 edition|date=May 30, 2016|isbn=9781610755801|location=Arkansas|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History (1837–1972)==
The Whitecapping movement started in [[Indiana]] around 1837,&lt;ref&gt;"The Pioneers of Morgan County, Memoirs of Noah J. Major", ''Indiana Historical Society Publications'', Vol. V, No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; as white males began forming secret societies in order to attempt to deliver what they considered justice on the frontier independent from the state. These groups became known as the "White Caps". The first White Cap operations generally aimed at those who went against a community's values. Men who neglected or abused their family, people who showed excessive laziness, and women who had children out of wedlock all were likely targets.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Chris and Green, Len, eds. "Crime and Deviance in Canada: Historical Perspectives." 1st ed. Toronto:Canadian Scholars' Press Inc, 2005. pp 56&lt;/ref&gt;

As whitecapping spread into the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] during the 1890s after Reconstruction, a period of increasing racial violence against blacks by whites, the targets changed. In the South, White Cap societies were generally made up of [[Poor White|poor-white farmers]], frequently [[sharecroppers]] and small landowners, who operated to control black laborers and to prevent [[merchants]] from acquiring more land.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, William. "Whitecapping: Anti-Semitism in the Populist Era." ''American Jewish Historical Quarterly.'' 63 (1974): 247.&lt;/ref&gt; In the South, Whitecaps tried to force victims to abandon his home or property. Whitecapping in the South is thought to have been related to the stresses of the [[Reconstruction Era|postbellum]] agricultural depression that occurred immediately after the Civil War. The South had issues with [[overproduction]] and falling crop prices.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With attention centered on producing cotton, the South's economy became very unbalanced. Many farmers went into debt and lost their lands to merchants through mortgage foreclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, William. "Whitecapping: Anti-Semitism in the Populist Era." ''American Jewish Historical Quarterly''. 63 (1974): 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispossessed turned on merchants, African-American laborers, and sometimes new white tenants. [[Racism]] contributed to the problem as well. Prosperous black men, or simply African Americans who acquired land in the South, frequently faced resentment that could be expressed violently.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, Nell. "The Flames of Racial Hatred." ''The Washington Post.'' 4 Feb 1996, national ed.: X03.
&lt;/ref&gt; White Caps were also part of the effort by whites to maintain [[white supremacy]], particularly in the economy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Mexican Americans]] were also victims of white capping, particularly in the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pkcfl|title=CIVIL-RIGHTS MOVEMENT|last=ARNOLDO|first=CALVERT, ROBERT A. and DE LEON,|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many White Cap societies were disbanded by 1894 and their members were punished with fines. Some state governments were determined to disband the White Cap societies operating in their regions. While a segregationist, Mississippi [[James K. Vardaman|Governor James K. Vardaman]] assembled an executive task force in 1904 in order to gather information about membership. He feared that the violence would drive too many black workers away from the state economy, as the number of lynchings was also high in the state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Active members of the Whitecaps were found and punished by states in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;Anon. "For Whitecapping Negress." ''The New York Times.'' 10 Nov 1903, national ed.:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the negative economic effects of whitecapping violence were the main reason for state response to the lawlessness, political leaders often expressed values of [[Christianity]] as the main reason to end whitecapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newspapers.library.in.gov/cgi-bin/indiana?a=d&amp;d=ISST18890619.1.4|title=Indiana State Sentinel 19 June 1889 — Hoosier State Chronicles: Indiana's Digital Historic Newspaper Program|website=newspapers.library.in.gov|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over many years, whitecapping not only affected individuals, but communities and counties as a whole. In the South, whitecapping discouraged many merchants and industrialists from doing business in the counties. Added to the thousands of murders committed by whites in lynchings of blacks, whitecapping threatened to drive away black laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, William. "Whitecapping: Agrarian Violence in Mississippi, 1902–1906." ''The Journal of Southern History''. 35 (1969):177&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning around the time of World War I, tens of thousands of rural blacks began to leave in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], with 1.5 million leaving for northern and midwestern industrial cities by 1940.

In the late twentieth century, whitecapping continued to be an issue in the South: Mississippi passed a 1972 statute criminalizing its practice. The statute reads as follows:  "Any person or persons who shall, by placards, or other writing, or verbally, attempt by threats, direct or implied, of injury to the person or property of another, to intimidate such other person into an abandonment or change of home or employment, shall, upon conviction, be fined not exceeding five hundred dollars, or imprisoned in the county jail not exceeding six months, or in the penitentiary not exceeding five years, as the court, in its discretion may determine." &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[http://www.mscode.com/free/statutes/97/003/0087.htm SEC. 97-3-87. Threats and intimidation; whitecapping] MISSISSIPPI CODE OF 1972, As Amended.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Despite the different whitecapping targets, the White Caps used similar methods. Generally, the members of this society were disguised in a way that somewhat resembled that of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), and always attacked at night. Physical attacks could include such things as whipping, drowning, firing shots into houses, arson and other brutalities, with whipping and threats constituting the majority of the tactics used against victims.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, William. "Whitecapping: Agrarian Violence in Mississippi, 1902–1906." ''The Journal of Southern History.'' 35 (1969):169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=William|year=1980|title=Moonshining and Collective Violence: Georgia, 1889–1895|jstor=1889869|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=67| issue =  3|pages=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Caps also used non-violent means of intimidation to force certain residents from their homes. These included posting signs on doors of blacks' and merchants' homes, as well as cornering a target and verbally threatening them. If a resident or witness to a crime did not abandon their homes after being terrorized, White Caps sometimes murdered them.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Holmes, William F.

The victims of these attacks had little support from the legal authorities until 1893, when the threat of whitecapping began to be taken more seriously. But even if suspects were prosecuted, local officials had difficulty clearing juries of White Cap members or sympathizers. In addition to white bias against black victims, part of the White Cap oath was to never help convict a fellow member.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holmes|first=Williams|year=1969|title=Whitecapping: Agrarian Violence in Mississippi, 1902–1906|jstor=2205711|journal=The Journal of Southern History|volume=35| issue =  2|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the White Caps had elite connections to defense attorneys in their state, who aided them in avoiding harsher sentences in court. In the case of ''[[Hodges v. United States]]'', the defendants' attorneys were the lieutenant governor and a candidate running for state prosecutor. Defendants were convicted but sentenced only to one year and one day in prison, along with a $100 fine.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The penalty for violating the blood oath of the White Caps was death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In some states, whitecapping societies were interconnected throughout the region. Members could call on members from another county to terrorize witnesses of crimes as a scare tactic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''William Hickling Prescott''' (May 4, 1796&amp;nbsp;– January 28, 1859) was an American historian and [[Hispanist]], who is widely recognized by [[historiography|historiographers]] to have been the first American scientific historian. Despite suffering from serious visual impairment, which at times prevented him from reading or writing for himself, Prescott became one of the most eminent historians of 19th century America. He is also noted for his [[eidetic memory]].

After an extensive period of study, during which he sporadically contributed to academic journals, Prescott specialized in late Renaissance Spain and the early [[Spanish Empire]]. His works on the subject, ''The History of the Reign of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella the Catholic]]'' (1837), ''The History of the Conquest of Mexico'' (1843), ''A History of the Conquest of Peru'' (1847) and the unfinished ''History of the Reign of Phillip II'' (1856–1858) have become classic works in the field, and have had a great impact on the study of both Spain and [[Mesoamerica]]. During his lifetime, he was upheld as one of the greatest living American intellectuals, and knew personally many of the leading political figures of the day, in both the United States and Britain. Prescott has become one of the most widely translated American historians, and was an important figure in the development of history as a rigorous academic discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians admire Prescott for his exhaustive, careful, and systematic use of archives, his accurate recreation of sequences of events, his balanced judgments and his lively writing style.  He was primarily focused on political and military affairs, largely ignoring economic, social, intellectual, and cultural forces that in recent decades historians have focused on. Instead, he wrote narrative history, subsuming unstated causal forces in his driving storyline.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Muccigrosso, ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 3:1259-61&lt;/ref&gt;

William H. Prescott was born in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] on May 4, 1796, the first of seven children, although four of his siblings died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, 1972, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were [[William Prescott, Jr.]], a lawyer, and his wife, [[née]] Catherine Greene Hickling. His grandfather [[William Prescott]] served as a colonel during the [[American Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott began formal schooling at the age of seven, studying under Mr. Jacob Knapp.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 3, Peck p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1808, where his father's earnings substantially increased.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, 2009, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; His studies continued under Dr. John Gardiner, rector of [[Trinity Church, Boston|Trinity Episcopal Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, 1972, pp. 155–156, Peck p. 18, Gardiner p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Prescott frequented the [[Boston Athenæum]], which at the time held the 10,000-volume [[private library]] of [[John Quincy Adams]], who was on a diplomatic mission to [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Prescott became a trustee of the library, a position he held for 15&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott enrolled at [[Harvard College]] as a second year student ([[sophomore year|sophomore]]) in August 1811, at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, 1972, p. 156, Peck p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; He was not considered academically distinguished, despite showing promise in [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Prescott found mathematics particularly difficult, and resorted to memorizing mathematical demonstrations word-for-word, which he could do with relative ease, in order to hide his ignorance of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott's eyesight degenerated after being hit in the eye with a crust of bread during a [[food fight]] as a student, and it remained weak and unstable throughout the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was admitted to the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] as a senior, which he considered a great personal honor,&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 26, Peck p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from Harvard in 1814. After a short period of [[rheumatism|rheumatic]] illness, he embarked on an extended tour of Europe.

Prescott first traveled to the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] in the [[Azores]], where his grandfather and Portuguese grandmother lived.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; After two weeks, he left for the cooler climate of London, where he stayed with the distinguished surgeon [[Astley Cooper]] and the [[oculist]] [[William Adams (oculist)|William Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott first used a [[noctograph]] while staying with Adams; the tool became a permanent feature of his life, allowing him to write independently in spite of his impaired eyesight.  He visited [[Hampton Court Palace]] with future American president [[John Quincy Adams]], at the time a diplomat in London, where they saw the [[Raphael Cartoons]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1816, Prescott traveled to Paris, but later moved on to Italy, where he spent the winter. He returned to Paris in early 1817, where he chanced to meet the American [[Hispanist]] [[George Ticknor]], and made another visit to England. Prescott spent some time in [[Cambridge]], where he saw the manuscripts of [[Isaac Newton]]'s works, and returned to the United States in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott's first academic work, an essay submitted anonymously, was rejected by the ''[[North American Review]]'' in late 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; After a short period of courtship, he married Susan Amory, the daughter of [[Thomas Coffin Amory]] and Hannah Rowe Linzee, on May 4, 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Early career: The ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' ===
In 1821, Prescott abandoned the idea of a legal career because of the continued deterioration of his eyesight, and resolved to devote himself to literature.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Although he initially studied a wide range of subjects, including Italian, French, English and Spanish literature, [[History of North America|American history]], [[classics]] and [[political philosophy]], Prescott came to focus on [[Italian poetry]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works he studied during this period were such classics as [[Dante]]'s ''[[La Divina Commedia|Divine Comedy]]'' and [[Boccacio]]'s ''[[Decameron]]''. His first published works were two essays in the ''North American Review''—both discussing Italian poetry. The first of these, published in 1824,&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; was titled ''Italian Narrative Poetry'', and became somewhat controversial after it was heavily criticized in an Italian review by [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]], the librettist of [[Mozart]]'s [[Don Giovanni]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossi, Joseph ''The Italian Poems of Thomas James Mathias'', 1943, printed in ''[[Modern Language Quarterly]]'', p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott wrote a succinct reply to Da Ponte's fifty-page argument in the ''North American Review'' of July 1825. Da Ponte published the criticisms as an appendix to his translation of [[Robert Dodsley|Dodley]]'s ''Economy of Human life'', which resulted in Prescott noticing them rather late.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 249"&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott first became interested in the history of Spain after his friend, the Harvard professor George Ticknor, sent him copies of his lectures on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott's studies initially remained broad, but he started preparing material on [[Catholic Monarchs|Ferdinand and Isabella]] in January 1826.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; His acquaintance [[Pascual de Gayangos y Arce]] helped him construct a sizable personal library of historical books and manuscripts concerning the subject. [[Alexander Hill Everett]], an American diplomat in Spain, also provided him with material which was unavailable to Prescott in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Herring, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, progress was stalled almost immediately, due to a sudden deterioration in Prescott's eyesight. Unable to find a reader fluent in Spanish, Prescott was forced to work through Spanish texts with an assistant who did not understand the language.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; When Alexander Everett heard of this situation, he provided Prescott with the services of [[George Lunt]], who had adequate knowledge of Spanish for the task. However, this could only be a temporary arrangement, and he was replaced by a man named Hamilton Parker, who held the position for a year.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually George Ticknor, who was by then in charge of the department of modern literature at Harvard University, found James L. English, who worked with Prescott until 1831.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Among the books studied by Prescott in this period, Ticknor lists [[Juan Antonio Llorente]]'s ''Historia crítica de la Inquisición de España'', ''Historia de los Reyes Católicos don Fernando y doña Isabel'' by {{ill|Andrés Bernáldez|es}}, [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[History of Charles XII|Charles XII]]'' and [[William Roscoe]]'s ''Life of Lorenzo de Medici'', which were to be the sources on which the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' was to be based.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 1828, Prescott visited Washington, where he and Ticknor dined with [[John Quincy Adams]] at the [[White House]], and saw Congress in session.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Due in part to his own condition, Prescott was interested in aiding the blind and partially sighted. The [[Perkins School for the Blind]], then known as the New England Asylum,  had been founded in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] by [[Samuel Gridley Howe]], [[Thomas Handasyd Perkins]] and [[John Dix Fisher]] and 28 others in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott involved himself from the very start of the project, becoming a [[trustee]] in 1830. He published an article in support of [[education for the blind]] in the ''North American Review'' of July 1830, and helped to raise $50,000 for the organization in May 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:History of Ferdinand and Isabella 1838 title pages.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An open book, showing an image of Ferdinand and Isabella enthroned|Title pages of the ''History of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]]'', 1838 edition]]
His work was disturbed in February 1829 by the unexpected death of his eldest daughter Catherine, who was only four years old. This led him to reconsider his position on religion—previously an [[agnostic]], his interest in Christianity was renewed, and having read the [[Bible]], the works of the theologian [[William Paley]] as well as more skeptical works such as [[David Hume|Hume's]] ''[[Of Miracles]]'', he came to acknowledge the "moral truth" of the gospels, while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, pp. 91, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this personal tragedy, and his own continued ill health, Prescott had gathered sufficient material to begin drafting the ''History'' in October 1829.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; At around this time, Prescott read the works of [[Gabriel Bonnot de Mably]], including his historiographical piece ''De l’étude de l’histoire''. He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably's romantic ideal, and on more than one occasion expressed his indebtedness to him.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott also encountered ''Elogia de la Réina Doña Isabel'', by his Spanish contemporary [[Diego Clemencín]], which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs' political roles. Due to further problems with his eyesight, it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the ''History''. It was largely finished by 1834, but Prescott dedicated two years to [[abridgement|abridging]] and redrafting it. He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of [[Charles Brockden Brown]] for [[Jared Sparks]]' ''Library of American Biography''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was not familiar with American literature, and he based the work on other contemporary biographies of Brown. As a result, the biography has had little academic impact. In 1835, he took residence in the rural town of [[Nahant, Massachusetts]], due to concerns about his health.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He was here accustomed to riding his horses for the purpose of exercise, and he persevered even in sub-zero temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott finished the concluding chapter of the work in July 1836, and despite the amount of time and effort which he had spent on the work,  was at first unsure about publishing it. However, his father argued that refusing to do so would amount to cowardice, and this swayed him.&lt;ref&gt;Griswold, 1847, p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott had previously considered publishing the work in London first, and therefore a printed draft copy of the work was sent to a [[Thomas Aspinwall (consul)|Colonel Aspinwall]] for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; However, both [[Longman]] and Murray, which were at the time the leading British publishers, refused the work, and Prescott decided to postpone.

The ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' was published on Christmas Day, 1837 by the American Stationery Company, [[Boston]], with a print run of 500&amp;nbsp;copies.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to his father. To the surprise of Prescott and the publisher, the book sold very well—the original print run was insufficient to adequately supply Boston's bookshops, let alone the whole nation's.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in London by [[Richard Bentley (publisher)|Richard Bentley]] in early 1838. The work received excellent critical reviews, both in America and in Britain, where [[Henry Vassall-Fox]] and [[Robert Southey]] expressed their admiration of the work.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, p. 142"&gt;Gardiner, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' by William H. Prescott|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=June 1839|volume=64|pages=1–58|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=iau.31858021738798;view=1up;seq=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also noticed in France, despite the fact that a French translation was not available at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was adamant that his work should not be altered by anyone other than himself, and when he heard that his publishers were considering an abridgement of the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' in June 1839, he produced an abridgement of the work himself, which resulted in the original project's cancellation.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 197"&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in May 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlist|title=MemberList|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'' ===
Prescott expressed interest in his correspondence in writing a biography of [[Molière]], and Ticknor records that he sent Prescott "a collection of about 50 volumes" of relevant material.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p.162&lt;/ref&gt; However, after writing to [[Ángel Calderón de la Barca y Belgrano|Ángel Calderón de la Barca]], a Spanish minister living in Mexico, who was able to provide source material, Prescott started research on what was to become the ''History of the Conquest of Mexico''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He extensively read the works of [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who had written on [[Mesoamerica]], and started corresponding with the historian [[Washington Irving]], the Swiss writer [[Sismondi]] and the French historian [[Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 176-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;  He also received assistance in collecting sources from a college friend, Middleton, and a Dr. Lembke. In contrast to the lengthy time spent researching the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'', Prescott started drafting the ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'' in October 1839. However, Prescott faced difficulties in writing the work which he had not encountered previously. There was relatively little scholarship on [[Aztec]] civilization, and Prescott dismissed much of it as "speculation",  and he therefore had to rely almost exclusively on primary sources (with the exception of Humboldt). In particular, he considered [[Edward King, Viscount Kingsborough|Edward King]]'s theory that the pre-Columbian civilizations were non-indigenous to be fallacious, although he was greatly indebted to him for his anthology of [[Aztec codices]] in the [[Antiquities of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott also studied Spanish writers contemporary to the conquest, most significantly [[Fray Juan de Torquemada|Torquemada]] and [[Toribio de Benavente]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Harper's monthly magazine. Image of William H. Prescott.png|alt=A page from a 19th-century magazine with a picture of a bust of a man wearing a toga and facing right|thumb|left|Depiction of Greenough's bust of Prescott in the June 1850 edition of ''Harper's new monthly magazine'']]
Prescott received three honorary degrees in this period—an [[honorary doctorate]] in laws from [[Columbia University]] in autumn 1840, the [[College of William and Mary]] in July 1841 and [[South Carolina College]] in December 1841.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; He also helped [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Frances Inglis]] find a publisher for her autobiographical work ''Life in Mexico''.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Frances Inglis]] was one of Prescott's most valuable correspondents during the writing of the "History of the Conquest of Mexico." She is cited by Prescott five times throughout the text, and is described by him as, "one of the most delightful of modern traveller's."&lt;ref&gt;Leask, Nigel, “The Ghost in Chapultepec: Fanny Calderón de la Barca, William Prescott and Nineteenth-Century Mexican Travel Accounts”, in [[Jas Elsner]] and Joan-Pau Rubiés, Voyages &amp; Visions. Towards a Cultural History of Travel, London Reaktion Books, 1999, pp. 205-206.&lt;/ref&gt;
Prescott found it difficult to evaluate Mesoamerican scientific and mathematical achievements, because of his relative ignorance of those subjects.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 197"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; While working in Boston in 1841, he met [[George Howard, 7th Earl of Carlisle|George Howard]], who was to stay a close friend for the remainder of his life. Prescott worked industriously throughout 1840–1842, and as a result, the work was finished by August 1843. It was published by [[Harper &amp; Brothers]], New York in December, Bentley issuing the British edition.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; His elderly father had suffered a stroke in October, which resulted in temporary paralysis, so Prescott spent most of the winter attending him in [[Pepperell, Massachusetts|Pepperell]]. The ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'' was received extremely well, both critically and by the general public, despite Prescott's fears to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Those praising the work included [[George Hillard]] in the ''North American Review'', [[George Ticknor Curtis]] in the [[Christian Examiner]], [[Joseph Cogswell]] in the ''Methodist Quarterly'', as well as the [[Dean of St. Paul's]], [[Henry Hart Milman]]&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Quarterly Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The History of Mexico'' by William H.

=== The ''Conquest of Peru'' ===
In 1844, Prescott was painted by [[Joseph Alexander Ames]], and also commissioned a bust from [[Richard Saltonstall Greenough]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; He was not active in researching for the ''Conquest of Peru'' until spring 1844, although he had already decided to write a work concerning [[Inca]] civilization while researching pre-Columbian Mexico, and listened to [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]]'s ''Comentarios Reales de los Incas''.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 233"&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; He further studied [[Pedro Cieza de León]]'s ''Crónicas del Perú'', the works of [[Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa]] and [[Diego Fernández]]'s ''Primera y segunda parte de la Historia del Piru''.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 233"/&gt; Prescott's progress was stalled by the unexpected death of his brother Edward at sea. His daughter Elizabeth was seriously ill, so Prescott and his family traveled to [[Niagara, New York|Niagara]], which he considered a more healthy environment for her.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; After her recovery, they returned to Nahant in the summer, where Prescott started drafting the ''Conquest'', and, as was his custom, spent the autumn in Peperell.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott's father died at the age of 82 on December&amp;nbsp;8, which deeply upset him.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; He took a two-month break from writing to support his widowed mother and settle matters concerning his father's estate.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 238"&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; His father left numerous stocks, shares and property that amounted to $343,736.86, almost all of which was shared between Prescott and his sister.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, 225&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was elected to the [[Institut de France]] in February 1845, in recognition of his accomplishments as a historian.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 238"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bibliographie de la France, Beuchot, 1846, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; He took the place of [[Martín Fernández de Navarrete]], who had died the previous year, after a vote was cast. He was also admitted to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 238"/&gt; In the summer of 1845, a collection of articles Prescott had published in the ''North American Review'' were published as ''Biographical and Critical Miscellanies'' by Bentley in [[octavo]], and an edition was also prepared simultaneously by Harper &amp; Brothers in New York.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 249"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was writing 12&amp;nbsp;pages of the work per day in the summer of 1845, and completed the first two chapters of the ''Conquest''.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; He used the inheritance from his father to buy [[Headquarters House (Boston, Massachusetts)|a house]] on [[Beacon Street]] in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; The building is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], and is also known as the William Hickling Prescott House.&lt;ref name=dames&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nscda.org/ma/william_hickling_prescott_house.htm|title=William Hickling Prescott House|publisher=The National Society of The Colonial Dames of America|accessdate=2009-01-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201123404/http://www.nscda.org/ma/william_hickling_prescott_house.htm|archivedate=2009-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHL Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=574&amp;ResourceType=Building|title=Prescott, William H., House|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|work=National Historic Landmarks Program|accessdate=2010-09-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606175045/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=574&amp;ResourceType=Building|archivedate=2011-06-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott moved into the house during December 1845, and set himself a year to finish the ''Conquest of Peru''. In March, his eyesight, which had recovered significantly, suddenly deteriorated. Prescott was also suffering from acute [[dyspepsia]] and [[rheumatism]], and he travelled to Nahant to "benefit from the sea-air".&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 265"&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; This did not prevent him travelling to Washington, where he dined at the White House with President [[James K. Polk]]. He was also entertained by [[John Y. Mason]], the former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]], who informed him that a copy of Prescott's ''Conquest of Mexico'' had been placed in the library of every fighting ship.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Conquest of Peru'' was completed in March 1847. As with previous works, it was published by Harper &amp; Brothers in the United States and Bentley in Britain. The original US print run was 7,500&amp;nbsp;copies, and the books were sold for $1 each.&lt;ref name="Ticknor, 1864, p. 265"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; It was translated into Spanish, French, German and Dutch, and sold excellently. As with his previous works, it was also well-received critically.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research on Philip II ===
Shortly after the publication of the ''Conquest of Peru'', Prescott turned his mind to writing a history of [[Philip II of Spain]], which he had been contemplating for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lothrop Motley]], who planned to write an independent work on the subject, was aided by Prescott, who gave him access to his library.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two corresponded, there seems to have been little collaboration on their respective works. Prescott had started searching for sources as early as 1842, but a number of difficulties confronted him in his study of Philip II.  The principal archives of historical material were held in [[Simancas]], but neither Lembke (who had collected materials for the ''Conquest of Mexico'') nor Middleton were able to gain access to them.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; They had been informed that the library was so disordered as to make productive research impossible, even if access had been gained. However, Lembke, who as a diplomat had been expelled from Spain, made the acquaintance of two wealthy Parisian scholars, [[François Mignet|Mignet]] and Ternaux-Compans, who offered him access to their manuscript collections.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, de Gayangos assisted greatly by locating important documents in the British Museum and in the collection of the [[bibliomaniac]] [[Thomas Phillipps]], who owned around 60,000&amp;nbsp;manuscripts. He also borrowed several manuscripts from the archives in Brussels, having received letters from the respected Belgian diplomat [[Sylvain Van de Weyer]] in London. de Gayangos became Professor of [[Arabic literature]] at the [[Complutense University of Madrid]] in late 1842, and subsequently lent Prescott rare books and manuscripts from the university library.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; By the summer of 1848, Prescott had over 300 works on the subject at his disposal, but he continued to have serious problems with his eyesight; an examination by an oculist confirmed that there was untreatable damage to his retina.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 281&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott had been commissioned by the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]] to write a biography of the scholar John Pickering in 1848, which he wrote for publication later in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott was invited to write a history of the [[Mexican–American War]], but declined, as he was uninterested in writing on contemporary events.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott's main secondary source for the history was [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s ''Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert'', a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the [[papacy]]. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical [[historical method]], and considered his work to be the best of his predecessors on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt; He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Prescott was a creditor of [[John White Webster]], the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 293-4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visits to Washington and Europe ===
[[Image:William H. Prescott.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A scratched, half-length photographic portrait of a middle aged man in formal mid-19th century dress, facing left |right|Daguerreotype portrait of Prescott by M.B. Brady, c. 1848–1850]]
Prescott visited [[Washington D.C.]] in spring 1850, where he met [[Zachary Taylor]], then President of the United States, as well as numerous other prominent figures, including [[Henry Bulwer]], the British ambassador, and [[Daniel Webster]], the former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], who had been a friend of Prescott's father.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, he decided to visit England. He embarked from New York on May 22, and arrived at Liverpool on June 3.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; There he stayed with an old friend, Alexander Smith, and became reacquainted with Mary Lyell, the wife of the geologist [[Charles Lyell]].&lt;ref name="Gardiner, p. 305"&gt;Gardiner, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;  He traveled with the Lyells to London, where they stayed in [[Mivart's Hotel]]. Prescott was greeted in London, as in Washington, by the most important members of society—he dined with the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Henry Temple]], the former Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]], as well as the elderly [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt; He went to the races at [[Ascot Racecourse|Ascot]], and was presented at court to [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; On June 22, he traveled to Oxford to receive an honorary doctorate in law. In Oxford, he stayed at [[Cuddesdon Palace]], the home of the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who was absent because of the christening of the infant [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Prince Arthur]].&lt;ref name="Gardiner, p. 305"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott met [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton|Spencer Compton]], the president of the [[Royal Society]], who was also receiving an honorary degree.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; He left London for Paris, where he arrived on July 20. Two days later, he traveled to Brussels, where he stayed in [[Coudenberg]], the site of a residence of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], returning to London on July 29.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; Traveling north, Prescott visited [[Alnwick Castle]] and the ruins of Hulm Abbey in [[Northumbria]]. On his arrival in Edinburgh, he met the geologists [[Adam Sedgwick]] and [[Roderick Murchison]], whom he accompanied to [[Inveraray]], where he visited [[Inveraray Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott then traveled south, through [[Staffordshire]], where he was entertained by [[George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland|George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower]]. He embarked for New York on September 14, arriving on September 27.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Final works ===
Prescott spent the winter in Boston, and returned to the composition of his work. He gradually changed the focus of the ''History'', deciding that he was a better writer of history than biography&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; and worked solidly for the next two years, alternating between Boston and Nahant. This period was interrupted only by the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth in early 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband was James Alexander; they settled in a house near the family home in Pepperell. Prescott's mother fell ill on May 17 and died soon after, which caused Prescott to fall into a bout of depression that lasted until the winter.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to his work, and continued at the pace that he was able through the remainder of 1852 and 1853, which passed uneventfully. Prescott started to suffer seriously from rheumatism during the former year, and as a result he abandoned his residence at Nahant.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 390&lt;/ref&gt; He bought a house in the then rural town of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]], where he was visited by Charles Lyell and his family in June 1853.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; On August 22, he finished the second volume of the ''History''.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; The first two volumes were finished by May 1855, but not immediately published.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in [[British copyright law]] and a change of publishers caused Prescott to delay publication until November. Compared to his previous works, the ''History'' received little coverage in the press or in academic journals. It was suggested to him at this time that he should write a biography of Charles V, but he declined, as he regarded the work of [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] on the subject to be definitive.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 406&lt;/ref&gt; However, he wrote an appendix to Robertson's ''The History of the reign of Charles V'' in May 1855; it was published in December 1856. Previously uninterested in politics (although he had predicted the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] victory in [[United States presidential election, 1840|1840]],&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;) Prescott supported and voted for the Republican [[John C. Frémont]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1856|1856 Presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 359&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work on the third volume of the ''History'' until he suffered a [[stroke]] on 3 February 1858.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; Prescott recovered, but his health was permanently affected, and he decided to temporarily retire from writing. The third volume was therefore published in April, and its scope was more limited than Prescott had originally planned.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 428&lt;/ref&gt; He worked on the Spanish translation of the ''Conquest of Mexico'', which had been prepared by [[José Fernando Ramírez]] and [[Lucas Alamán]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 429&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
William H. Prescott and Susan Amory Prescott (c. 1799&amp;nbsp;– 1859) had four children; the first, Catherine Prescott (23 September 1824&amp;nbsp;– 1 February 1829) died of a childhood illness. William Gardiner Prescott (27 January 1826&amp;nbsp;– 15 August 1895) attended Harvard from 1841 to 1844 and worked as a lawyer in Boston. He married Josephine Augusta Peabody on 6 November 1851, and inherited Headquarters House.&lt;ref name=MVR&gt;''Massachusetts Vital Records'', 1841–1910, Vol: 527; pp 33–37. New England Historic Genealogical Society, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; William Gardiner's daughter Catherine Elizabeth Prescott married a Hebert Timmins on 22 February 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Notable Wedding in Boston|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1887/02/23/104008593.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=22 February 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth (27 July 1828&amp;nbsp;– 24 May 1864) married James Lawrence, a distant cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lawrence |first=Robert |title=The descendant of Major Samuel Lawrence |year=1904 |publisher=Riverside Press |page=153 |url=https://archive.org/stream/descendantsofmaj00lawr/descendantsofmaj00lawr_djvu.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest was William Amory (25 January 1830&amp;nbsp;– 13 March 1867).&lt;ref name=MVR/&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
[[File:55 BeaconSt Boston.png|thumb|left|alt=A large house, in an American neo-classical style|Prescott lived on [[Beacon Street]], Boston, 1845–1859.&lt;ref&gt;State Street Trust Company. Forty of Boston's historic houses. 1912.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In January 1859, Prescott decided to resume his work on Philip II, with the goal of writing a final fourth volume. On January 29, he suffered a second stroke, which resulted in his immediate death.&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried with his parents in St. Paul's Church, and his funeral was attended by representatives, among others, of [[Harvard University]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Essex Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Ticknor, 1864, p. 446&lt;/ref&gt;

Prescott's work has remained popular and influential to the present day, and his meticulous use of sources, [[citation|bibliographical citations]] and critical notes was unprecedented among American historians.&lt;ref name="Gardiner, p. 142"/&gt; As the work of an amateur historian, the ''History of Ferdinand and Isabella'' was an outstanding achievement, and it arguably was the best English-language work on the subject published until then.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The major problems with the work to the modern day historian are not related to the quality of the research or Prescott's understanding of the period, but rather that his focus is on the major political and military events as opposed to social and economic conditions. It has also been argued that Prescott partially subscribed to the [[Great Man theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Commager, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Conquest of Mexico'' has endured more than any other of Prescott's work: it is regarded as his greatest literary accomplishment.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peck, p. 133-6&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern scholarship agrees that there are problems with Prescott's characterization of the conquest. David Levin has argued that the Conquest shows "inadequate attention to detail" and remains a broad and general account of events.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, David, "History as Romantic Art: Structure, Characterization and Style in ''The Conquest of Mexico''", ''[[Hispanic American Historical Review]]'', 39 (February 1959), pp. 20-40.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the ''Conquest of Mexico'', the ''Conquest of Peru'' has received relatively little modern scholarly attention, perhaps due to some key similarities in style and structure.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is generally thought that the work was the authoritative account until the 20th century, and that Prescott used a broader range of source material than any previous writer on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[archeological]] and [[anthropology|anthropological]] aspects of both works have been heavily criticized by historians since the end of the 19th century. Prescott had never visited archeological sites in Mesoamerica and his understanding of [[Inca]] and [[Aztec]] culture was weak.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; In defense of Prescott, it has been argued that despite advances in archeological understanding, and a reconceptualization of the nature of pre-Columbian society, the works remain broadly historically accurate, and Prescott's elaborations on fact were due to a fundamental lack of source material.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commager, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''Phillip the Second'' is considered essentially an inferior piece—it lacks the epic structure and literary merits of Prescott's other work, and the work has not received more critical attention than other contemporary accounts of the monarch's life.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a popular misconception that Prescott was completely blind, which seems to have stemmed from a misunderstanding of his comment in the preface to ''The Conquest of Mexico'', in which he stated, "Nor have I ever corrected, or even read, my own original draft".&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; The myth was further propagated by a contemporary New York review of the ''Conquest'', and has been a common theme in popular accounts of his work. Other related embellishments of Prescott's disability have also occurred—[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], writing in a 1959 article for ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', claimed that Prescott had an artificial eye, although there is no evidence to suggest this. It has been argued that Prescott's biographers have naturally been drawn to romanticize his life due to Prescott's own romantic style of history.&lt;ref&gt;Eipper, p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

Four biographies of Prescott have been written.  In 1864, [[George Ticknor]] published a biography based on Prescott's then-unpublished correspondence, to which the later biographers have been greatly indebted. [[Rollo Ogden]]'s 1904 account is more a stylistic modernization of Ticknor's work. [[Harry Thurston Peck]]'s 1905 account is considered academically inferior due to its essentially derivative nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; C. Harvey Gardiner's 1969 work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=UCdMAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq | title=William Hickling Prescott: A Biography | publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] | author=C.

Historian Richard Kagan has identified "Prescott's Paradigm" as a 19th century interpretive model first fully articulated by Prescott. It argues that Spain's early modern 'decline' and subsequent 'torpor' was a product of its religious bigotry and political despotism. The Prescott Paradigm was dominant in 20th century American historiography, But was showing signs of decline by the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Kagan,  "Prescott's Paradigm: American Historical Scholarship and the Decline of Spain." ''American Historical Review'' 101#2 (1996): 423-446.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kagan wrote:
:What I call "Prescott's paradigm" is an understanding of Spain as the antithesis of the United States. Most of the elements contained in this paradigm — anti-Catholicism, criticism of absolutism, support for commerce and individual liberty — were to be found in the work of other writers, but Prescott bundled them into a single package that offered a means of approaching Spanish history through the lens of that of U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard L. Kagan|title=Spain in America: The Origins of Hispanism in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qq-w4POa8ikC&amp;pg=PA253|year=2002|publisher=U of Illinois Press|page=253}}&lt;/ref&gt;
