'''"Amor d'água fresca"''' ("Fresh water love") was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1992]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Dina (singer)|Dina]] (born Ondina Veloso).

The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with Dina comparing her lover to a series of different fruits and his love to "fresh water". Thus, she says that she "picked you, bit you and put you in the basket" and describes her lover's "eyes of plum/And your blackberry mouth".

The song was performed eighth on the night, following [[Sweden]]'s [[Christer Björkman]] with "[[I morgon är en annan dag]]" and preceding [[Cyprus]]' [[Evridiki]] with "[[Teriazoume]]". At the close of voting, it had received 26 points, placing 17th in a field of 23.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3462">The '''Annual Georgia European Union Summit''' ('''AGEUS''') is a yearly gathering of Georgian and international economic development leaders.  It occurs on the first Thursday in November.   During its first nine years the event was held in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[United States|USA]].  In 2010 the event moved to [[Athens, Georgia]], home of the [[University of Georgia]].

Founded in 2001 by [[Christopher N. Smith]], attorney and [[Honorary Consul]] of the Kingdom of [[Denmark]] for Georgia, AGEUS serves to bring together select international leaders, both from European and non-European countries, with various Georgian economic, business, and governmental leaders.

Table sponsors have included such companies as [[UBS AG]], [[Georgia Power]], and the [[Georgia Department of Economic Development]] (GDEcD).

'''''Badiaga''''' is a 1987 [[drama film]] directed by [[Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa]] and starring Justine Sengue and Alexandre Zanga.

==Synopsis==
''Badiaga'' follows the rules of a classical tragedy: a three-year-old girl abandoned in a food market is sheltered and raised by a deaf and dumb vagrant. They develop a very strong bond. Badiaga dreams of becoming a famous singer and listens in total fascination to the artists who sing in the different cafes where she wanders.
One day she has the chance of singing on the radio a song which becomes a national hit. From that moment onwards she holds a nonstop succession of concerts. In love with her career, she refuses any romantic relations and searches desperately for her origins.
The story was inspired by the life of Beti Beti (Béatrice Kempeni),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiki-cm.com/annuaire-des-artistes/dictionnaire/index/B/137,beti-beti.html |title=Beti Beti |publisher=Musiki-cm.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101102032646/http://www.musiki-cm.com/annuaire-des-artistes/dictionnaire/index/B/137%2Cbeti-beti.html |archivedate=2010-11-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a legendary Cameroon singer.

'''''Born of the Storm''''' is a [[socialist realist]] novel written by [[Nikolai Ostrovsky]] (1904–1936) during [[Joseph Stalin]]'s era. The novel, begun in January 1924 and concerning the [[Ukrainian–Soviet War]], remains unfinished due to Ostrovsky's death in December 1936.

==Plot summary==
The action of ''Born of the Storm'' goes on in autumnal days of 1918 when Poland was regaining its independence after 123 years of partitions. German occupational forces moved away from Ukrainian territories while local Polish legioners had been formed with dreams of adding some Ukrainian, Belarusian and Lithuanian lands to the Polish state bordering on the ruins of Russian, German and Austro-Hungarian empires.

This article is about the '''[[coat of arms]]''' of the German state of '''[[Saarland]]'''.

==Description==
The coat of arms of Saarland is parted per cross:
*The first quarter shows the coat of arms of the prince of [[Nassau-Saarbrücken]], a silver lion with golden crown, between nine crosses argent. The shield is blue. It represents the town district of [[Saarbrücken]] and the district of [[Neunkirchen (German district)|Neunkirchen]].
*The second quarter shows the coat of arms of the [[Archbishopric of Trier|prince elector, archbishop of Trier]], in [[Trier]]. The charge is a red three-dimensional symmetric cross. The arms are advance to the axis. It represents the districts of [[Merzig-Wadern]] and [[St Wendel]].
*The third quarter shows the coat of arms of the [[duchy of Lorraine]] and represents the district of [[Saarlouis]]. It shows three silver [[alerion]]s on a red bend, on a yellow field.
*The fourth quarter, the coat of arms of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate|prince elector Palatinate]], represents the [[Saarpfalz]] district, which once was part of the Palatinate. The black shield is charged with a yellow lion rampant, whose claws and tongue are painted in red.
  
The actual legal base of the use of the coat of arms is:

The '''Constitution of the Year XII''' was a national [[constitution]] of [[France]] adopted during the Year XII of the [[French Revolutionary Calendar]] (1804 in the [[Gregorian calendar]]).

It amended the earlier [[Constitution of the Year VIII]] and [[Constitution of the Year X]], establishing the [[First French Empire]] with [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] &amp;mdash; previously [[French Consulate|First Consul]] for Life, with wide-ranging powers &amp;mdash; as Napoleon I, [[Emperor of the French]]. The Constitution established the [[House of Bonaparte]] as France's imperial dynasty, making the throne hereditary in Napoleon's family. The Constitution of the Year XII was later itself extensively amended by the [[Charter of 1815|Additional Act]] and definitively abolished with the final return of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]] in 1815.

The '''Embassy of Belgium in New Delhi''' is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] to [[India]]. The [[diplomatic mission#Naming|embassy]] is located in [[Shantipath]], [[Chanakyapuri]]. The Embassy of Belgium in New Delhi covers the services for India, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Maldives|the Maldives]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diplomatie.be/newdelhi/default.asp|title=Official website of Belgium in New Delhi|work=Website of Kingdom of Belgium|publisher=Kingdom of Belgium|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium also operates a consulate in [[Mumbai]] and [[Chennai]]. The Belgian ambassador to India is Jan Luykx.&lt;ref name=embassy /&gt; 

Belgium had opened its embassy in India in 1947, just a few months after India's independence. Its first ambassador to India was [[Eugène, 11th Prince of Ligne]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indembassy.be/pdf/Seech%20at%20BICCI%20lunch%20event%20-%2011%20SEP%2014.pdf Website of Indian Embassy in Brussels]&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction of the current embassy complex (seen in picture) was designed and managed by [[Satish Gujral]], and completed in 1984. The design resembles a fortress of rocky outcrops.&lt;ref name=archnet&gt;{{cite web |title=Archnet: An international online community of scholars, students, and professionals addressing the built environment in Muslim societies. |url=http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=688 |work=Archnet Digital Library |publisher=Archnet |accessdate=14 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101032637/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=688 |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building complex includes the administrative buildings of the embassy, chancellor's residence, ambassador's residence, and staff housing. The embassy was one of Satish Gujral's most challenging assignments, winning him national and international awards. In 2000, the building was recognised as one of the 1000 best buildings in the 19th century&lt;ref name=falisse&gt;{{cite book|last=Falisse|first=Philippe|title=Inspirations: The Architectural Marvel of Satish Gujral and memories of Seven Ambassadors|year=2005|publisher=Bosco Society|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The embassy is located in New Delhi's diplomatic district in Chanakyapuri. The front facade consists of two large cupolas with a central fold above the entrance.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Rebecca M.|title=Art for a modern India, 1947-1980|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0822343554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entrance opens into a courtyard with stone masonry and greenery within. The building is constructed with red bricks. The ubiquitous red brick construction of the building has been compared to early architectural forms prevalent in [[Mohenjo-daro#Architecture_and_urban_infrastructure|Mohenjo-daro]] and the [[buddhist architecture]] in [[Sanchi Stupa|Sanchi]] and [[Nalanda]].&lt;ref name=brown /&gt; Along with two other embassies, the post-modern architecture of the Belgian embassy in New Delhi has been critiqued by [[Roger Connah]] for its confusing appeal to [[Delhi Sultanate|pre-colonial glory of Delhi]] on one hand and the fading [[British India|(British) empire]] on the other.&lt;ref name=thesis&gt;{{cite book|last=Panicker|first=Shaji K|title=PhD Dissertation on ‘Indian Architecture’ and the Production of a Postcolonial Discourse: A Study of Architecture + Design (1984-1992)|year=2008|publisher=School of Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Urban Design Centre for Asian and Middle Eastern Architecture, University of Adeleide|page=238|url=http://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/49947/1/02whole.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some parts of the building near the entrance are open to visitors, while the parts hosting the residence and the administrative blocks are not accessible to the public.

'''Fear Doirich''' (literally '''Dark Man''') is a villainous [[Druid]] featured in [[Irish mythology]] in events surrounding the hero [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] and his wife [[Sadhbh]].

==History==
According to the myth, Fear Doirich had sought Sadhbh to wife, but transformed her into a deer when she refused his advances. Fionn encountered her while hunting, and his hounds Bran and Sceólang recognized her as an enchanted human, having themselves been born of a woman who had been changed into a hound. Fionn's land proved to be the one place were Fear Doirich's spell could be undone and Sadhbh restored to human form; upon achieving this, she and Fionn were married, and she became pregnant. Unfortunately, Fear Doirich learned of this and transformed her back into a deer after Fionn left for a war; she was thus never seen again.

'''Finland–Mozambique relations''' refers to the [[bilateral relations]]hip of [[Finland]] and [[Mozambique]].  Finland recognised Mozambique on July 4, 1975. Both countries established diplomatic relations on July 18, 1975.

In November 2008, Finland's President [[Tarja Halonen]] called her country's relationship with Mozambique "excellent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpk.fi/Public/default.aspx?contentid=177813&amp;nodeid=41416&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Speech by President of the Republic of Finland Tarja Halonen at a banquet given in honour of President of the Republic of Mozambique Armando Emílio Guebuza on 5 November 2008] 11 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations==
Since 1987, Mozambique has been one of Finland's main partner countries for development aid, with Mozambique receiving 23 million Euros in 2008. In 2009, Finland's aid contribution to Mozambique increased to 26.6 million Euros. In 2008, development aid was used in the agriculture, education and health sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=15369&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Development Policy] Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finland&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade and Development [[Paavo Väyrynen]] visited Mozambique to discuss development and trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finland.org.au/Public/default.aspx?contentid=138660&amp;nodeid=35606&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Minister Väyrynen to Mozambique and Namibia] Ministry of Foreign Affairs, October 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Finland's aid was directed towards rural development, specifically with the goals of increasing agricultural productivity and increasing farmers’ income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://formin.finland.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=15369&amp;contentlan=2&amp;culture=en-US Finland's development cooperation with Mozambique] Minister of Foreign Affairs, Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

However, due to the political culture in Eritrea, youthful citizens were unable to gather to organize mass protests.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://awate.com/interview-with-eritreas-freedom-friday-organizers/|title=Interview With Eritrea's "Freedom Friday" Organizers - Awate.com|date=2012-02-10|work=Awate.com|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official date the movement began was November 11th, 2011 when original members made calls and sent messages around the country to join in protesting for democratic changes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This movement is based on the freedom of being able to spread information to one another. The political climate within the country places the power in the hands of the sitting regime and inhibits individual freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Eritrea|date=2018-11-24|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eritrea&amp;oldid=870354149|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "2018 World Press Freedom Index" by [https://rsf.org/en/ranking Reporters without borders], Eritrea out ranked only one other country, that being North Korea.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rsf.org/en/ranking|title=2018 World Press Freedom Index {{!}} Reporters Without Borders|work=RSF|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization goes on to say "For the past 26 years, Eritrea has been a dictatorship in which there is no room for freely reported news and information"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and "Like everything else in Eritrea, the media are totally subject to the whim of President Issayas Afeworki, a predator of press freedom who is responsible for 'crimes against humanity,' according to a June 2016 UN report"&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Resistance ==
[[File:Freedom Friday Graffiti.jpg|thumb|Graffiti messages on Eritrean currency]]
[[File:Freedom Friday Poster.jpg|thumb|Poster encouraging resistance by the Freedom Friday movement]]
Due to the strong power that the government holds in this fairly new country, resistance, and spreading the message of resistance is extremely difficult. But unlike the militant resistance that is conducted by '''[[Red Sea Afar Democratic Organisation]]''' (RSADO)''',''' the Freedom Friday movement focuses on information campaigns. The main goals of the organization include "heighten the level of indignation against the regimes actions. Encourage people to go beyond the individual response of fleeing the country but seek a communal solution to the common problem. Support people in the search for actions that challenge the regime without putting people in danger as they build their confidence in challenging the regime. Link the opposition in diaspora to our people inside the country."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The movement uses multiple outlets to spread their message ranging from independent radio stations broadcasting from different countries, to simple graffiti on Eritrean bank notes.&lt;ref name="theguardianabeaconofhope" /&gt; This movement essentially coordinates underground activists within the country to spread information to the broad population, as well as provide video and information of what is being published by the governments media.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Selam Kidane, a co-founder of the movement, frequently posts messages to social media including Facebook and Twitter in hopes to spread hope for individuals stuck within the oppressive country, but also in hopes that they will grow the will to rise up and resist the government in the streets of major cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Selkid?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor|title=Selam Kidane (@Selkid) {{!}} Twitter|website=twitter.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only 1% of the countries population has access to the internet, social media accounts for Eritrean resistance are numerous, and well supported.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With a large separation between individuals and internet within the country, other methods of streaming hopeful messages has to take place. As done by [http://www.erena.org/ Radio Erena], and [https://assenna.com/ Radio Assenna], they look to provide an independent information source to the population via satellite and radio.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These along with others broadcast messages to Eritreans informing them of different events occuring in the world, as well as encouraging individuals to not flee the country and instead rebel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Yet both of these information sources also provide websites and publish articles in which they discuss and update information the current situations that are occuring within the country itself, for the international community to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://assenna.com/|title=Assenna.com – Politics, Culture, Religion|website=assenna.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.erena.org/|title=Welcome to Radio Erena! - erena|website=www.erena.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another independent publisher focused on Eritrea, individuals within the country also conduct mass robo-calls to landlines, as well as post posters along with graffiti markings to encourage and positively support resistance to oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asmarino.com/|title=Welcome to Asmarino Independent.|website=www.asmarino.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  


== International Involvement ==
Although Eritrea has been mentioned by many international leaders and organizations, little has been done to intervene. On June 8th, 2015, the United Nations published a special inquiry detailing gross human rights violations within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/hrbodies/hrc/coieritrea/pages/reportcoieritrea.aspx|title=OHCHR {{!}}

Little tangible support has been provided by the international community and has lead to an increase in difficulty for the movement.

'''Fritule''' is a festive [[Croatia]]n pastry made particularly for Christmas. They resemble little [[doughnut]]s, the Italian [[zeppole]], Venetian [[frìtole]], and the Dutch Christmas snack "[[oliebollen]]" ("balls of oil"). However, they are usually flavored with rum and citrus zest, containing [[raisin]]s, and are topped with [[powdered sugar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2772">[[File:African chicken macau.JPG|thumb|250px|''Galinha à africana'' with fresh potato chips, as served near [[A-Ma Temple]] in [[Macau]]]]

'''African Chicken''' ({{lang-zh|t=非洲雞|s=非洲鸡|first=t}}), also known as '''Galinha à africana''' ({{IPA-pt|ɡɐˈɫĩɲaː.ɐfɾiˈkɐ̃nɐ|lang}}, is a [[Macanese cuisine|Macanese]] chicken dish.

African Chicken consists of a [[barbecue]]d [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] coated with spicy [[piri piri]] sauce, which sometimes includes Asian ingredients such as coconut milk or peanuts.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{Cite news|last=Yu|first=Jessica|title=The Dish: African Chicken|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=Feb 29, 2008|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120397352175491547|accessdate=Oct 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dish is sometimes considered to be a renowned Macanese dish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phang|first1=Jonathan|title=The Food of Macau|url=https://riddlemagazine.com/the-food-of-macau/|website=Riddle Magazine|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen as a variant of [[Piri piri]] Chicken.&lt;ref name="SCMP"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wordie|first1=Jason|title=How African chicken became Macau’s "national" dish|url=http://www.scmp.com/destination-macau/article/1937351/how-african-chicken-became-macaus-national-dish|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
There are many theories on where African Chicken originated, but all invariably attribute the dish to Macao's [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colonial past.

One theory on the dish's origin states the dish is the brainchild of local chef Americo Angelo, who came up with the dish in a hotel kitchen in the 1940s, utilizing spices he obtained from a trip to Portugal's African colonies at the time,&lt;ref name="TheGuardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Cathy|title=Macau’s favourite dish: hot out of Africa|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jun/04/macau-african-chicken-favourite-dish-the-fooie-traveller|accessdate=7 March 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another theory states the recipe has been passed down through Portuguese families in Macao for centuries.&lt;ref name="TheGuardian"/&gt;

Yet another theory states the recipe was brought to Macao by retired [[Portuguese Army]] officers in the aftermath of the [[Carnation Revolution]], who opened cafés and served foods they came to like during their overseas service.&lt;ref name="SCMP"/&gt;

'''Gnome King Kyrië''' (Dutch: '''Kabouterkoning Kyrië''', {{IPA-nl|ˈkiːrijə|pron}}) is, according to local folklore, the leader of the legendary [[gnome]]s ([[kabouter]]s) which lived in the [[Campine]] region of the province of [[North Brabant]], the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naaijkens|first1=Jan|title=Noord-Brabant in grootvaders tijd, 1870-1914|date=1979|publisher=North Brabant (Netherlands)|isbn=9789023303831|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QkkeAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Kabouterkoning+Kyri%C3%AB%22&amp;dq=%22Kabouterkoning+Kyri%C3%AB%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Olj9VPqPEoipNuWQgfgD&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These gnomes had their base in the village of [[Hoogeloon]]. From Hoogeloon the gnomes often made journeys in the neighboring lands. According to tradition the Gnome King Kyrië lived on the Kerkakkers in the Kabouterberg (Gnome Mountain) also known as Duivelsberg (Devil's Mountain), a [[tumulus]] located in the Koebosch forest, slightly northeast of Hoogeloon.

The gnomes of the Campine were helpful creatures who helped mostly the farmers and the households in the Campine and also in the neighboring lands of [[Peel, Netherlands|the Peel]] and the [[Meierij]]. They came by night and did not want to be seen by people. If people did see them, they were punished by the gnomes. One story tells of an inquisitive farmer who spied on the gnomes and later became blind in one eye as a punishment.

== The death of Kyrië ==
One day, Gnome King Kyrië was shot by a hunter in the heathlands of [[Riethoven]] (most sources name the winter of 1952/1953, some place his death in the winter of 1951/1952). He had just enough strength to reach the Duivelsberg (Devil's Mountain) where the gnomes lived. The hunter looked for what he had shot down, when he heard the shocked gnomes say: "Kyrië is dead". The sad message that their king had died spread quickly among all gnome settlements in the region. Gnome King Kyrië was buried somewhere in Hoogeloon. After the death of their king, all the gnomes left the area to an unknown destination. Nobody has ever since heard or seen these Campine gnomes.&lt;ref&gt;Nederlandse and Vlaamse Sprookjes 1998, by Sprookjes Uit De Wereldliteratuur&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statue ==
In Hoogeloon, a [[village pump]] with a statue of Gnome King Kyrië on it was erected on the Valensplein in 1985. It is designed by Gubbels. On 9 April 2001 the pump and statue were moved to another place on the same square after a reconstruction of the Valensplein. At the same time a special 'Koning Kyrië Kruidenbitter', a [[bitters|bitter]], was introduced.

An '''international regime''' is an international process and collection of rules. Sometimes, when formally organized, it can transform into an [[intergovernmental organization]]. They are, however, not actors or [[non-governmental organization]]s. Organizations only regulate and promote regimes.{{huh|date=May 2015}}

==Definition and Types==
[[Stephen D. Krasner]] defined International Regimes as “Implicit or explicit principles, norms, rules and decision-making procedures around which actors’ expectations converge in a given area of international relations”&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, Stephen D. 1983c. Structural Causes and Regime Consequences: Regimes as Intervening Variables. In International Regimes, edited by S. D. Krasner. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;in the journal ''[[International Organization]]'' in 1982. Regimes "are more specialized arrangements that pertain to well-defined activities, resources, or geographical areas and often involve only some subset of the members of [[international society]]", according to Oran R. Young, in his 1989 book ''International Cooperation : Building Regimes for Natural Resources and the Environment''.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Oran R. 1989. International cooperation : building regimes for natural resources and the environment. Ithaca: Cornell University Press. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of [[regime]]s include International Conventions such as the [[Basel Convention]], the [[Barcelona Convention|Mediterranean Action Plan]] and well-known regimes like the [[Bretton Woods System]] of monetary management. International Regimes might also include [[international organization]]s in a broader sense.

==Formation==
International regimes often form in response to a need to coordinate behavior among countries around an issue. In the absence of an overarching regime, for instance, telecommunications between countries would have to be governed by numerous bilateral agreements, which would become impossibly complex to administer worldwide. A regime such as [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] serves simultaneously as a forum, a multilateral treaty, and a governing body to standardize telecommunications across countries efficiently. The [[International Monetary Fund]], [[Biological Weapons Convention]], and [[Kyoto Protocol]] are other examples of international regimes.  The number of international regimes has increased dramatically since the Second World War, and today regimes cover almost all aspects of international relations that might require coordination among countries, from security issues (such as weapons non-proliferation or [[collective defense]]), to trade, finance, and investment, information and communication, human rights, the environment, and management of outer space—to name a few.

Some scholars emphasize the importance of a [[Hegemony|hegemon]] in creating a regime and giving it momentum. This is called the [[hegemonic stability theory]]. The [[United States]], for example, has been instrumental in creating the [[Bretton Woods system]], with organizations such as the [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. The rationale is that a hegemon, being the dominant actor in international politics and economics, often stands to gain the most from the creation of global standards. For instance, while other countries might benefit from it, U.S. companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Universal Studios]], and [[Pfizer]] would be among the greatest beneficiaries of a strict global [[intellectual property]] regime. As the hegemons use their power to create regimes, their withdrawal similarly can also threaten the effectiveness of regimes.

==Proponents and critics==
Regimes serve crucial functional needs in international relations. Powerful regimes are considered by some scholars as independent actors in international politics. Although ultimately states create and sustain regimes, once institutionalized, regimes can exert influence in world politics that is practically independent of state sovereignty. The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], for instance, has certain rights, given to it by states themselves, to monitor nuclear energy activity in countries. Insofar as they are organized by means of treaties among countries, regimes provide an important source of formal [[international law]]. Regimes themselves can also be subjects of international law. Insofar as they shape the behavior of states, the most influential regimes can also be a source of customary international law. In this light, some liberal scholars see in regimes the early seeds of peaceful world governance, in the vein of philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s idea of [[perpetual peace]] through a federation of world's states. 

Critics of regimes deplore their influence as a source of additional conflict or inefficiency in world politics. The security regime organized around the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] is sometimes cited as a case in point. Some other scholars are also alarmed that regimes represent a dilution of democratic control. Although they govern and influence important aspects of life, they operate steps removed from domestic democratic politics, organized around a legislature. In effect, some critics argue, most regimes come to represent the [[Technocracy|technocratic]] views of international civil servants, with agreements made behind closed doors, rather than being subject to openness and democratic popular representation. Some regimes, such as the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) have tried to address this "[[democratic deficit]]" by establishing civilian affairs departments, which are supposed to act as a liaison to the popular will. Most regimes are still insulated from the direct democratic politics that happen within states. Some, however, consider such insulation necessary, since much of international coordination require specialized expertise provided best by technocrats.

'''La Borsa''', also known as the '''Exchange Buildings''', is a 19th-century building in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]], which houses '' The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical Context|url=http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/content.aspx?id=189384|website=The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414032916/http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/content.aspx?id=189384|archivedate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site of La Borsa was originally occupied by a house which belonged to the Priory of Castile. In 1853, the house was handed over to The Malta Chamber of Commerce and Enterprise, which had been formed in 1848. It was demolished to make way for new premises which were designed by the Maltese architect [[Giuseppe Bonavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bugeja|first1=Lino|title=Valletta – vibrant city of many styles|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150104/business-news/Valletta-vibrant-city-of-many-styles.550626|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=4 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702024046/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20150104/business-news/Valletta-vibrant-city-of-many-styles.550626|archivedate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Works were undertaken by the contractor Michelangelo Azzopardi, and the building was inaugurated in March 1857.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denaro |first1=Victor F. |title=Houses in Kingsway and Old Bakery Street, Valletta |journal=Melita Historica |date=1959 |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=206-207 |url=http://mhs.eu.pn/mh/19591.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117014317/http://mhs.eu.pn/mh/19591.html |archivedate=2015-11-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some features within the building include the Lewis Farrugia Courtyard, Sir Agostino Portelli Hall, the Aula Conciliaris (Council Room), the Banif Lecture Hall and the [[Bank of Valletta|BOV]] Meeting Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facilities|url=http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/content.aspx?id=192264|website=The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150414092203/http://www.maltachamber.org.mt/content.aspx?id=192264|archivedate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument by the [[Malta Environment and Planning Authority]].&lt;ref name=oneworld&gt;{{cite news|title=One World: Protecting the most significant buildings, monuments and features of Valletta (16)|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080626/opinion/one-world.214168|work=[[Times of Malta]]|date=26 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010151910/http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20080626/opinion/one-world.214168|archivedate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
La Borsa was designed by [[Giuseppe Bonavia]] in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=HbCzLhVYkBsC&amp;pg=PA110 p.110]&lt;/ref&gt;Its design contrasts with Valletta's traditional architecture. Its façade has an imposing symmetrical [[colonnade]] in the [[Ionic order]]. It has three floors above street level and an underground level. Inaugurated in 1848, the building's design is rather simple but elegant at the same time.&lt;ref name=oneworld/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2014-02-18/books/Commerce-and-Art-working-hand-in-hand-3994812416|title=Commerce and Art working hand in hand - The Malta Independent|website=Independent.com.mt|accessdate=27 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felice, David (2013) in Bonello, Giovanni (ed.).

== Accolades ==
The novel won the 2018 Man Booker Prize. Her novel became the 50th novel to win the Man Booker prize.

Kwame Anthony Appiah, Chair of judges commented:

‘The language of Anna Burns’ Milkman is simply marvellous; beginning with the distinctive and consistently realised voice of the funny, resilient, astute, plain-spoken, first-person protagonist. From the opening page her words pull us into the daily violence of her world — threats of murder, people killed by state hit squads — while responding to the everyday realities of her life as a young woman, negotiating a way between the demands of family, friends and lovers in an unsettled time. The novel delineates brilliantly the power of gossip and social pressure in a tight-knit community, and shows how both rumour and political loyalties can be put in the service of a relentless campaign of individual sexual harassment. Burns draws on the experience of Northern Ireland during the Troubles to portray a world that allows individuals to abuse the power granted by a community to those who resist the state on their behalf. Yet this is never a novel about just one place or time. The local is in service to an exploration of the universal experience of societies in crisis.’

In [[New Zealand]] [[economics]], '''onshore and offshore services''' are respectively [[service (economics)|services]] provided within New Zealand to foreigners and services provided outside New Zealand to New Zealanders.

==Onshore services==

The best example of an onshore service is tourism. For example, if an American resident were to travel to New Zealand, and play golf with his friends in [[Auckland]], the provision of golfing facilities would be classified as an onshore service as the Auckland (New Zealand) golf club is providing the American tourist with a service.

==Offshore services==

New Zealand is heavily reliant on overseas providers for insurance services and for transport for goods via sea. For instance, if a New Zealand tourist flies [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Airlines]] from Ireland to London, this tourist has used a service, not provided by his own country, to travel from one place to another.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8512">'''Partners in Population and Development''' (PPD) is an intergovernmental initiative created specifically for the purpose of expanding and improving South-to-South collaboration in the fields of reproductive health, population, and development. PPD was launched at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD), when ten developing countries from Asia, Africa and Latin America formed an intergovernmental alliance to help implement the Cairo Program of Action (POA). This POA, endorsed by 179 nations, stresses the need to establish mechanisms to promote development through the sharing of experiences in reproductive health (RH) and family planning (FP) within and among countries and to promote effective partnerships among the governments, Non- Governmental-Organizations (NGOs), research institutions and the private sector.

During the five-year review of the implementation of the POA (“Cairo+5”), representatives at the June 1999 Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly not only documented renewed commitment to the goals of the ICPD, but also encouraged intensified support of South- South Collaboration.

According to their website, the PPD is the "only organization in the world fully dedicated to South-South partnerships." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.south-south-ppd.org/abtppd_history.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929010506/http://www.south-south-ppd.org/abtppd_history.asp |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }} ''Partners in Population and Development History''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
PPD an Intergovernmental Alliance of developing countries is committed to improving the quality of life of people through sustained advocacy, capacity building, networking, knowledge sharing and management and transfer of technology in the field of reproductive health, population and development within the framework of South-South Cooperation.

      <comment>/* Interplanetary systems */ Radar only works in geospace, for object this small</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3682">A '''positioning system''' is a mechanism for determining the location of an object in space. Technologies for this task exist ranging from worldwide coverage with meter accuracy to workspace coverage with sub-millimetre accuracy.

== Interplanetary systems ==
Interplanetary-radio communication system not only communicate with spacecraft, but are also used to determine their position. [[Radar]] can track targets near the Earth, but spacecraft in deep space must have a working [[transponder]] on board to echo a radio signal back. Orientation information can be obtained using [[Attitude control (spacecraft)#Star tracker|star tracker]]s.

== Global systems ==
[[Satellite navigation|Global navigation satellite system]]s (GNSS) allow specialized radio receivers to determine their 3-D space position, as well as time, with an accuracy of 2–20 metres or tens of nanoseconds. Currently deployed systems use microwave signals that can only be received reliably outdoors and that cover most of Earth's surface, as well as near-Earth space.

The existing and planned systems are:

*[[Global Positioning System]] – US military system, fully operational since 1995
*[[GLONASS]] – Russian military system, fully operational since October 2011
*[[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] – On 21 October 2011 the first two of four operational satellites were launched the next two will follow in 2012. Expected completion is 2019
*[[Beidou navigation system]] – a planned project in China
*[[Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System]] – a planned project in India

== Regional systems ==
Networks of land-based positioning transmitters allow specialized radio receivers to determine their 2-D position on the surface of the Earth. They are generally less accurate than GNSS because their signals are not entirely restricted to [[line-of-sight propagation]], and they have only regional coverage. However, they remain useful for special purposes and as a backup where their signals are more reliably received, including underground and indoors, and receivers can be built that consume very low battery power. [[LORAN]] is such a system.

==Site-wide systems==
Indoor positioning systems are optimized for use within individual rooms, buildings, or construction sites. They typically offer centimeter-accuracy. Some provide 6-D location and orientation information.

Examples of existing systems include

* [[Active Bat]]

== Workspace systems ==
These are designed to cover only a restricted workspace, typically a few cubic meters, but can offer accuracy in the millimeter-range or better. They typically provide 6-D position and orientation. Example applications include [[virtual reality]] environments, alignment tools for [[computer-assisted surgery]] or radiology, and cinematography ([[motion capture]], [[match moving]]).

Examples: [[Wii Remote]] with Sensor Bar, Polhemus Tracker, Precision Motion Tracking Solutions InterSense&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intersense.com/|title=InterSense {{!}} Precision Motion Tracking Solutions {{!}} Home|website=www.intersense.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Ronin''' is a [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[Singapore]]. They are infamous{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} for their live performances and being one of the few high-profile rock bands around. Before their entry to the mainstream market, the band launched a [[Self-publishing|self-released]] [[Extended play|EP]] which included 5 songs, and later released an [[LP album|LP]] which was hugely successful{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://juice.com.sg/leonard-soosays-10-greatest-anthems-singapore/|title=Leonard Soosay's 10 greatest anthems for Singapore {{!}} JUICE Singapore|date=2017-08-09|work=JUICE Singapore|access-date=2018-10-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Their debut album ''Do or Die'' has received rave reviews{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} by local press, and is one of the top selling English-language albums in Singapore of all time{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. In 2006, the band collaborated with local [[Mediacorp]] artiste [[Fiona Xie]] in a love song duet, entitled "Love Will Shine on Through". The song was recorded to raise funds for a [[cancer]] project, with a [[book]] and a [[CD]] recorded together. One of their songs, "One More Moment", was covered by Singaporean artiste [[Ho Yeow Sun]].

The band enjoyed a number one hit called ''Black Maria'' in the Singapore charts, the song ''Crazy Son'' reached third.&lt;ref name="cdbaby"&gt;[http://cdbaby.com/cd/ronintunes CD Baby] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621125254/http://cdbaby.com/cd/ronintunes |date=2008-06-21 }} - notes on "Do or Die"&lt;/ref&gt; Ronin has also written the theme song and title soundtrack 'Memories' for the film ''[[Singapore Dreaming]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funkygrad.com/lifestyle/displayarticle.php?artID=808&amp;subcat=popcorn www.funkygrad.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130123214204/http://www.funkygrad.com/lifestyle/displayarticle.php?artID=808&amp;subcat=popcorn |date=2013-01-23 }} - Ronin interview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singaporedreaming.com/fullcredits.htm www.singaporedreaming.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204140607/http://www.singaporedreaming.com/fullcredits.htm |date=2008-02-04 }} – Full credits&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2007, lead singer Levan Wee performed with the band for the last time, due to a combination of personal issues, as well as differences in musical direction&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.soft.com.sg/forum/showthread.php?29640-Levan-left-Ronin|title=Levan left Ronin|website=www.soft.com.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

She contributed to the development of the Catalan public schools during the first third of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/icdones/menuitem.4b491b5fa301c8a439a72641b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=4ba3770fb6f5f110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=4ba3770fb6f5f110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default|title=Rosa Sensat i Vilà: una ciència de la vida en una escola com la llar|publisher=[[Institut Català de les Dones]]|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
She undertook education studies in [[Barcelona]] and in [[Madrid]]'s ''Escuela Central de Magisterio'' (''Central Education Studies School''). Afterwards she studied at [[Geneva]]'s Institut Rousseau and other European schools, where she learnt about new educational trends.

In 1900, she passed the public examinations so as to become a houseworks headmistress in [[Alacant]]. However, she got married to David Ferrer in 1903, and the couple moved to [[Barcelona]]. The year after, their first daughter, [[Àngels Ferrer i Sensat]] was born.

Sensat spread the new educational trends, and in 1914 she became the first director of the girls section of [[Barcelona]]'s Escola de Bosc. In 1921 she was commissioned to design the studies program for Barcelona's Institut de Cultura i Biblioteca Popular de la Dona, a cultural centre created in 1909 by [[Francesca Bonnemaison]] which was the first centre in Europe especially focused in women's cultural and working education.&lt;ref name=bonnemaison&gt;{{cite web|last=Segura Soriano|first=Isabel|title=La biblioteca popular Francesca Bonnemaison|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/icdones/menuitem.4b491b5fa301c8a439a72641b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=e0bd2a0646f5f110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=e0bd2a0646f5f110VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default|publisher=Generalitat de Catalunya}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, Sensat gave courses and conferences for [[Mancomunitat de Catalunya]]'s educational programs, in summer schools, and also in Institut de Cultura i Biblioteca Popular de la Dona. She also participated in several international conferences on education, such as the 1st national conference on primary education ([[Barcelona]], 1909), the 3rd international conference on ''Enseignement Menager'' ([[Paris]], 1922), and the ''Écoles Nouvelles'' conference ([[Nice]], 1932).

Sensat hold the Escola de Bosc headmaster position until 1930, when she became the director of Barcelona's Grup Escolar Milà i Fontanals. Severely affected by the [[Spanish Civil War]] and its aftermath, she got retired in 1939.

A group of teachers created the ''Escola de Mestres Rosa Sensat'' (Rosa Sensat teaching school) in 1955, in acknowledgement of Sensat's work regarding the spreading of new educational trends and her ability to manage schools.

'''''Summer in the Golden Valley''''' (Original title in [[List of Bosnia-Herzegovina films|Bosnian]]: '''''Ljeto u zlatnoj dolini''''') is a 2003 [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]n film by [[Srđan Vuletić]], produced by [[Ademir Kenović]]. The movie is about a 16-year-old boy who has to repay his dead father's debt. In order to collect money, his friend and he get involved in [[Sarajevo]]'s underground crime.

== Plot ==
At the traditional Muslim funeral service for his father Fikret Varupa, sixteen-year-old boy from Sarajevo, learns that his father owes money to Hamid, a man he does not even know. The debt is considerable and Hamid does not want it to go to the grave with the body, so the debt automatically passes from the father to the son.
Since in Bosnia this way of collecting debts, at a funeral, is considered to be utterly humiliating, it is never, ever applied. Fikret and his entire family become subjects of ridicule.
Fikret, who is practically still a child, is decisive to "redeem his father's soul". Wishing to repay his father's debt and to secure the forgiveness, Fikret wanders into the real world of Sarajevo, the world that is ruled by post-war chaos, misery and poverty and becomes an ideal target for two corrupted policemen who wish to "help" him: they plant the kidnapped girl on him.

The '''Trade Unions Forum''' (FZZ) is a [[national trade union center]] in [[Poland]]. It held its first congress on April 15–16, 2002 in [[Warsaw]], second on April 26–28, 2006 in Zegrze near Warsaw, and on April 12–14, 2010 in [[Bydgoszcz]].

Despite opposition, particularly from the [[All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions]] (OPZZ), the FZZ has secured membership at the Polish [[Tripartite Commission]].

In 2005 during the campaign for parliamentary elections, FZZ failed to form an election coalition with the [[left-wing populism|left-wing populist]] peasants party "[[Samoobrona]]" led by [[Andrzej Lepper]].

The membership of FZZ to the European trade union confederation CESI is suspended, as FZZ does not pay its fees and is absent from meetings.

'''Čop Street''' ({{lang-sl|Čopova ulica}}) is a major [[pedestrian]] thoroughfare in the center of [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]] and regarded as the capital's central [[promenade]].

==Location==
The street leads from the [[Main Post Office (Ljubljana)|Main Post Office]] ({{lang|sl|Glavna pošta}}) at [[Slovene Street (Ljubljana)|Slovene Street]] ({{lang|sl|Slovenska cesta}}) to [[Prešeren Square]] ({{lang|sl|Prešernov trg}}).

==History==
Until the late 19th century, the street was known as Elephant Street ({{lang|sl|Slonova ulica}}) in memory of an [[elephant]] present in the city in the 16th century.
