'''Amakhosi Theatre Productions''' (also known as '''Amakhosi Academy of Performing Arts''') is a [[Zimbabwe]]an [[theatre company]] based at the Amakhosi Township Square Cultural Centre in [[Makokoba]] township, [[Bulawayo]]. The company was established under its current name in 1981 by [[Cont Mhlanga]],&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;
and has since become an influential cultural institution in Zimbabwe, playing a role not only in stimulating the performance arts scene, but also in examining critical issues in politics, health, women's rights and development with urban and rural communities through a method of active audience engagement.&lt;ref&gt;Chinyowa, K. C. (2009). Emerging paradigms for applied drama and theatre practice in [[Africa]]n contexts. ''Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance'', 14 (3), 329 -346&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and Development==

The group's origins go back to 1979 when Mhlanga and his Dragons Karate Club colleagues turned up one day for their training session at Makokoba's Stanley Hall and found the hall booked for a theatre workshop. The karate club members attended the workshop out of curiosity, and it was during this experience that their enthusiasm for theatre was first ignited.&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), p.44&lt;/ref&gt;
Cont Mhlanga began to attend theatre workshops in Bulawayo and Harare in 1980 and 1981 (in the newly independent Zimbabwe), from which he would return to share newly acquired skills with his karate club. In 1981, the Dragons Karate Club officially renamed itself “Amakhosi Productions”.&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

The performers became highly active in the township of Makokoba and beyond. By 1990 the group had performed 295 times on stage, and grown to 110 active members.&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), 44 – 47&lt;/ref&gt; Initially Cont Mhlanga was the sole writer, director and producer of all the plays. However, later other Amakhosi playwrights, such as Cont's brother Styx Mhlanga, were to make contributions to the company’s extensive repertoire, while the company expanded and diversified.&lt;ref&gt;Visit to Amakhosi Township Square and interview with Styx Mhlanga, January 20th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and Cultural Context==
Amakhosi was founded within a unique historical and cultural context. Prior to Zimbabwe’s 1980 attainment of political independence, [[Rhodesia]]n cultural and social life was polarised.&lt;ref&gt;Seda, O. S. (2004). Transculturalism in Post-independence Zimbabwean Drama: Projections of Zimbabwean Theatre at the Onset of a New Millenium. ''Zambezia'', 31 (2), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senior Drama Lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, Owen Seda, notes that "as a conquest society, colonial Rhodesia was in dire need of legitimacy in its values and existence as a domineering settler society…Through theatre and other arts, western civilisation was contrasted with the lives of indigenous people who were regarded as uncivilised and without a culture."&lt;ref&gt;Seda, O. S. (2004). Transculturalism in Post-independence Zimbabwean Drama: Projections of Zimbabwean Theatre at the Onset of a New Millenium. ''Zambezia'', 31 (2), p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

It was inevitable that after independence this segregation of Zimbabwean theatre would continue. Indeed, for the first decade following Zimbabwe’s independence in 1980, the National Theatre Organisation (a colonial establishment) continued its support of exclusive white amateur theatre companies.  In this context, Amakhosi emerged as a strand of revolutionary black nationalist theatre, critical not only of colonialism, but also of the post-independence leadership which it characterised as hypocritical and corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Seda, O. S. (2004). Transculturalism in Post-independence Zimbabwean Drama: Projections of Zimbabwean Theatre at the Onset of a New Millenium. ''Zambezia'', 31 (2), p. 136-147&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Zimbabwe Association of Community based Theatres]] (ZATC), established six years after independence, promoted indigenous township theatre, with the aim of encouraging cultural equality. However, black and white theatre traditions remained confrontational throughout the 1980s. At the onset of  the 1990s, the attempts by various cultural activists (such as [[Cont Mhlanga]]) to break racial divisions in the arts resulted in a "process of transculturalism and hybridity in post-independence Zimbabwean theatre; leading to production of plays that resonate with traditional forms of African theatre infused with elements of western drama…(producing) theatre works of outstanding cultural and artistic merit."&lt;ref&gt;Seda, O. S. (2004). Transculturalism in Post-independence Zimbabwean Drama: Projections of Zimbabwean Theatre at the Onset of a New Millenium. ''Zambezia'', 31 (2), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

In the play ''Workshop Negative'' (see below) in 1986, Amakhosi showed its willingness from early on to collaborate across the divide (in this case with Chris Hurst, a white Zimbabwean actor from the exclusive white theatre tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;Seda, O. S. (2004). Transculturalism in Post-independence Zimbabwean Drama: Projections of Zimbabwean Theatre at the Onset of a New Millenium. ''Zambezia'', 31 (2), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amakhosi Productions==
Cont Mhlanga has been described by theatre expert Jane Plastow as "a product of urban township life", in contrast to many other African [[playwright]]s who hail from the elite classes.&lt;ref&gt;Plastow, J. (1996). ''African Theatre and Politics: the evolution of theatre in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe – a comparative study''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

Mhlanga's first plays – ''Children Children'' (1983), ''Book of Lies'' (1983) and ''Diamond Warriors'' (1983) – were performed in English, with little dialogue and extensive use of karate. Their themes were political – about colonisation, the theft of Africa’s cultural heritage and its natural wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Plastow, J. (1996). ''African Theatre and Politics: the evolution of theatre in Ethiopia, Tanzania and Zimbabwe – a comparative study''. Amsterdam: Rodopi, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;
''Ngizozula Lawe'' (1984) was the first play in isiNdebele, the local language of Matabeleland, and was consequently a breakthrough for Amakhosi. It involved elderly dancers from the [[Bulawayo Traditional Dancers' Association]], whose participation in the performance, according to Professor Caleb Dube, "legitimised Amakhosi’s existence".&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), p.45&lt;/ref&gt; 

The theatre group had an agenda, as Mhlanga recounts: "The intention was to make the group known in Makokoba, make it a local institution…We wanted what we did to be of significance to a local audience, and they should be able to recognise themselves in what we were doing. So the lines in the plays were to a large extent based on what I heard people saying and the way they talked, in the workplace, in bars and so on."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Cont Mhlanga, Copenhagen, 8 September 1989, in Kaarsholm, P. (1990). Mental Colonisation of Catharsis? Theatre, Democracy and Cultural Struggle from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe. ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 16 (2), p.270&lt;/ref&gt;

Having captured the attention and admiration of the Makokoba people with ''Nansi Lendoda'' in 1985, which won five National Theatre Organization awards, the theatre group expanded beyond the township.&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1985 the actors began to engage their audiences in 'discussion theatre', often entering into controversial social, political and cultural topic areas.&lt;ref&gt;Kaarsholm, P. (1990).  Mental Colonisation of Catharsis? Theatre, Democracy and Cultural Struggle from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe. ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 16 (2), p.271&lt;/ref&gt; 

One such 'discussion theatre' performance – ''Workshop Negative'' (1986) – which the group had wanted to take on tour in [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]], was cut short as it did not receive "the Government’s blessing",&lt;ref&gt;Kaarsholm, P. (1990). Mental Colonisation of Catharsis? Theatre, Democracy and Cultural Struggle from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe. ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 16 (2), p.273&lt;/ref&gt; due to its highly critical portrayal of the country’s leaders as hypocritical and corrupt. The controversial banning of the play, and the implications this had for other artists' freedom of expression, caused a deep sense of unease in the arts community. The Writers' Union saw the episode as a fundamental challenge to free speech,&lt;ref&gt;Kaarsholm, P. (1990). Mental Colonisation of Catharsis? Theatre, Democracy and Cultural Struggle from Rhodesia to Zimbabwe. ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 16 (2), p.273&lt;/ref&gt; and it was to signify just the beginning of Amakhosi’s many issues with oppressive authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/may/12/david-smith-cont-mhlanga/ Smith, David. (2009) Interview with Cont Mhlanga (accessed 6. October 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Citizen Mind'', produced in 1986, urged a revitalisation of Zimbabwean traditional cultures, arguing that they should be the basis for future development. ''Cry-Isilio'' (1987/88) dealt with the capitalist system and its perpetual repression of workers, as well as sexual harassment of under-privileged women.&lt;ref&gt;Chifunyise, S. (1990). Trends in Zimbabwean Theatre since 1980. ''Journal of Southern African Studies'', 16 (2), p.283&lt;/ref&gt;
"Stitsha" (1990) dealt with many serious issues of crime, unemployment, corruption, and the suppression of women. The play was taken on a European tour in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aloismoyo.com/theatre.html/ |title=actor Alois Moyo (accessed 5. October 2011) |access-date=2011-10-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425051812/http://www.aloismoyo.com/theatre.html |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the company branched out to radio with ''Ngokwako Sgadula'' (a popular serial about family planning), and TV with ''Tshada Laye'', a screen play about marriage and divorce (13 episodes).&lt;ref&gt;Dube, C. (1992). Amakhosi Theatre: Ako-Bulawayo. ''TDR'', 36 (2), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Many plays and European tours followed in the 1990s. Several Amakhosi dancers and actors, such as [[Alois Moyo]], have risen to prominence in the Zimbabwean theatre scene, or have headed abroad to advance their careers in [[South Africa]] and Europe. Zimbabwe's significant political and economic upheaval since 1999 has created serious setbacks for the theatre, both financially, and in the stifling of free expression. Cont Mhlanga has won several awards for his work, including the [[Freedom to Create Prize]] in 2008, for "practising protest theatre and challenging state ideologies in Zimbabwe for over 25 years. He has been the target of state surveillance, intimidation, harassment, arrest and detention."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731041748/http://www.freedomtocreate.com/cont-mhlanga/ Freedom to create (accessed 7. October 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Visit to Amakhosi Township Square and interview with Styx Mhlanga, January 20th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social Change and Development Projects==
Amakhosi Theatre has initiated several projects and collaborations with African and European organisations, and received vital funding support for its activities, mainly from [[Scandinavia]], through NGOs such as NORAD, [[DANIDA]] and [[HiVOS]].&lt;ref&gt;Seda, O. S. (2004). Transculturalism in Post-independence Zimbabwean Drama: Projections of Zimbabwean Theatre at the Onset of a New Millenium. ''Zambezia'', 31 (2), p.140&lt;/ref&gt; Its main venue, the ''Amakhosi Township Square Cultural Centre'',  with its offices, library, practice rooms, bar and open air stage, is a cultural hub hosting performances, concerts, dance and theatre workshops.&lt;ref&gt;Visit to Amakhosi Township Square and interview with Styx Mhlanga, January 20th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the decade since the year 2000, Amakhosi Productions has lacked sufficient funding and revenue to support the level of activity that it was previously able to sustain. However, at a new alternative venue in 2011, in Bulawayo City centre - the '''Amakhosi Elite 400''' (already described as "Zimbabwe's premiere arts and culture hub") - the company has attempted to revive its activities and host a diverse array of performance events.&lt;ref&gt;http://[http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-entertainment-sc-events-byo-3634-article-Amakhosi+Elite+400+Zimbabwe's+premiere+arts+and+culture+hub.html/ Bulawayo 24News (accessed 7. October 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voices From Zimbabwe===
Voices From Zimbabwe began with a statement by Cont Mhlanga from the Amakhosi Theatre in 2007, announcing the launch of a movement to  "support creative artists from all disciplines to produce, perform, distribute and amplify the voices of the majority who live in Difficult Times while exposing the trickery and hypocrisy of the minority who live in Good Times, while they claim to be acting on behalf of the people and the country, by taking such critical and sometimes protest works to the people by all means available and possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voicesfromzimbabwe.com/content/view/35/44// Voices from Zimbabwe (accessed 6. October 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amakhosi Theatre for Community Action (TCA)===
Established in 2001, this programme, uses a particular methodology created by the Amakhosi Theatre to "support and involve rural community members in the fight against HIV/AIDS" through the effective use of drama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comminit.com/?q=africa/node/126245/ C-Capacity online resource center (accessed 7. October 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;
It incorporates folk media like song, dance and narrative with spontaneous participation, to communicate the issue of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;Chinyowa, K. C. (2009). Emerging paradigms for applied drama and theatre practice in African contexts. Research in Drama Education: ''The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance'', 14 (3), 335&lt;/ref&gt;
(In interviews Mhlanga emphasises that theatre is a part of people’s everyday activity, and in the African context it must diverge in some sense from the Western notion of theatre.)&lt;ref&gt;Mhlanga, C. (2002) Interview at Grand Palm Hotel, Gaborone, 26 November, in Chinyowa, K. C. (2007). Helping them to help themselves: case study of an integrated popular theatre approach in Africa. ''The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance'', 12 (2), 140 (Mhlanga, interview 2002 in Chinyowa 2007: 140)&lt;/ref&gt; The initial TCA practical theatre skills training programme lasted 1 year and taught the TCA methodology to 7 districts in Matabeleland province, which resulted in plays being performed to 80 000 people.  The organizers stated that “community theatre can take the message to the people, instead of getting people to the theatre”. Amakhosi’s TCA development methodology is continuing to be implemented by Amakhosi in Zimbabwe, and other development groups elsewhere in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Chinyowa, K. C. (2007). Helping them to help themselves: case study of an integrated popular theatre approach in Africa. ''The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance'', 12 (2), 133-147&lt;/ref&gt; The Theatre has received substantial funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) for "addressing HIV/AIDS and Promoting Gender Equality through Music and Theatre."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acdi-cida.gc.ca/acdi-cida/contributions.nsf/Eng/2F5B1D5FDFEB08A285257290005928D6/ Canadian International Development Agency (accessed 6. October 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary School Drama===
Meanwhile, [[Styx Mhlanga]] continues to implement a new project in [[Matabeleland]], teaching secondary school literature texts to students by working with them on theatrical adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;Visit to Amakhosi Township Square and interview with Styx Mhlanga, January 20th, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''American Gangster''''' is a 2007 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[crime film]] directed and produced by [[Ridley Scott]] and written by [[Steven Zaillian]]. The film is fictionally based on the criminal career of [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]], a gangster from [[La Grange, North Carolina]] who smuggled heroin into the United States on American service planes returning from the [[Vietnam War]], before being detained by a task force led by detective [[Richie Roberts]]. The film stars [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Russell Crowe]] in their first lead acting roles together since 1995's ''[[Virtuosity]]''. The film also co-stars [[Ted Levine]], [[John Ortiz]], [[Josh Brolin]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Norman Reedus]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Lymari Nadal]] and [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]

Development for the film initially began in 2000, when [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story about the rise and fall of Lucas. Two years later, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] introduced a 170-page [[scriptment]] to Scott. Original production plans were to commence in [[Toronto]] for budget purposes; however, production eventually relocated permanently to New York City. Because of the film's rising budget Universal canceled production in 2004. After negotiations with [[Terry George]], it was later revived with Scott at the helm in March 2005. Principal photography commenced over a period of five months from July to December 2006; filming took place throughout [[New York City]] and concluded in [[Thailand]].

''American Gangster'' premiered in New York on October 20, 2007, and was released in the United States and Canada on November 2. The film was well received by most film critics, and grossed over US$266.5 million worldwide, with domestic grosses standing at $130.1 million. Many of the people portrayed, including Roberts and Lucas, have stated that the film took a lot of creative license with the story, and three former [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents sued Universal claiming the agency's portrayal was demoralizing. ''American Gangster'' was nominated for twenty-one awards, including two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] (Ruby Dee), and won three including a [[14th Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role for Dee.

==Plot==
In 1968, [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]] is the right-hand man of [[Harlem]] gangster [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]]. When Johnson dies of a heart attack, Lucas takes control of the Harlem crime scene.

After handing in almost $1 million that he found in a mobster's car, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] detective [[Richie Roberts]] is ostracized in his precinct. After his exiled and addicted partner overdoses on a potent brand of  [[heroin]] called "Blue Magic", Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a task force  that targets local suppliers. Lucas buys Blue Magic directly from producers in Thailand and smuggles it into the U.S. through returning [[Vietnam War]] servicemen. His low overhead allows him to eventually wholesale Blue Magic to most of the dealers in the New York area. With this monopoly, Lucas expands his control to nightclubs, casinos, and prostitution. He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers, including Huey and Turner, as lieutenants to spread his empire. During his rise to becoming Harlem's crime boss, Lucas falls in love with Eva, a Puerto Rican beauty queen.

As Lucas' business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the [[Fight of the Century]] with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]] boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure [[Nicky Barnes]], a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the [[Fall of Saigon]] cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.

Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' cousin and driver shoot a woman and then use the threat of a long sentence to get him to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]]. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized [[Shelby Mustang]] Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.

In the police station, Lucas offers to bribe Roberts, but is rebuffed. Instead, Roberts offers Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, three quarters of the New York [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, having just passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.

===Development and writing===
[[File:Russell Crowe TIFF 2006.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Russell Crowe]] (pictured here in 2006) worked with director Ridley Scott on the film's script.|alt=Russell Crowe in a premiere.]]
In 2000, [[Universal Pictures]] and [[Imagine Entertainment]] purchased the rights to "The Return of Superfly", a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine story by [[Mark Jacobson]] about the rise and fall of the 1970s heroin kingpin Frank Lucas.&lt;ref name="fame"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Kleinknecht, William | title=FROM FOES TO FRIENDS AND NOW ON TO FAME | work=[[The Star-Ledger]] | date=October 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, screenwriter [[Steven Zaillian]] brought a 170-page script to director [[Ridley Scott]], who expressed interest in making two films from it. However, Scott did not immediately pursue the project, choosing to make ''[[Kingdom of Heaven (film)|Kingdom of Heaven]]'' instead. In November 2003, Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with [[Brian De Palma]] to direct ''Tru Blu'', with a script by Zaillian based on Frank Lucas.&lt;ref name="re-imagined"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117895211.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title=U is re-Imagined | work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=November 5, 2003 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ew&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20154184,00.html|title=Clash of the Titans|first=Josh|last=Rottenberg |date=October 25, 2007 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zaillian interpreted the story as one of "American business and race", focusing the script thematically on corporate business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Leland, John |authorlink=John Leland (journalist) | title=Gross National Product |work=The New York Times | date=October 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was initially slated for a spring 2004 start.&lt;ref name="re-imagined" /&gt; In March 2004, the studio entered new negotiations with [[Antoine Fuqua]] to direct, as well as [[Denzel Washington]] to star in the film as Frank Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Snyder, Gabriel |author2=Michael Fleming | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117901768.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 | title='Tru Blu' has liftoff at Imagine | work=Variety | date=March 15, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following May, [[Benicio del Toro]] entered negotiations to star as Detective Richie Roberts, who brought down Lucas. Production of ''Tru Blu'' was reset to begin in early fall 2004, with the film slated for a release date of June 3, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117905459.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title=Del Toro's 'Tru' calling | work=Variety | date=May 23, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, [[Dania Ramírez|Dania Ramirez]] entered negotiations to join the cast of the film, now titled ''American Gangster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=6358 |title=Ramirez Joining Fuqua's American Gangster |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=September 13, 2004 |accessdate=April 30, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031431/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=6358 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal Pictures reported that it greenlit ''American Gangster'' with a budget of $80&amp;nbsp;million, which escalated to $93&amp;nbsp;million, with $10&amp;nbsp;million for development costs and $3&amp;nbsp;million for the delay of the production start date. Sources close to the director insist that the budget was $93&amp;nbsp;million from the beginning. The studio also sought for ''American Gangster'' to be produced in Toronto rather than New York City to save money, but Fuqua resisted the re-location. The studio's parent company [[General Electric]] received [[tax credit]]s in New York City, so production was moved to the city. The move, however, inflated the budget to $98&amp;nbsp;million. Fuqua's camp insisted that it was seeking ways to reduce the budget, but the studio contended several aspects of the project under him. The director had wanted to film a Vietnam sequence in Thailand and to cast notable names such as [[Ray Liotta]] and [[John C. Reilly]] in minor roles. To add to the studio's budgetary concerns, Fuqua was rewriting the script during the preproduction process. The director also did not have a shot-list, final locations, and supporting actors signed to initiate production.&lt;ref name=wrap&gt;{{Cite news|author=Ascher-Walsh, Rebecca |author2=Jeff Jensen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,724273,00.html |title='Gangster' Wrap |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=October 22, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115130416/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C724273%2C00.html |archivedate=November 15, 2007 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuqua was fired on October 1, 2004, four weeks before principal photography would begin.&lt;ref name=wrap /&gt; The studio cited creative differences for the director's departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117911326.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=Fuqua ankles 'Gangster' | work=Variety | date=October 3, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Fuqua's departure, the studio met with [[Peter Berg]] to take over directing the film, and Denzel Washington had approved of the choice.&lt;ref name=wrap /&gt; Due to the search potentially escalating a budget already in the US$80&amp;nbsp;million range and the difficulty in recouping the amount based on the film's subject matter, Universal canceled production of ''American Gangster'', citing time constraints and creative elements for its reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117911582.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title='American Gangster' pic rubbed out by U | work=Variety | date=October 6, 2004 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cancellation cost the studio $30&amp;nbsp;million, of which $20&amp;nbsp;million went to Washington and $5&amp;nbsp;million went to del Toro due to their [[Guarantee (filmmaking)|pay or play contract]]s.&lt;ref name=wrap /&gt;

In March 2005, ''American Gangster'' was revived as Universal and Imagine entered negotiations with [[Terry George]] to revise Zaillian's script and direct the film, which was to be financed with a target budget of US $50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117919334.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title=U's still high on 'Gangster' | work=Variety | date=March 13, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Will Smith]] was approached to replace Washington as Frank Lucas, though an offer would be held off until George completed his revision of the script.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117923659.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1 | title=Thesp's 'American' dream | work=Variety | date=May 30, 2005 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; George cut many key scenes, characters and Asian locations to reduce costs, but the project failed to progress given financial problems and Grazer feeling they "couldn't make it right" without the removed material.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name=daily/&gt;

After a meeting between Scott and Zaillian on another project, Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided he was ready to do it. Producer [[Brian Grazer]] and Imagine executive Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision.&lt;ref name="going"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940290.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title=U gets going on 'Gangster' | work=Variety | date=March 23, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, [[Ridley Scott]] entered talks with the studio to take over ''American Gangster'' from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and [[Russell Crowe]] was attached to star as Roberts.&lt;ref name="redux"&gt;{{Cite news | author=Fleming, Michael | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117938111.html?categoryid=10&amp;cs=1 | title='Gangster' redux | work=Variety | date=February 13, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowe was drawn to the project based on his previous work with the director on ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' and ''[[A Good Year]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Morris, Wesley | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/11/05/russell_crowe_learns_to_smile/ | title=Russell Crowe learns to smile |work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=November 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's ''[[Virtuosity]]''.&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Production was slated in summer 2006.&lt;ref name="redux" /&gt;

Scott had discussed the script with Crowe as they worked on ''A Good Year'' in France, and they sought to take on the project. The director reviewed Zaillian's script, Terry George's rewrite, and a revision by [[Richard Price (writer)|Richard Price]] during the project's incarnation with director Antoine Fuqua. Scott preferred Zaillian's approach and chose to follow it. In realizing the project, the director encountered a challenge in the script since the characters Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts do not encounter each other until twenty minutes before the end of the film. The director sought to flesh out the private universes of the characters that would evolve and have scenes cut between the two characters to provide a balance. Elements like Frank Lucas's interaction with his family and Richie Roberts' dysfunctional marriage were written to add to the characters' backgrounds.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{Cite news | author=Douglas, Edward | url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=38623 | title= Ridley Scott's ''American Gangster'' | publisher=ComingSoon.net | date=October 25, 2007 | accessdate=November 3, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071027024412/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=38623| archivedate= October 27, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rappers [[T.I.]], [[Rza|RZA]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]] were added to the cast to appeal to younger audiences.&lt;ref name=jay /&gt;

Scott chose to direct ''American Gangster'' based on the paradoxical values of Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The film somewhat focuses on the comparatively ethical business practices of the "wicked gangster" and the womanizing and failed marriage of the "do-gooder" police detective. Washington, who was not normally a fan of gangster films, chose to portray Lucas when he saw "the arc of the character" had ended with prices that Lucas paid for his actions.&lt;ref name="fame" /&gt; To prepare for their roles, the actors met their real-life counterparts. Washington acquired Lucas's Southern accent, and Crowe practiced to match Roberts's manner of speaking and body language, requesting tape recordings of Roberts to assist in his preparation.&lt;ref name="fame" /&gt; The following March, the studio rehired Zaillian to rewrite the script for ''American Gangster''.&lt;ref name="going" /&gt; It was rumored that Washington got paid another $20&amp;nbsp;million for when the project was greenlit again; that rumor proved to be false, as he signed on for his gross.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/10/american-gangst.html |title=American Gangster: A Grazer Tale |author=Thompson, Anne |work=Thompson on Hollywood |accessdate=November 4, 2007 |date=Oct 17, 2007 |quote=Denzel Washington had already gotten paid his upfront guarantee pay-or-play, so he signed on just for his gross. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107134457/http://weblogs.variety.com/thompsononhollywood/2007/10/american-gangst.html |archivedate=2007-11-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget had escalated to $100 million, which Grazer stated was unexpected given "It's not a [[high-concept]] comedy, it's not a fantasy movie, it's not a [[four-quadrant movie]]".&lt;ref name=ew/&gt; Grazer and Scott still had to pay back the studio $3 million for a [[cost overrun|budget overrun]].&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/15/business/fi-gangster15/|title='Gangster' gets a shot|date=October 15, 2007|first=Claudia|last=Eller|website=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=November 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Image:Bknavyard.JPG|thumb|left|Principal photography took place in several location throughout New York, including the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]].|alt=Panoramic view of the Brooklyn Navy Yard.]]

Other locations for principal photography include the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]], [[Old Westbury Gardens]], a segment of the [[George Washington Bridge]], and the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division|Brooklyn Supreme Courthouse]]. [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]] in upstate [[New York (state)|New York]] had the locations for both the Lucas farm and the estate Lucas buys for his family.&lt;ref name=notes/&gt; Filming locations began setting up in [[Thailand]] in November 2006, after [[Branko Lustig]] consulted with Suvit Yodmanee, the country's tourism minister.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/11/1/movies/15833311&amp;sec=movies |title=Thailand beckons |website=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |publisher=Star Publications |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=November 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614040826/http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F11%2F1%2Fmovies%2F15833311&amp;sec=movies |archivedate=June 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming for ''American Gangster'' concluded in [[Chiang Mai]] the following month.&lt;ref name=star/&gt;

Using his experience from visiting New York in the same time period in which the film's story took place, Scott sought to downplay a "[[The Beatles|Beatles]]" atmosphere to the film and to instead create a shabbier atmosphere, saying that "Harlem was really, really shabby, beautiful [[brownstone]]s falling apart."&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; Production and costume design was emphasized, transforming the location into the rundown streets of upper Manhattan from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Denzel Washington, as Frank Lucas, went through 64 different costume changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Schwartz, Robert | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117963680.html?categoryid=1236&amp;cs=1 | title='Gangster' puts hit on gentrification | work=Variety | date=April 24, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
In 2006, [[Greg Calloway]] was approached by producers to produce a soundtrack for the film. He presented the idea to [[Atlantic Records]] chairman [[Craig Kallman]], and one of the company's artists, [[T.I.]], got an acting role in the film. However, the deal did not go further because Universal Pictures owned the rights to the film; "It was a Universal film and they were not going to give the soundtrack to [[Warner Music Group|WMG]]" (Atlantic's parent company).&lt;ref name="AG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gregcalloway.wordpress.com/bio/|title=Who Is Who is Greg Calloway?|publisher=Greg Calloway's official website|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Scott brought back [[Marc Streitenfeld]], who had worked with him in ''A Good Year''. The composer stated that "the overall tone needed to be something bigger and darker" given the characters' strong personalities, and while not being the original intention, he added shades of [[blues]] and [[soul music]] to fit the 1970s setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/soundtracks/INTERVIEW-Marc-Streitenfeld-7411.html|publisher=Cinema Blend|title=INTERVIEW - Marc Streitenfeld|first=Scott|last=Gwin|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical score for ''American Gangster'' was recorded between April and May 2007 by Streitenfeld, with the help of orchestrator Bruce Fowler and conductor Mike Nowak, using an 80-piece orchestra recorded in sections as well as acoustic pre-records, performed by Streitenfeld himself. Additional score material was composed and recorded by [[Hank Shocklee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Goldwasser, Dan | url=http://www.scoringsessions.com/news/87/ | title=Marc Streitenfeld scores Ridley Scott's ''American Gangster'' | publisher=ScoringSessions.com| date=May 15, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official soundtrack album for ''American Gangster'' was released by [[Def Jam Recordings]] within a week of the film's release. In addition to Streitenfeld and Shocklee's score material, the soundtrack album also features songs influenced by music in the 1960s and 1970s, including from blues and soul musicians such as [[Bobby Womack]], [[The Staple Singers]], [[Sam &amp; Dave]], and [[John Lee Hooker]].&lt;ref name=jay&gt;{{Cite news|author=Halbinger, David M. |author2=Leeds, Jeff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/arts/music/20jayz.html |title=For Jay-Z, Inspiration Arrives in a Movie |work=The New York Times |date=September 20, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207172627/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/arts/music/20jayz.html |archivedate=February 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grazer stated that "I wanted to introduce a visual and sonic world that is a contained entity of the '70s", and Scott felt it was vital to have "the brand of music that was Harlem at the time."&lt;ref name=notes/&gt;

Denzel Washington pressed Grazer into inviting rapper [[Jay-Z]] to write the film's score, but the producer "just didn't think there'd be enough for Jay-Z to do" given the intentions to do a soundtrack filled with 1970s music.&lt;ref name=jay /&gt; The film's trailer had already used Jay-Z's "Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)", and the rapper was invited to an advanced screening. The film had a profound resonance on the musician, who decided to create a concept album, also entitled ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]''.&lt;ref name=notes /&gt; The rapper recorded tracks that were prompted by specific scenes in the film. It was speculated that the album's release in conjunction with the film would attract a young audience and help Universal Pictures generate profits to recover from the film's troubled development history.&lt;ref name=jay /&gt; According to Jay-Z: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was like I was watching the film, and putting it on pause, and giving a back story to the story. It immediately clicked with me. Like ''Scarface'' or any one of those films, you take the good out of it, and you can see it as an inspiring film."&lt;ref name=jay /&gt;

{{quote box|width=35%|align=left|quote="Like many moviemakers [...], Mr. Scott loves his bad guy too much. And by turning Lucas into a figure who seduces instead of repels, an object of directorial fetishism and a token of black resistance, however hollow, he encourages us to submit as well. Part of this is structural and economic: blood and nihilism are always better sells than misery and hopelessness. Yet there's also a historical dimension, because when Lucas strolls down a fast-emptying Harlem street after putting a bullet into another man’s head and the camera pulls back for the long view, you are transported into the realm of myth. Once, another gunman, or the director, might have taken direct aim at Lucas. But the world belongs to gangsters now, not cowboys."|source=—Manohla Dargis of ''The New York Times''&lt;ref name=nyttimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/11/02/movies/02gang.html|last=Dargis|first=Manolha|title=American Gangster (2007)|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a perfect four star rating and opined, "This is an engrossing story, told smoothly and well." Ebert also praised Crowe's performance, saying that his contribution to the storytelling was "enormous".&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071101/REVIEWS/711010303|title=American Gangster |accessdate=November 5, 2011 |date=November 2, 2007 |last=Ebert |first=Robert |website=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Paul Byrnes of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' felt that ''American Gangster'' was "one of the most intelligent gangster films in years" and expressed that the film offers "the spectacle of grand themes and two bigger-than-life characters played by two of the best actors in cinema." Concluding his review, Byrnes gave the film four out of four stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/film-reviews/american-gangster/2008/01/03/1198949939913.html|title=American Gangster|first=Paul|last=Byrnes|website=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=January 3, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Jim "Stax" Vejvoda rated the film four out of five stars, praising the acting—particularly of the two protagonists, "both dynamic presences on-screen, with neither actor outweighing the other's importance to the story"—and declaring that despite being preceded by other gangster stories such as ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''American Gangster'' managed to justify its existence with "emphasis on the human and class elements of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/11/01/american-gangster-review-2|title=American Gangster Blu-ray Review|last=Monfette, Pirrello|first=Christopher, Phil|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=September 26, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111092627/http://movies.ign.com/articles/831/831913p1.html|archivedate=November 11, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manohla Dargis of ''The New York Times'' strongly commended the film, opining that "greatness hovers just outside ''American Gangster''." She continued: "It's a seductive package, crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city back in the day, when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red."&lt;ref name=nyttimes/&gt; These sentiments were echoed by Sukhdev Sandhu of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', who asserted that the storyline was "amazing".&lt;ref name="Tele"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/3669300/Film-reviews-American-Gangster-and-Brick-Lane.html|title=Film reviews: American Gangster and Brick Lane|first=Sukhdev |last=Sandhu |website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=November 16, 2007 |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison, some reviewers were more critical of ''American Gangster''. Jonathan Crocker of ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]'' was polarized with the film, criticizing its aesthetics. In his review, he wrote, "Scott's meticulous aesthetics can’t touch the urban texture and deep focus of ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'', ''[[The Godfather]]'', ''[[Serpico]]'' and ''[[Prince of the City]]'' – all looming heavily in intertextual nods." In contrast, Crocker praised Washington's acting, writing, "He's immense: centering every scene with tractor-beam charisma, that dangerous, easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence." In conclusion, Crocker gave the film three out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/84261/american-gangster.html|title=American Gangster (2007)|last=Crocker|first=Jonathan|website=[[Time Out (company)|Time Out London]]|date=November 18, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a 'C-' grade, expressing that ''American Gangster'' is "never dull, but it could have used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue." Gleiberman found Washington's performance to have "a ghastly ingenuity".&lt;ref name=ewew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20155724,00.html|title=American Gangster (2007)|first=Owen |last=Gleiberman |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]''{{'}}s Ian Freer rated the film three stars out of five; he stated that it was "undeniably enjoyable" and praised the cast, but also noted that he felt that "very little in the movie feels fresh, re-treading scenes, riffs and imagery from the whole history of crime flicks" and that the film did not explore enough of Lucas' story and Scott's visual imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=134550|title=American Gangster|website=Empire|first=Ian|last=Freer |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slant Magazine]] journalist Nick Schager harshly criticized the film, giving the film a one out of four stars. Schager remarked that the film was "dumb as a rock", and that it was "far too convinced of its import to be any fun."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/american-gangster/3211|title=American Gangster|first=Nick|last=Schager|website=[[Slant Magazine]]|publisher=|date=October 21, 2007|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giving ''American Gangster'' a two out of five stars, [[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' was disappointed with Washington's acting, asserting, "He doesn't seem to relax and enjoy himself in the role, or even inhabit it very satisfyingly." He resumed: "He never has the menace of his dirty cop in ''[[Training Day]]'', and we don't see anything like the transformation from street-hustler to leader in ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]''.

In an interview with [[MSNBC]], Lucas expressed his excitement about the film and amazement at Denzel Washington's portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://insidedateline.nbcnews.com/_news/2007/10/26/4374157-breakfast-with-the-real-american-gangster |title=Breakfast with the real 'American Gangster'|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date= October 26, 2007 |author=Davis, Bradley |work=[[Dateline NBC|Inside Dateline]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Lucas admitted to several news outlets that only a small portion of the film was true,&lt;ref name=GangLiesNYPost&gt;{{Cite web|title=GANGING UP ON MOVIE'S 'LIES' |website=New York Post |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/item_KbkhlJoI4y3vbAa9lEAEZN;jsessionid=3AB880C9B783B42F3625F06ACCFC358D |author=[[Susannah Cahalan]] |date=November 4, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214041142/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/item_KbkhlJoI4y3vbAa9lEAEZN |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that much of it was fabricated for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=TheVoice&gt;{{cite web|date = 2007-12-09|url = http://archive.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=12509|archive-url = https://archive.is/20120917180100/http://archive.voice-online.co.uk/content.php?show=12509|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2012-09-17|title = The Real American Gangster|publisher = voice-online|accessdate = 2008-03-08|last = Janelle Oswald|quote = She spent five years in prison for aiding her husband's narcotic smuggling trade.

Roberts criticized the portrayal of Lucas, describing it as "almost noble".&lt;ref name=GangLiesNYPost/&gt;

[[Sterling Johnson Jr.]], a federal judge who served as a special narcotics prosecutor for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] and assisted the arrest and trial of Lucas, described the film as "one percent reality and ninety-nine percent Hollywood." In addition, Johnson described the real life Lucas as "illiterate, vicious, violent, and everything Denzel Washington was not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Coyle, Jake|url=https://www.thestar.com/article/295102|title=Fabrications dim American Gangster's Oscar hopes|publisher=[[Toronto Star]]|date=January 17, 2008|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Jack Toal, Gregory Korniloff, and Louis Diaz filed a lawsuit against Universal saying that the events in the film were fictionalized and that the film [[Defamation|defamed]] them and hundreds of other agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&amp;nav=F8nI|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208093858/http://www.wpri.com/Global/story.asp?S=7734178&amp;nav=F8nI|archivedate=February 8, 2008|title=DEA agents sue over 'American Gangster' |publisher=[[WPRI-TV|WPRI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was eventually dismissed by US District Judge Colleen McMahon. While McMahon noted that the [[intertitle]] that appears at the end of the film, stating that Lucas' collaboration led to the arrest of many corrupt DEA agents, was "wholly inaccurate", in that Lucas' cooperation did not lead to the convictions, and admonished that "It would behoove a major corporation like Universal (which is owned by a major news organization, NBC) not to put inaccurate statements at the end of popular films", she stated that the film failed to meet legal standards of defamation because it failed to "show a single person who is identifiable as a DEA agent".&lt;ref name="ABC/Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|publisher =[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]/[[Reuters]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-02-18/american-gangster-lawsuit-dismissed/1045622|title=American Gangster lawsuit dismissed|date= February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Lucas' other claims, as presented in the film, have also been called into question, such as being the right-hand man of [[Bumpy Johnson]], rising above the power of the Mafia and [[Leroy Barnes|Nicky Barnes]], and that he was the mastermind behind the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] heroin connection of the 1970s. Ron Chepesiuk, a biographer of Frank Lucas, deemed the story as a myth. [[Associated Press]] entertainment writer Frank Coyle noted that "this mess happened partly because journalists have been relying on secondary sources removed from the actual events."&lt;ref&gt;Chepesiuk, Ron (January 17, 2008).

{{distinguish|Art director}}
An '''artistic director''' is the executive of an arts organization, particularly in a theatre or dance company, who handles the organization's artistic direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Actor Prepares|last = Stanislavski|first = Constantin|publisher = Theatre Arts Inc. New York|year = 1936|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Meyerhold the Director|last = Rudnitsky|first = Konstantin, Transl. G. Petrov|publisher = Ardis, Ann Arbor, MI|year = 1981|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Empty Space|last = Brook|first = Peter|publisher = Harmondsworth, UK: Pelican|year = 1972|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally a [[Theatrical producer|producer]] and [[Theatre director|director]], but not in the sense of a [[Business magnate|mogul]], since the organization is generally a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] organization. The artistic director of a [[Theatre|theatre company]] is the individual with the overarching artistic control of the theatre's production choices, directorial choices, and overall artistic vision.  In smaller theatres, the artistic director may be the founder of the theatre and the primary director of its plays.  In larger non-profit theatres (often known in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] as [[Regional theater in the United States|regional theatres]]), the artistic director may be appointed by the [[board of directors]].

==Overview==
The artistic director of a performing arts company is similar to the [[Music director|musical director]] of an orchestra, the primary person responsible for planning a company's season. The artistic director's responsibilities can include (but are not limited to) choosing the [[Play (theatre)|material]] staged in a season, the hiring of creative/production personnel (such as [[theatre director|directors]]), and other theatre management tasks. He or she may also [[Theatre director|direct]] productions for the company. Artistic directors work closely with the general manager of the theatre, and contribute the artistic evaluation of projects and productions to be included in promotional, funding, and press materials. An artistic director also functions as a resource for the directors who are working to mount productions at the theatre and can provide support, counsel, and/or artistic input where requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Communication in Theatre Directing and Performance from rehearsal to production|last = Lanipekun|first = Jennifer|publisher = Cambria Press, New York|year = 2011|isbn = |location = |pages = Appendix I: Interview with Director 1, Artistic Director of Opera Company 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic director is usually prepared to assume the production should the director become unable to complete his/her duties. Artistic directors are frequently regarded as the artistic representatives of theatre companies and are often required to speak about their theatre to the press.  In the United States, artistic directors often have [[fundraising]] responsibilities as well. 

In some ensemble companies, the artistic director is responsible for recruiting performers to act as a talent pool for the company's productions.  This ensemble may include actors and artists of various disciplines. The artistic director functions as leader of this group, with the aim to create and/or realize various new and established works. 

In [[ballet]], the artistic director is the head of a [[ballet company]]. They have overall responsibility for training the dancers as well as selecting and mounting productions. They are almost always a retired dancer. Often they also [[Choreography|choreograph]] some of the company's productions. 

In some companies, the artistic director may also manage the day-to-day operations of the company, but in many (particularly larger) companies, the artistic director is often exempt from routine administrative duties, freeing him or her to concentrate on the art.  In those cases, decisions about administration, business issues, finances, fundraising, board relations, donor relations, publicity, and marketing devolve to the responsibility of the general manager, chief operating officer, managing director, etc. or are discussed collaboratively.

Ciardelli led the company as Artistic Director and CEO from 1997-2012, during which time Northern Stage produced 111 main stage productions over 16 seasons, 52 directed or co-directed 52 by Ciardelli. (Boston Herald, Terry Byrne.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Northern Stage Bids Farewell to Artistic Director Brooke Ciardelli|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/vermont/article/Northern-Stage-Bids-Farewell-to-Artistic-Director-Brooke-Ciardelli-20121117#|work=Broadway World|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won five Moss Hart Awards for Excellence in Theater from the New England Theatre Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moss Hart Award|url=http://www.netconline.org/moss-hart-award.php|accessdate=22 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126081357/http://netconline.org/moss-hart-award.php#|archive-date=2013-11-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ciardelli also established the “Celebrity Saturday” talk-back series to allow audiences to interact directly with professional actors and directors, as well as the Athena Sunday series of expert pre-show lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Script Club: ''Damascus''|url=http://blip.tv/northern-stage-presents/script-club-damascus-4780133|work=Blip TV|accessdate=22 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112032039/http://blip.tv/northern-stage-presents/script-club-damascus-4780133#|archive-date=2013-11-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Director and Producer ==

In her career, Ciardelli has directed over 60 productions in association with Northern Stage. (CT Valley Spectator, Aaron Nobel). As a director, she has been honored by the New England Theatre Conference’s Moss Hart Awards for Excellence in Theater three times.

Ciardelli directed a staged reading of Arthur Miller’s then-unpublished ''[[Resurrection Blues]]'', with the playwright himself in residence; has directed [[Patrick Stewart]] and [[Lisa Harrow]] in ''[[Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Warner|first=David|title=Miller's Tale|url=http://www.7dvt.com/2004/millers-tale|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=Seven Days|date=25 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with British playwright Sonja Linden on the American Premiere of ''The Strange Passenger''.

Ciardelli has directed eight World Premieres, 11 regional premieres, and premiere performances in Europe and Africa, including productions of ''Wit'', ''[[The Beauty Queen of Leenane]]'', ''[[I Am My Own Wife]]'', ''[[Pride’s Crossing]]'', and ''[[No Orchids for Miss Blandish (play)|No Orchids for Miss Blandish]]'', as well as a number of large-scale musicals. She has worked with actors from [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], [[London]]'s West End, and around the world, as well as touring, as co-director, with ''I Am My Own Wife'' to [[Harare]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Mark|title=Edinburgh Festival: Growing Up on the Road to War|url=http://www.onstagescotland.co.uk/iammyownwife.htm|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=22 August 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Award-Winning Play Coming to Zim|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200704190323.html|work=All-Africa.com|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the summer of 2010, she co-directed a production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' with Castle Theatre Company, which toured England and the northeast U.S., including Off-West End and Off-Broadway performances.

Ciardelli has adapted a number of classical pieces for the stage. In 2007 she was commissioned by [[Dartmouth College]] to adapt [[Ovid]]’s ''[[Metamorphoses]]''. Her play ''The O Myths'' was performed as the basis of an international exchange between actors from [[New York City]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mexico]], and [[Romania]]. (The Herald.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Randall|first=Lucy|title=Festival Presents Adaptation of Metamorphoses|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2007/07/06/arts/festival-presents-adaptation-of-metamorphoses|accessdate=23 December 2013|newspaper=The Dartmouth|date=6 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Siegel of [[The Boston Globe]] said in his review that ''The Shrew Tamer'' "feels a little like listening to a symphony orchestra speed through an edited version of Mahler before going all-out in Mantovani".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2004/10/20/shrew_pairing_is_too_tame/|title='Shrew' pairing is too tame|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 20, 2004|accessdate=August 24, 2016|author=Seigel, Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Balázs Béla.jpg|thumb|right|Béla Balázs c. 1910s]]

'''Béla Balázs''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈbeːlɒ ˈbɒlaːʒ|lang}}; 4 August 1884, [[Szeged]] – 17 May 1949, [[Budapest]]), born '''Herbert Bauer''', was a Hungarian-[[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] [[film criticism|film critic]], [[aesthetics|aesthete]], writer and poet. He was a proponent of [[formalist film theory]].

==Career==
Balázs was the son of German-born parents, adopting his ''nom de plume'' in newspaper articles written before his 1902 move to Budapest, where he studied Hungarian and German at the Eötvös Collegium.

Balázs was a moving force in the [[Sonntagskreis]] or Sunday Circle, the intellectual discussion group which he founded in the autumn of 1915 together with Lajos Fülep, [[Arnold Hauser]], [[György Lukács]] and [[Karl Mannheim|Károly (Karl) Mannheim]]. Meetings were held at his flat on Sunday afternoons; already in December 1915 Balázs wrote in his diary of the success of the group.&lt;ref name=gluck&gt;Mary Gluck (1985) [https://books.google.com/books?id=TUdmFkDoIGUC&amp;pg=PA15 ''Georg Lukács and His Generation, 1900–1918'']. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0674348664}}. pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

He is perhaps best remembered as the librettist of ''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'' which he originally wrote for his roommate [[Zoltán Kodály]], who in turn introduced him to the eventual composer of the opera, [[Béla Bartók]]. This collaboration continued with the scenario for the ballet ''[[The Wooden Prince]]''.

The collapse of the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] under [[Béla Kun]] in 1919 began a long period of exile in Vienna and Germany and, from 1933 until 1945, the Soviet Union.

In Vienna he became a prolific writer of film reviews. His first book on film, ''Der Sichtbare Mensch'' (''The Visible Man'') (1924), helped found the German "film as a language" theory, which also exerted an influence on [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. A popular consultant, he wrote the screenplay for [[G. W. Pabst]]'s film of ''[[The Threepenny Opera (1931 film)|Die Dreigroschenoper]]'' (1931), which became the object of a scandal and lawsuit by [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht]] (who admitted to not reading the script) during production.

Later, he co-wrote (with [[Carl Mayer]]) and helped [[Leni Riefenstahl]] direct the film ''[[Das Blaue Licht]]'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140222011309/http://www.walter-riml.at/walter-riml.at/-_1931_The_blue_light_-.html 1931 „the blue light“]. walter-riml.at&lt;/ref&gt; Riefenstahl later removed Balázs's and Mayer's names from the credits because they were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/LitWiss/MedienWiss/Forsch/Telaviv/Riefenstahl-englisch.html Hanno Loewy: "Balazs' and Leni Riefenstahl's The blue Light. A martyr's story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040430052226/http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/LitWiss/MedienWiss/Forsch/Telaviv/Riefenstahl-englisch.html |date=30 April 2004 }}. Uni-konstanz.de. Retrieved on 24 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his best known films is ''[[Somewhere in Europe (film)|Somewhere in Europe]]'' (''It Happened in Europe'', 1947), directed by [[Géza von Radványi]].

His last years were marked by petty vexations at home and ever increasing recognition in the German-speaking world. In 1949, he received the most distinguished prize in [[Hungary]], the [[Kossuth Prize]]. Also in 1949, he finished ''Theory of the Film'', published posthumously in English (London: Denis Dobson, 1952). In 1958, the Béla Balázs Prize was founded and named for him as an award to recognize achievements in  [[cinematography]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3404">The '''Cave of Euripides''' is a narrow cave, approximately 47 meters deep with ten small chambers, on a hillside overlooking the [[Saronic Gulf]] in the area of Peristeria on the south coast of [[Salamis Island]], [[Greece]]. Its name derives from its reputation since ancient times as the place where the playwright [[Euripides]] came to write his [[tragedy|tragedies]]. The ancient authors [[Philochorus]] and [[Satyrus the Peripatetic|Satyrus]] described Euripides as a misanthrope who avoided society by lurking in a cave. The second century Roman author [[Aulus Gellius]] claimed to have visited the "grim and gloomy cavern" during his visit to Athens (Attic Nights XV.20).

==Archaeology==
In the 1990s, excavations were carried out under the direction of Yannos G. Lolos, Assistant Professor of Prehistoric Archaeology at the [[University of Ioannina]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], in collaboration with the Department of [[Palaeoanthropology]] of the Greek Ministry of Culture.

Finds date from the late [[Neolithic]] onward. They include stone implements and arrowheads; [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] burials; 5th century BC Attic [[Pottery of ancient Greece|black glaze pottery]]; Roman period coins and [[votive]] figurines; and jewellery from the Frankish period, generally suggesting its long-term use as a place of refuge and worship. The most notable discovery was a fragmentary black-glaze [[skyphos]] dating from the late 5th century BC, with the letters ΕΥΡΙΠΠ, clearly part of the name Euripides, carefully inscribed in letters of the [[Hellenistic]] or [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. Lolos interpreted the cup as a votive offering to Euripides, confirmation of the devotion his poetry inspired in later periods.

Lolos also uncovered the foundations of a small rural sanctuary about 70 meters southwest of the cave, on the trail from the shore. Based on a marble phallus and other finds, he interpreted it as a sanctuary of [[Dionysus]], the patron god of Greek theatre.

==Access==
The cave, unsignposted, is located between the settlements of [[Salamis Island#Peristeria|Peristeria]] and Kolones, about 350 meters northwest of the north end of Euripides Street, up a clear footpath. There is a steel door.

{{About|the printmaking process|the photographic process|Collotype|decorative writing|Calligraphy}}
'''Collagraphy''' (sometimes spelled '''collography''') was introduced in 1955 by Glen Alps and is a [[printmaking]] process in which materials are applied to a rigid substrate (such as [[paperboard]] or [[wood]]). The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''koll'' or ''kolla'', meaning [[adhesive|glue]], and ''graph'', meaning the activity of [[drawing]].

The plate can be [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]-inked, inked with a roller or paintbrush or some combination thereof. Ink or pigment is applied to the resulting [[collage]] and the board is used to print onto [[paper]] or another material using either a [[printing press]] or various hand tools. The resulting print is termed a '''collagraph'''. Substances such as [[carborundum]], [[acrylic paint|acrylic texture medium]]s, sandpapers, textiles, bubble wrap, string or other fibres, cut card, leaves and grass can all be used in creating the collagraph plate. In some instances, leaves can be used as a source of pigment by rubbing them onto the surface of the plate.

Different tonal effects and vibrant colours can be achieved with the technique due to the depth of relief and differential inking that results from the collagraph plate's highly textured surface. Collagraphy is a very open printmaking method. Ink may be applied to the upper surfaces of the plate with a [[brayer]] for a [[relief print]], or ink may be applied to the entire board and then removed from the upper surfaces but remain in the spaces between objects, resulting in an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] print. A combination of both intaglio and relief methods may also be employed. A [[printing press]] may or may not be used.

Her hard-hitting journalism exposing racism in South Africa has angered conservative [[White South African|whites]]. [[Black people#Republic of South Africa|Black]] members of the public have also accused her of being [[Racism|racist]], e.g. after exposing corrupt black doctors who sold medical certificates and after interviewing "[[Bling-bling|bling]] queen" [[Khanyi Mbau]], and [[Jews|Jewish]] members of the public have accused her of being [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] after airing the controversial 2002 documentary ''[[Palestine Is Still the Issue]]''.&lt;ref name=Sekano/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Gerjo|title=Patta says it doesn't matta|url=http://www.news24.com/Entertainment/SouthAfrica/Patta-says-it-doesnt-matta-20030511|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=Die Burger|date=11 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tabane|first=Rapule|title=An embarrassment of riches|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2010-12-23-an-embarrassment-of-riches|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=23 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masithela|first=Tsietsi|title=Debora Patta is no racist|url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dailysun/2010/12/17/DJ/47/letter1.html|accessdate=15 March 2013|newspaper=Daily Sun|date=17 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also been criticized as not being qualified to talk about black culture by former [[African National Congress Youth League|ANC Youth League]] president [[Julius Malema]] during an interview with him and by black viewers offended by a ''3rd Degree'' show on black [[Artificial hair integrations|hair weaves]].&lt;ref name=Blood&gt;{{cite news|author=Issa Sikiti da Silva|title=3rd Degree: a decade of ‘blood-on-the-floor' journalism|url=http://www.bizcommunity.com/Article/196/66/47607.html|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=bizcommunity.com|date=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Esther|title=3rd degree makes waves over weaves|url=http://www.iol.co.za/lifestyle/style/beauty/3rd-degree-makes-waves-over-weaves-1.1330618#.UTb9PtZTCz4|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=Cape Argus|date=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging|AWB]] leader [[Eugène Terre'Blanche]] walked out of an interview with Patta after his release from prison in 2004. A complaint lodged against e.tv about the interview was dismissed by the [[Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa]].&lt;ref name=Bongiwe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case No - 28-2004 - e.tv - 3rd Degree - Eugene Terrblanche - Comment|url=http://www.bccsa.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=233:case-no-28-2004-comment&amp;catid=13&amp;Itemid=2|publisher=BCCSA|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Patta publicly apologized on television to Chrisna de Kock, a [[Freedom Front Plus]] youth leader at the [[University of the Free State]], after accusing her of being a racist in an interview on ''3rd Degree''. An e.tv spokesperson conceded that "the manner in which the allegation was put across was unfortunate" and the racism comment was subsequently retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debora Patta to apologise to FF Plus leader|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2010-07-06-debora-patta-to-apologise-ff-plus-leader|accessdate=4 March 2013|newspaper=Mail &amp; Guardian|date=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=du Toit|first=Pieter|title=Debora Patta says sorry|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Debora-Patta-says-sorry-20100708|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=Beeld|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patta has responded to criticism of her reporting with statements such as "that means I am doing my job well" and "we are doing this because we have a true democracy".&lt;ref name=Sekano/&gt;&lt;ref name=Blood/&gt;

==Personal life==
In April 1995 Patta, a white woman, announced over the radio her plans to marry Mweli Mzizi, a black filmmaker and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] prince.&lt;ref name=Principessa/&gt;&lt;ref name=RGJS/&gt; The interracial couple had encountered hostility for a year, so she was surprised by the positive response of listeners to her announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matloff|first=Judith|title=Life in the New South Africa: Racial Strife Slowly Easing|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1995/0427/27051.html|date=27 April 1995|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married in January 1996 and the wedding was attended by hundreds of guests including Nelson Mandela.&lt;ref name=Principessa/&gt; After the wedding the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]] notified Mzizi that the marriage was invalid because he did not fill out a form requiring black men to say that they were not already married. ''[[Newsweek]]'' reported that few South Africans were aware of this requirement and  "many of the country's marriages are probably illegal in the eyes of the bureaucracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=So You Think You're Married?|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/1996/04/07/so-you-think-you-re-married.html|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=[[Newsweek]]|date=7 April 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Patta and Mzizi unsuccessfully attempted to enter a whites-only picnic resort in the [[Free State (province)|Free State]] together, filming the incident on a hidden camera for a ''3rd Degree'' show on racism following which Patta received hate mail.&lt;ref name=Wiesner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Sally|title=Racist resort gets the 3rd Degree|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/racist-resort-gets-the-3rd-degree-1.52676#.UTN7gaJTCz4|accessdate=3 March 2013|newspaper=IOL|date=9 November 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002 it was reported that Patta and Mzizi were divorcing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mzizi and Patta's break-up tears family apart|url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/citypress/2002/04/28/4/14.html|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=[[City Press (South Africa)|City Press]]|date=28 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003 she married businessman Lance Levitas.&lt;ref name=RGJS&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter Number 49 |url=http://www.rgjs.co.za/ROGU/Newsletters/49.pdf|date=December 2008|publisher=RGJS|accessdate=3 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Debora Patta ties the knot|url=http://www.news24.com/Entertainment/SouthAfrica/Debora-Patta-ties-the-knot-20030717|accessdate=2 March 2013|newspaper=News24|date=17 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has two daughters, one from each marriage.&lt;ref name=Nog/&gt;&lt;ref name=McRae/&gt;&lt;ref name="Segar"/&gt; Her elder daughter Chiara Mzizi has worked as a presenter for YoTV, a youth entertainment show broadcast by [[SABC 1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Girls|url=http://www.starqualitymanagement.net/girls.php|publisher=SQ Artiste Management and Acting Academy|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levitas divorced Patta in 2015 and remarried in 2017. When approached for comment as to why he sued for divorce Levitas remarked, "now is not the time to comment"

'''Edward Wadie Said''' ({{IPAc-en|s|ɑː|ˈ|iː|d}}; {{lang-ar|إدوارد وديع سعيد}} {{IPA-ar|wædiːʕ sæʕiːd|}}, ''{{transl|ar|Idwārd Wadīʿ Saʿīd}}''; 1 November 1935 – 25 September 2003) was a professor of literature at [[Columbia University]], a [[public intellectual]], and a founder of the academic field of [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]].&lt;ref name="ryoung"&gt;Robert Young, ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'', New York &amp; London: Routledge, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Palestinian Americans|Palestinian American]] born in [[Mandatory Palestine]], he was a citizen of the United States by way of his father, a U.S. Army veteran.

Educated in the [[Western canon]], at British and American schools, Said applied his education and bi-cultural perspective to illuminating the gaps of cultural and political understanding between the Western world and the Eastern world, especially about the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] in the Middle East; his principal influences were [[Antonio Gramsci]],  [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Aimé Césaire]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Theodor Adorno]].&lt;ref name=buchanan&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Said, Edward|editor=Ian Buchanan|encyclopedia=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2010|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199532919.001.0001/acref-9780199532919-e-617|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[cultural critic]], Said is known for the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a critique of the [[Representation (arts)|cultural representations]] that are the bases of [[Orientalism]]—how the Western world perceives [[Eastern world|the Orient]].&lt;ref name="Ghazoul2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Ferial Jabouri Ghazoul|title=Edward Saïd and Critical Decolonization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uf9_dbmJyQkC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=19 November 2011|year=2007|publisher=American University in Cairo Press|isbn=978-977-416-087-5|pages=290–|quote=Edward W.

As a public intellectual, Said was a controversial member of the [[Palestinian National Council]], because he publicly criticized Israel and the Arab countries, especially the political and cultural policies of Muslim régimes who acted against the national interests of their peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bernstein, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/26/arts/edward-w-said-literary-critic-advocate-for-palestinian-independence-dies-67.html?pagewanted=2 "Edward Saïd, Literary Critic and Advocate for Palestinian Independence, Dies at 67"], ''The New York Times''. 26 September 2003.

Accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Said advocated the establishment of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]] to ensure equal political and [[human rights]] for the Palestinians in Israel, including the [[right of return]] to the homeland. He defined his oppositional relation with the ''status quo'' as the remit of the public intellectual who has "to sift, to judge, to criticize, to choose, so that choice and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] return to the individual" man and woman.

In 1999, with his friend [[Daniel Barenboim]], Said co-founded the [[West-Eastern Divan (orchestra)|West–Eastern Divan Orchestra]], based in Seville, which comprises young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. Besides being an academic, Said was also an accomplished [[pianist]], and, with Barenboim, co-authored the book ''Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society'' (2002), a compilation of their conversations about music.&lt;ref name="democracy"&gt;Democracy Now!, [http://www.democracynow.org/features/edward_said "Edward Saïd Archive"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108201059/http://www.democracynow.org/features/edward_said |date=8 November 2009 }}, DemocracyNow.org, 2003.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
[[File:SaidSis.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=A photo of Edward Said and his sister as children, dressed in Arab-style clothing.|Edward Said and his sister, [[Rosemarie Said Zahlan|Rosemarie Said]] (1940)]]
Edward Wadie Said was born on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and Wadie Said, a businessman in Jerusalem, then part of British-governed [[Mandatory Palestine]] (1920–48).&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Hughes |title=Envoy to Two Cultures |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,978727,00.html |publisher=''Time'' |date=1993-06-21 |accessdate=2008-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wadie Said was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in the First World War (1914–18). Afterwards, that war-time military service earned American citizenship to Said ''père'' and his family. Edward's mother, Hilda Said was born Lebanese and raised in [[Nazareth]], [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Ihab Shalback, [https://books.google.it/books?id=b9dPZ1RcSkAC&amp;pg=PA76 'Edward Said and the Palestinian Experience,'] in Joseph Pugliese (ed.) ''Transmediterranean: Diasporas, Histories, Geopolitical Spaces,'' Peter Lang, 2010, pp. 71–83&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, in partnership with a cousin, Wadie Said established a stationery business in Cairo. Like her husband, Hilda Said was an [[Arab Christian]], and, although the Said family practiced the Jerusalemite variety of [[Greek Orthodox|Greek Orthodox Christianity]], Edward was agnostic.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Moreover, his sister [[Rosemarie Said Zahlan|Rosemarie Saïd Zahlan]] (1937–2006) also pursued an academic career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Edward Saïd: A Legacy of Emancipation and Representation|year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24546-4|author=Adel Iskander, Hakem Rustom|quote= [Edward Wadie] Saïd was of Christian background, a confirmed agnostic, perhaps even an atheist, yet he had a rage for justice and a moral sensibility lacking in most [religious] believers.

Accessed 7 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Said lived his boyhood between the worlds of Cairo and Jerusalem; in 1947, he attended [[St. George's School, Jerusalem]], a British school of stern Anglican Christian cast. About being there, Said said:

{{quote|With an unexceptionally Arab family name like "Saïd", connected to an improbably British first name (my mother much admired Edward VIII  the Prince of Wales in 1935, the year of my birth) I was an uncomfortably anomalous student all through my early years: a Palestinian going to school in Egypt, with an English first name, an American passport, and no certain identity, at all. To make matters worse, Arabic, my native language, and English, my school language, were inextricably mixed: I have never known which was my first language, and have felt fully at home in neither, although I dream in both. Every time I speak an English sentence, I find myself echoing it in Arabic, and vice versa.|''Between Worlds'', ''Reflections on Exile and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 556–57&lt;ref name="Between Worlds"&gt;Edward Said, ''[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n09/said01_.html Between Worlds]'', ''London Review of Books'', 7 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the late 1940s, Edward's schooling included the Egyptian branch of [[Victoria College, Alexandria]] (VC), where classmates included [[King Hussein|(King) Hussein of Jordan]], and the Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers would progress to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen in their respective countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward W.|year=1999|title=Out of Place|publisher=Vintage Books, NY|page= 201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that [[Colonialism|colonial]] time and place, the function of a British colonial school, such as VC, was to educate selections of young men from the Arab and Levantine ruling classes, to become the Anglicized post-colonial administrators who would rule their countries, upon British decolonization. About Victoria College, Edward said:

{{quote|The moment one became a student at Victoria College, one was given the student handbook, a series of regulations governing every aspect of school life—the kind of uniform we were to wear, what equipment was needed for sports, the dates of school holidays, bus schedules, and so on. But the school's first rule, emblazoned on the opening page of the handbook, read: "English is the language of the school; students caught speaking any other language will be punished." Yet, there were no native speakers of English among the students. Whereas the masters were all British, we were a motley crew of Arabs of various kinds, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Jews, and Turks, each of whom had a native language that the school had explicitly outlawed. Yet all, or nearly all, of us spoke Arabic—many spoke Arabic and French—and so we were able to take refuge in a common language, in defiance of what we perceived as an unjust colonial structure.|''Between Worlds'', ''Reflections on Exile and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 556–57.&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds", ''Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 556–57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1951, Victoria College expelled Edward, who had proved a troublesome boy, despite being a student of great intelligence and much academic achievement; he then attended [[Northfield Mount Hermon School]], Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he lived a difficult year of social alienation. Nonetheless, the student Edward excelled, and achieved the rank of either first (valedictorian) or second (salutatorian) in a class of one hundred sixty students.&lt;ref name="Between Worlds"/&gt;

In retrospect, being sent far from the Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental decision much influenced by "the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, being so uncertain that it would be best to send me as far away as possible."&lt;ref name="Between Worlds"/&gt; The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said.&lt;ref name = "Between Worlds"/&gt; At school's end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in [[English Literature]] from Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward.

===Career===
In 1963, Said joined [[Columbia University]], as a member of the English and [[Comparative Literature]] faculties, where he taught and worked until 2003. In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard; during the 1975–76 period, he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at [[Stanford University]]. In 1977, he became the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and subsequently was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and in 1979 was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University.&lt;ref name="lajewsforpeace.org"&gt;LA Jews For Peace, [http://www.lajewsforpeace.org/Bibliography.html ''The Question of Palestine'' by Edward Saïd.

===''Orientalism''===
{{Main|Orientalism (book)}}
Said became an established cultural critic with the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978) a critique (description and analyses) of [[Orientalism]] as the source of the false cultural representations with which the Western world perceives the Middle East—the narratives of how The West sees The East. The thesis of ''Orientalism'' proposes the existence of a "subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo–Islamic peoples and their culture", which originates from [[Western culture]]'s long tradition of false, romanticized images of Asia, in general, and the Middle East, in particular. That such cultural representations have served, and continue to serve, as implicit justifications for the colonial and imperial ambitions of the European powers and of the U.S. Likewise, Said denounced the political and the cultural malpractices of the régimes of the ruling Arab élites who have [[internalization|internalized]] the false and romanticized representations of [[Arabic culture]] that were created by Anglo–American Orientalists.&lt;ref name="newcriterion.com"&gt;Windschuttle, Keith.

{{quote|So far as the United States seems to be concerned, it is only a slight overstatement to say that Moslems and Arabs are essentially seen as either oil suppliers or potential terrorists. Very little of the detail, the human density, the passion of Arab–Moslem life has entered the awareness of even those people whose profession it is to report the Arab world. What we have, instead, is a series of crude, essentialized caricatures of the Islamic world, presented in such a way as to make that world vulnerable to military aggression.|"Islam through Western Eyes" (1980) ''The Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/islam-through-western-eyes|title=Islam Through Western Eyes|last=Said|first=Edward|date=26 April 1980|work=The Nation|accessdate=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Orientalism'' proposed that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism, meant for the self-affirmation of European identity, rather than objective academic study; thus, the academic field of Oriental studies functioned as a practical method of cultural discrimination and imperialist domination—that is to say, the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals.&lt;ref name="newcriterion.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward. ''Orientalism'', Vintage Books: New York: 1979 p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

That the cultural representations of the Eastern world that Orientalism purveys are intellectually suspect, and cannot be accepted as faithful, true, and accurate representations of the peoples and things of the Orient; that the history of European colonial rule and political domination of Asian civilizations, distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Orientalist.

{{quote|I doubt if it is controversial, for example, to say that an Englishman in India, or Egypt, in the later nineteenth century, took an interest in those countries, which was never far from their status, in his mind, as British colonies. To say this may seem quite different from saying that all academic knowledge about India and Egypt is somehow tinged and impressed with, violated by, the gross political fact—and yet ''that is what I am saying'' in this study of Orientalism.|Introduction, ''Orientalism'', p. 11.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward.

That since [[Ancient Greece|Antiquity]], Western Art has misrepresented the Orient with stereotypes; in the tragedy ''[[The Persians]]'' (472 BCE), by [[Aeschylus]], the Greek protagonist falls, because he misperceived the true nature of The Orient.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'', pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt; That the European political domination of Asia has biased even the most outwardly objective Western texts about The Orient, to a degree unrecognized by the Western scholars who appropriated for themselves the production of cultural knowledge—the academic work of studying, exploring, and interpreting the languages, histories, and peoples of Asia; therefore, Orientalist scholarship implies that the [[Subaltern (post-colonialism)|colonial subaltern]] (the colonised people) were incapable of thinking, acting, or speaking for themselves, thus are incapable of writing their own national histories. In such imperial circumstances, the Orientalist scholars of the West wrote the history of the Orient—and so constructed the modern, cultural identities of Asia—from the perspective that the West is the cultural standard to emulate, the norm from which the "exotic and inscrutable" Orientals deviate.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'', pp. 38–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesis of ''Orientalism'' concluded that the West's knowledge of the Orient depicts the cultures of the Eastern world as an irrational, weak, and feminized non–European [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], which is the opposite of the West's representations of Western cultures as a rational, strong, and masculine polity. That such an artificial binary-relation originates from the European psychological need to create a "[[Difference (philosophy)|difference]]" of inequality, between the West and the East, which inequality originates from the immutable cultural [[Essentialism|essences]] innate to the peoples of the Oriental world.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. ''Orientalism'', pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of ''Orientalism''===
{{Main|Orientalism (book)}}

''Orientalism'' provoked much professional and personal criticism for Said among academics.&lt;ref&gt;Kramer, Martin. [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3082 "Enough Said (Book review: ''Dangerous Knowledge'', by Robert Irwin)"], March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional Orientalists, such as [[Albert Hourani]], [[Robert Graham Irwin]], [[Nikki Keddie]], [[Bernard Lewis]], and [[Kanan Makiya]], suffered negative consequences, because ''Orientalism'' affected public perception of their intellectual integrity and the quality of their [[Oriental studies|Orientalist scholarship]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard. "The Question of Orientalism", ''Islam and the West'', London: 1993. pp. 99, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Robert. ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'' London:Allen Lane: 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Martin Kramer said that "Fifteen years after [the] publication of ''Orientalism'', the UCLA historian Nikki Keddie (whose work Saïd praised in ''Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World'') allowed that ''Orientalism'' was 'important, and, in many ways, positive' ".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/martinkramerorg/SaidSplash.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:20:28 "Said's Splash"] ''Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America'', Policy Papers 58 (Washington, D.C.: Washington Institute for Near East Policy, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;}} The historian Keddie said that Said's [[critical theory|critical]] work about the field of Orientalism had caused, in their academic disciplines:

{{quote|Some unfortunate consequences ... I think that there has been a tendency in the Middle East [studies] field to adopt the word ''Orientalism'' as a generalized swear-word, essentially referring to people who take the "wrong" position on the Arab–Israeli dispute, or to people who are judged "too conservative." It has nothing to do with whether they are good or not good in their disciplines. So, ''Orientalism'', for many people, is a word that substitutes for thought, and enables people to dismiss certain scholars and their works. I think that is too bad. It may not have been what Edward Saïd meant, at all, but the term has become a kind of slogan.|''Approaches to the History of the Middle East'' (1994), pp. 144–45.&lt;ref&gt;''Approaches to the History of the Middle East'', Nancy Elizabeth Gallagher, Ed., London:Ithaca Press, 1994: pp. 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}}

In ''Orientalism'', Said described [[Bernard Lewis]], the Anglo–American Orientalist, as "a perfect exemplification [of an] Establishment Orientalist [whose work] purports to be objective, liberal scholarship, but is, in reality, very close to being propaganda ''against'' his subject material."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward ''Orientalism'', p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis responded with a harsh critique of ''Orientalism'' accusing Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving "free rein" to his biases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Question of Orientalism|url=https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/307584/original/The+Question+of+Orientalism+by+Bernard+Lewis+%7C+The+New+York+Review+of+Books.pdf|publisher=New York Review of Books|accessdate=17 December 2017|date=June 24, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Said retorted that in ''The Muslim Discovery of Europe'' (1982), Lewis responded to his thesis with the claim that the Western quest for knowledge about other societies was unique in its display of disinterested curiosity, which Muslims did not reciprocate towards Europe. Lewis was saying that "knowledge about Europe [was] the only acceptable criterion for true knowledge." The appearance of academic impartiality was part of Lewis's role as an academic authority for zealous "anti–Islamic, anti–Arab, Zionist, and Cold War crusades."&lt;ref&gt;Saïd, Edward ''Orientalism'' (1978), p. 315; "Orientalism Reconsidered" (1985), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edward Saïd 1985, p. 96"&gt;Edward Saïd, "Orientalism Reconsidered", ''Cultural Critique'' magazine, No. 1, Autumn 1985, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the Afterword to the 1995 edition of the book, Said replied to Lewis's criticisms of the first edition of ''Orientalism'' (1978).&lt;ref name="Edward Saïd 1985, p. 96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward ''Orientalism'': pp. 329–54&lt;/ref&gt;

([[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], 1883)]]

In the academy, ''Orientalism'' became a foundational text of the field of [[Postcolonialism|Post-colonial studies]], for what the British intellectual [[Terry Eagleton]] said is the book's "central truth ... that demeaning images of the East, and imperialist incursions into its terrain, have historically gone hand in hand."&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, Terry. [http://www.newstatesman.com/200602130032 ''Eastern Block'' (book review of ''For Lust of Knowing: The Orientalists and Their Enemies'', 2006, by Robert Irwin)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118042021/http://www.newstatesman.com/200602130032 |date=18 November 2009}}, ''New Statesman'', 13 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Said's friends and foes acknowledged the transformative influence of ''Orientalism'' upon scholarship in the humanities; critics said that the thesis is an intellectually limiting influence upon scholars, whilst supporters said that the thesis is intellectually liberating.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kramer. ''Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew N.

In [[Eastern Europe]], Milica Bakić–Hayden developed the concept of [[Nesting Orientalisms]] (1992), derived from the ideas of the historian Larry Wolff (''Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment'', 1994) and Said's ideas in ''Orientalism'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John E Ashbrook |title=Buying and Selling the Istrian Goat: Istrian Regionalism, Croatian Nationalism, and EU Enlargement |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uk9VVZ1esGwC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |year=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=New York |isbn=978-90-5201-391-6 |oclc=213599021 |page=22 |quote=Milica Baki–Hayden built on Wolff's work, incorporating the ideas of Edward Saïd's "Orientalism"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian historian [[Maria Todorova]] (''[[Imagining the Balkans]]'', 1997) presented the [[Ethnology|ethnologic]] concept of Nesting Balkanisms (''Ethnologia Balkanica'', 1997), which is derived from Milica Bakić–Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ethnologia Balkanica |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0ogSzrXJEfMC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;dq=%22Nesting+Orientalisms%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nesting%20Orientalisms%22&amp;f=false |year=1995 |publisher=Prof. M.

In ''The Impact of "Biblical Orientalism" in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Palestine'' (2014), the historian Lorenzo Kamel, presented the concept of "Biblical Orientalism" with an historical analysis of the simplifications of the complex, local Palestinian reality, which occurred from the 1830s until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kamel |first=Lorenzo |date=2014 |title=The Impact of "Biblical Orientalism" in Late Nineteenth- and Early Twentieth-Century Palestine |url=http://www.brismes.ac.uk/nmes/archives/1263 |journal=New Middle Eastern Studies |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamel said that the selective usage and simplification of religion, in approaching the place known as "The Holy Land", created a view that, as a place, the Holy Land has no human history other than as the place where Bible stories occurred, rather than as Palestine, a country inhabited by many peoples.

The post-colonial discourse presented in ''Orientalism'', also influenced post-colonial theology and post-colonial biblical criticism, by which method the analytical reader approaches a scripture from the perspective of a colonial reader.

==Politics==
[[File:Palestinian Cultural Mural Honoring Dr. Edward Said.jpg|thumb|350px|Palestinian cultural mural honoring Said]]
In 1967, consequent to the [[Six-Day War]] (5–10 June 1967) the [[university professor|academic]] Edward Said became a [[Intellectual|public intellectual]] when he acted politically to counter the stereotyped misrepresentations (factual, historical, cultural) with which the U.S. news media explained the [[Arab–Israeli war]]s; reportage divorced from the historical realities of the [[Middle East]], in general, and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Israel]], in particular. To address, explain, and correct such Orientalism, Said published "The Arab Portrayed" (1968), a descriptive essay about images of "the Arab" that are meant to evade specific discussion of the historical and cultural realities of the peoples (Jews, Christians, Muslims) who are the Middle East, featured in journalism (print, photograph, television) and some types of scholarship (specialist journals).&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds", ''Reflections on Exile, and Other Essays'' (2002) pp. 563.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay "Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims" (1979), Said argued in favour of the political [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and philosophic [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] claims and right to a Jewish homeland; and for the inherent right of national self-determination of the Palestinian people.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Saïd, "Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims" (1979), in ''The Edward Saïd Reader'', Vintage Books, 2000, pp. 114–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Said's books about Israel and Palestine include ''The Question of Palestine'' (1979), ''The Politics of Dispossession'' (1994), and ''The End of the Peace Process'' (2000).

===Palestinian National Council===
From 1977 until 1991, Said was an independent member of the [[Palestinian National Council]] (PNC).&lt;ref&gt;Malise Ruthven, [https://www.theguardian.com/israel/Story/0,2763,1049931,00.html "Edward Said: Controversial Literary Critic and Bold Advocate of the Palestinian Cause in America,"] ''The Guardian'' 26 September 2003; accessed 1 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he was a proponent of the [[two-state solution]] to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] (1948), and voted for the establishment of the [[State of Palestine]] at a meeting of the PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the [[Oslo Accords]] (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the [[Madrid Conference of 1991]].

Said disliked the Oslo Accords for not producing an independent State of Palestine, and because they were politically inferior to a plan that [[Yasser Arafat|Yasir Arafat]] had rejected—a plan Said had presented to Arafat on behalf of the U.S. government in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Saïd, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v15/n20/edward-said/the-morning-after "The Morning After"]. ''London Review of Books'' Vol. 15 No. 20. 21 October 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the [[right of return]] of the Palestinian refugees to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of [[Green Line (Israel)|pre-1967 Israel]], and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the [[Israeli settlements]] in the occupied territories that had been established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967.

In 1995, in response to Said's political criticisms, the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) banned the sale of Said's books; however, the PA lifted the book-ban when Said publicly praised Yasir Arafat for rejecting Prime Minister [[Ehud Barak]]'s offers at the [[Camp David 2000 Summit|Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David]] (2000) in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wood, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v25/n20/michael-wood/on-edward-said "On Edward Said"], ''London Review of Books'', 23 October 2003, accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Said, [http://www.mediamonitors.net/edward33.html "The price of Camp David"], ''Al Ahram Weekly'', 23 July 2001. Accessed 5 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Said wrote the Foreword to the history book ''[[Israel Shahak#Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years|Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of Three Thousand Years]]'' (1994), by [[Israel Shahak]], about Jewish fundamentalism, which presents the cultural proposition that Israel's mistreatment of the Palestinians is rooted in a [[Judaism|Judaic]] requirement (of permission) for Jews to commit crimes, including murder, against Gentiles (non-Jews). In his Foreword, Said said that ''Jewish History, Jewish Religion'' is "nothing less than a concise history of classic and modern [[Judaism]], insofar as these are relevant to the understanding of modern Israel"; and praised the historian Shahak for describing contemporary Israel as a nation subsumed in a "Judeo–Nazi" cultural ambiance that allowed the [[dehumanization]] of the Palestinian [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Cohn]]: [http://www.wernercohn.com/Said.html What Edward Said knows] Page accessed 2012-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Said made ''In Search of Palestine'' (1998), a BBC documentary film about Palestine past and present.

On 3 July 2000, whilst touring the Middle East with his son, Wadie, Edward Said was photographed throwing a stone across the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line Lebanese–Israel border]], which image elicited much political criticism about his action demonstrating an inherent, personal sympathy with terrorism; and, in ''Commentary'' magazine, the journalist Edward Alexander labelled Said as "The Professor of Terror", for aggression against Israel.&lt;ref name="Julian Vigo 2004 pp. 43"&gt;Julian Vigo, "Edward Saïd and the Politics of Peace: From Orientalisms to Terrorology", ''A Journal of Contemporary Thought'' (2004): pp. 43–65.&lt;/ref&gt; Said explained the stone-throwing as a two-fold action, personal and political; a man-to-man contest-of-skill, between a father and his son, and an Arab Man's gesture of joy at the end of the [[Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon]] (1985–2000):

[[File:BlueLine.jpg|thumb|right|375px|alt=A map showing a light blue and a dark blue line between Lebanon and Israel.|For throwing a stone at an Israeli guardhouse across the Blue Line Lebanese–Israeli border, ''Commentary'' magazine labelled Edward Said "The Professor of Terror" in 2000.&lt;ref name="Julian Vigo 2004 pp. 43"/&gt;]]
{{quote|It was a pebble; there was nobody there. The guardhouse was at least half a mile away.|"A Stone's Throw is a Freudian Slip" (NYT, 10 March 2001)&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Dinitia Smith, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/10/arts/a-stone-s-throw-is-a-freudian-slip.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22edward+said%22&amp;st=nyt "A Stone's Throw is a Freudian Slip"], ''The New York Times'', 10 March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Despite having denied that he aimed the stone at an Israeli [[watchtower|guardhouse]], the Beirut newspaper ''[[As-Safir]]'' (The Ambassador) reported that a Lebanese local resident reported that Prof. Said was at less than ten metres (ca. 30&amp;nbsp;ft.) distance from the [[Israeli Defense Force]] (IDF) soldiers manning the two-storey guardhouse, when Said aimed and threw the stone over the border fence; the stone's projectile path was thwarted when it struck the barbed wire atop the border fence.&lt;ref&gt;Sunnie Kim, [http://www.columbiaspectator.com/2000/07/19/edward-said-accused-stoning-south-lebanon ''Edward Said Accused of Stoning in South Lebanon''], Columbia Spectator, 19 July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the U.S., despite a political fracas by right-wing students at Columbia University and the [[Anti-Defamation League]] of [[B'nai B'rith|B'nai B'rith International]] (Sons of the Covenant), the university provost published a five-page letter defending Prof. Said's action as an academic's [[freedom of expression]]:

{{quote|To my knowledge, the stone was directed at no-one; no law was broken; no indictment was made; no criminal or civil action has been taken against Professor Saïd.|Columbia Debates a Professor's 'Gesture' (NYT, 19 October 2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/19/nyregion/19COLU.html?ex=1176523200&amp;en=ea585e33b37df5f2&amp;ei=5070|title=Columbia Debates a Professor's 'Gesture'|newspaper=The New York Times|author=Karen W. Arenson|date=19 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, Said endured political repercussions, such as the cancellation of an invitation to give a lecture to the Freud Society, in Austria, in February 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Saïd and David Barsamian, ''Culture and Resistance – Conversations with Edward Said'', South End Press, 2003: pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; The President of the Freud Society justified withdrawing the invitation by explaining to Said that "the political situation in the Middle East, and its consequences" had rendered an accusation of [[anti-Semitism]] a very serious matter, and that any such accusation "has become more dangerous" in the politics of Austria; thus, the Freud Society cancelled their invitation to Said in order to "avoid an internal clash" of opinions, about him, that might ideologically divide the Freud Society.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; In ''Culture and Resistance: Conversations with Edward Saïd'' (2003), Said likened his political situation to the situation that [[Noam Chomsky]] has perdured as a public intellectual:

{{quote|It's very similar to his. He's a well-known, great linguist. He's been celebrated and honored for that, but he's also vilified as an anti–Semite and as a Hitler worshiper. . . .
For anyone to deny the horrendous experience of anti–Semitism and the Holocaust is unacceptable. We don't want anybody's history of suffering to go unrecorded and unacknowledged. On the other hand, there's a great difference, between acknowledging Jewish oppression and using that as a cover for the oppression of another people.| ''Culture and Resistance: Conversations with Edward Saïd'', pp. 85, 178 (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Edward Saïd and David Barsamian, ''Culture and Resistance: Conversations with Edward Saïd'', South End Press, 2003: pp. 85, 178&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism of U.S. foreign policy===
In the revised edition of ''[[Covering Islam|Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World]]'' (1997), Said criticized the Orientalist bias of the Western news media's reportage about the Middle East and Islam, especially the tendency to editorialize "speculations about the latest conspiracy to blow up buildings, sabotage commercial airliners, and poison water supplies."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kramer, [http://www.campus-watch.org/article/id/3082 Enough Said review of ''Dangerous Knowledge'', by Robert Irwin], March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the American military involvement in the [[Kosovo War]] (1998–99) as an imperial action; and described the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] (1998), promulgated during the Clinton Administration, as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003, which was authorised with the [[Iraq Resolution]] (2 October 2002); and the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="democracy" /&gt;

In the event, despite being sick with leukemia, as a public intellectual, Said continued criticising the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. Invasion of Iraq]] in mid-2003;&lt;ref&gt;Democracy Now!, [http://www.democracynow.org/2003/4/15/syrian_expert_patrick_seale_and_columbia "Syrian Expert [[Patrick Seale]] and Columbia University Professor Edward Said Discuss the State of the Middle East After the Invasion of Iraq"], DemocracyNow.org, 15 April 2003. Accessed 4 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the Egyptian ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly]]'' newspaper, in the article "Resources of Hope" (2 April 2003), Said said that the U.S. war against Iraq was a politically ill-conceived military enterprise:

{{quote|My strong opinion, though I don't have any proof, in the classical sense of the word, is that they want to change the entire Middle East, and the Arab world, perhaps terminate some countries, destroy the so-called terrorist groups they dislike, and install régimes friendly to the United States. I think this is a dream that has very little basis in reality. The knowledge they have of the Middle East, to judge from the people who advise them, is, to say the least, out of date and widely speculative. . . .

I don't think the planning for the post–Saddam, post-war period in Iraq is very sophisticated, and there's very little of it. U.S. Undersecretary of State Marc Grossman and U.S. Undersecretary of Defense Douglas Feith testified in Congress, about a month ago, and seemed to have no figures, and no ideas [about] what structures they were going to deploy; they had no idea about the use of [the Iraqi] institutions that exist, although they want to de–Ba'thise the higher echelons, and keep the rest.

The same is true about their views of the [Iraqi] army. They certainly have no use for the Iraqi opposition that they've been spending many millions of dollars on; and, to the best of my ability to judge, they are going to improvise; of course, the model is Afghanistan. I think they hope that the U.N. will come in and do something, but, given the recent French and Russian positions, I doubt that that will happen with such simplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward.[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/631/focus.htm "Resources of Hope"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221000000/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/631/focus.htm |date=21 February 2015 }}, Al-Ahram Weekly, 2 April 2003, accessed April 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Under surveillance===
In 2003, [[Haidar Abdel-Shafi]], Ibrahim Dakak, [[Mustafa Barghouti]], and Said established ''Al-Mubadara'' (The [[Palestinian National Initiative]]), headed by Dr. Mustafa Barghouti,  a third-party reformist, democratic party meant to be an alternative to the usual [[two-party system|two-party politics]] of Palestine. As a political party, the ideology of ''Al-Mubadara'' is specifically an alternative to the extremist politics of the social-democratic [[Fatah]] and the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Hamas]] (Islamic Resistance Movement). Said's founding of the group, as well as his other international political activities concerning Palestine, were noticed by the U.S. government; in 2006, the anthropologist David Price obtained 147 pages of the 283-page political dossier that the FBI had compiled on Said, begun in 1971, four years into his career as a public intellectual active in U.S. politics.&lt;ref&gt;David Price, [http://www.counterpunch.org/price01132006.html "How the FBI Spied on Edward Said,"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116100931/http://www.counterpunch.org/price01132006.html |date=16 January 2006 }} ''CounterPunch'' 13 January 2006, accessed 15 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides having been a public intellectual, Edward Said was an accomplished pianist, worked as the music critic for ''The Nation'' magazine, and wrote four books about music: ''Musical Elaborations'' (1991); ''Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society'' (2002), with Daniel Barenboim as co-author; ''On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain'' (2006); and ''Music at the Limits'' (2007) in which final tome he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.&lt;ref&gt;Ranjan Ghosh, [http://www.ewidgetsonline.com/dxreader/Reader.aspx?token=lHNy0CN9jdX%2fkV3%2f8IVtAA%3d%3d&amp;rand=1414102986&amp;buyNowLink= ''Edward Said and the Literary, Social, and Political World'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710211037/http://www.ewidgetsonline.com/dxreader/Reader.aspx?token=lHNy0CN9jdX%2FkV3%2F8IVtAA%3D%3D&amp;rand=1414102986&amp;buyNowLink= |date=10 July 2011 }}, New York: Routledge, 2009: p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia University Press, [http://cup.columbia.edu/book/978-0-231-13936-6/music-at-the-limits ''Music at the Limits'' by Edward W.

Elsewhere in the musical world, the composer [[Mohammed Fairouz]] acknowledged the deep influence of Edward Said upon his works; compositionally, Fairouz's ''First Symphony'' thematically alludes to the essay "Homage to a Belly-Dancer" (1990), about Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian terpsichorean, actress, and political militant; and a piano sonata titled ''Reflections on Exile'' (1984), which thematically refers to the emotions inherent to being an exile.&lt;ref name=qonstage&gt;Rase, Sherri (8 April 2011), [http://www.qonstage.com/QOnStage_articles/2011fairouz-rase/index.html Conversations—with Mohammed Fairouz] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322231341/http://www.qonstage.com/QOnStage_articles/2011fairouz-rase/index.html |date=22 March 2012 }}, ''[Q]onStage'', retrieved 2011-04-19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Homage to a Belly-dancer", ''Granta'', 13 (Winter 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Reflections on Exile", ''London Review of Books'', 13 September 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Edward W. Said and Daniel Barenboim co-founded the [[West-Eastern Divan (orchestra)|West-Eastern Divan Orchestra]], which is composed of young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. They also established The Barenboim–Said Foundation in [[Seville]], to develop education-through-music projects. Besides managing the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Barenboim–Said Foundation assists with the administration of the Academy of Orchestral Studies, the Musical Education in Palestine Project, and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project, in Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Barenboim–Saïd Foundation, [http://www.barenboim-said.org/index.php?id=119 official website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027113059/http://www.barenboim-said.org/index.php?id=119 |date=27 October 2009 }}, Barenboim-Said.org.

==Honors and awards==
Besides honors, memberships, and postings to prestigious organizations worldwide, Edward Said was awarded some twenty honorary university degrees in the course of his professional life as an academic, critic, and Man of Letters.&lt;ref&gt;The English Pen World Atlas, [http://penatlas.org/online/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=100&amp;Itemid=16 "Edward Said"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727172211/http://penatlas.org/online/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=100&amp;Itemid=16 |date=27 July 2011 }}, accessed on 3 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the honors bestowed to him was the [[Bowdoin Prize]] by [[Harvard University]]. He twice received the [[Lionel Trilling Book Award]]; the first occasion was the inaugural bestowing of said literary award in 1976, for ''Beginnings: Intention and Method'' (1974). He also received the Wellek Prize of the [[American Comparative Literature Association]], and was awarded the inaugural [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] Lens Prize.&lt;ref&gt;Spinozalens, [http://www.spinozalens.nl/pages/laureaten_en.htm ''Internationale Spinozaprijs Laureates''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805011845/http://www.spinozalens.nl/pages/laureaten_en.htm |date=5 August 2008 }}, accessed on 3 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Said was awarded the [[Lannan Literary Award]] for Lifetime Achievement, and in 2002, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord.

'''Elena Genrikhovna Guro''' ({{lang-rus|Еле́на Ге́нриховна Гуро́|p=jɪˈlʲɛnə ˈɡʲɛnrʲɪxəvnə ɡʊˈro|a=Yelyena Gyenrihovna Guro.ru.vorb.oga}}; in marriage '''Matyushina''' ({{lang-rus|Матю́шина|p=mɐˈtʲuʂɪnə|a=Yelyena Gyenrihovna Matyushina.ru.vorb.oga}}; January 10, 1877 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1913&lt;ref name="Artists"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Women Artists, Volume 1 |year=1997 |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |isbn=1-884964-21-4 |pages=623–624 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_0Y0PALzQMC&amp;pg=PA623 |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Russian [[Futurism|Futurist]] painter, playwright, poet, and fiction writer.

==Early life==
Guro was born in St. Petersburg on January 10, 1877. Her father was Genrikh Stepanovich Guro, an officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] of French descent. Her mother Anna Mikhailovna Chistyakova was a talented amateur artist. Guro spent her childhood in the village of Novosely near [[Pskov]] and at her father's estate in [[Luga, Leningrad Oblast|Luga]]. She inherited a government pension and property in Finland from her father, using both to support her artistic career. Her sister Ekaterina was also a writer.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Russian Women Writers |year=1994 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=0-313-26265-9 |pages=238–241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lI4hPO8u3ecC&amp;pg=PA241 |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Matushin Guro.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Guro and Matyushin.]]
From 1890 to 1893 she studied art at the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in St Petersburg. From 1903 to 1905 she studied in the private studio of [[Jan Ciągliński]] where she met her future husband [[Mikhail Matyushin]] (they were married in 1906).&lt;ref name="Artists"/&gt;  In 1905 she illustrated the Russian translation of a book of fairy tales by [[George Sand]]. In 1906 she and Matyushin moved to the school of Elizaveta Zvantseva, where Guro worked under [[Mstislav Dobuzhinsky]], [[Léon Bakst]] and [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]].&lt;ref name="Artists"/&gt;  In 1908 she left the school and established her own studio. By 1908 her home was an important meeting place for discussions on art and literature.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;
[[File:Guro olen.jpg|thumb|right|170px|''Little Deer'' by Guro, 1908/09]]
Guro published her first prose work in 1905. Her first book of prose, poetry, and drama ''The Hurdy-Gurdy'' came out in 1909.&lt;ref name="Artists"/&gt; In 1910 she contributed to the journal ''Trap for Judges'' the first publication of the [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]]. She also contributed to the second volume of ''Trap for Judges'' in 1913. Guro and her husband subsidized both issues. In 1911 Guro's manuscript of a book of fairy tales she had been planning to publish was lost by her publisher along with the  illustrations she had done for it. Her second book ''Autumnal Dream'' was published in 1912.&lt;ref name="Artists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

==Last days==
In 1913 she continued to write and paint, even though she was suffering from [[leukemia]]. She died the same year at her country house in what was formerly Uusikirkko, Finland. At the time of her death she had nearly completed a major work ''The Poor Knight''. Several poems and two works of prose were published posthumously, in the collection ''The Three'' and in the journal ''[[Soyuz Molodyozhi|Union of Youth]]'', in 1913. Her third book ''The Little Camels of the Sky'' was published in 1914.&lt;ref name="Artists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt;

[[Image:Embroidery and fabric collage by Esther Nisenthal Krinitz, 1991 .jpg|thumb|right|400px|’On Friday, October 15, 1942, it was the beginning of the end, the somber march of the [[Rachów, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Rachow]] Jews to their deaths’, Embroidery and fabric collage by Esther Nisenthal Krinitz, 1991]]

'''Esther Nisenthal Krinitz''' (1927&amp;ndash;2001) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[artist]].

==The Final Solution==
In September 1939, as a 12-year-old, Esther watched [[Nazi Germany|German]] soldiers arrive in her village of Mniszek, strategically located along the east bank of the [[Vistula River]]. For the next 3 years, German troops used Jewish slave laborers from Mniszek and the nearby city of [[Rachów, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Rachów]] to build roads and bridges for their Eastern campaign. Once the Nazis moved to implement the "[[Final Solution]]", however, the Jews of  Rachów and Mniszek—those who had not already been murdered—were instructed to leave their homes and report to the train station in [[Kraśnik]], about 20 miles away. No one knew where they were going. Many thought they were going to be taken to a [[ghetto]] somewhere. Others whispered darkly of [[death camps]].

Esther was by then 15, the second in a family of 5 children and the oldest girl. Her family had managed to struggle through the German occupation, watching their already-meager livelihood dwindle to nearly nothing. Her father, a horse trader, could no longer travel. Soldiers had taken the last of her mother's geese just as her eggs were about to hatch. The night before their departure, as her family assembled what few belongings remained to them, Esther decided she would not go with them. She turned to her mother for help, insisting that one of the Polish farmers among her father's friends would take her in and give her work. Although at first reluctant to let her go, Esther's mother agreed to give her some provisions and destinations.

As the family said their goodbyes to her, Esther realized she could not carry out her plan by herself and insisted that her 13-year-old sister, Mania, go with her. Mania was reluctant, wanting only to stay with the rest of the family, but Esther was emphatic. On October 15, 1942, her father, Hersh; her mother, Rachel; her older brother, Ruven; and her little sisters, Chana and Leah, set off on the road to Kraśnik. It was the last time Esther saw her family.

==Escape==
Mania was heartbroken and cried to go back to their family. Giving in, Esther turned back with her to the Kraśnik road, filled by now with a stream of [[refugees]]. Esther and Mania joined them, walking with their cousin Dina and her baby past fields and through the [[sandhill]]s of the valley. As they walked on, Esther realized that the next bend in the road would lead to the train station, and she halted in panic, insisting that she could not continue.  At this, their cousin turned to Mania and told her she should leave the road and go with her sister.

Esther and Mania went first to the house of Stefan, a good man who embraced them when they arrived.  But after sheltering them for a couple of days, Stefan told them that the rest of the village knew where they were and that the [[Gestapo]] would soon come looking for them. In tears, he put them out of his house.

Knowing now that it was not safe for them to be seen, Esther and Mania waited in the forest until the rain ended and their clothes dried.  While they waited, Esther devised a plan: They would make their way to another village where they were not known. There, they would say that they had come from the northern part of Poland, where their family, like others in the region, had lost its farm to a German family. With their digging tools in sacks across their shoulders, they would ask for work in harvesting potatoes.

==Grabówka==
They eventually came to the village of Grabówka. Pretending to be a [[Polish Catholic Church|Polish Catholic]] girl named Josephina, Esther found work with an old farmer whose wife was ill and bedridden.  Mania also became a housekeeper, for the village's sheriff and his mother.  Until 1944, Esther and Mania cooked, cleaned, cared for animals, helped in the fields, went to church, and lived out the daily lives of two Polish farm girls.

Although the Germans did not have a camp in the village, the Gestapo were stationed nearby and soldiers came and went in the village frequently, commandeering food and other supplies as they needed them. They also took young people for labor camps, now that the Jews had been eliminated. So even though she was assumed to be Polish, Esther was still forced to run up to the attic of the barn to hide when the Germans were seen to be in the village.

In May 1944, after both the farmer and his wife had died and Esther was living on the farm by herself, an old soldier in Grabówka, a veteran of the First World War, told his neighbors that he could hear artillery fire in the distance to the east. The Russians were pushing the Germans back across Poland, and the old soldier predicted that the front would be in their village within a few days. Under his direction, the neighbors dug out a [[bunker]] and prepared to go below. The battle front arrived as predicted, and the neighbors spent a night in the bunker as the German and Russian artillery engaged on the ground immediately above them.

==Liberation==
That day, at sunset, a platoon of [[USSR|Soviet]] soldiers arrived in Grabówka. Esther and her neighbors ran to greet them.  After waiting 2 weeks, Esther left for Mniszek to see who else had returned. When she arrived in Mniszek, her former neighbors were shocked to see her. Only a few other Jews had come back. All the rest were rumored to have been taken to a death camp nearby called [[Majdanek]]. Unable to find the rest of her family, Esther decided to join the [[Polish Army]], then continuing on its way west to [[Warsaw]] under [[Marshal Zhukov]]'s command.

Before she left, Esther set out to see Majdanek for herself. The Polish Army had taken over the camp, and soldiers who had been there for a while served as guides, taking new recruits around to point out the horrors inflicted by the Nazis.  Esther noticed the enormous cabbages growing in the fields around the [[crematorium]], later learning that it had been the dumping site for ashes.

With Marshal Zhukov's army, Esther eventually arrived in Germany.

==After the war==
After the war ended in 1945, Esther returned to Grabówka to get Mania and in 1946, the two of them returned to Germany, making their way to a [[Displaced Persons]] camp in the favored [[American Zone]], in the city of [[Ziegenheim]]. She met Max Krinitz there and, in November 1946, married him in a ceremony conducted in the camp. The following year, pregnant with their first child, Esther joined Max in [[Belgium]], where he had gone to work in the coal mines. While in Belgium, he contacted a cousin who lived in the United States and she agreed to arrange for sponsorship of his [[immigration]]. In June 1949, Esther, Max and their daughter arrived in New York.

==Return to Poland==
In June 1999, exactly 50 years after she left Europe, Esther returned to Mniszek to see what remained. The landscape of central Poland had not changed: farmers driving horse-drawn wooden wagons, red and yellow fields of poppy and mustard, women carrying baskets overflowing with ripe strawberries. Both in Mniszek and Grabówka, Esther met again with friends and neighbors from her childhood. "Yes, it was just like that!" they said when she showed them photographs of her art.

Immediately following her return from Poland, Esther became seriously ill; she died in 2001 at the age of 74.

==Pictures==
Esther Nisenthal Krinitz began her series of fabric pictures in 1977, with a depiction of her home and family in Mniszek. Although trained as a [[dressmaker]] and highly skilled in [[needlework]], Esther had no training in art and no conception of herself as an artist. Yet her first picture was so well received by her family and friends and was so personally satisfying that Esther went on to do another, also of her childhood home.

The next subjects for her art were two dreams she had had while hiding in Grabówka. Each dream—one in which her grandfather had appeared to her and another in which her mother came for her—had left singular vivid images in Esther's memory, and translating them into pictures was an important accomplishment for her. Once the dream sequence was completed, Esther decided to begin a narrative series that grew increasingly complex. With the addition of text, her art became illustrations of Esther's story of survival.

==Art and Remembrance==
[http://www.artandremembrance.org Art and Remembrance] is traveling an exhibit of Esther Nisenthal Krinitz's to museums in the United States, and in the future hopes to bring the art to Poland, Israel and other countries that share the legacy of the Holocaust. The entire collection began its public exhibitions at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland and has subsequently been exhibited at more than a dozen museums in the US [http://www.artandremembrance.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.showPost&amp;contentID=127]. In 2012, it returned to the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland, where it will stay until September 1, 2013.  Future exhibits include the Florida Holocaust Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida and the Evansville Museum of Art and Science in Evansville, Indiana.

In 2011, Art and Remembrance completed the 30-minute documentary film, "Through the Eye of the Needle: The Art of Esther Nisenthal Krinitz." The film tells the story of her harrowing experiences surviving the Holocaust in Poland and how she came to create an amazing and beautiful narrative in embroidery and fabric collage through images of Esther’s artwork, and the story in her own voice, as well as interviews with family members and others.

"Trained as a dressmaker but with no training in art, Esther picked up a needle and thread, intending simply to show her children all that she had gone through. Yet the art she created -- both beautiful and shocking -- is universal in its appeal, expressing deep love of family and personal courage in the face of terror and loss," says the Smithsonian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Fabric-of-Survival-The-Art-of-Esther-Nisenthal-Krinitz-4765&lt;/ref&gt;

It dates from 614 AH (1217 CE, 800 years ago), 200 years after the final completion of the epic poem in 1010, and is unillustrated.  It is a very important manuscript, because it contains old forms of many words. It was discovered in 1978 by Angelo Piemontese, the Italian scholar in the [[National Central Library (Florence)|National Central Library of Florence]]. Prior to the discovery of this manuscript, a London manuscript was considered the oldest surviving manuscript (675 AH, 1276-1277 CE). [[Djalal Khaleghi Motlagh]] used this manuscript in his edition of ''Shahnameh''. Older editions of the ''Shahnameh'' like the Moscow Edition, did not use this manuscript, because it was not discovered yet at that time. This manuscript is incomplete and contains only half of the ''Shahnameh''.

'''''Ich und Du''''', usually translated as '''''I and Thou(You)''''', is a book by [[Martin Buber]], published in 1923, and first translated from German to English in 1937.

==Premise==
Buber's main proposition is that we may address [[existence]] in two ways:
# The attitude of the "I" towards an "It", towards an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience.
# The attitude of the "I" towards "Thou", in a relationship in which the other is not separated by discrete bounds.
One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. In Buber's view, all of our relationships bring us ultimately into relationship with [[God]], who is the Eternal Thou.

Buber explains that humans are defined by two word pairs: ''I-It'' and ''I-Thou''.

The "It" of ''I-It'' refers to the world of experience and sensation. ''I-It'' describes entities as discrete objects drawn from a defined set (e.g., he, she or any other objective entity defined by what makes it measurably different from other entities).  It can be said that "I" have as many distinct and different relationships with each "It" as there are "Its" in one's life. Fundamentally, "It" refers to the world as we experience it.

By contrast, the word pair ''I-Thou'' describes the world of relations.  This is the "I" that does not objectify any "It" but rather acknowledges a living relationship. ''I-Thou'' relationships are sustained in the spirit and mind of an "I" for however long the feeling or idea of relationship is the dominant mode of perception.  A person sitting next to a complete stranger on a park bench may enter into an "I-Thou" relationship with the stranger merely by beginning to think positively about people in general.  The stranger is a person as well, and gets instantaneously drawn into a mental or spiritual relationship with the person whose positive thoughts necessarily include the stranger as a member of the set of persons about whom positive thoughts are directed.  It is not necessary for the stranger to have any idea that he is being drawn into an "I-Thou" relationship for such a relationship to arise. But what is crucial to understand is the word pair "I-Thou" can refer to a relationship with a tree, the sky, or the park bench itself as much as it can refer to the relationship between two individuals. The essential character of "I-Thou" is the abandonment of the world of sensation, the melting of the between, so that the relationship with another "I" is foremost.

Buber's two notions of "I" require attachment of the word "I" to a word partner. The splitting into the individual terms "I" and "it" and "thou" is only for the purposes of analysis. Despite the separation of "I" from the "It" and "Thou" in this very sentence describing the relationship, there is to Buber's mind either an ''I-Thou'' or an ''I-It'' relationship.  Every sentence that a person uses with "I" refers to the two pairs: "I-Thou" and "I-It", and likewise "I" is implicit in every sentence with "Thou" or "It". Each It is bounded by others and It can only exist through this attachment because for every object there is another object.  Thou, on the other hand, has no limitations. When "Thou" is spoken, the speaker has no thing (has nothing), hence, Thou is abstract; yet the speaker “takes his stand in relation”.

What does it mean to experience the world? One goes around the world extracting knowledge from the world in experiences betokened by "He", "She", and "It". One also has ''I-Thou'' relationships. Experience is all physical, but these relationships involve a great deal of [[spirituality]]. The twofold nature of the world means that our being in the world has two aspects: the aspect of experience, which is perceived as I-It, and the aspect of relation, which is perceived as I-Thou.

==Examples==
Buber uses an example of a tree and presents five separate relations:
# Looking at the tree as a picture with the color and detail through the aesthetic perception.
# Identifying the tree as movement. The movement includes the flow of the juices through the veins of the tree, the breathing of the leaves, the roots sucking the water, the never-ending activities between the tree and earth and air, and the growth of the tree.
# Categorizing the tree by its type; in other words, studying it.
# Exercising the ability to look at something from a different perspective. “I can subdue its actual presence and form so sternly that I recognize it only as an expression of law”.
# Interpreting the experience of the tree in mathematical terms.
Through all of these relations, the tree is still an object that occupies time and space and still has the characteristics that make it what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman's translation, Touchstone edition, 1996, pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

If "Thou" is used in the context of an encounter with a human being, the human being is not He, She, or bound by anything. You do not ''experience'' the human being; rather you can only relate to him or her in the sacredness of the I-Thou relation. The I-Thou relationship cannot be explained; it simply is. Nothing can intervene in the I-Thou relationship. I-Thou is not a means to some object or goal, but a definitive relationship involving the whole being of each subject.

Like the I-Thou relation, love is a subject-to-subject relationship. Love is not a relation of subject to object, but rather a relation in which both members in the relationship are subjects and share the unity of being.

The ultimate Thou is God. In the I-Thou relation there are no barriers. This enables us to relate directly to God. God is ever-present in human consciousness, manifesting in music, literature, and other forms of culture. Inevitably, Thou is addressed as It, and the I-Thou relation becomes the being of the I-Thou relation. God is now spoken to directly, not spoken about.

There is no world that disconnects one from God, a world of It alone, when I-Thou guides one’s actions. "One who truly meets the world goes out also to God." God is the worldwide relation to all relations.

{{Expand Polish|Międzynarodowe Biennale Architektury w Krakowie|date=June 2015}}
'''The International Biennale of Architecture in Kraków''' ({{lang-pl|Międzynarodowe Biennale Architektury w Krakowie}} - '''MBA''') is a regular architectural event organised in [[Kraków]] since 1985. Each edition consists of architectural competitions and a range of accompanying events like exhibitions, presentations and lectures. Over time it has shifted from being a biennial to being held in irregular years&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarp.krakow.pl/historia_triennale|title=Historia MTA - Stowarzyszenie Architektów Polskich - Kraków|website=www.sarp.krakow.pl|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mba2017.sarp.krakow.pl/historia/|title=History {{!}} MBA Kraków 2017|website=mba2017.sarp.krakow.pl|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first edition of Biennale of Architecture in [[Kraków]] was organised in 1985 by a group of Polish architects gathered in The [[Association of Polish Architects]] ({{lang-pl|Stowarzyszenie Architektów Polskich}} - SARP) on the initiative of Romuald Loegler.  The Biennale grew in importance following the [[History of Poland (1989–present)|democratic transition in Poland in 1989]]. In the 1990s Biennale became a unique forum for exchanging ideas and individual experience among the architects from all over the world. In 1994, the Biennale celebrated the astronomer, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=ulh&amp;AN=9406170715&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Visionary Monument for the Astronomer Who Shook the World|last = |first = |date = 1994|journal = Architectural Record|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 8 September 2015|volume = 182|issue = 5|page = 17|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During different editions of the event, projects in competitions were evaluated by [[Wojciech Leśnikowski]], [[Pekka Salminen]], Julia Bolles and Peter Wilson, Francesco Purini, Eckhard Feddersen, Günter Schlusche, Hildebrand Machleidt, Armando dal Fabbro, [[Peter Cook]], Roger Hopkinson and many others. Invitged guests have included [[Frei Otto]], [[Jacques Herzog]], [[Pierre de Meuron]], [[Zvi Hecker]], David Mackay, [[Dietmar Eberle]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Economic and organisational constraints eventually made it impossible to go on with the original Biennale formula, although the name Biennale was retained.

In 2015, the Biennale celebrated its jubilee year, exploring the theme of "the human dimension of urban spaces."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thenews.pl/1/11/Artykul/210432,Krakow-to-host-jubilee-architectural-biennale|title = Kraków to host jubilee architectural biennale|last = |first = |date = 16 June 2015|work = Radio Poland|access-date = 8 September 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its most recent event was in 2017.

'''Jana Eve Bennett''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 1956&lt;ref name="MediaGuardian100_2009" /&gt;) is President and General Manager of [[The History Channel|History]] and [[H2 (TV network)|H2]] at [[A+E Networks]] in New York.

She joined A+E Networks in June 2013 as President of [[The Biography Channel|The Biography Channel (bio)]] and [[Lifetime Movie Network|Lifetime Movie Network (LMN)]].  bio was rebranded as [[FYI (U.S. TV channel)|fyi]], in July 2014.

Prior to joining A+E Networks she was President of BBC Worldwide Networks and Global BBC iPlayer.  In that role she was responsible for [[BBC Worldwide]]'s television channels, which operate in more than 100 countries, and the development and roll out of the commercial global iPlayer. She was also Worldwide's Managing Director for Latin America with oversight of the company's businesses in the region.  She sat on Worldwide's Executive Board and on the Board of UKTV, Britain's second largest pay-TV group.  She took up this role in February 2011 moving from the BBC's UK public service where she had been Director of Vision at the [[BBC]] from 2006. As Director of BBC Vision, she headed "the largest multi-media production, commissioning and broadcast group of its kind in the world" with overall responsibility for BBC Television and its online services, BBC Films and BBC Productions. Previously she was Director of Television (appointed January 2002).  In her two most recent roles at the BBC, Jana Bennett "steered the BBC TV portfolio through its transition into the mainstream digital age."&lt;ref name="BBC_Newsnight_Profile" /&gt;

She was previously Executive Vice President and General Manager at [[Discovery Communications]] in the [[United States|US]].&lt;ref name="BBC_Newsnight_Profile" /&gt;

Bennett is a member of the governing board of the [[Pew Research Center]].  She is also a Governor of the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]&lt;ref name="RSC_AnnualReport" /&gt; and was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Television Society]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="RTS_Fellows" /&gt;

== Education ==
Born in [[Cooperstown, New York|Cooperstown, New York State]], USA, Bennett moved to Britain in 1969, where she was educated at Bognor Regis Comprehensive School, then studied politics, philosophy and economics at St Anne's College, Oxford.  She undertook post-graduate studies at the London School of Economics where she was awarded an MSc (Dist) for her work on strategic analysis and international and defence studies.

== Early BBC career ==
In 1979 she won a place on the [[BBC News|BBC New]]s trainee scheme, and began her first period of employment with the corporation working on radio and television news; BBC Newcastle's ''[[Look North]]'' and Radio Sheffield.  She worked on ''[[Nationwide (TV programme)|Nationwide]]'', ''[[The Money Programme]]'' and ''[[Newsnight]]''.

She became an award-winning producer of Panorama in 1986, and co-authored ''The Disappeared: Voices from a Secret War'' with the BBC's diplomatic editor [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]] about the actions of Argentina's military government in the same year.

In 1990 she became editor of the BBC's flagship science programme ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]''. Awards she won during this period included the 1991 News and Documentary [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] for her role as Executive Producer of the film "Suicide Mission to Chernobyl" which also aired on the WGBH program ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' in the United States.

In 1994 she was appointed the BBC's Head of Science, the first woman to take that role.  Under her leadership the department expanded the range and ambition of its programming, winning awards for series such as ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs|Walking With Dinosaurs]]'', ''The Human Body'' and ''Meet The Ancestors'' and business formats such as ''Blood on the Carpet'', ''Back to the Floor'' and the medical format ''Trust Me, I'm a Doctor''. She introduced a new animal genre to UK television with the highly successful and long-running ''Animal Hospital'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/factsheets/1990s.pdf&amp;pli=1 |title=Google Drive Viewer |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside live events such as ''Hospitalwatch''. The science department also pioneered content rich web sites and was one of the first areas to use email inside the BBC.

She joined the BBC's Board of Management in 1997 as Director of Production, then became Director of Programmes for the former BBC Production division until she left the BBC to join Discovery Communications as General Manager of the [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] channel in August 1999.

In 2000 she was appointed an OBE in 2000 for her work in science broadcasting.&lt;ref name="PRNewswire_2000_OBE" /&gt;

== Discovery Communications ==
At TLC Bennett transformed the channel's ratings and revenue performance.  She introduced a new editorial direction under the slogan "Life Unscripted" which included reality-drama and interior design shows, some of them based on popular British formats. The audience success of shows&lt;ref&gt;Seattle Times July 22, 2002 http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020722&amp;slug=wtradingspaces22&lt;/ref&gt; like ''[[Trading Spaces]]'', and ''[[Scrapheap challenge|Junkyard Wars]]'' exemplified a shift in programming towards more mass-appeal shows. By 2001 TLC had the youngest adult audience profile amongst US cable channels with a median age of 40 and a 15% year on year growth in audience among the 18- to 34-year-old age group. It was also the strongest performing network for women in daytime.

== Later BBC career ==
In 2002 Bennett returned to the UK to take the job of Director of Television.  In this capacity she took charge of the launch and expansion of the BBC's portfolio of 7 digital TV channels: BBC THREE, BBC FOUR, HD TV and the children's channels, CBBC and CBeebies This included winning the approval of the government for the launch of BBC THREE, the corporation's youth orientated digital television channel, which at the time was considered by some to be a controversial development for the BBC.

In 2006 the BBC's Director-General, Mark Thompson reorganised the BBC's divisional structure, creating BBC Vision from the amalgamation of the corporation's Television, Drama Entertainment &amp; Children's and Factual &amp; Learning divisions. Bennett was promoted from Director of Television to Director of Vision taking "overall creative and leadership responsibility" for the commissioning, production and scheduling of television, video and online content across the BBC's analogue and digital television networks (excluding the BBC News and Parliament channels), the web, mobile phones and interactive technology.&lt;ref name="BBC_Vision_Launch" /&gt;

During her tenure, BBC television was responsible for natural history landmarks, such as ''[[Life (BBC TV series)|Life]]'', worldwide entertainment hits, including ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'' and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''; new comedy formats, such as [[Outnumbered (UK TV series)|Outnumbered]] and ''[[Gavin &amp; Stacey]]''. Dramas ranged from period classics like ''[[Cranford (TV series)|Cranford]]'' to contemporary pieces such as ''Criminal Justice'' and ''Occupation'', from science fiction in the shape of ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' to detective series such as ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', ''[[Wallander (UK TV series)|Wallander]]'' and ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]''.

Her division was also heavily involved in the planning and launch of the corporation's on-demand service, BBC iPlayer, providing 400 hours content for the service each week. In a speech to the Royal Television Society in 2007, she articulated a fresh approach to the BBC's mission to inform and educate in the digital era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/speeches/stories/bennett_rts2007.shtml |title=Jana Bennett speech given to the Royal Television Society, London |publisher=BBC |date=2007-09-20 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also championed new multi-media approaches to major fundraising entertainment events.

== Biography ==
Jovan is son of [[protoiereus]] Atanasije Došenović. He was born in [[Počitelj (Gospić)|Počitelj]]&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt; in [[Lika]] or [[Velika Pisanica]]. He studied at the [[University of Padua]], where he got his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] and other academic degrees. He has lived for a while in his father’s home after returning to Lika, and then worked as a [[bookkeeper]] in [[Trieste]], in a big shop owned by [[Dositej Obradović]]’s friend [[Draga Teodorović]]. He remained there until [[1809]], when he went to [[Pešta]] to publish his writings. "Recommend, brother," Draga told him at their farewell, "let them write and work, there is a world in front of [everyone’s] eyes." "And as long as we have money," Došenović replied happily. In Pešta he printed his [[anthology]] of poems; it was ''Čislenica'' or ''Nauka računa'' (lit. ''Science of Mathematics''), Part I, and he was preparing to publish more to the world. There he got sick, but quickly recovered. After this event, trail on Jovan is lost. However, it is known that in [[1811]] Došenović was still alive; in [[1815]] he has been mentioned among deceased [[Serbs|Serbian]] writers. Besides [[Italian language]] in which he studied, he was able to speak [[French language|French]] and [[German language]]s. After finding some information on his work, [[Jernej Kopitar]] used to put Došenović’s humble beginnings among best products of [[Serbian literature]] of that time, and in literary discussions (via letters sent to friends) he mentioned Došenović’s name several times.&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

== Literary work and critical review ==
Jovan Došenović’s poems can be divided by origin, subject and form. In the first case, he used to translate more than to write on his own. His literary-historical significance is that he appears as the first person who was familiar with someone else’s [[art]] and [[poetry]], and is the first person who started translating poems from other languages. Only this way Serbian readers of that time could get familiar with a variety of poetic forms, seeing that except natural poetry (which was common in renewed Serbian literature) there were other artistic poetry forms, and that in fact this was the most important of all. Došenović cited sources for his translated poems in the [[preface]]s of his books, where he mentions [[Italians]] Iacopo Vittorelli (1749-1835) and [[Giovanni Battista Casti]], and [[Russians|Russian]] [[Mikhail Lomonosov]]. It was not vanity dictating him not to tell for source for every single poem separately. He did not relied on this. Main ideal he was guided by was: is it possible to have different songs in [[Serbian language]] too? That possibility he believed was completely true, so he tried to make everyone else see his printing. While translating his [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]], he did not want to show them to the Serbian publicity. In them he was trying to find only support column, choosing what he thinks is important for [[Serbian literature|Serbian poetry literature]] by form and/or content. Subject he used to write about was love or depicting of natural beauties; by form they were [[anacreontics]], [[sonnet]]s and [[ode]]s. In every Došenović’s [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] it can be seen how hands of poets are being tied and freedom of movement for a used language being cut. He wanted to write poems in popular language spoken by an ordinary man; generally, he actually did write only in [[vernacular language]]. In order to reach a total clearance, he needed to do so much more so that could be achieved successfully. [[Orthography]] was another factor that influenced him as his language was not "clear"; however, he strived to make it that way everywhere...&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

Beginnings of some more specific [[lyricism]] in modern [[Serbian literature]] is directly related to the poetic work of Došenović. He was the first one to come out with new forms of already mentioned [[anacreontics]], [[sonnet]] and even more free [[ode]]s; he was first to begin translating other eminent poets; he was first to show greater freedom and agility in poetic terms, too. All he did was using the famous collection with the preface of the Serbian literature in large-scale, speaking of [[aesthetics]] [[literature]]. Thus, the Došenović is one of the first Serbian literary aestheticians.&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

Došenović did not want to surrender to the way of writing poems in that time; he knew what had to be different; he saw that in other [[people]]s, especially [[Italians]]; he wanted to make a Serbian poem really an ode poem; due to the latter, he gets into fights with anything that was slowing down artistic poetry: using form, language and orthography, and making some successes.&lt;ref name="Srpski biografski rečnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name="riznica"/&gt;

The '''''Libri Carolini''''' ("Charles' books"), '''''Opus Caroli regis contra synodum''''' ("The work of King Charles against the Synod"), also called '''''Charlemagne's Books''''' or simply the '''''Carolines''''', are the work in four books composed on the command of [[Charlemagne]], around 790, to refute the supposed conclusions of the Byzantine [[Second Council of Nicaea]] (787), particularly as regards its acts and decrees in the matter of sacred images.  They are "much the fullest statement of the Western attitude to representational art that has been left to us by the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 32&lt;/ref&gt;  The work appears to have been very largely a [[polemic]] based on a misunderstanding of the actual position taken by the Byzantine church, which was quietly archived when this was realized, probably in Rome. 

The ''Libri Carolini'' were never promulgated at the time apart from being sent to [[Pope Adrian I]] who responded with a ''grandis et verbosa epistola'' (dignified and wordy letter),&lt;ref name="Gibbon"&gt;Gibbon, Edward. ''History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire Vol. 5''. Kessinger Publishing. 2004. {{ISBN|1-4191-2419-6}}. p 37.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained all but unknown until they were first printed in 1549, by [[Jean du Tillet]], [[Bishop of Meaux]], under the name of ''Eriphele''.&lt;ref name="cyclo"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt; They contain 120 objections against the Second Council of Nicaea, and are couched in harsh, reproachful terms, including the following: ''dementiam'' ("folly"), ''priscae Gentilitatis obsoletum errorem'' ("an old and outmoded pagan misunderstanding"), ''argumenta insanissima et absurdissima'' ("most insane and absurd reasoning"), ''derisione dignas naenias'' ("screeds worthy of derision"), etc.&lt;ref name="Gibbon"/&gt; The modern edition of this text, by Ann Freeman and Paul Meyvaert (Hannover 1998), is called ''Opus Caroli regis contra synodum'' ("''The work of King Charles against the Synod''"), and is based on the manuscript in the [[Vatican Library]], which is now generally accepted as a Carolingian working manuscript "hastily finished up", when it became clear that the work was now redundant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2903487 JSTOR] Review by John J. Contreni of:''Opus Caroli regis contra synodum (Libri Carolini)'' by Ann Freeman; Paul Meyvaert, ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Vol. 76, No. 2 (April 2001), pp. 453-455&lt;/ref&gt;

When the work resurfaced during the [[Protestant Reformation]], it caused a good deal of excitement and confusion. Despite its support of images, [[John Calvin]] refers to it approvingly in later editions of his ''[[Institutes of the Christian Religion]]'' (Book 1, Ch 11, section 14), and uses it in his argument against the veneration of images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vor.org/rbdisk/html/institutes/index.html Calvin's ''Institutes'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
The work begins, "In the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ beginneth the work of the most illustrious and glorious man Charles, by the will of God, king of the Franks, Gauls, Germany, Italy, neighboring provinces, with the assistance of the king, against the Synod which in Greek parts firmly and proudly decreed in favour of adoring (''adorandis'') images recklessly and arrogantly,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Libri Carolini, sive, Caroli Magni Capitulare de imaginibus|url=https://archive.org/stream/libricarolinisiv02bast#page/n11/mode/2up|website=archive.org|accessdate=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed immediately by what is called "Charlemagne's Preface". However, it is unlikely that Charlemagne wrote any of the books himself,&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt; although the views expressed were influenced by him.  He apparently did not accept that art had any advantages over books, a view not held by many of his advisers.

The preferred candidate as author of most modern scholars, following Anne Freeman, is Bishop [[Theodulf of Orleans]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WsN-YaSICWwC&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=%22Libri+Carolini%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=tUHnTH7uMg&amp;sig=fEuUepuFG39OP-_PwGWPccJdFJg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result Dales, Richard C.]''The Intellectual Life of Western Europe in the Middle Ages'', note 3 on p. 88, BRILL, 1992
{{ISBN|90-04-09622-1}} - summarizes recent scholarship.  See also Dodwell, 32&lt;/ref&gt; a Spanish [[Visigoth]] in origin, of which traces can be detected in the Latin and the liturgical references in the work. The Vatican manuscript has an author, considered to be Theodulf, and a corrector.  It is very likely that several clerics at the court contributed to discussions formulating a work to be issued in the Emperor's name, but it seems likely that Theodulf composed the text we have.&lt;ref&gt;Dales,89&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, some have attributed the writings to [[Angilram]], [[Bishop of Metz]] or others of the bishops of France, alleging that Pope Adrian having sent Charlemagne the Acts of the Council in 790, he gave them to the French bishops for examination, and that the ''Libri Carolini'' was the answer they returned.&lt;ref name="cyclo" /&gt; There is also evidence that the author was [[Alcuin]]; besides the English tradition that he had written such a book, there is also the remarkable similarity of his commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John]] (4, 5, et seqq.) to a passage in ''Liber IV.'', cap. vi., of the ''Libri Carolini''.&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

==Contents==
According to the ''Libri Carolini'', images may be used as ecclesiastical ornaments, for purposes of instruction, and in memory of past events. It is foolish, however, to burn incense before them and to use lights, though it is quite wrong to cast them out of the churches and destroy them. Strong opposition is voiced to "adoration" of images, wrongly believing that the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] used this word, taken to mean the absolute adoration reserved for God alone, while only appropriate veneration is to be given to the saints and reverential honour to the Cross of Christ, Scripture, sacred vessels, and relics of the saints. The Greek word προσκύνησις that the Council in fact used means no more than reverence in a prostrate attitude.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03371b.htm Thomas Shahan, "Caroline Books (Libri Carolini)" in ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (New York 1908)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Libri Carolini'' also blame the excessive reverence shown by the Greeks to their emperors, criticize unfavourably the elevation of [[Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople|Tarasius]] to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, and find fault with the Scriptural and patristic exegesis of the Greeks. They confuse statements of the Second Council of Nicaea with those of the Iconoclastic conciliabulum of 754, frequently misrepresent the facts, and in general exhibit a strong anti-Greek bias.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

Various iconodule arguments for the use of images are dismissed. The reverence shown to the [[Ark of the Covenant]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]] is not accepted as an analogy for the attitude due to art, as the Ark was made on the direct instructions and to the designs of God himself.  That Theodulf's oratory has a mosaic on this very subject, otherwise unknown at this scale, is itself taken as an argument for his authorship of the work.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The contents were interpreted by [[John Calvin|Calvin]] and other [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] writers during the [[Protestant Reformation]] as support for their attitude. They were also put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]], where they remained until 1900, either because of their iconoclastic arguments or because seen as interference by a civil authority in matters of Church doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7rjenNXferEC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22Libri+Carolini%22+Index&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MolGUtyLGoLwhQfsxIBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Libri%20Carolini%22%20Index&amp;f=false Paul Oskar Kristeller et al.

==Authority==
According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] the editions of the ''Libri Carolini'' that have been in print are not those that were sent to Pope Adrian by Charlemagne, to which the Pope designed to write a refutation. This has been shown by [[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]], who notes that those sent to the Pope treated the matter in an entirely different order; and that they contained only 85 chapters,&lt;ref name=CE/&gt; while the printed books have 120, or 121 if the authenticity of the last chapter is granted. Moreover, the quotations made in Adrian's reply do not occur verbatim in the ''Libri Carolini'', but are in some cases lengthened, in others abbreviated.&lt;ref name="ECF"&gt;"[http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-14/Npnf2-14-171.htm Examination of the Caroline Books]". ''Early Church Fathers: Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, Series II, Vol. XIV''. Public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Petavius]] thinks that what Adrian received were extracts from the ''Libri Carolini'', made by the [[Council of Frankfort]] (794). Hefele arrives at a directly opposite conclusion, ''viz.'', that the ''Libri Carolini'' are an expansion of the Capitula sent to the Pope, and that this expansion was made at the bidding of Charlemagne. [[Baronius]], [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], [[Severin Binius|Binius]], and [[Surius]] all questioned the authenticity of the ''Libri Carolini'' altogether. However, this extreme position seems to be refuted by the fact that certain quotations made by [[Hincmar]] are found in the modern printed books,&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt; and may have been influenced by their use by Protestant writers during the Reformation.  It is now generally accepted that the books are authentic, and the original Carolingian manuscript, as published by Freeman, was rediscovered in the 20th century.

==All a misunderstanding==
The work was refuting a bad copy of a very incompetent translation of the Byzantine decrees. In particular it seems clear that at least one negative was omitted, reversing the sense of the Greek, and that the Greek word [[proskynesis]] was mistranslated as "[[adoration]]", for which the Greek word is ''[[latria]]'', which the Council had stated, in the invariable position shared by Catholics and Orthodox, was due only to the persons of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;Gale, 87&lt;/ref&gt;

(1728 Cyclopedia)
It seems that the authors of these books had never read the acts nor decrees of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], or only in a very poor translation. Further, they seemed ignorant of what took place at the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 754. As an example, in Book IV., Chapter xiv., and also in Chapter xx., (Migne's ed., col. 1213 and col. 1226), the charge is made that the [[Second Council of Nicaea]], specifically Gregory, the [[bishop of Neocaesarea]], unduly flattered the Empress. However, these remarks were made at the [[Conciliabulum]] of 754, and not at the Second Council of Nicaea; also, they were not made by Gregory of Neocaesarea at all, and the reason they are attributed to him is because he read them in the proceedings of that pseudo-council to the true council of 787.&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

The most famous example of incongruity in these books occurs in Book III., Chapter xvii., in which it is attributed to [[Constantius of Cyprus|Constantius]], the bishop of [[Cyprus]], the statement that the sacred images were to be given supreme adoration due to the Holy Trinity. Sir [[William Palmer (theologian)|William Palmer]], and most modern scholars, attribute all of these mistakes to the books' authors using a mistranslated version of the acts and decrees of the Second Council of Nicaea. Of this translation, Anastasius Bibliothetius says, "The translator both misunderstood the genius of the Greek language as well as that of the Latin, and has merely translated word for word; and in such a fashion that it is scarcely ever possible to know (aut vix aut nunquam) what it means; moreover nobody ever reads this translation and no copies of it are made."&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

Following are select false statements made in the text:

*In the Preface, it states that the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Conciliabulum]] was "held in [[Bithynia]];" however, they were held in Constantinople.
*In Book I, chapter i. are quoted certain words said to occur in the letters of the Empress and her son. On this Hefele remarks: "One cannot find the words in either of the two letters of these sovereigns, which are preserved in the acts of the Council of Nicaea."
*In the Second Book, chapter xxvii., the council is charged with saying, "Just as the Lord's body and blood pass over from fruits of the earth to a notable mystery, so also the images, made by the skill of the artificers, pass over to the veneration of those persons whose images they bear." Now this was never said nor taught by the Nicene Synod, but something like it was taught by the Constantinopolitan conciliabulum of 754. These exact words cited occur neither in the one set of acts nor in the other. The underlying thought, however, was clearly exposed by the iconoclastic synod of 754 and as clearly refuted by the orthodox synod of 787.
*In Book III, chapter v., it states that, "[[Patriarch Tarasios of Constantinople|Tarasius]] said in his confession of faith that the Holy Spirit was the companion (''contribulum'' in the ''Libri Carolini'') of the Father and of the Son." It was not Tarasius who said this, but Theodore of Jerusalem.
*Chapter XVII. begins thus: "How rashly and (so to speak) like a fool, Constantine, bishop of Constantia in Cyprus, spoke when he said, with the approval of the rest of the bishops, that he would receive and honourably embrace the images; and babbled that the service of adoration which is due to the consubstantial and life-giving Trinity, should be given images, we need not here discuss, since to all who either read or hear this it will be clear that he was swamped in no small error, to wit to confess that he exhibited to creatures the service due to the Creator alone, and through his desire to favour the pictures overturned all the Holy Scriptures. For what sane man ever either said or thought of saying such an absurdity, as that different pictures should be held in the same honour as the holy, victorious Trinity. the creator of all things, etc." But according to the acts, this is exactly the opposite of what Constantine did say.&lt;ref name="ECF"/&gt;

}}
The '''Lotus chalice''' or '''Alabaster chalice''', called the '''Wishing Cup''' by [[Howard Carter]], derives from the [[Tomb of Tutankhamun|tomb]] of the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]] ([[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]). The object received the find number 014 and is now on display in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]], with the inventory number JE 67465.

== Discovery ==
The tomb of the young king in the [[List_of_burials_in_the_Valley_of_the_Kings#East_Valley|East Valley of the Kings]] ([[KV62]]) was uncovered almost untouched in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in West [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] by [[Howard Carter]] on 4 November 1922. The lotus chalice was one of the first objects which Carter and his excavators found on entering the tomb. The vessel was almost directly behind the entrance of the corridor to the antechamber, where they broke in, on the ground. This was not its original position.&lt;ref&gt;Jaromir Malek. ''The Treasures of Tutankhamun.'' London 2006, {{ISBN|0-233-00197-2}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and significance ==
[[File:Heh.svg|thumb|upright|[[Heh (god)|Heh]] kneeling on the Neb symbol with the symbols of infinity: Shen ring, tadpoles and palm rib]]
The lotus chalice is made from a single piece of [[alabaster]]. The chalice has the shape of a [[Nymphaea|lotus]] in full bloom. The handles on both sides are identical, shaped like lotus flowers growing upward, with the [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Heh (god)|Heh]] seated on a basket (the neb symbol) on the tips of the leaves. In each hand Heh holds a palm rib with notches for counting the years and a tadpole sitting on a [[shen ring]] below each one. This is a typical depiction of the god of the "million years", the god of infinity and eternity: the palm rib is the [[Hieroglyph]] for year, while both the shen ring and the tadpole were symbols of eternity. A kneeling image of the god was the hieroglyph for the number "one million". The same motif is found on other items from the tomb. For example, wooden stool (JE 62029, find number 87). At the upper end of each palm rib there is an [[ankh]] symbol, the sign of life. The chalice therefore symbolises the infinite and eternal life of King Tutankhamun.

The lotus is significant in [[Egyptian mythology]] for the birth of the sun god, who emerged from the lotus, after it had risen out of the flood of the primeval waters of [[Nun]]. The name of the king in the centre of the white open flower therefore symbolised his rebirth.

== Inscriptions ==
[[File:Tutankhamen tomb layout.jpg|thumb|upright|Floorplan of KV62]]
The inscriptions are engraved and filled with dark paste. Howard Carter copied the inscriptions and asked [[Alan Gardiner]] to provide a translation, since he required this for publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/perl/gi-ca-qmakedeta.pl?sid=95.89.186.47-1387916681&amp;qno=1&amp;dfnam=014-c014-2 ''Card/Transcription No.: 014-2'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The main lotus, which forms the actual chalice, had the king's [[Ancient Egyptian royal titulary|throne name]] (''Neb-kheperw-Re'' - Lord in Forms, Re) and personal name (''Twt-ankh-amun'' - Living image of [[Amun]]), "may he live forever." The first column names him as "beloved of [[Amun-Re]], Lord of the throne of the two Lands (''Neb-neswt tawi''), Lord of Heaven (''Neb-pet'').&lt;ref&gt;Karl-Theodor Zauzich: ''Hieroglyphen ohne Geheimnis.'' (= ''[[Kulturgeschichte der antiken Welt]].''). von Zabern, Darmstadt/ Mainz 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-8053-4267-4}}. S. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing runs from right to left.

The inscription on the rim of the chalice is to be read in two directions. From right to left, beginning with the [[Horus]] falcon, are the more rarely attested Horus name and Nebty name of Tutankhamun. From left to right, beginning with the [[ankh]] symbol, is the following:
: ''May your ''[[Ka (Egyptian soul)|ka]]'' live, may you spend millions of years, you, who love Thebes, sitting with your face to the north wind, your eyes beholding happiness.''&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Reeves, John H. Taylor: ''Howard Carter before Tutankhamun.'' British Museum Press; London 1992, {{ISBN|0-714-10959-2}}, p. 188; T. G. H. James: ''Tutanchamun. Der ewige Glanz des jungen Pharaos.'' Köln 2000, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;


Because of the inscription, Howard Carter called the lotus chalice the ''King's Wishing Cup''. The wish inscription from the lotus chalice is quoted on the second gravestone of Howard Carter.

== Display ==
In addition to being displayed in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in Cairo, the lotus chalice was among the original finds selected for the first temporary exhibition of the [[grave goods]] of Tutankhamun. It was also on display with the exhibition number 39 in the world-touring ''[[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972–1981)|Treasures of Tutankhamun]]'' exhibition.

[[File:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|300 px|[[Jerusalem]] on the Madaba Map]]
The '''Madaba Map''' (also known as the '''Madaba Mosaic Map''') is part of a floor [[mosaic]] in the [[Byzantine architecture|early Byzantine]] church of [[Saint George]] in [[Madaba]], [[Jordan]]. The Madaba Map is a map of the Middle East. Part of it contains the oldest surviving original [[cartography|cartographic]] depiction of the [[Holy Land]] and especially [[Jerusalem]]. It dates to the 6th century AD.

==History==
[[File:Madaba Map reproduction.jpg|thumb|250px|Reproduction of the Madaba Map]]
The Madaba Mosaic Map depicts Jerusalem with the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|Nea Church]], which was dedicated on 20 November, AD 542. Buildings erected in Jerusalem after 570 are absent from the depiction, thus limiting the date range of its creation to the period between 542 and 570.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} The mosaic was made by unknown artists, probably for the [[Christianity|Christian]] community of Madaba, which was the seat of a [[bishop]] at that time. In 614, Madaba was conquered by the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian empire]]. In the 8th century AD, the [[Islam|Muslim]] [[Umayyad]] rulers had some figural motifs removed from the mosaic. In 746, Madaba was largely destroyed by an earthquake and subsequently abandoned. The mosaic was rediscovered in 1884, during the construction of a new [[Greek Orthodox]] church on the site of its ancient predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meimaris|first=Yiannis|title=The Discovery of the Madaba Mosaic Map. Mythology and Reality|url=http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/MeimarisMap.html|access-date=9 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003025644/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/articles/MeimarisMap.html|archive-date=3 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarch [[Nicodemus I of Jerusalem]] was informed, but no research was carried out until 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Donner, 1992, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jordan Times, "[https://archive.org/stream/JordanTimes1995JordanEnglish/Sep%2021%201995%2C%20Jordan%20Times%2C%20%236026%2C%20Jordan%20%28en%29#page/n14/mode/1up The discovery of the mosaic map of madaba]", September 21, 1995: "It was only Abuna Kleofas Kikilides who realised the true significance, for the history of the region, that the map had while visiting Madaba in December 1896. A Franciscan friar of ltalian-Croatian origin born in Constantinople, Fr. Girolamo Golubovich, helped Abuna Kleofas to print a booklet in Greek about the map at the Franciscan printing press of Jerusalem. Immediately afterwards, the Revue Biblique published a long and detailed historic-geographic study of the map by the Dominican fathers M.J. Lagrange and H. Vincent after visiting the site themselves. At the same time. Father J. Germer-Durand of the Assumptionist Fathers published a photographic album with his own pictures of the map. In Paris, C. Clermont-Gannau, a well known oriental scholar, announced the discovery at the Academie des Sciences et belles Lettres. "&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following decades, large portions of the mosaic map were damaged by fires, activities in the new church and by the effects of moisture. In December 1964, the [[Volkswagen]] Foundation gave the ''Deutscher Verein für die Erforschung Palästinas'' ("German Society for the exploration of Palestine") 90,000 [[Deutschmark|DM]] to save the mosaic. In 1965, the archaeologists Heinz Cüppers and Herbert Donner undertook the restoration and conservation of the remaining parts of the mosaic.

==Description==
[[File:Sapsaphas Madaba.jpg|thumb|Place of [[John the Baptist]]'s baptism at the mouth of the [[Jordan (river)|Jordan]] and (near-obliterated) lion hunting a gazelle]]
The floor mosaic is located in the [[apse]] of the church of Saint George at Madaba. It is not oriented northwards, like modern maps, but faces east towards the [[altar]] in such a fashion that the position of places on the map coincides with the actual compass directions. Originally, it measured 21 by 7 m and contained over two million ''[[tesserae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uni-bonn.de/Aktuelles/Publikationen/forsch/forsch_4_November_2005/bilder/Kultur.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Ute Friederich: ''Antike Kartographie''&lt;/ref&gt; Its current dimensions are 16 by 5 m.

===Topographic representation===
The mosaic map depicts an area from [[Lebanon]] in the north to the [[Nile Delta]] in the south, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the [[Eastern Desert]]. Among other features, it depicts the [[Dead Sea]] with two fishing boats, a variety of bridges linking the banks of the [[Jordan (river)|Jordan]], fish swimming in the river and receding from the Dead Sea; a [[lion]] (rendered nearly unrecognisable by the insertion of random tesserae during a period of [[iconoclasm]]) hunting a [[gazelle]] in the [[Moab]] desert, [[palmtree|palm]]-ringed [[Jericho]], [[Bethlehem]] and other [[bible|biblical]]-Christian sites. The map may partially have served to facilitate pilgrims' orientation in the Holy Land.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} All landscape units are labelled with explanations in [[Greek language|Greek]]. A combination of folding perspective and aerial view depicts about 150 towns and villages, all of them labelled.

The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is Jerusalem, at the centre of the map. The mosaic clearly shows a number of significant structures in the [[Old City of Jerusalem]]: the [[Damascus Gate]], the [[Lions' Gate]], the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]], the [[Zion Gate]], the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|New Church of the Theotokos]], the [[Tower of David]] and the [[Cardo#Jerusalem|''Cardo Maximus'']]. The recognisable depiction of the urban topography makes the mosaic a key source on Byzantine Jerusalem. Also unique are the detailed depictions of cities such as [[Nablus#Flavia Neapolis|Neapolis]], [[Askalon]], [[Gaza City|Gaza]], [[Pelusium]] and [[Kerak|Charachmoba]], all of them nearly detailed enough to be described as [[street map]]s.

==Scientific significance==
The mosaic map of Madaba is the oldest known geographic floor mosaic in [[art history]]. It is used heavily for the localisation and verification of biblical sites. Study of the map played a major role in answering the question of the topographical location of [[Askalon]] (''Asqalan'' on the map).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grin.com/de/preview/59736.html Jana Vogt: ''Architekturmosaiken am Beispiel der drei jordanischen Städte Madaba, Umm al-Rasas und Gerasa''. Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität Greifswald, Greifswald 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1967, excavations in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of Jerusalem revealed the Nea Church and the ''Cardo Maximus'' in the very locations suggested by the Madaba Map.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111021010325/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/Jerusalem-%20the%20Nea%20Church%20and%20the%20Cardo ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES NO. 5 Jerusalem- the Nea Church and the Cardo]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, excavations further substantiated its accuracy with the discovery of a road depicted in the map that runs through the center of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/meast/02/10/jerusalem.road.discovery/index.html?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title=Archaeologists find Byzantine era road | date=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the map, the main entrance to the city was through a large gate opening into a wide central street. Until the discovery, archaeologists were not able to excavate this site due to heavy pedestrian traffic. In the wake of infrastructure work near the [[Jaffa Gate]], large paving stones were discovered at a depth of 4 meters below ground that prove such a road existed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1149033.html Dig uncovers ancient Jerusalem street depicted on Byzantine map ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies of the Madaba Map==
A copy of the map is in the collection of the Archaeological Institute at [[Göttingen University]]. It was produced during the conservation work at Madaba in 1965 by archaeologists of the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier|Rheinisches Landesmuseum]], [[Trier]]. A copy produced by students of the ''Madaba Mosaic School'' is in the foyer of the [[Akademisches Kunstmuseum]] at [[Bonn]]. The lobby of the [[YMCA]] in Jerusalem has a replica of the map incorporated in the floor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Archaeology/jermandate.html Jerusalem: Architecture in the British Mandate Period]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word '''magnificence''' comes from the Latin “magnum facere”, which means to do something great. The Latin word draws on the Greek “megaloprépeia”. This noun conveys the meaning of doing something great which is fitting or seemly to the circumstance. Magnificence is a philosophical, aesthetic and socio-economic notion deeply rooted in Western culture since [[classical antiquity]]. It regards the greatness of actions, courage, excellence, honour, generosity, and splendour of lifestyles of noble purposes.

==Magnificence in Classical Antiquity==

===Plato===
[[Plato]] offered the first philosophical interpretation of the concept of magnificence. He separated ''megalopsychía'' ([[magnanimity]]) from ''megaloprépeia'' (magnificence), which had been synonymous in [[archaic Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;John Cook Wilson. “Μεγαλοπρεπεια and μεγαλοψυχια”, ''Arist. Classical Review'', 4, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Gauthier, ''Magnanimité. L’idéal de la grandeur dans la philosophie païenne et dans la théologie chrétienne''. Bibliothèque thomiste, XXVIII, Paris: Vrin, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnificence is the special quality in Plato's conception of the [[philosopher-king]], as presented in the fifth and sixth books of [[The Republic (Plato)|''The Republic'']]. Only those with a philosophical and educational temperament understand the difference between good and evil. The philosopher is magnificent, gracious, the friend of truth, justice, courage and temperance, has an excellent memory, and learns easily (487 a2-8).&lt;ref&gt;Linda Rabieh. Plato and the virtue of courage. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006: 155.&lt;/ref&gt; When perfected by age and education this magnificent being is the type of person to whom the state must be entrusted.

===Herodotus and Xenophon===
The historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]] proposed a social and economic interpretation of magnificence. They used the term to describe the donation of private money and property to support public works or communal needs. In [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[History of the Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] societies this was a widespread custom. Affluent citizens holding public positions were expected to use their own money for a wide range of activities which were deemed important by their communities.

In the [[Histories (Herodotus)|''Histories'']], Herodotus gives various examples of magnificence, such as that of [[Polycrates]] (3, 123, 1); the [[Scythian]]s' magnificent festivity of the goddess [[Cybele]] (4, 7, 3); [[Amyntas I of Macedon|Amyntas]]'s invitation to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] to feast and be entertained by him with great generosity and displays of friendship (5, 18); [[Clisthenes]]'s sumptuous treatment of his daughter's suitors when seeking a good marriage for her (6, 128).

Xenophon, in his treatise ''[[Oeconomicus]]'' introduces magnificence within the meaning of wealth and social obligations.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Cozzo, ''Le passioni economiche nella Grecia antica'', Palermo, Sellerio, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the phenomenon of [[evergetism]] (as outlined by [[Paul Veyne]]), affluent citizens are called upon to offer many costly sacrifices such as building all sorts of public works, such as fortifications, war boats, temples, or amphitheatres; supplying an army with all the equipment and provisions it needed; offering entertainment and shows; hosting prominent foreign guests and regaling them with lavish hospitality. Even fellow-citizens must be plied by them with all sorts of nice things. Magnificence is thus connected with liberality, high lifestyles, and wealth. [[Critobulus]], says [[Socrates]] in the dialogue, is called upon to be magnificent in order to live up to his reputation as an affluent citizen. All these deeds give public honour to the wealthy citizens and the entire city. Xenophon extends magnificence to women.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], “Magnificenza e mondo classico”. ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 5: 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Mania, the widow of Zenis, the governor of [[Aeolis]], not only convinced the Persian satrap Pharnabazus to appoint her as the new governess, but excelled in her military, political and economic duties, never lacking in magnificence whenever it was required (''[[Hellenica#Xenophon's Hellenica|Hellenica]]'', III, 10-13).

===Aristotle===
In his ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', [[Aristotle]] offers a philosophical, [[ethical]], and [[aesthetic]] interpretation of magnificence which exerted an extensive influence throughout the following centuries.

In the fourth book of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', magnificence is described as the ethical virtue linked to money: "it is a fitting expenditure involving largeness of scale" (IV, 2, 1122a 23). However, Aristotle insists that the type of expenditure must be appropriate to the circumstance. Hence, not every type of action requires the same degree of expense. Thus, Aristotle, like Plato, consolidates the separation of the virtues of magnificence and magnanimity. Drawing on Xenophon, however, he dignifies the economic aspect of a great expenditure by turning it into an ethical virtue.

With Aristotle, magnificence also acquires an aesthetic dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah F. Maclaren,  “Magnificenza e mondo classico”. ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 5: 2003: 43&lt;/ref&gt; It becomes an art in itself, requiring that one understands what type of expenditure is needed and does so tastefully. A magnificent man knows that the expenditure should be large, but appropriate to who is actually spending, the circumstance, and the object of the expense. The Aristotle scholar [[W. D. Ross]] suggested that in this conception magnificence turns out to be mainly a matter of aesthetic good taste.&lt;ref&gt;David Ross, Aristotle. (1923). New introduction. London: Routledge, 1995, 6th edition: 144&lt;/ref&gt; The aesthetic role that magnificence acquired with Aristotle exerted a profound influence on [[rhetoric]], the arts, [[architecture]] and [[art criticism]].

===Cicero and Rome===
[[Cicero]] introduced the ethic of magnificence to [[ancient Roman]] and [[Italian people|Italian]] civilization. In his youthful work on rhetoric, ''[[De inventione]]'', he writes that magnificence is "the consideration and management of important and sublime matters with a certain wide seeing and splendid determination of mind" (II, Liv, 163). Thus Cicero fused the Greek and Roman traditions, transforming the Greek view of magnificence into a Roman concept. The Latin word ''magnificentia'' comes from the expression ''magnum facere'', which literally means "to do something great". In Cicero's formulation, it refers to the greatness of the task, the intention to realize it, and the determination to carry it through. Cicero’s seminal interpretation of magnificence influenced [[Thomas Aquinas]] in his ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiæ]]'' over a thousand years later.

===Magnificence in Ancient Rome===
Magnificence took on very Roman characteristics. In ancient Rome, it is a [[Res publica|public]] phenomenon connected to the institutions, political power and the Roman state. The magnificence of the buildings, roads,  public buildings and festivals was under the control of the [[aedile]]s. Furthermore, magnificence has nothing to do with [[wikt:luxury|luxury]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], “Lusso, spreco, magnificenza”, ''Ágalma. Rivista di studi culturali e di estetica'', 2, 2002: 43-62&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it reflects a system of [[Roman Republic|republican]] values and [[Virtus (virtue)|virtues]] embraced by the traditionalist Roman oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Emanuele Narducci, ''Modelli etici e società. Un’idea di Cicerone'', Pisa, Giardini, 1989: 226-265&lt;/ref&gt; When Cicero claims that "the Roman people loathe private luxury (''luxuriam'') but they love public magnificence (''magnificentiam'')" (''Pro Murena'', 76), he is making an explicit reference to a political system which was being undermined by a new generation of politicians. Whereas luxury represented the use of wealth to serve personal satisfaction, magnificence rested on traditional republican values based on respect for an appropriate relationship between private and public life.

===Rhetoric, Demetrius and art criticism===
In classical rhetoric, magnificence is one of the models of the [[Grand style (rhetoric)|grand]] or elevated style. However the most important work on magnificence in the classical world is ''On Style'' (''Perì hermēnēías'') written by [[Demetrius of Phalerum]] probably in the first century B.C. Demetrius gives a technical description of the typical features of the elevated style.&lt;ref&gt;Demetrius. ''On style''. Translated by William Rhys Roberts, 1902&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Thucydides]] and the poet [[Sappho]] are presented as the leading exponents of this style. Demetrius’s treatise did not gain the same success as [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]’s ''[[On the Sublime]]''. Although magnificence and the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] both belong to the grand style, there are significant differences between them. Magnificence insists more on formal correctness and stylistic [[Gravitas|solemnity]]. Whereas the sublime inspires awe, veneration, loss of rationality, ecstasy and [[pathos]], the magnificent aims to impress without causing fear or indignation.&lt;ref&gt;Dirk Schenkeveld,  ''Studies in Demetrius On Style''. Amsterdam: Adolf M. Hakkert: 1964: 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The grand style of magnificence also entered terminological discourse of ancient Greek art criticism. Indeed, the Greeks drew on rhetorical terminology to describe and evaluate sculpture, painting and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome J. Pollitt, ''The Ancient View of Greek Art: Criticism, History and Terminology''. New Haven-London: Yale University Press, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Magnificence is applied to works of art which express grandeur and other lofty features.

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the grand style of magnificence can be appreciated in works such as the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus]] by [[Phidias]] and [[Zeuxis]]’s painting of Zeus enthroned.

===Vitruvius and the magnificence of Roman architecture===
In his monumental ''[[De architectura]]'', [[Vitruvius]] analyzed both the artistic-aesthetic and the philosophical-ethical aspects of the concept and enshrined magnificence in [[classical architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  “Magnificenza e mondo classico.” Agalma 5 (2003): 113-125&lt;/ref&gt; In the sixth book, Vitruvius argues that the client (public or private) is magnificent, because the beauty of a building depends on its cost (6, 8, 9). The materials employed should be of the best quality and the most beautiful, which means that they are usually the most expensive. Thus, for Vitruvius magnificence is not only a typical artistic and aesthetic feature of architecture, but is also connected to the social and political [[Auctoritas|prestige]] of the client. Architecture becomes the means by which a public or private sponsor of a building can display his [[Dignitas (Roman concept)|honour]].

It is no surprise that ancient Romans granted such importance to public architecture: even the ancient historians and geographers celebrated the Romans’ ability to create buildings that were not only useful, but also beautiful and magnificent. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] states that the three greatest examples of magnificent Roman architecture were the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], the [[Roman roads|roads]] and the [[Cloaca Maxima|sewage system]] (''Roman Antiquities'' 3, 67, 5). [[Strabo]] (''[[Geographica]]'', V, 3, 8) and [[Livy]] (''[[Ab urbe condita libri|History of Rome]]'', 1, 38, 5-6; 39; 44) celebrate the hygienic functions of the aqueducts and the ''cloacae''. Pliny the Elder provides a moving description of the engineering skills used to rebuild Rome's great sewage system, the  ''Cloaca Maxima'', which is still in use today (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', 36, 104-105).

==Magnificence in the Middle Ages==

===Thomas Aquinas===
[[Thomas Aquinas]] left one of the most significant [[mediaeval]] interpretations of the concept of magnificence, drawing on the Graeco-Roman tradition and blending it with [[Christian]] precepts. He brings together the pagan idea of human magnificence with the [[Christianity and Judaism|Jewish-Christian]] mentality, according to which mankind should always be reverent towards God.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis 2005: 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa theologiae]]'' magnificence is a virtue that belongs to God, which can also be shared by men (''Summa'', IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1). Aquinas adopts Cicero’s definition of magnificence, highlighting how it consists in doing great things. Magnificence belongs to the virtue of fortitude, or courage, because it regards the undertaking of great things and actions, and persevering even when circumstances can make their realization arduous (''Summa'', IIa IIae q. 134 art. 1-4).

===Dante Alighieri===
[[Dante]], drawing on Aquinas, regards magnificence as a divine virtue connected to God’s grandeur and perfection.  Then, following the traditions of Aristotle and Aquinas, Dante classifies magnificence as the fourth virtue "which regulates great expenditures, in administering them and setting limits to their size" (''[[Convivio]]'' IV, XVII, 5).

==Magnificence in Renaissance Italy==&lt;!--Please note that this heading is used as a link on several pages on  Renaissance-related topics--&gt;

With the advent of the [[Renaissance Italy|Renaissance in Italy]], magnificence underwent a deep transformation, drawing on this cultural movement which supported the rebirth of both classical culture and urban centres. The idea of magnificence and its representation had profound implications for Renaissance society in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]], ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis, 2005 13-23&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnificence as a civic virtue===
Magnificence acquires new vitality within the process of renewal of Italian cities as cultural and political centres. Magnificence thus reflects the transformation of traditional political structures and epitomizes the flourishing of a new type of civic culture based on virtues which diverged from the previous [[feudal]] values. A novel idea of human excellence emerged which was seen as distinct from the medieval aristocratic privileges connected to birth and rank. [[Marsilio Ficino]] in his work ''De virtutibus morabilus'' (1457) claims magnificence is the virtue par excellence, because it expresses God’s greatness. [[Cristoforo Landino]] in ''De vera nobilitate'' (1487) describes magnificence as an aspect of fortitude. The new idea of nobility emphasizes deeds and works realized by men whose behaviour is primarily governed by the cultivation of such virtues, rather than merely by noble blood and aristocratic ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Teresa Liaci, Ed. ''Cristoforo Landino. De vera nobilitate''. Florence: Olschki, 1970: 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnificence and patronage in Renaissance Italy===
By the first half of the 15th century, magnificence had already become a well-known and highly practiced virtue in [[Renaissance]] Italy. It concerned the custom of wealthy citizens spending large sums of money on building projects and to [[patronage]] of architecture and the arts. In Florence, [[Cosimo de' Medici]] (the founder of the [[Medici]] dynasty) was actively involved in practising the virtue of magnificence from the 1430s onwards and many other ruling families and distinguished citizens followed suit all over Italy.&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Fraser Jenkins, “Cosimo de’ Medici’s Patronage of Architecture and the Theory of Magnificence”, ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', 33, 1970: 162-70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Howard,  “Preaching Magnificence in Renaissance Florence.” ''Renaissance Quarterly'' 61.2, (2008): 325-369.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lorenzo de’ Medici]] gained the title “magnificent” due to his support to [[Renaissance humanism|humanist scholars]] and artists, establishing one of the most sophisticated courts in Italy. Magnificence regains its ancient splendour also as an aspect of works of architecture and art. The rediscovery of ancient [[rhetoric]] and the pre-eminence given to [[Vitruvius]] throughout the Renaissance influenced not only patrons’ tastes, but also those of the architects and artists who were commissioned to create magnificent masterpieces that would give fame to the both themselves and the entire town. In the ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'', [[Leon Battista Alberti]] draws on both the philosophical and aesthetic concepts of magnificence. Many Italian Renaissance architects and artists applied magnificence both in their artworks and in their writings. Antonio Averlino, known as [[Filarete]], [[Giorgio Vasari]] and [[Andrea Palladio]] extolled the philosophical and aesthetic aspects of magnificence. Magnificence, however, is not only a practice engaged in by distinguished citizens, princes, popes, architects and artists, but is also analyzed by humanist scholars. In [[Naples]], the humanist and poet [[Giovanni Pontano]] wrote a philosophical and ethical treatise ''De magnificentia'' (1498). Magnificence was connected with the employment of wealth on behalf of the [[Kingdom of Naples|Neapolitan]] kings and aristocracy, and their lifestyles. Pontano’s ''De magnificentia'' and his other philosophical treatises on the use of wealth and the role of the prince probably anticipated the courtier’s ethic and the doctrine of how to behave appropriately, which would find the most mature expression in 16th-century Italian literature thanks to [[Baldassare Castiglione]]’s ''[[Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528) and [[Giovanni Della Casa]]’s ''[[Il Galateo]]'' (1558).

==Magnificence in the eighteenth century==

===Giovanni Battista Piranesi===
During the 18th century Italy had become one of the main destinations of the Grand Tour visitors, who came from Northern Europe to study and admire Italian art and architecture, and also to absorb classical culture. With Giovanni Battista Piranesi (1720-1778), magnificence received one of its final interpretations in the Italian cultural context.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah F. Maclaren]],  ''La magnificenza e il suo doppio. Il pensiero estetico di Giovanni Battista Piranesi''. Milan: Mimesis, 2005: 30-45&lt;/ref&gt; Universally known as the etcher of the ''Prisons'' and the ''Views'' of Roman monuments, Piranesi was an eclectic personality, who pursued a wide range of interests. Giovanni Battista Piranesi had a prominent role within the Graeco-Roman debate. In this controversy Piranesi supported the superiority of the architects and designers of the Roman Empire and demonstrated the indigenous roots of Roman culture, arguing that the Romans had been influenced more by the Etruscans than the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;John Wilton-Ely, The Mind and Art of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In his polemical treatise ''Della Magnificenza ed Architettura de’ Romani'' (''Concerning the Magnificence and Architecture of the Romans'') (1761) Piranesi draws on the entire heritage of the philosophical, ethical, economic and artistic aspects of the notion. He controversially conceives magnificence as a virtue which was shared by the entire ancient Roman population. Furthermore, he argues that the Romans used the most advanced technical and hydraulic skills, and the finest materials available. They excelled in public buildings and proved they were better at them than the Greeks.

This large, mid-19th century [[Morocco|Moroccan]] wall hanging, or ''haiti,'' is a highlight of the textile collection of the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]]. Made in the cultural center of [[Fes|Fez]], it is crafted of the finest materials: [[Velvet#Fibres|silk velvet]] embroidered with [[gold]] metallic thread.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Ellen Wardwell|last2=Robinson|first2=Anne|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=Indianapolis|year=2005|isbn=0936260777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The seven panels of this wall hanging, in alternating crimson and emerald velvet, were sewn not by women, as was typical of Moroccan embroidery, but by professional male needleworkers. That is because this ''haiti'' represents the most prestigious and complicated form of textile. The men were under close supervision by the leatherworkers' guild, since the work was so complex it required custom-made leather templates. They stitched around the templates with a special technique known as [[Couching#Variants|underside couching]] that kept the precious gold thread from being wasted on the unseen underside. The interlaced ''[[mihrab]]'' motif, echoing a [[mosque]]'s arch-shaped niche, makes this wall hanging a magnificent backdrop for special occasions.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

==Historical information==
Artisans in Fez had been creating sumptuous wall hangings like this since the 16th century. Magnificent embroideries of this particular type, with their large size and architectural elements, were reserved for very grand occasions such as the week-long weddings of the very wealthy. They provided a suitable backdrop for the bride in her lavish finery.&lt;ref name=day&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=Holliday T.|title=Indianapolis Museum of Art Collections Handbook|year=1988|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|location=[[Indianapolis]]|isbn=0936260203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location history==
In 2003, the IMA loaned this artwork to the [[National Museum of African Art]] as part of an exhibit entitled "The Fabric of Moroccan Art," which was sponsored by [[Mohammed VI]], king of Morocco. Of the dozens of textiles displayed, this one was lauded as "One of the most important pieces in the exhibition--and in the IMA's entire textile collection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorenz|first=Joyce L.|title=Moroccan Rugs and Textiles|url=http://friendsofmorocco.org/Souk/FabricofMoroccanLife.htm|publisher=Friends of Morocco|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==
This ''haiti'' was donated to the IMA by Eliza M. and Sarah L. Niblack in 1932. It became an official part of the museum's collection in 1983 per Sarah's bequest, and was given the accession number 1983.66.&lt;ref name=ima&gt;{{cite web|title=wall hanging (haiti)|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/collections/artwork/wall-hanging-haiti|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Niblack family had acquired it when Admiral [[Albert Parker Niblack]], Eliza's brother, was stationed in [[Gibraltar]] in 1917. His discerning eye led to a collection of 2,500 Moroccan, European, and [[Indonesia]]n textiles, all of which found their way into the IMA's collection. The family's generosity means the museum holds one of the most important collections of Moroccan textiles in the United States, since most institutions focus on [[Turkey|Turkish]] and [[Persia]]n textiles.&lt;ref name=wt&gt;{{cite journal|title=Moroccan mastery with textiles|journal=[[Washington Times]]|date=18 July 2003|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/jul/18/20030718-082637-2428r/?page=all|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

{{Main|List of Mysticons episodes}}
{{:List of Mysticons episodes}}
===Season One===
In the mystical world of Gemina, in a place called Drake City, four teenage girls are chosen by the all-powerful Dragon Disk to become legendary heroes known as the Mysticons. Arkayna, Emerald, Zarya and Piper undertake an arduous quest to find four spellbooks and [[Totem animals|animal-themed]] bracers of mystical power to form [[Volume (bibliography)|the Codex]]. This will grant them their full strength and abilities necessary to save their world from Dreadbane, who seeks to release Necrafa, the leader of the Spectral Hand and Queen of the Undead. When Necrafa is freed she betrays Dreadbane and throws him into where she was once banished this happens in the 13th episode.


While fulfilling various quests to bring harmony and order to the realm, the Mysticons encounter several trusty allies and devious adversaries. A startling revelation is that Arkayna has a [[Fraternal twin|fraternal twin sister]]. Unfortunately, as their sisterly union would result in the imminent release of the dangerous Spectral Dragon, Nova Terron had been ordered to send the younger princess twin to an alternate dimension on the astral plane. Unable to bring himself to do so, he sent her to a fairy orphanage hidden from mortal eyes.    

The Mysticons succeed in finding a blue-green birth gem in the vault of the Dragon, which is revealed to belong to the mysterious and immensely powerful Astromancer Proxima Starfall, who had stayed at the orphanage until taken in by the Astromancers at a young age. 

It is later revealed that Arkayna's real fraternal twin sister is the second Mysticon Ranger, Zarya Moonwolf. Proxima's blue-green birth gem had been purposefully switched with Zarya's as a cover-up to protect her true identity, thus making Proxima's family history nothing but a complete fabrication. 
Having had a vision, Arkayna and Zarya head to Mount Tryanus to obtain two yellow rings which transform them into the Twin Dragon, enabling them to obliterate both the Spectral Dragon and Necrafa in one single strike; an act that leaves half of her mysterious mask behind.

===Season Two===
With Queen Necrafa and the Spectral Dragon destroyed, Arkayna, Zarya, Emerald and Piper are enjoying their lives. However, they are needed once again to destroy a surviving fragment of Necrafa's mask by tossing it into the fiery core of the Rift of Ruin, a volcanic trench in the depths of the sea. Proxima accompanies them as an Astromancer, but is secretly lonely and bitter; she deceives them into believing that she had destroyed the mask fragment while keeping it to seek vengeance against those who had deceived her about her family history, mistrusted her judgement and underestimated her powerful magical abilities. Meanwhile, Nova Terron and the other Astromancers enlist Malvaron, Doug, and Choko on a special mission to get Tazma out of Necrafa's old lair before they destroy it. To save Tazma they use a shrinking potion and imprison her in a snow-globe which she escapes twice. Though Necrafa's lair and Necrafa herself are destroyed, Tazma still uses the dark magic and knowledge from both in later episodes while reminiscing from time to time. After the lair's destruction it is never seen again so, the, turned evil, Proxima uses Astromancer Academy for her dark magic doings. Proxima turns her former master, Nova Terron, and fellow top-level Astromancers into her mindless, masked minions: Spectromancers. She snatches the Dragon Disk and fully corrupts the ancient and all-powerful artifact with evil magic. After succeeding in creating her very own Dark Codex, she calls upon four female warriors called the Vexicons, from its dark and sinister pages to combat the Mysticons. This leaves her free to achieve the necessary steps for her ultimate revenge on Arkayna, for making her believe that she had a family and was loved in the realm, and for Zarya getting everything she would have had.

Things have escalated further, as Proxima has now been fully possessed by the evil within the half Necrafa's mask; having worn it for so long it had caused its intense dark power to become deeply attached to Proxima and chose her as its rightful host. To help remove the mask off of Proxima who is out cold before the Vexicons arrive at the Stronghold to take the mask, Tazma tells Arkayna a spell that traps the Mysticons inside Proxima's subconscious mind, in which they see Proxima’s memories and learn of her troubled and lonely childhood since leaving Mrs. Sparklebottom's sanctuary, to the point of choosing the dark powers of the mask fragment because of an oblivious Princess Arkayna never being truly there for her as a sister and for breaking her heart so badly. After freeing Proxima of the evil, stronger hold the mask's fragment had on her, Arkayna apologizes for her non sister-like actions and welcomes Proxima back as her honorary twin sister.
Proxima explains all she had learned while under the evil influence of the mask; how the Spectral Hand has tempted and manipulated many over the millennia; such as Necrafa (who was, in fact, a powerful elven sorceress), Captain Kaos, and finally Mallory. With the piece of the  mask having taken over her as it did Proxima, Mallory takes charge and has her three Vexicon sisters help her in releasing the ravenous wrath of the Spectral Hand's beast upon Drake City. Proxima reverses the dark spell on the mindless Spectromancers, turning them all back into top Astromancers- Nova Terron, Gandobi and Quasarla- who fend off the tentacles of the ancient ruins, from which the Spectral Hand is imprisoned. 

Running out options, the Mysticons turn to Dreadbane, as he is the only one who can return Queen Goodfey and King Darius to life. He initially refuses but comes his senses when a human boy he saved asks him his name, to which he says it is "General Bane." He rises to the occasion as an unexpected ally and prevents the bone statues of the queen and king from being destroyed. However, he is gravely wounded when taking a fatal blow for Arkayna, from Mallory's greater snowy blast. He uses the last of his strength, before turning into stardust, to undo the spell he himself had cast to fully restore Princess Arkayna and Zarya's mother and stepfather to living flesh and blood, after being frozen in time for so many months. Arkayna reunites with her mother, and introduces her to Zarya Moonwolf who addresses her as "Mom", to the Queen's confusion. Her brief memories of the newborn Zarya are returned to her by Nova Terron (off-screen) and she provides the blueprints for the four mystical Lances of Justice which were hidden in her necklace for safekeeping. She accompanies her twin daughters (riding Zarya on Archer, much to Arkayna's resentment and envy), Emerald and Piper on their ultimate quest to stop to Vexicons and finally eradicate the Spectral Hand. Zarya finally comes to the realization that the Spectral Hand does have a great weakness: the Dragons of Light.
They all go to the sacred realm of Dragonhenge and see King Valmuk and his baby daughter Stormy again. They see the hidden, remaining yellow dragon eggs. King Valmuk explains that by only being given a boost from the ancient time magic of the Ever Realm can dragons be strong enough by reaching full adulthood more quickly. This plan works but, the Vexicons trap the Mysticons before they can strike the demon of the Spectral Hand. Em &amp; the others beg for the help of Eartha, who they saved from crumbling in the episode, "Heart Of Stone." Eartha frees the Mysticons before the other Vexicons banish the girls and she destroys Mallory's hair making the Ice Witch lose all confidence and surrender (Unseen). The Mysticons ride the dragons to the Spectral Hand demon and use their enhanced bracers, powered by lancers, to strike the Spectral Hand demon thus, sending it into oblivion and returning peace to the land forever. Some loose ends are also tied up such as, the Vexicons are imprisoned (possibly in the Necrafa prison dimension). Eartha remains unpunished for helping the Mysticons restore peace to all of Gemina. Nova Terron steps down as leader of the Astromancers and announces Proxima, his second-in-command, as the new leader/Star Mistress of the  Academy, as he leaves on adventures across the astral plane with his longtime girlfriend/starmate Geraldine Yaga. The mask's remains are thrown into the Rift of Ruin and destroyed forever.

==Characters==

===Mysticons===
The Mysticons are four teenage girls whose destiny it is to use unique mystical powers and weaponry to defend the world of Gemina and its inhabitants from evil forces, namely the Spectral Hand. A generation of Mysticons is chosen once every thousand years by the ancient and powerful Dragon Disk. Their unique Mysticon abilities and weaponry become a hundred times greater and more effective when [[Volume (bibliography)|the Codex]] is combined into one larger spellbook, which happened to have been drained dry of its magic by Queen Necrafa herself. The second generation of legendary Mysticons are:
* Arkayna Goodfey (voiced by [[Alyson Court]]) – The Crown Princess of Gemina and Mysticon Dragon Mage who is the fearless leader. Her signature color is [[shades of green|dark green]] and her symbol of mystical power is the [[European dragon|dragon]]. Her Mysticon weapon is a staff that emits powerful green fire and can erect a protective shield or create weapons. Her [[griffin]] companion is named Izzie. She initially disliked learning of the original four Mysticons from her mother, the Queen. She demonstrated telekinetic skill by mentally levitating a construction and converting it into a ramp; her eyes glow white while utilizing this ability. She eventually learns that she has a [[Fraternal twin|fraternal twin sister]] who was believed to be Proxima Starfall, one of the top Astromancers' strongest star mages. Later it is revealed that Zarya is her ''true'' twin sister, though they both welcome Proxima into "the sisterhood" as their honorary twin. Her romantic interest is the talented mid-level Astromancer, Malvaron Grimm. She grew up playing with the royal griffins and relies on her honor, determination and ideals to always do the right thing. However, she is mostly oblivious to the feelings of others; such as Proxima's deeply hurt feelings of betrayal and abandonment towards her for never actually being there for her after Arkayna realized that Zarya was her real twin sister.
* Zarya "Z-Star" Moonwolf (voiced by Nicki Burke) – Chosen as the second Mysticon Ranger, Zarya is an "orphaned pauper" who does her best to help other poor kids on the street, often acting as a big sister to them and Piper. She is wily and tough with a roguish charm. Her signature color is [[shades of blue|dark blue]] and her symbol of mystical power is the [[Gray wolf|wolf]]. Her weapon is a shortbow from which she fires an array of mystical arrows. She is known as "the muscle" of the group. She first named her griffin "Stinky" because of his breath, but later renamed him "Archer". She is expelled from the team in "Scourge of the Seven Skies" and heads off alone. Her bracer and large blue book of Codex spells falls into the possession of Dreadbane who corrupts her Wolf Bracer. She eventually succeeds in getting them back. She temporarily replaces Arkayna as leader but refuses to take the position permanently. It is revealed that she had been the lost youngest twin princess and Arkayna's fraternal twin sister, having been left at Hortensia Sparklebottom's fairy orphanage for the first three years of her life, where Proxima was left at also.

* Piper Willowbrook (voiced by Ana Sani) – An elf orphan who, along with Zarya, works to help fellow poor people in Drake City. She is Mysticon Striker. She is optimistic, energetic and fun-loving. Her signature colors are shades of yellow and blue and her symbol of mystical power is the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]. Her weapons are three yellow [[chakram]]s that act as boomerangs strong to render enemies unconscious from a distance. In addition, she can create sparkly yellow orbs which she calls her "pixie blast". Her griffin companion is named Miss Paisley, after a lost toy. She is known as "the party bringer" of the team. It is revealed that her name was given to her by Zarya when they first met as kids. Her full birth name is Pyperia Ashryn Elvanestri. Despite her youthful looks, she is revealed to be 110. She loves music and acrobatics and is a natural performer.
* Emerald "Em" Zirconia Goldenbraid (voiced by Evany Rosen) – A teenage dwarf who originally worked as the royal family's griffin wrangler and is the new Mysticon Knight. She is smart, empathetic, innovative, and can engineer just about anything. Her signature color is [[Shades of purple|purple]] and, at times, [[Shades of pink|pink]]; her symbol of mystical power is the pink [[unicorn]], which is the same color as the dark Basilisk Bracer belonging to her "dark" Vexicon counterpart Eartha. She can erect a pink orbicular shield around her and her fellow Mysticons. Her griffin companion is named Topaz. She is known to be "the heart" of the team. In addition to her mystic sword, she can use her dwarven gadgets to disable machinery from a distance or to seek out her fellow Mysticons if separated. She is given a legendary Silver Trident by Queen Truefin, as a gift for her bravery. Her romantic interest is the hunky Kasey Boon of the Pink Skulls sky pirates.

===Vexicons===
Four, dark female warriors called from the pages of Proxima's Dark Codex. They debut as shadowed cameos at the end of "Happily Never After", but make their full debut in "The Lost Scepter" where they race the Mysticons to find an ancient and immensely powerful mind-controlling scepter that belonged to one of Gemina's centuries-old king. They are considered the dark counterparts of the Mysticons. They each have their own dark [[Totem animals|animal bracer]], to combat those of light wielded by the Mysticons''':'''
*Mallory{{snd}}The leader and Arkayna's evil counterpart. She has light blue skin, ice-white spiked hair and a blue staff with a jagged dark blue crystal which emits strong beams of icy, snowy energy. She also has an animal sidekick named Deeva, a pale aqua blue fox-like creature (Choko's evil counterpart) that she wears around her neck like a muffler. Her bracer is a serpent/snake, which she attacks with by calling out ''"Ice Serpent, Strike!"''; the same color as Zarya's [[Shades of blue|blue]] Wolf Bracer. She is the most rebellious of all four Vexicons, even attempting to overthrow her own creator and "mother." She succeeds but is completely possessed by the mask fragment of the Spectral Hand itself, just like Proxima was.
*Kasha&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;A orange cat-humanoid and Zarya's evil counterpart. She can emit three blasts of red energy from her claws. Her animal bracer is an orange [[Black panther|panther]]. She also has skates that enable her to levitate in midair at high speeds. Her animal bracer is a bright orange [[Panthera|panther]], from which her attack phrase is ''"Shadow Panther, Pounce."'' 
*Eartha&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;Large and muscular, and is Em's evil counterpart.  Her body is made of solid stone and she can turn into a huge boulder-like ball of rock to carry the other three inside. Her animal bracer is pink [[basilisk]], from which she calls out ''"Basilisk, Stampede!"'' as her attack phrase; same pink color as Emerald's Unicorn bracer. Her weapon is a large hammer, from which she can project a strong blast of pink energy. Out of all four Vexicons, she is the most polite and somewhat kinder. 
*Willa{{snd}}An [[Imp|imp]] with small, purple bat wings, and is Piper's evil counterpart. She has purple skin and can fire purple beams of energy from her hands. She can also teleport over short or long distances in a flash of purple smoke, namely by stating the phrase "Quicker than a flicker." Her purple [[Totem animals|animal]] bracer is a [[bat]]; her attack phrase is ''"Fear the Nightmare"''. Her additional special ability is "Boom Doom" similar to Piper's "Pixie Blast" attack.

===Companions and sidekicks===
*Choko – A fuzzy, white mole-like creature with pale pink ears who is Zarya's longtime friend and sidekick. He occasionally assists the Mysticons in some battles. He is quite adapt at recognizing ancient [[Runes|runes]] and mystic symbols of high magics.
*Izzie – Arkayna's loyal griffin friend since childhood. She is adorned in a dark green saddle and helmet that protect her enhanced eyesight from spiked attacks.
*Topaz – Emerald's faithful griffin mount. She is adorned in a purple blanket and helmet. 
*Miss Paisley – Piper's griffin mount. She is adorned in a bright orange blanket. It is revealed that the name came from a stuffed griffin Piper had had as a child.
*Archer – Zarya's griffin mount whom she initially named "Stinky" because of his breath. She later named him Archer; likely due to her being capable of shooting mystical lightning-like arrows from her Mysticon Ranger short-bow.
*Deeva- A pale aqua fox that is the evil counterpart of Choko, who came from Proxima's Dark Codex. She has purple eyes and a strong tail that she uses to push objects away in one swish. She appears as a muffler on Mallory's neck.

===Arkayna and Zarya's family===
* Queen Goodfey (voiced by [[Linda Kash]]) – Arkayna's mother and queen of Gemina. She presents the Mysticons with griffin companions during their flight training. She is turned to solid stone by Dreadbane's evil magic, and her absence prompted her arrogant and selfish stepson Gawayne to declare himself monarch in her place. She is temporarily revived, astonished at her daughter as the Dragon Mage, and assures Arkayna to be confident before reverting to stone. Her stone body falls into the depths of the sea and is given to a kraken as tribute by Queen Truefin; the Mysticons explain the situation and lift Goodfey's statue to the surface. It is later revealed that Goodfey has another daughter with purple hair and green eyes who grew up to be known as Zarya Moonwolf. She is finally fully restored to living flesh and blood at the end of "Fear the Spectral Hand" by Dreadbane himself. She is introduced to Zarya, having regained the brief memories of her youngest twin daughter by Nova Terron, and reluctantly gives her daughters and their fellow Mysticons the plans to greatly strengthening their animal bracers temporarily. After the Spectral Hand is fully destroyed from the plane of existence, she is then introduced to Proxima, the orphan who was thought to be the daughter she never knew she had, whom she accepts as her "third twin daughter." Like her second husband and stepson, she will make appearances in the ''Mystions'' comics and chapter books as a supporting character with more speaking roles.
* King Darius (voiced by [[Patrick McKenna]]) – Queen Goodfey's second husband and king consort, Gawayne's father, and stepfather to the princess twins Arkayna and Zarya. He is turned to solid stone by Dreadbane in the very first episode. He is almost restored to living flesh by the combined mystical power of his stepdaughter and Malvaron, but ends up falling into the depths of the sea, where the Mer-Knights used him as tribute to a kraken. He was later brought to the surface and put in the palace throne room alongside his petrified wife. His bone form is finally revived at the end of Episode Thirty-Nine. He is to make appearances as a supporting character in the comics and chapter books.
* Gawayne (voiced by [[David Berni]]) – Arkayna and Zarya's selfish and spoiled stepbrother and the source of their frustrations. He is initially unaware of the Mysticons' true identities. After his parents are turned to stone he is crowned king of Gemina (dubbing himself "Gawayne the Great"), but was abducted and used to extort the Mysticons into handing over the Dragon Disk. In another episode he chooses his own safety over his people. At one point he obtains the orange and blue gems of Queen Necrafa. He gives the blue one to his pixie girlfriend, Lateensia, who dumps him afterward because of his selfishness, leaving him crushed. He tearfully attempts to persuade her to take him back, claiming that he will try to change. He writes letters to the bone statue of his father in secretly, admitting that he would trade being king to have him back.

===Zarya's adopted family===
*Mr and Mrs. Moonwolf- As she was raised during her early girlhood in Mrs. Sparklebottom's fairy orphanage, Zarya is said to have been taken in by the Moonwolfs who had raised her as their own daughter for several years, in a distant village outside Drake City. At the age of 12 she was abducted and forced to become a sky-pirate by the ruthless Captain Kaos. What became of her adoptive parents is unknown, though it is implied that they had died of unknown circumstances, as Zarya admitted that she misses her parents dearly. The only memento of her mom is a gold pendent set with a [[Shades of green|forest-green]] gemstone. Their first names have not yet been revealed, though their last name Zarya naturally took as her own.

===Emerald Goldenbraid's family===
*Citrine Goldenbraid – Emerald's optimistic and overexcited mother who lives in a cottage in the town of Rudix Hollow. One of her family recipes is a soup that Zarya dislikes. She gives Arkayna a hope ring that will give her strength in fulfilling her quest to stop Dreadbane. She believes that Emerald works in the castle as a griffin wrangler. She later pays her daughter a surprise visit for some quality mother-daughter time, and learns the truth about Em's Mysticon identity. She makes her Season Three appearances in "Total Eclipse of the Golden Heart," "Heart of Stone", "Fear the Spectral Hand" and "Age of Dragons". 
*Malachite Goldenbraid – Emerald's grumpy and cold father with whom she was very close as a child, calling her "Poo Twinkle" much to her chagrin. He is a dwarf engineer with a workshop in the cottage basement. He disapproved of his daughter's working at the castle, but admits that he had always been proud of her. He is the only one who knows of her identity as the second Mysticon Knight. He returns in "Heart of Stone" and "Age of Dragons." In the graphic novels and original chapter books, she will appear as a supporting character.
*Halite and Ferrus Goldenbraid – Emerald's younger brothers who enjoy goofing off and embarrassing their older sister. They both have a crush on Piper and her cheery quirks. Halite has inherited his mother's hair while Ferrus has his father's hair color. They make their second appearance in Episode 35 "Heart of Stone."

===Astromancers===
The Astromancers are an ancient league of [[Mage (fantasy)|mages]] ([[Sorcerer (paranormal)|sorcerers]] and [[Sorceress (fantasy)|sorceresses]]) who have protected Gemina. They reside at the Astromancer Academy. Those of the top level have a deep purple magical aura while mid-level Astromancers have a light orange magical aura.
====Top-level====
* Nova Terron (voiced by [[Dan Lett]]) – Holding the top rank of Star Master, he is a stern and bearded leader with a high-pitched voice. He sees the new Mysticons as failures whose incompetence will bring about the apocalypse, especially when they defy his order to destroy the complete Codex. He had been ordered by his master, Alpha Galiga, to separate the twin princesses, Arkayna and Zarya, as newborns. He came to enjoy playing the video game ''Avatars of the Apocalypse''.
*Quasarla{{snd}}A female Astromancer who had fought alongside the original Mysticons during their battle against Queen Necrafa. She was eventually overpowered and turned into a mindless, masked Spectromancer by her fellow Astromancer colleague Proxima.
* Tazma Grimm (voiced by Michelle Monteith) – Malvaron's older sister who favors training over natural talent and is chosen to train the Mysticons. She later betrays them and the Astromancers to obtain power for herself. She was the Shadow Mage who had forced Zarya and Piper to steal the Dragon Disk in exchange for Choko in the first episode. She later seems to have second thoughts about Dreadbane's leadership, calling him weak and incompetent. Tazma partners with Kymraw to claim the complete Codex from the Mysticons but is betrayed; she is horrified when Dreadbane uses it to release Queen Necrafa. She informs Necrafa of the new Mysticons and joins her for vengeance. Tazma is saved from being destroyed with the lair of the Spectral Hand and imprisoned in a snow-globe for her crimes. She was eventually freed by her reluctant younger brother and took the chance to escape by teleporting away in a flash of shadowy smoke. She is still at large in the realm.
*Proxima Starfall (voiced by [[Stacey DePass]]) – A short orphan with red glasses, a black [[Bob haircut|bob-cut]] hairstyle, and pale tan skin. Her innate magical strength is exceptional and she has more experience in high-star technology than most top-level Astromancers. She offers to use her magic to locate the Mysticons per Nova Terron's orders. She later demands that they be "brought to justice" in retaliation for Emerald giving her a star-shaped scar on her right cheek. She had always felt like she was missing an essential part of herself, which seems to be explained when she was believed to be the lost princess of Gemina and Arkayna's fraternal twin. However, she was merely a decoy to protect the real twin princess, Zarya. To gain revenge on the Mysticons for making her believe that she was loved and wanted in the realm, she secretly kept the sinister fragment of Queen Necrafa's evil mask, allowing its dark power to consume her soul. She then corrupts the Dragon Disk, and creates her very own Dark Codex ,from which she calls forth the Vexicons. While the Vexicons distract the Mysticons, Proxima continues her plot to achieve her full revenge on the oblivious Arkayna for not being there for her and choosing to abandon her, ever since she discovered that Zarya was her true twin sister. She eventually came to regret allowing the dark power within the mask fragment to consume her and intends to toss it back into the Rift of Ruin. Unfortunately for her, it has long since been attached to her intensely bitter feelings of loneliness, hatred and betrayal and has now taken full control of her troubled mind and body in full measure. Her tormented mind is later intruded by the Mysticons, with the help of Tazma, in an attempt to break the stronger hold Necrafa's mask now has upon her by finding the "Free Psyche" spell. She makes amends by revealing what she has learned about the Spectral Hand itself, and reverses the spell she cast on the Astromancers. In the end, she is given the untainted, gold Dragon Disk and still-powerless Codex by Nova Terron, who resigns as leader of the Astromancers to stay with his longtime starmate Geraldine by going off on inter-dimensional adventures with her, and gives the topmost position of "Star Mistress" to the teenage orphan. He does this by presenting her with the Codex and the untainted, golden Dragon Disk, despite the fact that both are drained dry of their ancient magic.

====Mid-level====
* Malvaron Grimm (voiced by Devon Mack/Mac Heywood) – A young, talented male mid-level Astromancer who is stationed in the palace. He becomes the Mysticons' new instructor in mystical abilities. He has romantic feelings for Arkayna, which are expressed somewhat when he admitted that he was scared that he might lose her. Unlike top-level Astromancers, his exceptionally powerful innate magical aura is colored light orange; the same as his aunt Geraldine Yaga. He is the [[Love interest|love interest]] and starmate of Princess Arkayna.

====Low-level====
* Douglaphius "Doug" Hadderstorm (voiced by Doug Hadders) – A large cyclops Astromancer and friend of Malvaron. He becomes Malvaron's assistant in training the new Mysticons. He has an obsession with a tiny child's collectible called "Twinkly Mare" and "Twinkly Dragon". Even though he is in the Order of the Astromancers, he seems to possess no magical abilities whatsoever, which he himself officially confirms in ''The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon'' chapter book of not having any "flashy powers."

===Spectral Hand===
* Queen Necrafa (voiced by [[Valerie Buhagiar]]) – Leader and witch queen of the sinister Spectral Hand who was defeated by the original Mysticons a thousand years ago. Dreadbane intends to resurrect her with the Dragon Disk, though it is later implied she is imprisoned in another dimension which Dreadbane intends to breach. Once she is released, she double-crosses her devoted general by hurling him into the dark world where she was trapped. She similarly uses the Codex, draining its magic to rejuvenate herself and amplify her power, before hurling it through the gateway. Necrafa doubts Tazma's word that there are new Mysticons, and regards them as mere children when she confronts them in Drake City. Necrafa joins with the Spectral Dragon but is destroyed by Arkayna and Zarya who bonded together and turned into twin dragons. However, a fragment of the skeletal mask she wore is left behind. It is revealed that she was originally a powerful elf, highly gifted in ancient elf magics, whose entire being was fully consumed by the mask of the Spectral Hand, turning her into undead lich-queen of pure evilness. This implies that she is/was distantly related to Piper.
* General Dreadbane (voiced by Mac Heywood/Devon Mack) – The undead leader of the skeleton army who loves Necrafa and seeks to steal the Dragon Disk to resurrect her. He eventually succeeds but she rejects his feelings and hurls him into her former prison, an inter-dimensional world of darkness. He is discovered there by Tazma and the Mysticons who came searching for the Codex. Having [[Amnesia|lost his memory]] he calls himself "Reginald" and had built a flower garden as an expression of his unrequited love. In a bizarre turn of events, he attacks Tazma, warning that Necrafa will betray her. He later uses Zarya's mystical bowstring  to return to his lair. He takes the yellow mystic rings to give to Necrafa, but comes to see that she used him; He throws the rings down and he leaves. He returns in "Fear the Spectral Hand" in which he was revealed to have a mighty Sky Lancer who defended the realm bravely until he was tainted by the evil forces of the Spectral Hand; thus becoming the undead skeleton Dreadbane. In an act of self-sacrifice he reverses the spell of petrification on the King and Queen, and makes Arkayna promise to defend the city he loves before expiring into the stars.
* Skeleton/Spectral Army – Hundreds of undead skeletons who work for Queen Necrafa and Dreadbane. Once Necrafa is released, she uses her magnified powers to give them "a makeover" by turning them into hooded spectral-like creatures. They were ultimately destroyed by the Twin Dragons, Arkayna and Zarya. 
* Spectromancers – As of "Happily Never After", dozens of top-level Astromancers (including Nova Terron, Gandobi, and Quasarla) were all quickly overpowered by Proxima and turned into her masked, mindless minions. Proxima proclaimed herself the new leader and Queen of the Spectral Hand; her very first command was for them to kneel before her as she corrupted the Dragon Disk. She then had them utilize the ancient starfire ink she had stolen for her to effectively create her very own Dark Codex. After Proxima was released from the mask's darker hold, she reversed the spell which turned them back into Astromancers.

===Pink Skulls===
A group of [[Air pirate|sky pirates]] who plunder and pillage whatever they find. They were founded several years ago when Zarya was a young orphan girl in Drake City. 
*Kitty Boon – Captain of the Pink Skulls and Zarya's childhood friend. She takes advantage of this relationship to incapacitate the Mysticons and obtain the Dragon Disk, which she sells to Dreadbane. She later fights alongside the Mysticons, and on a third occasion gives Zarya inspiration to thwart Necrafa's plans. She is later revealed to be Zarya's romantic love interest.
*Kasey Boon – Kitty's younger brother who Emerald developed a [[Crush (emotion)|crush]] on. He gave her a bracelet which was revealed to be a tracking device to follow the Mysticons. He later appears to have second thoughts about taking advantage of Em's feelings for him, and catches her.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}

===Mer-Knights of the Silver Trident===
Fierce and brave mermaid/mermen warriors who possess the ancient and very powerful silver tridents of myth. According to Emerald, children's tales of them have been famous for many, many years''':'''
*Kelpie Truefin – A young and tough mermaid warrior and daughter of Queen Truefin who crosses paths with the Mysticons during their search of the ocean depths, for the bone statues of Princess Arkayna's mother and stepfather. Distrusting them, she zaps Zarya and Arkayna with her silver trident and accuses them of trespassing. She makes a second appearance in "The Mask" along with her mother.
*Queen Truefin – Queen of the Mer-Knights of the Silver Trident, who has the statues of Goodfey and Darius in her possession, with the intent of sacrificing them to a vicious kraken. She initially mistrusts the Mysticons, but works alongside them to stop the kraken. She apologizes for her actions by giving Emerald one of her silver tridents.

===Dragons of Light===
Millennium ago, the ancient and mighty Dragons of Light had fought a fiercely violent final battle in their sacred homeland of Dragonhenge. Unfortunately, thousands had fallen and were thought to be extinct at the hand of one of the Spectral Dragons. Until a dragon egg was discovered by the second generation of Mysticons, which hatched an infant storm dragon whom Arkayna decided to christen "Stormy."
*King Valmuk- The king of Dragonhenge and the majestic, mighty ruler of the Dragons of Light. He had mysteriously disappeared, never to be seen or heard from again for the next thousand years. His renowned wife and queen Auratha had tragically perished alongside most of their fellow dragons. It is revealed that he had been living among the citizens of the modern world as a panhandler called "Snor-y Dude" by the Mysticons, due him always snoring and begging for a gold coin. In "The Edge of Two Morrows", it was he who had sent Piper into an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]], so she could learn to embrace her destiny as a Mysticon. He revealed his true form to the Mysticons, in "The Last Dragon" so he could take Stormy home and unite her with their family who have been hidden in a secret location at Dragonhenge, a cavern full of dragon eggs. He makes a second and final appearance in "Age of Dragons", as the Mysticons require his wisdom and ancient power in putting an end to the Spectral Hand once and for all.
*Stormy- An infant storm dragon who had been found by the second generation of legendary Mysticons, in the sewers of Drake City. Due to her weather-controlling abilities, Arkayna christened her "Stormy" and vowed to keep her safe, as she was the last of her kind. When King Valmuk revealed himself, he and Stormy flew off to Dragonhenge, where he used his ancient dragon fire to reveal a hidden cavern, in which were dozens of surviving golden dragon eggs.  
*Dragon Mounts- Four of the dozens of baby dragons that had resided in the yellow eggs, hidden secretly in a cave of Dragonhenge and had escaped total death and annihilation by the original Spectral Dragon. After going through the swirling portal to the Ever Realm, the four returned as full-fledged Dragons of Light instantaneously. Each one is colored in the Mysticons' signature color''':'''
**Light green for Princess Arkayna
**Light blue for Zarya
**Light orange for Piper
**Light purple for Emerald
They seem to have replaced the everlasting faithful griffin mounts- Izzie, Archer, Miss Paisley and Topaz- as the Mysticons are seen on the dragons backs in the last scene of the show.

===Supporting characters===
* Neeko (voiced by [[Cory Doran]]) – A homeless orphan with short pink hair. He is given a bag of food that Zarya and Piper stole. Zarya always tells him to "keep the magic real", implying that he may possess inherent magical abilities. He is surprised to learn that Zarya was a Mysticon the whole time in "Game of Phones."
* Serena Snake Charmer (voiced by [[Julie Lemieux]]) – A [[gorgon]] reporter who has wiggly blonde hair of live snakes, one of which is named Serena. She dons sunglasses during her big reports. She reported live on the coronation of Gwayne "the Great", and got a closer look at Arkayna gate-crashing the party as the Dragon Mage. Her last appearance was in "The Foz Who Saved Lotus Night" when she was turned full zombie. 
*Kymraw – A gruff female troll who leads a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]] and speaks in the [[Illeism|third person]]. She aided in the abduction of recently crowned King Gwayne. She swore vengeance on the Mysticons, and attempts to take it on later occasions. She gave Dreadbane information on the Codex when she overheard Piper's boasting. She betrays Tazma and hands over the completed Codex to Dreadbane for two gold-filled treasure chests, stating that "double-cross means double pay." She is eventually hypnotized by Tazma into doing her biding as payment for this double-cross.
*Barnabas Dinklelot – A troll who is a security guard at the mall where the second Codex spellbook was found by Piper. He also likes Twinkly Mare and gave one to Doug as a token of their adventure together. He later shows holographic stories of the leader of the original Mysticons, Imani Firewing, and her final battle against Necrafa. In Season 2, he narrates the heroic tale "The Foz Who Saved Lotus Night" to several foz. 
*Imani Firewing{{snd}}One thousand years ago, she was chosen as the first Dragon Mage and leader of the original Mysticons, who had perished defending the realm of Gemina from Queen Necrafa. First appearing in a flashback in "The Astromancer Job", she was the last of her generation of Mysticons standing against Dreadbane in the wasteland of Victory Heights; she defeated Necrafa by unleashing the powers of her mystical "Bracer of the Heavens", imprisoning Necrafa in a far-off world, but this caused Imani to lose her own life. A statue of her is in the royal treasury and on the Hill of Heroes alongside her fellow Mysticons. In "The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon" novel, it is revealed that she was deeply afraid of foz.
*Geraldine Yaga Grimm (voiced by Lili Franks) – Is a powerful top-level Astromancer, and Malvaron and Tazma Grimm's aunt. She is an astral traveler who hops from dimension to dimension but seeks refuge in Centaur Park once a year. According to her nephew, she is a minor demigoddess who is eccentric and loves cake. She is deceived by Tazma, who claims that Zarya and Emerald had stolen her magical artifacts and spellbooks. After Geraldine is overpowered by Emerald releasing her Unicorn Bracer's mystical power, she sends Tazma away for a "time out" and cures Zarya of a life-draining spell. She then heads off for the magical kingdom of Arizona. Besides being [[Telepathy|telepathic]], it is implied that she can [[Precognition|foresee the future]]. She eventually is tasked with being the guardian and caretaker of Proxima, to keep her safe from Tazma and Queen Necrafa, by welcoming the long-lost Princess of Gemina to stay with her in the dimension of [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].
*Captain Kaos (voiced by Jamie Waston) – A large parrot-like creature who is captain of a pirate crew; he had attacked the village where Zarya and Kitty lived as young children. In retaliation for later marooning him on a desert island, he returns and abducts Kasey to lure Zarya and Kitty into a trap. He hypnotizes them into following him to the island's ancient ruins, where a malevolent force seeks to devour their souls. However, Zarya utilizes her Wolf Bracer to push him down into the ruins which devours his entire being.
*Hortensia Q. Sparklebottom – The overprotective matron of the orphanage where Proxima was raised. She dotes on children and is determined to keep them safe from harm. She had deliberately planted the evidence of Proxima being Arkayna's long-lost twin sister by placing her blue-green birth gem in the vault of the dragon, to protect Zarya's true identity. She is shown to have done this many years ago, at the time when Nova Terron had came to give the younger princess twin a foz balloon for her starday. It was then that Hortensia had switched the toddler Zarya with toddler Proxima, who happened to be right next to the true royal twin at the time.
*Lance O'Lovely – A [[gnome]] who was once a popular singer of the boy band Gnomes to Men which played at Gawayne's coronation. He is a celebrity idolized by Emerald, Piper and Doug. According to Emerald, he sang his way from the streets to fame and fortune. However, he is revealed to be a fraud who used a magic microphone to rob former-bandmate Vesper of her talent.
*Vesper – A [[banshee]] who headed the band Vesper and the Phantoms, but backup singer Lance O'Lovely robbed her of her magical singing voice, leaving her with only her ground-shattering, ultrasonic screams and deafening subsonic screeches. She returned to reclaim her [[Siren Song|magical voice]] and become a celebrity singer.
*Mr. Snellson- The male snail and librarian of the mythical Library of the Eternal Equinox. He is the powerful enforcer who enforces the rules of the library. Debuting in "Happily Never After", he is unable to help the Mysticons prevent Proxima from stealing ancient starfire ink.

== Series elements ==

===Magical artifacts===
*The Dragon Disk – A supremely powerful artifact which is sentient and has a will of its own. It had belonged to the original Mysticons and became dormant after their sacrifice to stop Queen Necrafa. Every few centuries it chooses four new Mysticons to defend Gemina. It falls into the hands of Dreadbane who wished to use it to revive Necrafa. The Mysticons make an exact duplicate of the Disk from four items gathered across the realm. Kitty later manages to retrieve it and gives to Zarya to make amends for her actions. It became one with the completed Codex by affixing itself to its dark green cover, but was later torn off by Tazma and presented to Necrafa, who revealed the prophecy predicting imminent doom for the realm. It was recovered and presented to Nova Terron by Malvaron but was taken and corrupted by a vengeful Proxima, turning it from a [[Shades of yellow|golden-yellow]] to a deep [[Shades of red|blood-red]]. It is then affixed to Proxima's Dark Codex, which further increases its already powerful dark magic to significant levels. 
*The Codex – An ancient and powerful [[Volume (bibliography)|tome]] that is the main source of the Mysticons' strength and abilities. It was split into four separate books of spells, along with mystic bracers, and scattered across Gemina for safekeeping. Once found, each Mysticon has her own book of spells and bracer that contains the symbol of the dragon, the phoenix, the wolf and the unicorn. When all four spellbooks are combined, it amplifies their mystical abilities a hundred times. After it is used to release Necrafa from her prison, she commands it to fill her with its immense power, rejuvenating her and magnifying her dark powers. Necrafa then disposed of the Codex in the dark realm where she had been trapped. The Mysticons eventually recover it with the unexpected aid of Dreadbane. Unfortunately, it has been completely drained of all of its magic since Queen Necrafa had commanded it to "fill her with its power" upon her release in Episode Thirteen.
In addition to its four spellbooks, each Mysticon dons a jeweled [[bracer]] that represents their own [[totem animals|animal]] which can also be used underwater:  
*Dragon Bracer – Arkayna's bright green bracer unleashes a roaring green [[European dragon|dragon]] that can carry others and cause intense damage to its target. Its attack phrase is ''"Unleash the Dragon!"'', though at times it is ''"Release the Dragon!"'' It is the most used. 
*Phoenix Bracer– Piper's bracer which can unleash intense fiery power, just like Arkayna's mystical Dragon bracer. Its attack phrase is ''"Fly, Phoenix, Fly!"''
*Wolf Bracer– Zarya's light blue-colored mystical bracer that was once corrupted in the possession of Dreadbane. It was the last to be recovered by the Mysticons, but the third to be found. Unlike the other three, Zarya does not call out the animal it represents; its attack phrase being ''"Time to Howl!"'' It is colored a light blue, the same color as Mallory's Snake Bracer.
*Unicorn Bracer – Emerald's bright pink bracer which has healing powers. Its attack phrase is ''"Battle Unicorn, Charge!"'' Emerald had gained it in "A Walk in the Park." It is the same pink color as Eartha's Basilisk bracer.

===Other magical objects===
*Queen Necrafa's Necklace – Necrafa used this as protection against the animal bracers mystic abilities of the original four Mysticons. When she was defeated, its four gems were scattered. It was found by Dreadbane who was transformed into a skeletal figure when he touched it. It is destroyed in "The Dragon's Rage" along with its wearer. 
*The Mask of the Spectral Hand- A sinister-looking object that Necrafa (who was, in fact, originally a very powerful elven sorceress) donned, covering her mouth completely. She switches to her second face to emit an exceptionally powerful burst of red energy which acts as a hypersonic shriek. However, it appears to possess evil magic of its own, as a fragment of the mask was capable of taking possession of Kelpie and Queen Truefin's minds. This fragment appears to have fed on Proxima's feelings of loneliness and hatred, and she willingly hid it from the Mysticons. She now wears its fragment on the left side of her face, proclaiming herself the new leader of the Spectral Hand, allowing its dark power to feed off her bitter feelings of loneliness, abandonment and betrayal. As a result, it has become strongly attracted to Proxima, to the point of making her desire to wipe out the entire realm of Gemina in the process of revenge on Arkayna, and to point of taking full possession of her body and mind. However, Mallory still coveted it and its dark untold power. Unfortunately for her, it also took hold of her mind and body as it had for Proxima.
*The Dark Codex- After snatching and corrupting the ancient, all-powerful Dragon Disk, from bright gold to blood-red, a thoroughly vengeful and heartbroken Proxima had her mindless Spectromancers use ancient starfire ink to effectively create her very own Codex book of [[Black magic|dark spells]]. Once she affixed the tainted Dragon Disk to it, she used her darker, and far more powerful star magic to call upon the Vexicons; four female warriors to combat the Mysticons. it also contains steps to finding special ingredients to creating certain objects of powerful evil magic; such as wave resonators. What became of the Dark Codex remains unknown, as no further display of its evil magics have been revealed by Proxima, and that the Dragon Disk had been eventually removed from its gray cover (off-screen).

===Magical weaponry===
These are the four immensely powerful magic-infused weaponry belonging to the Mysticons, four legendary heroes who defend the realm of Gemina and its people from any evil. They were created by the ancient, all-powerful Dragon Disk which had chosen the original Mysticons a millennia ago. They are used constantly rather than the special power each Mysticon possesses: 
*Dragon Mage Staff – The weapon of the Dragon Mage, signifying her as leader of the team. It has a light green glass orb in its center which emits strong and blazing green-colored flames. It can convert this fiery energy into other shapes, such as a net, a shield or rope. 
*Ranger Bow and Arrow – Weapon of the Mysticon Ranger, which fires a lightning-like arrow. It can also be converted into a rope or even a net to retain targets from a short distance. On some occasions, Zarya fired two lightning arrows at once.
*Striker Energy Hoops – Three golden [[chakram]]s that act as boomerangs when thrown and can knock out multiple enemies from a distance. They can also expand to be used as a grappling hook or rope.
*Knight Star Sword – Weapon of Mysticon Knight, which can generate a powerful wave of pink mystical energy to cut through solid objects. In ''The Secret of the Fifth Mysticon'' chapter book, the unnamed Mysticon Knight (who was a male dwarf) had wielded a purple-and-pink broadsword. 
*Knight Energy Shield- A pink/magenta-colored energy shield wielded by Emerald, with which she defends herself and her friends by altering it into various shapes of protection; a circle, sphere or even a small dome. She can even surf on it for faster midair transportation. It has not been confirmed whether this is a weapon or an actual [[Superpower (ability)|special ability]] of Mysticon Knight.

===Vexicon weapons===
These are the magic-infused weapons of the Vexicons, the four evil counterparts of the Mysticons. Each is somewhat similar to the weapons of light wielded by the Mysticons. Only Willa does not display any actual weapon, but prefers her Vexicon abilities; her ''"Doom Boom"'' attack and teleporting via purple smoke.
*Crystal Ice Staff- The weapon of Mallory, the blue-skinned ambitious and power-mad leader of the Vexicons. It is the evil counterpart to the green Dragon Mage Staff wielded by Princess Arkayna as Mysticon Dragon Mage. As opposed emitting green fire/flames from it, this blue staff generates strong ice/snow/frost magic; capable of projecting a strong blast of snowy magic, encase victims in ice cubes, and erect an orb of ice for defense. In place of a light green lotus on its mount, it has a deep blue jagged crystal.
*Feline Energy Claws- Being a humanoid feline, Kasha uses her catlike claws to fire a stream of red-white claws of a type of evil energy that can scratch victims from a distance. 
*Hammer- The weapon of Eartha, the "evil" counterpart of Emerald. She does not use it every time she appears, as her fellow Vexicons do with their weaponry, but she can project a strong beam of dark pink energy from it if need to.

===Other magical weapons===
*The Silver Trident – An extremely powerful and dangerous object that is the main weapon and symbol of the merpeople of the Silver Trident. These can emit lightning bolts of white electric energy and erect a transparent dome-shaped shield. Emerald is given one in recognition of her bravery. It is later shown able to grant marine physiology to those who cannot otherwise breathe underwater.
*Queen Necrafa's Scepter&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;#32;A long thin skeletal staff with a red crystal orb in its center. Necrafa can use it to teleport via red portals, erect powerful force-fields, and mutate her skeleton-like servants into hooded Specters. It is destroyed by the combined forces of the Princess Twins of Gemina (combined strength of Princess Arkayna and Zarya), who had transformed into the green-and-blue Twin Dragon by tapping into the magic of two yellow rings.
*Proxima's Scepter – This long and thin golden staff was presumably created in secret via the Celestial Forge. It further develops and drastically magnifies all of Proxima's already powerful star magic to even greater levels. She demonstrated its power by turning Nova Terron and other Astromancers into Spectromancers. From it, she emits powerful bursts of blood-red dark star magic.
*Lances of Justice- After the old king (Princess Arkayna and Zarya's birth father) had suddenly died defending the realm from evildoers, a grieved Queen Goodfey had dedicated her life to protecting all of Gemina to ensure her husband's demise was not in vain. She ordered that Nova Terron create magical lances that had the ability to further increase the mystical animal bracers of the Mysticons, thus strengthening their attack power. The plans to create them had been hidden in Queen Goodfey's necklace for safekeeping. They were forged in the magic furnace of the drawven mines, at Rudix Hollow, by each of the Mysticons.  Each lance is colored in the Mysticons' signature color.
===Powers and abilities===
These are the unique superpowers and abilities each of the four Mysticons possess, but for some reason are never used or relied upon as constantly as their weapons are. Some are psionic/[[List of psychic abilities|psychic]]/[[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory]], while others are what fairies and pixies possess. Only the special abilities of Zarya Moonwolf and Emerald Goldenbraid were never revealed in the show''':'''
*[[Psychokinesis|Telekinesis]]- The one of many that the brave leader of the Mysticons, Mysticon Dragon Mage, alone possess. Princess Arkayna Goodfey first utilizes this psionic ability to telekinetically create a ramp for the midair limousine to escape Kymraw, in Episode Three. Her eyes glow white, and a telekinetic aura is seen around her hands in a light green, though at one point, a darker greenish aura glowed around the rocks she psionically moved in "The Prophecy Unleashed", likely due to her telekinesis being given a boost from her rage and fury.
*Pixie Blast- Is the fairy-related special power of Piper Willowbrook as the second Mysticon Striker. She emits a stream of bright yellow, glittery fairy dust from her hands which dazzles her enemies from a distance.

This is most commonly, but not exclusively, by a popular artist or group. It differs from a [[reissue]], which involves a second or subsequent release of a previously-recorded piece of music.

Re-recordings are often produced decades after the original recordings were released, usually under contract terms more favorable to the artists. This is especially common among acts that originally agreed to [[Recording contract|contracts]] that would be considered unfair and exploitative today.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2013/05/re_recordings_runaway_and_other_classic_songs_redone_in_the_studio_can_we.html| last=Mandl| first=Dave| title=Same old song?

The '''Rental Car Rally''' is a 36-hour city-to-city road rally that takes place &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Your Very Own Cannonball Run
|publisher=Jaunted.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; on public roads several times a year in different cities, with a different route each time. Founded in 2008 by the organizers of Wiimbledon and Street Wars, RCR sees an annual entry of about 30 cars per rally, with each team required to compete in a themed costume of their choosing, so long as the costume includes their vehicle. The rally is not a serious race in the traditional sense of competitive rally driving,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=The Great Debate: Gumball 3000 vs. Rental Car Rally
|publisher=Complex.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; though teams win by merit of their costumes and low mileage. Organizers emphasize that Rental Car Rally is a road trip and not a race.

==History==
Drawing inspiration from the ''[[Cannonball Run (film)|Cannonball Run]]'' films, ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', the ''[[Wacky Races (1968 TV series)|Wacky Races]]'' cartoons as well as the [[Gumball 3000]], the Rental Car Rally was born as a more reasonable alternative to for those wanting to participate in a rally but who may not have the time and money required to complete in events such as the Bullrun and the Gumball 3000.

The first Rental Car Rally took place on August 15–17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=CNET.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The route required that participants drive from New York to Montreal, attend a party and drive back to NYC.

==Rally==

===2008 NYC to Montreal===
The inaugural rally featured 74 cars and 189 participants, and traveled from Long Island City, Queens to Montreal, Canada. Drivers were required to stop at 5 checkpoints along the route (which necessitated that mostly local roads were used) and collect evidence of their passing through them. 3 cars never made it to Montreal due to mechanical problems and 1 team - Jake's Clown Car - did not make it back from Montreal due to an accident in which no one was injured. The winner drove a van converted to resemble an emergency blood delivery vehicle.

A '''retablo''' in [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[folk art]] (also '''lámina''') is a devotional painting, especially a small popular or [[folk art]] one using [[iconography]] derived from traditional Catholic church art. More generally ''retablo'' is also the Spanish term for a [[retable]] or [[reredos]] above an [[altar]], whether a large [[altarpiece]] painting or an elaborate wooden structure with sculptures.  Typically this includes painting, sculpture or a combination of the two, and an elaborate framework enclosing it. The Latin etymology of the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word means "board behind".&lt;ref name="DRAE"&gt;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?LEMA=retablo&amp;TIPO_HTML=2&amp;FORMATO=ampliado Diccionario de la Real Academia Española]&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from being found behind the altar, "similar ornamental structures are built and carved over facades and doorways" (Fernandez 23), called [[overdoor]]s. 

Small retablos are devotional or [[votive]] paintings, often on rectangular sheets of tin that illustrate holy images such as [[Christ]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mother]], or one of the hundreds of saints. Many are [[ex-voto]]s ("from a vow") that depict the story that led to their commission, usually dangerous or threatening events that actually occurred, and which the person survived, thanks to the [[intercession]] of a sacred person - God, Mary or a saint. They are made as a way of thanking the sacred person for protection in precarious situations, such as surviving an illness or earthquake. This class of ex-votos often shows the protected humans in the dangerous situation, and the sacred person who protected them, usually with an inscribed explanation of the events, with the date and location.  Both devotional and especially ex-voto retablos may be deposited at a [[shrine]] as a [[votive offering]], or alternatively kept at home. 

Reredos of the Late Middle Ages and Renaissance in Spain grew extremely large and elaborate, typically using carved and [[gilding|gilded]] wood, and rising as high as 40 feet or more.  The tradition of making them was taken to the new [[Spanish Empire]] in America.  There, by the late 18th century at least, the word became used for much smaller popular religious paintings, both conventional [[andachtsbilder|devotional images]] and [[ex-voto]]s (paintings giving thanks for protection through a specific episode). These were typically made to express gratitude towards the Virgin Mary for saving a person or a loved one from a nearly fatal event.

== The small paintings ==
The popular labeling of ex-votos as "Retablos" can be traced back to the late 18th century. In 1950, Mexican artist [[Roberto Montenegro]] published a history of Mexican altarpieces, which included a votive painting dated 1781, that contained an inscription which offers thanks to [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Nuestra Señora de Dolores]] de [[Xaltocan]] for renewing the people's health after a severe illness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJHQ2RKEPtcC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=%20PA5|title=Miracles on the Border: Retablos of Mexican Migrants to the United States|last=Durand|first=Jorge|date=1995|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=9780816514977|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the bottom of the votive painting left, is inscribed a message that read "en cuia memoria dedica a su Magestad este Retablo" (in whose memory he dedicates to her Majesty this ''retablo'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The oil painted retablos generated the need for "small retablo factories" to be established in order to "reproduce the same images" which were then "sold to devout believers who displayed them in home altars to honor their patron Saints."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicanretablos.com/mexican_retablos_history.php Retablo history]&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only were the retablos purchased by those wanting to show devotion to their patron saints, they were also given when the saints were there for their devotees in hard times.  When people wished to express gratitude, they could give retablos that described "the miraculous deed of a saint to whom the petitioner turned to in a time of need" (Correa 113).  People call upon these saints for aid with rain, harvests or other outcomes.  For example, if a farmer needs rain for his crops he might pray for rain. After the rain comes, a retablo might be created to give thanks to San [[Isidore the Laborer|Ysidro Labrador]], the patron saint of farmers. He is "venerated for good weather, agricultural issues and prosperous crops" (Eddy, 1). That figure would most likely be kept in the farmer's house. Each time rain was needed in the future, that farmer might pray in front of that retablo (Eddy, 1).  These traditions are by no means exclusive to Latin America, but are found in all Roman Catholic countries, as well as in classical [[paganism]] and many other religions.  To judge by survivals, similar small paintings were especially common in the German-speaking Catholic areas of Europe in the [[Early Modern period]].  By the 19th century, the process of [[lithography]] became very popular for devotional retablos, replacing earlier [[printmaking]] methods.

=== Form ===
[[File:Puerto Iglesia05.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Baroque]] carved wood [[reredos]], or retablo in the original Spanish sense, [[Tenerife]].]]
The way a retablo and ex-voto look is entirely up to the person designing it, so long as it contains the necessary basic elements. The most important part of the retablo is the representation of the miraculous event. That is why most artists try to use bright, vibrant colors to portray the supremacy of the event. An ex-voto is, more often than not, reduced to a smaller size. It is usually about half the size of the original&lt;!-- what "original"???? --&gt;, while still maintaining its rectangular shape. The largest size was about 280 square inches. The smallest was about 18 square inches. Some of the most common sizes include 140 square inches and 70 square inches (Durand, 9).

=== Significance ===
Retablos are important to Mexican [[folk religion]] because they are a physical representation of holy images such as Christ, the Virgin Mother, or one of the many thousands of saints. They come from the need humans have to interact on a personal level with divine spirits. Retablos are evidentiary support for communication between the divine and humans (Wroth, 2).

This tradition of retablos was also brought into New Mexico and southern Colorado by Franciscan monks. Due to the remoteness of this frontier and lack of metals, retablos were made of wood. These crude retablos were coated with a [[gesso]] made with gypsum and rabbit skin glue. Pigments also were made locally from natural materials, colored earths, plant extracts, cochineal bugs, and lamp black.

These traditional retablos and other indigenous religious art were removed by Bishop Lamy throughout New Mexico after the conquest of these territories by the US Army.  In 1924 the Spanish Colonial Arts Society was formed, and since then these unique traditions of New Mexico have been preserved.

=== Contemporary revival ===
During the 1940s, a resurgence of the art began in Peru, due in large part to the research and philanthropy of Alicia Bustamante, a member of the Peruvian [[Indigenismo|indigenista]] movement, who encouraged an artist named Joaquin Lopez Antay to save and revitalize the retablo art form.  She enlisted him "to make retablos that included themes of everyday life – harvests, markets, and fiestas.  A distinction emerged between the retablo for ritual and religious purposes and the retablo as decoration."&lt;ref&gt;Exhibit Explanation, San Diego Museum of Man, Retablos Exhibit, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many others in the area, including [[Nicario Jimenez Quispe]], continued along the same path as Antay, creating a popular art that was displayed during annual branding ceremonies of cattle, sheep, and llamas. These retablos have achieved status as important heirlooms passed on within families that symbolize protection, fertility and healing.  They are also sold as art.

The '''Snettisham Hoard''' or ''Snettisham Treasure'' is a series of discoveries of [[Iron Age]] precious metal, found in the [[Snettisham]] area of the English county of [[Norfolk]] between 1948 and 1973.

==Snettisham iron age hoard==
The [[hoard]] consists of [[metal]], [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] and over 150 [[gold]] [[torc]] fragments, over 70 of which form complete torcs, dating from BC 70. Though the origins are unknown, it is of a high enough quality to have been royal treasure of the [[Iceni]].&lt;ref name=hilites&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cix.co.uk/~archaeology/hilites/snet.htm | title = The Snettisham Treasure | publisher = Current Archaeology | accessdate = June 6, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060509121039/http://www.cix.co.uk/~archaeology/hilites/snet.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snettisham Romano-British jeweller's hoard==
In 1985 there was also a find of [[Romano-British]] jewellery and raw materials buried in a clay pot in AD 155, the [[Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard]]. Though it has no direct connection with the nearby Iron Age finds, it may be evidence of a long tradition of gold- and silver-working in the area.&lt;ref name=johns&gt;''The Snettisham Roman Jeweller's Hoard'' by [[Catherine Johns]] (British Museum Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britmus&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/j/snettisham_jewellers_hoard.aspx | title = Jeweller's hoard from Snettisham | publisher = The British Museum | accessdate = June 10, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100413014233/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/j/snettisham_jewellers_hoard.aspx | archivedate = April 13, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum deposits==
The finds are deposited in [[Norwich Castle|Norwich Castle Museum]] and the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/g/snettisham_hoard_gold_torc.aspx British Museum highlights: Gold Torc from the Snettisham hoard L]&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most famous item from the hoard is the [[Great Torc from Snettisham]], which is now held by the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/t/the_great_torc_from_snettisham.aspx British MuseumHighlighs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The hoard was ranked as number 4 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the [[British Museum]] for the [[2003 in television|2003]] [[BBC Television]] [[Documentary television series|documentary]], ''[[Our Top Ten Treasures]],'' presented by [[Adam Hart-Davis]].

Similar specimens are the [[Sedgeford Torc]], found in 1965, and the [[Newark Torc]], found in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/18/artsandhumanities.arts|title=Iron age necklace discovered|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 February 2005|accessdate=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6772">'''Srdjan Jovanovic Weiss''' (born 1967) is a Yugoslav-born architect and theorist living and working in New York.

Jovanovic Weiss was born in Subotica and lived in [[Novi Sad]] and [[Belgrade]] until 1995. He then moved to the [[United States]] for graduate studies at [[Harvard University]]. After two years at Harvard studying with [[Richard Gluckman]], [[Jacques Herzog]] and [[Rem Koolhaas]], Jovanovic Weiss moved to [[New York City|New York]] where he started practicing architecture with [[Richard Gluckman]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]. In 1998 he won the Second Prize in the 2G Competition to expand Mies van der Rohe's [[Barcelona Pavilion]] in [[Barcelona]] and soon after opened his own art &amp; architectural practice called Normal Group for Architecture with a partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Srdjan Jovanovic  Weiss|url = http://www.akademie-solitude.de/en/fellowship/fellows/srdjan-jovanovic-weiss~pe1838/|website = Akademie Schloss Solitude|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration lasted until 2003 when Jovanovic Weiss founded NAO.NYC (Normal Architecture Office), a collaborative studio for design of architecture, cities and exhibitions and a successor of Normal Group for Architecture based in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NAO.NYC|url = http://www.nao.nyc|website = www.nao.nyc|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-founded SMS (School of Missing Studies), international art &amp; architecture group for studying cities marked or undergoing abrupt transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = School of Missing Studies|url = http://www.schoolofmissingstudies.net|website = www.schoolofmissingstudies.net|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jovanovic Weiss's theoretical work is mostly known for analysis of [[Balkans|Balkan]] cities in the aftermath of war and crisis in [[Yugoslavia]] during 1990s. He coined the term Turbo Architecture and contributed to understanding the geo-political process termed [[Balkanization]] and its defining effects on newly emerged capital cities after the fall of [[Yugoslavia]]. Jovanovic Weiss defines [[Balkanization]] as a bottom-up geo-political process that new capital cities of new countries go through to assert their own urban distinction and character among competing new capital cities and against hegemonic forces of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Balkanization {{!}} Srdjan Jovanović Weiss|url = http://monumenttotransformation.org/atlas-of-transformation/html/b/balkanization/balkanization-srdjan-jovanovic-weiss.html|website = monumenttotransformation.org|access-date = 2016-02-01|first = Martin Odehnal,|last = www.mo.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jovanovic Weiss authored books that include "Socialist Architecture: The Reappearing Act'' [ The Green Box, Berlin, 2017], ''Socialist Architecture: The Vanishing Act'' ([[JRP-Ringier|JRP Ringier]], 2012, with Armin Linke)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Armin Linke &amp;,Srdjan Jovanovic Weiss - Socialist Architecture: The Vanishing Act|url = http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=15&amp;id_b=2241|website = jrp-ringier|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Almost Architecture'' (Merz &amp; Akademie Solitude, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Almost Architecture|url = http://www.akademie-solitude.de/en/publications/projektiv/almost-architecture~no3026/|website = Akademie Schloss Solitude|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|By defining Turbo Architecture as a post-socialist mainstream in nationalizing collective identity through architecture, the author of the book Almost Architecture Srdjan Jovanovic Weiss is presenting his view on the complex relationships between politics, identity search, transition and war itself, all of that represented through specific historical and contemporary strategies in architecture. This book, in an interesting way, deals with depicting the major political shifts and turbulence periods in former Yugoslav and Serbian recent past through contexts of construction or deconstruction of symbolically charged buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Almost Architecture|url = http://transform.eipcp.net/correspondence/1156403374/print|website = transform.eipcp.net|access-date = 2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He edited the books ''Evasions of Power: On the Architecture of Adjustment'' (Slought, Ed. 2008) and ''Lost Highway Expedition'' (School of Missing Studies, Ed. 2007). His work has been published in the books ''100 Architects 10 Critics'' by Phaidon, ''Harvard Project on the City: Shopping, Did Someone Say Participate?'', ''Networked Cultures: Parallel Architectures and the Politics of Space'', ''Forensis: The Architecture of Public Truth'', ''Atlas of Transformation'', ''Beyond: Scenarios and Speculations'', ''Concurrent Urbanism'', ''Nationalities Papers'' and ''Inhabiting Geometry: Anne Tyng'' as well as magazines and journals such as ''[[Harvard Design Magazine]]'', [[Cabinet (magazine)|''Cabinet'' Magazine]], ''[[Perspecta (journal)|Perspecta]]'', ''Akcelerator'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AKCELERATOR: critical architectural magazine / editors: Srdjan     Jovanovic Weiss &amp; Ivan Kucina / Serbia|url = http://thenao.net/akcelerator/|website = thenao.net|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Domus (magazine)|Domus]]'', ''DaNS'', ''[[Architectural Design]]'', ''Oris'', ''Thresholds'' et al.

Weiss curated and designed exhibitions in New York of visionaries from the past: Lina Bo Bardi (at Columbia GSAPP), Yona Frieddman (at The Drawing Center) and Anne Tyng (at ICA Philadalphia and Graham Foundation, Chicago). His most recent exhibition on Hannes Meyer and the city of Birobidzhan has been exhibited in Birobidzhan Philharmonic in Far East Russia.

Jovanovic Weiss previously collaborated with [[Richard Gluckman]] and [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron|Herzog &amp; de Meuron Architects]] and artists [[Jenny Holzer]] and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]].

He is currently a faculty at CCNY_SSA at CUNY,  [[Columbia University]] GSAPP and Penn Design Architecture and he taught at [[Harvard University]] GSD, [[Tyler School of Art]] [[Temple University]] and [[Cornell University]] AAP/NYC.

==Synopsis==
A [[Scotsman]], an [[Englishman]] and an [[Irishman]] all ran away from the army together. After several days, the Scotsman saw a castle, went to it without speaking to the others, and met a lady. At his request, she gave him a meal and a bed to sleep. And then the same thing happened to the Englishman.

The Irishman saw the same castle and went to it, but when the lady gave him food, he stared about the castle and did not eat. When she asked, he said he could not eat without knowing who she was or where she came from, or how she came there. She told him she was an [[incantation|enchanted]] [[Princess and dragon|princess]], and if a man stayed in a little room from ten until midnight for [[rule of three (writing)|three]] nights running, she would be freed. Every night creatures came into the room and beat him, but the princess had a [[potion|bottle]] that cured him every morning.

She went off and told him she would back in a coach and six. A little lad came, and when he went to wait for the princess, the lad stuck a pin in his coat, putting him to sleep. When the princess came, the lad told her he was asleep. The princess said she would come once more, and then he would not see her again. The Irishman resolved to keep awake, but the boy stuck the pin in his coat again, and the princess left, leaving him a sword.

He woke up the other men in the castle and gave them silver and plate to carry away and set out in search of her. Three years later, he pulled out the sword in order to kill himself and found written on it, You will find me in the Blue Mountains. He set out in search of the Blue Mountains and found an old man who had not seen anyone in three hundred years. The old man, that night, looked through his book, which contained the history of the world, but found nothing of where the Blue Mountains were. He blew a [[magical item|magical whistle]], which let the Irishman travel to his brother's, nine hundred miles away, in a day. This brother summoned all the birds to consult them. Last of all, an eagle came; it had come from the Blue Mountains. The eagle said that the daughter of the king of the Blue Mountains was about to marry, because she had agreed with her father that if the man who had saved her had not arrived in that time, she would marry. 

The eagle said if they killed sixty cattle and the Irishman would throw quarter of one into its mouth every time it turned its head, it could carry him. So he and the old man hunted, and it flew off with him and the meat, but near the castle, the meat ran out, and the eagle threw him off. He landed in the bay and was able to get ashore. He gave a guinea to the king's [[:wiktionary:henwife|henwife]] to bring the princess to him. She recognized the Irishman and married him instead of her new [[False hero|bridegroom]].

'''''The Garden''''' is [[Michael Nesmith]]'s 11th full studio album and was released in 1994. ''The Garden'' is a companion release to Nesmith's 1974 album/book, ''[[The Prison - A Book with a Soundtrack|The Prison]]''. Both ''The Garden'' and ''The Prison'' are written to have the music complement a novel included in the release (also written by Nesmith). ''The Prison'' and ''The Garden'' were re-released together on CD in 2004 by Video Ranch.

The idea is for listeners to read the novel while simultaneously listening to the recording.  Even though ''The Garden'' was released on Nesmith's record company, Rio Records, the novella/album concept was the driving force behind Nesmith's multimedia company [[Pacific Arts]].

In the liner notes, Nesmith states ''The Garden'' is not a sequel in the strictest sense of the term — meaning that there isn't a true continuation of the narrative which began in ''The Prison''. Instead, they are correlated thematically and stylistically as both are presented in a linear and consecutive approach. Each of ''The Garden's'' seven chapters are also visually enhanced, if not somewhat inspired by a series of Claude Monet paintings. There is a much more subtle connection between the prose and these unqualified masterworks, yet he is able to relate them in a contextual sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=michael nesmith|chart=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot--&gt;

Allmusic writes "the music retains Nesmith's inimitable and signature sound, yet compared to his most concurrent effort, Tropical Campfires (1992), The Garden is exceedingly ethereal and more often than not instrumental. There are vocals that feature not only the artist, but also his children Jason — who is likewise the central character in the short story — Christian, and Jessica. The backing band also includes Christian Nesmith as well as most of the musicians the senior Nez had collaborated with on the aforementioned Tropical Campfires, most notably Desert Rose Band string man John Jorgenson (guitar/sax/bassoon/mandolin/oboe/bandurila/mandocello), Joe Chemay (bass), and John Hobbs (keyboards), as well as studio maven [[Sid Page]] (violin)".&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Planer, Allmusic, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
According to the liner notes, the album was recorded at various times between October 1991 and September 1993 at Footprint Studios and Trax in [[Los Angeles]].  Additionally, ''The Garden'' is the first studio album Nesmith does not use a steel pedal guitar on any track.  

''The Garden'' novella features seven paintings of [[Claude Monet]] at the beginning of each chapter.

'''''The Mentor Philosophers''''' was a series of six books each covering a period of philosophical thought, published by the [[New American Library]].   Each book was edited by an esteemed contemporary philosophy academic and contained analysis of a group of philosophers from a chosen period.

The series was very influential during the 1950s and 1960s and went a number of editions in paperback.  Literary historian [[Gilbert Highet]] called it a "very important and interesting series".

'''''The Peasant Wedding''''' is a 1567 [[genre painting]]&lt;ref name="Art History at Khan Academy"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Hs2GZKOhw|title=Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Peasant Wedding, c. 1566-69, Smarthistory, Art History at Khan Academy|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by  the [[Dutch People|Dutch]] [[Renaissance]] painter and [[printmaker]] [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], one of his many depicting [[peasant]] life. It is currently housed in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], [[Vienna]]. Pieter Bruegel the Elder enjoyed painting peasants and different aspects of their lives in so many of his paintings that he has been called Peasant-Bruegel, but he was in fact a  sophisticated  [[intellectual]], and many of his paintings have a symbolic meaning and also a moral aspect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/b/bruegel/pieter_e/10/index.html|title=Paintings of peasant life (1567-68) by Pieter BRUEGEL the Elder|publisher=Web Gallery of Art|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/bruegel/|title=Bruegel|publisher=Web Museum, Paris|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cana&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templegallery.com/content/thesis_part4.pdf|title=The marriage at Cana|publisher=Temple Gallery|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scene==
The [[bride]] is in front of the green textile  wall-hanging, with a paper-crown hung above her head. She is also wearing a crown on her head, and she is sitting passively, not participating in the eating or drinking taking place around her. The Bridegroom is not in attendance of the wedding feast in accordance to Flemish custom.  The feast is in a [[barn]] in the summertime; two sheaves of grain with a rake recalls the work that harvesting involves, and the hard life [[peasant]]s have. The plates are carried on a door off its hinges. The main food was [[bread]], [[porridge]] and [[soup]]. Other features of the scene include two pipers playing the [[pijpzak]], an [[breeching (boys)|unbreeched]] boy in the foreground licking a plate, the wealthy man at the far right feeding a dog by putting bread on the bench, and a mysterious extra foot seen under the load of dishes being carried by the two men in the right foreground. The scene is claimed to depict an accurate portrayal of the 16th-century way of celebrating a peasant wedding.&lt;ref name="Art History at Khan Academy"/&gt;

==The groom==
There has been much conjecture as to the identity of the groom in this painting. [[Gilbert Highet]] has argued that the groom is the man in the centre of the painting, wearing a dark coat and seen in profile,&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Highet. 1945. Bruegel's Rustic wedding. ''American Magazine of Art'' 38. 274-276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Highet. 1967. Where is the Bridegroom? ''Horizon: A Magazine of the Arts.'' 9.2:112-115.&lt;/ref&gt; or the ill-bred son of a wealthy couple, seen against the far wall, to the right of the bride, eating with a spoon, same as [[Gustav Glück]].&lt;ref&gt;Gustav Glück, ed. 1937. ''Bilder aus Bruegels Bildern.'' Vienna: Verlag Von Anton Schroll &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that according to contemporary custom, the groom is not seated at the table but may be the man pouring out beer.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wied |first1=Alexander |last2=Van Miegroet |first2=Hans J. |title=Bruegel |publisher=Grove Art Online |accessdate=27 January 2015 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T011669pg1 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or he may be according to the same custom serving the food instead. According to this theory, the groom is the young man wearing a red cap, who is serving his guests the food, handing out plates to his guests.&lt;ref name=Pickwick&gt;{{cite web |url=http://madamepickwickartblog.com/2010/06/second-helpings-on-the-peasant-wedding-feast/helpings-on-the-peasant-wedding-feast |title=Helpings on the peasant wedding feast|publisher=Madame Pickwick Art|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] vein, [[Rudy Rucker]] speculates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rudy Rucker, Notes |url=http://www.rudyrucker.com/bruegel/bruegelnotesposted.pdf|p=54|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|... the groom is the man in the red hat, passing food towards the bride. The motion of a husband, to penetrate the wife. Note that near him are no less than three phallic symbols pointing towards the wife: the man’s arm, the knife on the table, and the salt-cellar (?) on the table. Note also that at the end of the man’s arm is an ellipse of an angle-seen dish that is oriented and located in the right location to represent the bride’s vagina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rudolf von Bitter Rucker, As Above So Below |isbn= 0765327538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors have even suggested that the groom is not even included in the painting. Van der Elst speculated that this could be the depiction of an old Flemish proverb, like some of ''"There is an old Flemish proverb: 'It is a poor man who is not able to be at his own wedding.' That seems to be the case here."''&lt;ref&gt;Joseph van der Elst. 1944. ''The last flowering of the Middle Ages''. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, Doran &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Some argued that it is a presentation of the mystical [[The Wedding at Cana|Wedding of Cana]].&lt;ref name=Cana /&gt;
Lindsay and Bernard Huppé speculated that the painting was a Christian allegory, symbolizing corruption, depicting the corrupted Church, which was supposed to be the bride of Christ, but the groom has not appeared to claim his corrupt bride.&lt;ref&gt;K. C. Lindsay and Bernard Huppé. March 1956. Meaning and Method in Breughel's Paintings. ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' Vol. 14, No. 3. 376-386.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was parodied in ''[[Asterix in Belgium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Anthea|title=Translation: Here and There, Now and Then|year=1996|publisher=Intellect Books|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=agu3vbQl5QAC&amp;pg=PA129|chapter=Translating Astérix|authorlink=Anthea Bell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Screech|first=Matthew|title=Masters of the ninth art: bandes dessinées and Franco-Belgian identity|year=2005|publisher=Liverpool University Press|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EvkGQnWZf1gC&amp;pg=PA85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Thomas William Robertson.jpg|right|frame|Engraving of Tom Robertson]]
'''Thomas William Robertson''' (9 January 1829 – 3 February 1871), usually known professionally as T. W. Robertson, was an English [[dramatist]] and innovative stage director best known for a series of [[realism (arts)|realistic]] or [[naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] plays produced in London in the 1860s that broke new ground and inspired playwrights such as [[W.S. Gilbert]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]].

==Life and career==
Born in [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark-upon-Trent]], [[Nottinghamshire]], England, Robertson was the oldest son of William Robertson, a provincial actor and manager.  His family was famous for producing actors.  The actress [[Madge Kendal|Margaret (Madge) Robertson]] was his youngest sister.  As a child, Robertson acted in juvenile parts in ''Rob Roy'', ''Pizarro'', ''The Stranger'', "French" parts and eccentric comedy on the Lincoln Circuit and at the Marylebone in London.  He also visited Paris as the stage manager and interpreter for an English company.&lt;ref name=Utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289-301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Never a successful actor himself, he wrote numerous plays, mostly comedies, many of which achieved popularity.  Robertson died at the age of 42 and is buried, as is his wife Elizabeth, at [[Abney Park Cemetery]] in [[Stoke Newington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Savin|first=Maynard|title=Thomas William Robertson: his plays and stagecraft|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=jwFeTPO2N5SQOKLjtL0J&amp;ct=result&amp;id=XU0GAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=buried|year=1950|publisher=Brown University|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plays===
As a dramatist, Robertson began with adaptations of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] novels and wrote [[music hall]] songs for comedians.&lt;ref name=Utility/&gt;  He produced a farcical comedy, ''A Night's Adventure'' at London's [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1851, but this did not catch on, and he remained for several more years in the provinces, acting and continuing with play writing and writing for newspapers.  In 1860, he moved to London and worked as an editor, also writing a novel, later dramatised under the title ''Shadow Tree Shaft''.  He also wrote a farce entitled ''A Cantab'', which was played at the [[Royal Strand Theatre]] in 1861.  This brought him a reputation among a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] clique of writers, the ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine gang (including [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Tom Hood]], [[Clement Scott]], and [[F. C. Burnand]]), but so little profit that he thought of abandoning the profession to become a tobacconist.  Finally, in 1864, he had his first notable playwriting success, ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', produced at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] with [[Edward Sothern]] in the title role.  Robertson also wrote the libretto to the 1865 [[comic opera]] ''Constance'', with music by [[Frederic Clay]].

Robertson found fame in 1865 with the production of his comedy ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', under the management of [[Squire Bancroft]] and his wife [[Effie Bancroft|Marie (née Wilton)]] at the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] in the [[West End theatre|West End]].  The play includes a scene that fictionalized the ''Fun'' gang, who frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Information about the bohemian round tables]&lt;/ref&gt;  This play became regarded as a milestone in Victorian drama because of its realism in sets, costume, acting and dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Edgar Pemberton|Pemberton, T. Edgar]]. [https://archive.org/stream/societyandcastee00robeuoft/societyandcastee00robeuoft_djvu.txt ''The English Drama from its Beginning to the Present Day'' – ''Society'' and ''Caste''], D. C. Heath &amp; Co., Publishers Boston USA and London (1905)&lt;/ref&gt;

All of Robertson's popular plays, except for ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'', were produced by the Bancrofts at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.  Other Robertson successes included the domestic dramas ''Ours'' (1866), ''[[Caste (play)|Caste]]'' (1867), ''Play'' (1868), ''School'' (1869), and ''M.P.'' (1870).  He also wrote ''Dreams'' for the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], which opened that new theatre in 1868 together with Gilbert's ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]''.  His last play, ''War'', was produced at the [[St. James's Theatre]] in 1871, the year in which he died.  Robertson's plays are still occasionally seen.  For example, ''Ours'' was given a professional production in July 2007 at the [[Finborough Theatre]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/archive/2007/ours.htm Information about the 2007 production of ''Ours'' at the Finborough Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovations in realism and directing===
Robertson's plays became known as 'problem plays', because they dealt seriously and sensitively with issues of the day.  In the 1850s and 1860s, Robertson's plays, both in style and substance, were considered revolutionary.  ''Caste'' was about marriage across the class barrier and explored prejudices towards social climbing.&lt;ref name=Cup&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/0-9/19th-century-theatre/ "Cup and Saucer drama,"] 19th Century Theatre, Victoria and Albert Museum, accessed 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://members.tripod.com/FootlightNotes/index.html Information about ''Caste'', especially the 1910 revival.]  Footlight Notes, No. 315, 27 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; These plays were notable for their "cup and saucer" realism, treating contemporary British subjects in settings that were realistic, unlike the oversize acting in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[melodrama]]s that were popular at the time.&lt;ref name=bruegge&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy" (Associate Professor, Department Chair, Department of Theatre and Dance, Winthrop University).  Professor Vorder Bruegge presented this paper at the Victorian Interdisciplinary Studies Association of the Western United States annual conference in October 2002] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=2011-05-03 }}, accessed March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, whereas previously a designer would put as many chairs into a dining room scene as there were actors who needed to sit down, Robertson would place on stage as many chairs as would realistically be found in that dining room, even if some were never actually used.  Or, if someone came in from a blizzard, snow would blow in from the doorway.  In ''Ours'', a pudding was made on stage, and this caused a major furore – people were not used to seeing such realistic tasks in a stage setting.  Also, the characters spoke in normal language and dealt with ordinary situations rather than declaiming their lines.&lt;ref name=Cup/&gt;

In addition, the importance of everyday incidents, the revealing of character through apparent "small talk", and the idea that what is not said in the dialogue is as important as what is said are all Robertson trademarks.  Some critics wrote that there was nothing in Robertson's plays but commonplace life represented without a trace of wit and sparkle, but many admired the new style of play and new style of acting.  [[George Bernard Shaw]] called Robertson's play ''Caste'' "epoch making" and referred to Robertson's innovations as a "theatrical revolution".  It is now disputed whether Robertson really originated some of his innovations, but ''Society'' and its successors were viewed at the time as something new and, in a quiet way, revolutionary.

The Bancrofts, impressed with Robertson's dedication and skill, gave Robertson unusual artistic freedom to control his scripts and direct (or as it was then called, "stage manage") his plays.&lt;ref name=bruegge/&gt;  Before Robertson and [[James Robinson Planché]], star actors generally had control of scripts, and theatre managers had control of casting in the theatre.  Robertson insisted on retaining control over his scripts and casting and required that his actors follow his directions - a novel concept at that time.  Robertson directed his own plays and aimed to get rid of the unreal stylisation and bombast of the old [[melodrama]]s.  He did not act in his plays but instead took on the role of a professional director to control the action on stage.&lt;ref name=bruegge/&gt;  W. S. Gilbert attended Robertson's rehearsals to learn from the older playwright's use of "stagecraft" and personally directed his own plays and operas based on what he had learned. Gilbert later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Why, he invented stage management. It was an unknown art before his time. Formerly, in a conversation scene for instance, you simply brought down two or three chairs, and people sat down and talked, and when the conversation was ended the chairs were replaced. Robertson showed how to give life and variety and nature to the scene, by breaking it up with all sorts of little incidents and delicate by-play. I have been at many of his rehearsals and learnt a great deal from them.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, William. ''Real Conversations'', 1904, ''quoted'' in Baily, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These pioneers opened the way for later proponents of realism in drama, such as Shaw, and for modern methods of play production.  Robertson was also a leader in requiring a fee from his managers for every performance of his plays, thus pioneering the modern royalty system.

The '''shield banderese''', also known as a '''tournament shield''' or '''square shield''', is a [[shield]] is of wide rectangular shape 7 modules and high 8.

It was the shield of the gentlemen who had the right to take up arms to their [[Vassal|vassals]], and to lead them to war under their flag. These gentlemen were called [[Knight|knights banderesi]] (chevaliers bannerets).

The shield banderese, replicated fabric and attached to a vertical rod, is the direct ancestor of the flags, in their original square form.

Tournament shields were first recorded when Philip II the Bold, [[Duke of Burgundy]], used one in a tournament in 1399. The [[France|French]] used it after [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] formed a company of 500 knights.

A '''unit still photographer''', or simply '''still photographer''', is a person who creates [[film still]]s, still [[Photography|photographic]] images specifically intended for use in the marketing and publicity of feature [[film]]s in the motion picture industry and network [[television]] productions.&lt;ref name="Dzyak2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Dzyak|title=What I Really Want to Do on Set in Hollywood: A Guide to Real Jobs in the Film Industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWY6Ej4fO1QC&amp;pg=PA303|year= 2010|publisher=Crown Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-87516-7|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldman1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Larry Goldman|title=The professional photographer: developing a successful career|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7k4YAQAAMAAJ|page=117|year= 1983|publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kerrigan2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Finola Kerrigan|title=Film Marketing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbWKtM-L-ugC&amp;pg=PT243|year= 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-44000-7|pages=243–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides creating photographs for the promotion of a film, the still photographer contributes daily to the filming process by creating set stills. With these, the photographer is careful to record all details of cast wardrobe, set appearance and background.  The director and assistants review these images frequently for continuity and matching of all stage aspects.&lt;ref&gt;"Still Photography in the Motion Picture Industry" by Ned Scott&gt;: http://www.thenedscottarchive.com/hollywood/authorship.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornel Lucas]], a pioneer of film portraiture in the 1940s and 1950s, was the first still photographer to be awarded a [[BAFTA]], in 1998, for work with the [[British Film Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Cornel Lucas: Photographer who made his name as a pioneer of film portraiture - Obituaries |newspaper=The Independent| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/cornel-lucas-photographer-who-made-his-name-as-a-pioneer-of-film-portraiture-8399597.html|author=Martin Childs|date=11 December 2012| accessdate = 2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DawsonHolmes2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Dawson|author2=Sean Holmes|title=Working in the Global Film and Television Industries: Creativity, Systems, Space, Patronage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yixuaRMJ6tIC&amp;pg=PT136|date=2 August 2012|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78093-021-3|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses in the industry ==
Using individual [[Film frame|frames]] from film or recorded video material is not practical due to their relatively low quality. Much higher resolution images are therefore used. Typically, the end uses of these still photos include the film's theatrical release poster, [[DVD]] box artwork, the official web site photos, [[billboard]]s, [[bus stop]] adverts, [[Point of sale|point-of-purchase]] displays, key art image sets released to the press and media, and other printed and online collateral materials.

Unit still photographers are also responsible for creating "photo [[Theatrical property|props]]" and "set dressing images", the photos and images used on-camera to create various [[illusion]]s such as [[Forensic science|forensic photos]], crime drama booking photos, character driver's licenses, [[passport]] and I.D. photos, on-screen family photos, surveillance photos, computer screen displays, and any other image a producer may require in the course of a production.

In [[North America]] in particular, and some international locations, a unit still photographer must be a member of [[International Cinematographers Guild|IATSE Local 600 International Cinematographers Guild]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} in order to perform services on union productions and union studio lots and locations.  The most prestigious of these unit still photographers are members of The Society of Motion Picture Still Photographers, an organization which promotes the work of those within the industry.

While often perceived as a "glamour" job for photographers, the reality is often long hours (70-plus hours per week) on remote locations under difficult and often extreme conditions.  The unit still photographer often coordinates with the unit publicist, but physically works in close proximity to the film's [[Film crew|camera crew]], [[Film director|director]] and [[actor]]s, and also in close proximity to the film's boom microphone operator. Unit still photographers go to great lengths to muffle the sound of their camera's [[motor drive]] and [[Shutter (photography)|shutter]] to avoid distracting the actors, and to remain inaudible on the film's recorded dialogue soundtrack.

Typically, this is accomplished using a [[sound blimp]], which is a sound-absorbing, foam-filled metal case in which the still camera body is fitted with a proprietary remote operation cable. This allows the camera to be activated and operated from a two-button (activation, focus and shutter release) exterior control. Limitations exist once the blimp is closed around the camera, as one can no longer access the cameras controls ([[f-number]], shutter speed, ASA/[[Film speed|ISO]] settings) or menu displays directly. The [[Liquid crystal display|LCD display]] for reviewing the images will also be obscured in the closed position.  This requires the photographer to make control selections in advance, and use with those settings until the take in progress has been "cut", making adjustments only between takes or set-ups. Unit still photographers in this field typically produce over 2000 marketable images per week for their major-studio clients. Still photography involves the use of alignment, positioning, and other techniques to capture the "money shot". Still-life photography is the depiction of inanimate subject matter, most typically a small grouping of objects that are either human-made or natural.

Since 2010, high-end [[Digital single-lens reflex camera|DSLR cameras]], which can be remotely controlled with [[mobile apps]] on [[smartphone]]s and [[tablet computer]]s, using the built-in 2-way [[Wi-Fi]] radio-controlled interface between the tablet and the DSLR camera, and offer internal [[active noise control|''active noise reduction'']] technologies, have increased the ability of the unit still photographer to work quietly on the set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4774">'''"Welcome to Holland"''' is a prominent [[essay]], written in 1987 by [[United States|American]] author and social activist [[Emily Perl Kingsley]], about having a child with a [[disability]]. The piece is given by many organizations to new [[Parenting|parents]] of children with special needs issues such as [[Down syndrome]]. As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name "Holland".&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Far From The Tree]]|date=2012|ISBN=9780743236713|first=Andrew|last=Solomon|authorlink=Andrew Solomon|publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]|pages=169–179, 223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emily Kingsley is the mother of [[Jason Kingsley]]. The younger Kingsley is an [[actor]] who has appeared on programs such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and enjoyed a varied [[career]], despite the family being told early in his childhood that his struggles would prevent him from having a meaningful life. "Welcome to Holland", written in the [[Second-person narrative|second person]], employs a [[metaphor]] of excitement for a [[vacation]] to [[Italy]] that first becomes disappointment when the plane lands instead in [[Holland]] and then contentment at the happy events which they experience instead.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

==Background and contents==
{{quote|"Holland?!?" you say. "What do you mean Holland?? I signed up for Italy! I'm supposed to be in Italy. All my life I've dreamed of going to Italy.}}

The metaphor is that the trip to Italy is a typical birth and child-raising experience, and that the trip to Holland is the experiencing of having and raising a child with special needs.

{{quote|But everyone you know is busy coming and going from Italy... and they're all bragging about what a wonderful time they had there. And for the rest of your life, you will say "Yes, that's where I was supposed to go. That's what I had planned.}}

In the end, however, the reader sees that the "trip" is still well worth it:

{{quote|But... if you spend your life mourning the fact that you didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland.}}

Author and social activist [[Emily Perl Kingsley]] wrote the piece based on her experiences with her son, [[Jason Kingsley]], and her changing beliefs through [[Parenting|parenthood]]. The younger Kingsley was born in 1974 with [[Down syndrome]]. Their doctor labeled the child as a "[[Mongolian idiocy|mongoloid]]" that would fail to learn to speak or walk and instructed the parents to act essentially as if the birth hadn't happened, with the mother sent to receive [[Tranquilizer|tranquilizing drugs]] preventing [[lactation]]. She recounted that she [[Crying|cried]] for several days straight.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

Although such medical attitudes were consistent with the [[prejudices]] of the time, the distraught family resisted and determined to provide the boy with as intellectually stimulating an environment as possible. Accounts of widespread [[Child abuse|abuse]] as a result of controversial [[institutionalization]] policies served to spur them on even more. The younger Kingsley has worked as an [[actor]], appearing on programs such as ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and otherwise enjoyed a varied [[career]] despite various challenges.&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;

==Responses and influence==
As a testament to its popularity, several individuals have received the first name "Holland".&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt; In 2004, Will Livingston wrote a song loosely based on the story. He also used the title "Welcome to Holland".

Critical analysis of the work and its influence has compared it to [[poet]] [[Robert Frost]]'s piece ''[[The Road Not Taken]]'', which also discusses the human tendency to look back and fret about 'what might have been' after people make decisions.

A response essay describing the possible toll that parenting can take on a family's welfare, such as raising children with severe [[autism]], was created titled "Welcome to Beirut",&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt; with the later piece alluding to the suffering from the [[Lebanese Civil War]]. "Welcome to Holland" has also attracted some amused, humorous responses from individuals living in both [[Holland]] and [[Italy]] in contrast to the original story's [[United States|American]] perspective.

What later came to be known as the '''William and Mary style''' is a [[furniture]] design common from 1700 to 1725 in the [[Netherlands]], the [[Kingdom of England]], the [[Kingdom of Scotland]], and later, in England's [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]]. It was a transitional style between [[Mannerism|Mannerist furniture]] and [[Queen Anne style furniture|Queen Anne furniture]]. Sturdy, emphasizing both straight lines and curves, and featuring elaborate carving and [[woodturning]], the style was one of the first to imitate Asian design elements such as [[japanning]].

==About the design==
In 1688, [[James II of England]] was deposed by his daughter, [[Mary II of England|Mary]], and her husband, [[William III of England|William of Orange]], in what came to be known as the "[[Glorious Revolution]]". From birth in 1650, William had reigned over five provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]], and Mary had lived in the Netherlands with him after their marriage in 1677.  William and Mary brought to their kingdoms a taste for Dutch furniture styles, as well as a number of Dutch furniture-makers.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} Although movement toward what would come to be called the William and Mary style had begun during the reign of [[Charles II of England]], primarily due to the influence of his [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-born queen, [[Catherine of Braganza]], the style became defined and widely accepted during the reigns of William (d. 1702) and Mary (d. 1694),{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|pages=108-109}} initially jointly and then after Mary's death, of William alone.

The William and Mary style was influenced by recent [[French furniture]] traditions, which in turn were influenced by [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] furniture designs.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} William and Mary style furniture emphasized unity, so that all elements contributed to an overall shape or look. It also featured [[Relief#High relief|high relief]] carving, strong curves,{{Efn|Known as "Flemish curves".{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}}}} and elaborate [[woodturning]].{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} Despite these elements, the style was fairly squat,{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}} heavy-looking, and obviously sturdy.{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} Straight lines are common.{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} Paint, [[wood stain|stain]]s, or different kind of wood were used to create contrasting colors, which was another element of this style.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} [[Japanning]], a technique of [[varnish]]ing which was very popular at the time, was also used on this furniture design.{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} For chairs, [[Caning (furniture)|woven cane]] seats{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}} and heavily-scrolled backs predominated.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} Toward the end of the style, cane-woven seats and backs had given way to leather, and straight or slightly angled backs had given way to serpentine forms.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}}

Other decorative arts such as architecture, ceramics, silver, and textiles could also feature elements of the William and Mary style. The design movement had an extremely positive impact on the craftsmanship and quality of British furniture.{{sfn|''Grove Dictionary of Art''|2000|page=364}}

The William and Mary style was a transitional style between Mannerist and Queen Anne furniture.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}} The William and Mary style was very popular in Britain from 1700 to 1725,{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} and in America until about 1735.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} It was largely supplanted in both nations by [[Queen Anne style furniture]].{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}}

===English variations===
[[Daniel Marot]], a [[French people|French]] [[Huguenots|Huguenot]], was employed by King William and Queen Mary to design furniture for them, and became deeply influential on English, Scottish, and Welsh furniture during this period.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}} Dutch furniture craftsman [[Gerrit Jensen]] was appointed royal Cabinet Maker to the king and queen, and a great many works of his design were sold to wealthy British citizens of the day.{{sfn|''Grove Dictionary of Art''|2000|page=364}}

In Britain, case furniture{{Efn|Case furniture is any kind of furniture that suggests a box. Typical case furniture includes [[chest of drawers|bureaus]], [[cabinetry]], [[Chest (furniture)|chests]], [[cupboard]]s, [[desk]]s, and [[sideboard]]s.{{sfn|Thiel|2015|page=139}}}} in the William and Mary style tended to feature simple flat surfaces but exquisitely carved trim.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} Provincial furniture-makers in Britain moved away from the woven cane seat, and developed the [[leather]]-covered wooden seat as a [[Vernacular architecture|vernacular]] design.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} Split [[Spindle (furniture)|spindles]] also came into use, first rurally and then urbanly.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}}

The [[daybed]] was developed in Britain as part of the William and Mary style.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=109}} So, too, was the [[writing desk]], which was an adaptation of the bureau-cabinet.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=27}}{{Efn|The bureau-cabinet consisted of a chest of drawers atop which was a smaller set of shelves, pigeon-holes, and drawers set back from the front. A panel covered these drawers at an angle; when pulled forward and down, the panel served as a writing space. Atop the second set of drawers was a much taller third set of drawers, usually concealed behind two doors.{{sfn|Campbell|2006|pages=160-162}}}}

===American variations===
[[File:Side Chair, America, c. 1700, walnut and cane - Brooklyn Museum - DSC09086.JPG|thumb|A William and Mary style chair made in America.]]
American craftsmen working in the William and Mary style favored a tapered [[Foot (furniture)|scroll foot]] for their designs.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=25}} [[Juglans|Walnut]] and, to a lesser extent, [[maple]] were the preferred woods, with walnut [[burl]] [[Wood veneer|veneers]] and "ebonization" (black japanning) common.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}}

Over time, American forms of William and Mary furniture became simplified. Although the Baroque influence was still seen in the crests, feet, and scrolls, other elements and the overall look of pieces began to shed this influence in favor of plain but strong curves. American chairmakers began using woven cane in the [[Splat (furniture)|splats]] of chairs as well. For armchairs, American designers favored seats and splats covered in leather, attached with brass nails.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}}  In parts of America like [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], which had a heavy Dutch cultural influence, the ''[[kast (furniture)|kast]]'' became popular. The ''kast'' was of Dutch origin, and featured a large drawer in the base unit. Atop the base were shelves concealed behind one or two heavy doors. An elaborate [[cornice]] usually ran along the upper edges. Influenced by the William and Mary style, the American ''kast'' featured removable feet, simplified the cornice, and eliminated the intricate [[inlay]]s favored by the Dutch.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=27}}

The "Boston chair" became one of the best-known examples of a William and Mary style chair made in America. This spoon-back chair{{Efn|The spoon-back chair features a back which curves slightly inward and then outward as it rises. The serpentine form looks like the curvature of a spoon handle, hence the name.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=110}}}} with leather-covered seat and splat featured turned front legs and a turned [[Stretcher (furniture)|stretcher]] between them. The side and rear stretcher as well as the rear legs, however, were undecorated straight lines. The corners of the frame around the splat were usually rounded down (although not turned), and the crest was a simplified geometric or curving design. They were usually painted black or red. Made primarily in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], these chairs were manufactured in large numbers and very popular in America. They were also widely exported to Britain.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=110}} Benches and [[Couch|settees]] manufactured in America were less influenced by the William and Mary style. Panels, developed in the 1600s, were used for the seat, back, and (where used) arms, with trim and legs reflecting the new style. Leather seats were, however, sometimes added.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=26}}

Another innovation was the [[Tallboy (furniture)|highboy]].{{sfn|Gura|2016|page=16}} Essentially two chests of drawers, the lower slightly larger than the upper, American highboys often featured [[Solomonic column|Solomonic]] or [[trumpet]]-shaped legs. It was somewhat common for the faces of the drawers to have a walnut burl veneer.{{sfn|Butler|Johnson|Skibinski|1985|page=27}}

The William and Mary style lasted past the mid-1700s in rural America, often incorporating both Mannerist and Queen Anne styles. Slats began to be used in backs, and [[yoke]]-shaped crests became common.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=110}}

==Modern popularity==
The William and Mary style has long been overshadowed in both the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]] by the far more popular styles which came after it. Few reproductions of the furniture may be found today. However, numerous examples of William and Mary style furniture can still widely be found in British rural homes.{{sfn|Dillinger|2016|page=71}}
