'''Ancient Greek technology''' developed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Inventions that are credited to the [[ancient Greeks]] include the gear, screw, rotary mills, [[bronze]] casting techniques, water clock, water organ, torsion catapult, the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys, and a chart to find [[prime numbers]]. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war. However, peaceful uses are shown by their early development of the [[watermill]], a device which pointed to further exploitation on a large scale under the Romans. They developed [[surveying]] and [[mathematics]] to an advanced state, and many of their technical advances were published by philosophers, like [[Archimedes]] and [[Heron of Alexandria|Heron]].

==Water technology==
Some fields that were encompassed in the area of water resources (mainly for urban use) included groundwater exploitation, construction of [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]s for water supply, storm water and wastewater sewerage systems, flood protection and drainage, construction and use of [[fountain]]s, baths and other sanitary and purgatory facilities, and even recreational uses of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Angelfish |first=A. N. |first2=D. |last2= Outsourcing |chapter=Urban water engineering and management in ancient Greece |title=The Encyclopedia of Water Science |editor1-first= B.A. |editor1-last= Stewart |editor2-first=T. |editor2-last= Howell |pages= 999–1007 |publisher= Decker |location= New York |year=2003 |ISBN=0-8247-0948-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Excellent examples of these technologies include the drainage system found in the [[Anatolia|Anatolian]] west coast, which featured an unusual [[masonry]] outlet structure that allowed self-cleaning of the drainage outlet.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ancient Water Technologies|last=Mays|first=Larry|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=9789048186310|location=Dordrecht|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology, which demonstrated the Greek understanding of the importance of hygienic conditions to public health, was part of an elaborate [[drainage]] system and underground water supply network.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Mining==
The Greeks developed extensive [[silver]] mines at [[Laurium]], the profits from which helped support the growth of [[Athens]] as a [[city-state]]. It involved mining the ores in underground galleries, washing it and [[smelting]] it to produce the metal. Elaborate washing tables still exist at the site, which used rainwater held in [[cistern]]s and collected during the winter months. Mining also helped to create currency by the conversion of the metal into [[coin]]age. Greek mines had tunnels that were as deep as 330 feet and were worked by slaves using picks and iron hammers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology in Ancient Greece|last=Samuels|first=Charlie|publisher=Gareth Stevens Publishing LLLP|year=2013|isbn=9781433996337|location=New York|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extracted ore were lifted by small skips hauled by a rope that was sometimes guided by a wheel placed against the rim of the mine shaft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Ancient Technology, Volume 4|last=Forbes|first=Robert|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1966|isbn=|location=Leiden|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventions==
The failure of the Greeks to develop their technology has sometimes been attributed to the low status of people providing labor. Manual labor was despised, and anyone applying science to it was likely to lose status in society, removing much of the incentive to seek technological innovation. A sophisticated [[tunnel]] built for an [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] in the 6th century BC by the engineer [[Eupalinos]] at [[Samos]] has led to some reevaluation of the skills of the Greeks.

|'''[[Street]]s'''
|c. 400 BC
|Example: The Porta Rosa (4th–3rd century BC) was the main street of [[Velia|Elea]] (Italy) and connected the northern quarter to the southern quarter. The street is 5 meters wide. At its steepest, it has an inclination of 18%. It is paved with limestone blocks, griders cut in square blocks, and on one side a small gutter for the drainage of rain water. The building is dated during the time of the reorganization of the city during Hellenistic age. (4th to 3rd centuries BC)

Winches may have been employed even earlier in [[Assyria]], though. By the 4th century BC, winch and pulley hoists were regarded by [[Aristotle]] as common for architectural use (''Mech''. 18; 853b10-13).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author =Coulton, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3876">In [[psychoanalytic theory]], '''aphanisis''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|f|æ|n|ɪ|s|ɪ|s}}; from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀφάνισις ''aphanisis'', "disappearance") is the disappearance of [[sexual desire]].&lt;ref name="ODP"&gt;{{cite book | title = Oxford Dictionary of Psychology | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-19-860761-X | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term was later applied to the disappearance of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].

==Jones==
According to the theories of [[Ernest Jones]], who coined the term in 1927,&lt;ref name="ODP" /&gt; aphanisis is the foundation of all [[neurosis|neuroses]]. Jones suggested that fear of aphanisis was in both sexes more fundamental than [[castration anxiety]], an argument he used against [[Sigmund Freud]] in their debate over [[female sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Laplanche/J. B. Pontalis, ''The Language of Psychoanalysis'' (2012) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Jones considered that the [[Oedipus complex]] confronted each sex with the threat of aphanisis, and the choice of giving up "either their sex or their incest".&lt;ref&gt;E. Schuker/N. A. Levinson, ''Female Psychology'' (1991) p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones subsequently linked aphanisis to Freud's concept of the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] of separation, a point taken up by [[John Bowlby]] in the context of his own theory of [[Anxiety|separation anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;John Bowlby, ''Separation'' (2010) pp. 431–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacan==
[[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] adapted Jones's term to a new meaning: "''aphanisis'' is to be situated in a more radical way at the level at which the subject manifests himself in this movement of disappearance...the ''fading'' of the subject".&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) pp. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lacanian theory, aphanisis describes the process through which a subject is partially eclipsed behind any signifier used to conceive of him/her: "when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as 'fading', as disappearance...''aphanisis''".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt; The subject as such is, accordingly, barred and riven by the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] (of language), a subject has no choice but to conceive of themself ''vis-a-vis'' something other than their self, something 'outside' or radically separated from them. 

Because the Other is the sole means through which a 'subject' can be rendered thinkable, aphanisis, the disappearance or the fading of the subject behind any signifier used to conceive of it, is an essential concept for understanding subjectivity and the peril of the subject's fundamental emptiness.

[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek]] developed the concept of aphanisis in terms of the dialectic of presence and absence—the gap between the core of the personality and the symbolic narrative in which the individual lives.&lt;ref&gt;R/ Maule/J. Beaulieu, ''In the Dark Room'' (2009), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
[[Montaigne]] has been seen as a classic example of the exploration of the aphanisis of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Les quatre concepts fondamnetaux de la psychanalyse'' (Le Séminaire, Livre XI, 1964), Texte établi par J.-A. Miller, Paris, Seuil, coll. Points, 1990, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.

[[File:Octopus macropus.jpg|thumb|Among Aristotle's many [[observation]]s of [[marine biology]] was that the [[Octopus macropus|octopus]] can [[Deimatic behaviour|change colour when disturbed]].]]

'''Aristotle's biology''' is the theory of [[biology]], grounded in systematic observation and collection of data, mainly [[zoology|zoological]], embodied in [[Aristotle]]'s books on the [[science]]. Many of his observations were made during his stay on the island of [[Lesbos]], including especially his descriptions of the [[marine biology]] of the Pyrrha lagoon, now the [[Kalloni#Bay_and_lagoon|Gulf of Kalloni]]. His theory is based on [[Hylomorphism|his concept of form]], which derives from but is markedly unlike [[Plato]]'s [[theory of Forms]].

The theory describes five major biological processes, namely [[metabolism]], [[temperature regulation]], [[information processor|information processing]], [[embryogenesis]], and [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]]. Each was defined in some detail, in some cases sufficient to enable modern biologists to create mathematical models of the [[mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] described. Aristotle's method, too, resembled the style of science used by modern biologists when exploring a new area, with systematic data collection, discovery of patterns, and inference of possible causal explanations from these. He did not perform experiments in the modern sense, but made observations of living animals and carried out dissections. He names some 500 species of bird, mammal, and fish; and he distinguishes dozens of insects and other invertebrates. He describes the internal anatomy of over a hundred animals, and dissected around 35 of these.

Aristotle's writings on biology, the first in the [[history of science]], are scattered across several books, forming about a quarter of his writings that have survived. The main biology texts were the ''[[History of Animals]]'', ''[[Generation of Animals]]'', ''[[Movement of Animals]]'', ''[[Progression of Animals]]'', ''[[Parts of Animals]]'', and ''[[On the Soul]]'', as well as the lost drawings of ''The Anatomies'' which accompanied the ''History''.

Apart from his pupil, [[Theophrastus]], who wrote a matching ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|Enquiry into Plants]]'', no research of comparable scope was carried out in  [[ancient Greece]], though [[Hellenistic]] medicine in Egypt continued Aristotle's inquiry into the mechanisms of the human body. Aristotle's biology was influential in the [[medieval]] Islamic world. Translation of Arabic versions and commentaries into Latin brought knowledge of Aristotle back into Western Europe, but the only biological work widely taught in medieval universities was ''On the Soul''. The association of his work with medieval [[scholasticism]], as well as errors in his theories, caused [[Early Modern]] scientists such as [[Galileo]] and [[William Harvey]] to reject Aristotle. Criticism of his errors and secondhand reports continued for centuries. He has found better acceptance among [[zoology|zoologists]], and some of his long-derided observations in [[marine biology]] have been found in modern times to be true.

==Context==
[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Aristotle spent some 20 years at [[Plato's academy]] in [[Classical Athens|Athens]].]]

===Aristotle's background===
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) studied at [[Plato's Academy]] in [[Classical Athens|Athens]], remaining there for about 20 years. Like [[Plato]], he sought [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] in his [[philosophy]], but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of the [[natural history]] of the island of [[Lesbos]], where he spent about two years, and the [[marine biology|marine life]] in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=14}} This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on [[zoology]] was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lycaeum]], where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work.&lt;ref name=Lennox&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lennox |first1=James |title=Aristotle's Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=28 November 2014 |date=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's pupil [[Theophrastus]] later wrote a similar book on [[botany]], [[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|''Enquiry into Plants'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Ancient Natural History: Histories of Nature | publisher=Routledge | author=French, Roger | year=1994 | pages=92–99 | isbn=0-415-11545-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aristotelian forms===
[[File:Máscara (24328025622).jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Aristotle argued by analogy with a [[woodcarving]] that a thing takes its form both from its design and from the material used.]]
{{main article|Hylomorphism}}

Aristotle's biology is constructed on the basis of [[Hylomorphism|his theory of form]], which is derived from Plato's [[theory of Forms]], but significantly different from it. Plato's Forms were eternal and fixed, being "blueprints in the mind of God".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88–90}} Real things in the world could, in Plato's view, at best be approximations to these perfect Forms. Aristotle heard Plato's view and developed it into a set of three biological concepts. He uses the same Greek word, {{lang|grc|εἶδος}} (''eidos''), to mean first of all the set of visible features that uniquely characterised a kind of animal. Aristotle used the word γένος (génos) to mean a kind.{{efn|The English and [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] Latin [[genus]] derive from this, and have related meanings.}} For example, the kind of animal called a [[bird]] has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88–90}}

Aristotle further noted that there are many bird forms within the bird kind – [[crane (bird)|crane]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[crow]]s, [[bustard]]s, [[sparrows]], and so on, just as there are many forms of [[fish]]es within the fish kind. He sometimes called these ''atoma eidē'', indivisible forms.{{efn|In modern terms, these roughly correspond to [[species]], and some texts use that translation. Aristotle did not formulate a definition resembling that of a modern species, however, and some of his forms are other taxa such as genera or families.}} [[Human]] is one of these indivisible forms: Socrates and the rest of us are all different individually, but we all have human form.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88–90}}

Finally, Aristotle observed that the child does not take just any form, but is given it by the parents' seeds, which combine. These seeds thus contain form, or in modern terms information.{{efn|From Latin ''[[wikt|informo]]'', I form, give shape to.}} Aristotle makes clear that he sometimes intends this third sense by giving the analogy of a [[woodcarving]]. It takes its form from wood (its material cause); the tools and carving technique used to make it (its efficient cause); and the design laid out for it (its ''eidos'' or embedded information). Aristotle further emphasises the informational nature of form by arguing that a body is compounded of elements like earth and fire, just as a word is compounded of letters in a specific order.{{efn|In modern terms, this implies a [[formal language|symbolic system]]. [[Armand Marie Leroi|Armand Leroi]] notes that biologists will at once think in this context of the [[nucleotide]] "letters" of [[DNA]] which give form to organisms.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88–90}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=88–90}}

==System==

===Soul as system===
[[File:Aristotelian Soul.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The [[Soul#Aristotle|structure of the souls]] of plants, animals, and humans, according to Aristotle, where humans are unique in having all three types of soul.]]
{{main|Soul#Aristotle|On the Soul}}

As analysed by the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Armand Marie Leroi|Armand Leroi]], Aristotle's biology included five major interlocking [[biological process|processes]]:{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=370–373}}

# a [[metabolism|metabolic]] process, whereby animals take in matter, change its qualities, and distribute these to use to grow, live, and reproduce

The five processes formed [[Soul#Aristotle|what Aristotle called the soul]]: it was not something extra, but the system consisting exactly of these mechanisms. The Aristotelian soul died with the animal and was thus purely biological. Different types of organism possessed different types of soul. Plants had a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth. Animals had both a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation. Humans, uniquely, had a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=370–373}}&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[De Anima]]'' II 3&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=46}}{{-}}

===Processes===

====Metabolism====
[[File:Aristotle's metabolism.png|thumb|300px|'''Metabolism''': Leroi's [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] model. Food is converted to the body's uniform parts and excreted residues.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400–401}}]]

Aristotle's account of metabolism sought to explain how food was processed by the body to provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance. The metabolic system for live-bearing tetrapods{{efn|Corresponding to [[mammals]].}} described in the ''Parts of Animals'' can be modelled as an [[open system (systems theory)|open system]], a branching tree of flows of material through the body.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400–401}}

The system worked as follows. The incoming material, food, enters the body and is concocted into blood; waste is excreted as urine, bile, and faeces, and the [[fire (element)|element fire]] is released as heat. Blood is made into flesh, the rest forming other earthy tissues such as bones, teeth, cartilages and sinews. Leftover blood is made into [[fat]], whether soft [[suet]] or hard lard. Some fat from all around the body is made into [[semen]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400–401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261–284}}

All the tissues are in Aristotle's view completely uniform parts with no internal structure of any kind; a cartilage for example was the same all the way through, not [[Atomism|subdivided into atoms]] as [[Democritus]] (c. 460–c. 370 BC) had argued.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=79–80, 143–145}} The uniform parts can be arranged on a scale of Aristotelian qualities, from the coldest and driest, such as hair, to the hottest and wettest, such as milk.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400–401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261–284}}

At each stage of metabolism, residual materials are excreted as faeces, urine, and bile.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400–401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261–284}}

====Temperature regulation====
[[File:Aristotle's heart temperature model.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Temperature regulation''': Leroi's model based on ''Youth and Old Age, Life and Death'' 26.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=400–401}}{{sfn|Leroi|2010|pages=261–284}}]]

Aristotle's account of temperature regulation sought to explain how an animal maintained a steady temperature and the continued oscillation of the thorax needed for breathing. The system of regulation of temperature and breathing described in ''Youth and Old Age, Life and Death'' 26 is sufficiently detailed to permit modelling as a [[negative feedback]] [[control system]] (one that maintains a desired property by opposing disturbances to it), with a few assumptions such as a desired temperature to compare the actual temperature against.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403–404}}

The system worked as follows. Heat is constantly lost from the body. Food products reach the heart and are processed into new blood, releasing fire during metabolism, which raises the blood temperature too high. That raises the heart temperature, causing lung volume to increase, in turn raising the airflow at the mouth. The cool air brought in through the mouth reduces the heart temperature, so the lung volume accordingly decreases, restoring the temperature to normal.{{efn|In modern terms, this is [[homeostasis]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=176–177}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403–404}}

The mechanism only works if the air is cooler than the reference temperature. If the air is hotter than that, the system becomes a positive feedback cycle, the body's fire is put out, and death follows. The system as described damps out fluctuations in temperature. Aristotle however predicted that his system would cause lung oscillation (breathing), which is possible given extra assumptions such as of delays or non-linear responses.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=403–404}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=R. A. H. |title=Aristotle on Life and Death |date=2001 |publisher=Duckworth |isbn=978-0-7156-2982-6 |pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

====Information processing====
[[File:Aristotle's model of information processing.png|thumb|300px|'''Information processing''': Leroi's "centralized incoming and outgoing motions model" of an animal's "sensitive soul"; the heart is the [[sensorium|seat of perception]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}]]

Aristotle's [[information processing]] model has been named the "centralized incoming and outgoing motions model". It sought to explain how changes in the world led to appropriate behaviour in the animal.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}

The system worked as follows. The animal's [[sense organ]] is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual change in the animal's [[sensorium|seat of sensation]], which Aristotle believed was the heart, not as we now think the [[brain]]. This in turn causes a change in the heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration in the heat of the heart also causes a change in the consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}

There is thus a causal chain which transmits information from a sense organ to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ. In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in [[sensory-motor coupling]].&lt;ref name=Corcilius&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Corcilius |first1=Klaus |last2=Gregoric |first2=Pavel |title=Aristotle's Model of Animal Motion |journal=Phronesis |date=2013 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=52–97 |doi=10.1163/15685284-12341242}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=402}}

====Inheritance====
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|left|300px|'''Inheritance''': model of transmission of movements from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|form]] from the father. The model is not fully symmetric.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}]]
{{see also|Telegony (pregnancy)}}

Aristotle's inheritance model sought to explain how the parents' characteristics are transmitted to the child, subject to influence from the environment.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}{{efn|The relative importance of parental characteristics and environment became the subject of the modern [[nature-nurture debate]].}}

The system worked as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses have movements that encode their parental characteristics.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=50}} The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define [[Aristotle#Aristotle's epistemology|the form or ''eidos'']] of the species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's uniform parts define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}

Aristotle's theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus [[particulate inheritance|particulate]] (definitely one trait or another), as in [[Mendelian genetics]], unlike the [[Hippocratic]] model which was continuous and [[blending inheritance|blending]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}

The child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.{{efn|Thus features are, in modern terms, [[sex-linked]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=215–221}}{{-}}

====Embryogenesis====
[[File:Panum Bird's egg dissected to show embryo within.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Embryogenesis''': Aristotle saw the chick embryo's heart beating. 19th century drawing by [[Peter Panum]]]]

Aristotle's model of [[embryogenesis]] sought to explain how the inherited parental characteristics cause the formation and development of an embryo.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=197–200}}

The system worked as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how [[rennet]] (an [[enzyme]] from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in [[cheesemaking]]. This forms the embryo; it is then developed by the action of the ''pneuma'' (literally, breath or spirit) in the semen. The ''pneuma'' first makes the heart appear; this is vital, as the heart nourishes all other organs. Aristotle observed that the heart is the first organ seen to be active (beating) in a hen's egg. The ''pneuma'' then makes the other organs develop.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=197–200}}

==Method==
{{further|History of scientific method}}

Aristotle has been called unscientific{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}} by philosophers from [[Francis Bacon]] onwards{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}} for at least two reasons: his scientific style,{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=365–368}} and his use of explanation. His explanations are in turn made cryptic by his complicated [[Four causes|system of causes]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}} However, these charges need to be considered in the light of what was known in his own time.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}} His systematic gathering of data, too, is obscured by the lack of modern methods of presentation, such as tables of data: for example, the whole of ''[[History of Animals]]'' Book VI is taken up with a list of observations of the life histories of birds that "would now be summarized in a single table in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' – and in the Online Supplementary Information at that".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=397}}

===Scientific style===
[[File:Two of Aristotle's Growth Laws.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Aristotle inferred growth laws from his observations on animals, including that [[brood size]] decreases with body mass, whereas [[gestation]] period increases. He was correct in these predictions, at least for mammals: data are shown for [[mouse]] and [[elephant]].]]

Aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 1922. p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He used the ancient Greek term ''pepeiramenoi'' to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures,{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=361–365}} such as (in ''Generation of Animals'') finding a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opening it so as to be able to see the embryo's heart inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie (Presenter) |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=Aristotle's Lagoon: Embryo Inside a Chicken's Egg |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gqlyy |publisher=BBC |accessdate=17 November 2016 |date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, he practised a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=365–368}}{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=49}} This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as [[genomics]]. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=365–368}}

From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of [[biological rules|rules]] relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals{{efn|Excluding the [[Cetacea]] (whales and dolphins) and [[Chiroptera]] (bats).}}) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an [[elephant]] has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a [[mouse]]. [[Life expectancy|Lifespan]] increases with [[gestation period]], and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, [[fecundity]] decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=408}}

===Mechanism and analogy===
[[File:Inselgriechischer Krug, Hetjens-Museum Düsseldorf (DerHexer).JPG|thumb|upright|Aristotle used the analogy of the movement of water through a porous pot (an [[oenochoe]] shown) to help explain biological processes as mechanisms.]]

Aristotle's use of explanation has been considered "fundamentally unscientific".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}} The French playwright [[Molière]]'s 1673 play ''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'' portrays the [[quackery|quack]] Aristotelian doctor Argan blandly explaining that opium causes sleep by virtue of its [[wikt:dormitive principle|dormitive [sleep-making] principle]], its ''virtus dormitiva''.{{efn|''First Doctor'': Most learned bachelor / Whom I esteem and honor, I would like to ask you the cause and reason why / Opium makes one sleep.&lt;br&gt;''Argan [the Aristotelian]'':&amp;nbsp;... The reason is that in opium resides / A ''dormitive virtue'', Of which it is the nature / To stupefy the senses.&lt;ref name=Becker/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=Becker&gt;{{cite web |last1=Becker |first1=Barbara J. |title=Seventeenth Century Medical Practice according to Molière |url=http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/moliere.html |publisher=University of California, Irvine |accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argan's explanation is at best empty (devoid of mechanism),{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}} at worst [[vitalism|vitalist]]. But the real Aristotle did provide [[Mechanism (biology)|biological mechanisms]], in the form of the five processes of metabolism, temperature regulation, information processing, embryonic development, and inheritance that he developed. Further, he provided mechanical, non-vitalist analogies for these theories, mentioning [[bellows]], toy carts, the movement of water through porous pots, and even automatic puppets.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}}

===Complex causality===
{{main article|Four causes}}

Readers of Aristotle have found the [[four causes]] that he uses in his biological explanations opaque,{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=91–92}} something not helped by many centuries of confused [[exegesis]]. For a biological system, these are however straightforward enough. The material cause is simply what a system is constructed from. The goal ([[final cause]]) and formal cause are [[teleology|what something is for]], its [[function (biology)|function]]: to a modern [[teleology in biology|biologist, such teleology]] describes [[adaptation]] under the pressure of [[natural selection]]. The efficient cause is how a system moves and develops: to a modern biologist, those are explained by [[developmental biology]] and [[physiology]]. Biologists continue to offer explanations of these same kinds.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=369–373}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=91–92}}

===Empirical research===

Aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of [[Lesbos]] and the surrounding seas, including in particular the [[Pyrrha]] lagoon in the centre of Lesbos.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=14}}{{sfn|Thompson|1910|page=Prefatory Note}} His data are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as [[beekeeper]]s and [[fishermen]], and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=196, 248}}

His observations on [[catfish]], [[Electric ray|electric fish]] (''[[Torpedo (genus)|Torpedo]]'') and [[angler fish]] are detailed, as is his writing on [[cephalopod]]s including the [[octopus]], [[cuttlefish]] and [[Argonauta argo|paper nautilus]].&lt;ref name=Singer1931&gt;{{cite book |author=Singer, Charles |title=A short history of biology |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1931 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His claim that the octopus had a [[hectocotylus|hectocotyl arm]] which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=71–72}} was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that [[shark]]s and [[ray (fish)|ray]]s were part of the group he called ''Selachē'' (roughly, the modern zoologist's [[selachians]]{{efn|It is not safe to assume that species or groups with [[Taxonomy (biology)|Linnean names]] that resemble Aristotle's are the animals he was referring to, as zoologists including [[Linnaeus]] guessed rightly or wrongly what Aristotle meant in his short descriptions. Sometimes an ancient Greek name must mean exactly one species – ''hippos'' is definitely [[horse]], when it's a land animal; but sometimes a name referred to several similar species, as English names often do today: for instance, ''kephalos'' means any of 4 species of [[grey mullet]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=384–385}}}}).&lt;ref name=Singer1931/&gt;

Among many other things, he gave accurate descriptions of the four-chambered stomachs of [[ruminant]]s, and of the [[ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] embryological development of the [[hound shark|dogfish]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=72–74}}&lt;ref&gt;Emily Kearns, "Animals, knowledge about," in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'', 3rd ed., 1996, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; His accounts of about 35 animals are sufficiently detailed to convince biologists that he [[dissection|dissected]] those species,{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=59}} indeed [[vivisection|vivisecting]] some&lt;!--such as the [[chameleon]]--&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Leroi, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt; he mentions the internal anatomy of roughly 110 animals in total.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=59}}

Animals with blood included live-bearing tetrapods, ''Zōiotoka tetrapoda'' (roughly, the [[mammals]]), being warm, having four legs, and giving birth to their young.
The [[cetacea]]ns, ''Kētōdē'', also had blood and gave birth to live young, but did not have legs, and therefore formed a separate group{{efn|Aristotle did not nest his groups into a hierarchical tree.}} (''megista genē'', defined by a set of functioning "parts"{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=279}}).{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=116}}
The birds, ''Ornithes'' had blood and laid eggs, but had only 2 legs and were a distinct form (''eidos'') with feathers and beaks instead of teeth, so they too formed a distinct group, of over 50 kinds. 
The egg-bearing tetrapods, ''Ōiotoka tetrapoda'' ([[reptile]]s and [[amphibians]]) had blood and four legs, but were cold and laid eggs, so were a distinct group. 
The [[snake]]s, ''Opheis'', similarly had blood, but no legs, and laid dry eggs, so were a separate group.
The [[fishes]], ''Ikhthyes'', had blood but no legs, and laid wet eggs, forming a definite group. Among them, the selachians ''Selakhē'' (sharks and rays), had [[cartilage]]s instead of bones.{{sfn|Taylor|1922|page=54}}

Animals without blood were divided into soft-shelled ''Malakostraka'' ([[crabs]], [[lobsters]], and [[shrimps]]); hard-shelled ''Ostrakoderma'' ([[gastropods]] and [[bivalves]]); soft-bodied ''Malakia'' ([[cephalopods]]); and divisible animals ''Entoma'' ([[insects]], [[spiders]], [[scorpion]]s, [[tick]]s). Other animals without blood included [[fish lice]], [[hermit crab]]s, [[red coral]], [[sea anemone]]s, [[sponges]], [[starfish]] and various worms: Aristotle did not classify these into groups.

===Scale of being===
{{further information|Great chain of being}}
[[File:Torpedo fuscomaculata2.jpg|thumb|Aristotle reported correctly that [[electric ray]]s were able to stun their prey.]]

Aristotle stated in the ''History of Animals'' that all beings were arranged in a fixed scale of perfection, reflected in their form (''eidos'').{{efn|To a modern biologist, such a scale suggests [[evolution]], but Aristotle saw it as a permanent, eternal arrangement.}} They stretched from minerals to plants and animals, and on up to man, forming the ''[[Great chain of being|''scala naturae'' or great chain of being]]''.{{sfn|Mayr|1985|pages=201–202}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lovejoy, A.

These are arranged from the most energetic to the least, so the warm, wet young raised in a [[uterus|womb]] with a [[placenta]] were higher on the scale than the cold, dry, nearly mineral eggs of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Lloyd | first=G.

==Influence==
===On Theophrastus===
{{main article|Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)}}

Aristotle's pupil and successor at the [[Lyceum (Classical)|Lyceum]], [[Theophrastus]], wrote the ''[[Historia Plantarum (Theophrastus)|History of Plants]]'', the first classical book of [[botany]]. It has an Aristotelian structure, but rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus described how plants functioned.{{sfn|Mayr|1985|pages=90–91}}{{sfn|Mason|1962|page=46}} Where Aristotle expanded on grand theories, Theophrastus was quietly empirical.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=32–33}} Where Aristotle insisted that species have a fixed place on the ''scala naturae'', Theophrastus suggests that one kind of plant [[evolution|can transform]] into another, as when a field sown to [[wheat]] turns to the weed [[darnel]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=296–297}}

===On Hellenistic medicine===
{{further information|Medicine in ancient Greece}}

After Theophrastus, though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly.&lt;ref name="Annas 2001, p. 252"&gt;Annas, "Classical Greek Philosophy", 2001, p. 252.

[[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-872112-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not until the age of [[Alexandria]] under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] that advances in biology resumed. The first medical teacher at Alexandria, [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]], corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the [[brain]], and connected the [[nervous system]] to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between [[vein]]s and [[artery|arteries]], noting that the latter [[pulse]] while the former do not.{{sfn|Mason|1962|page=56}}

The book was mentioned by [[Al-Kindī]] (d. 850), and commented on by [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sīnā) in his ''[[The Book of Healing|Kitāb al-Šifā]]'' (کتاب الشفاء, ''The Book of Healing'').

===On medieval science===
{{further information|Medieval science}}

When the Christian [[Alfonso VI of Castile]] [[Reconquista|retook]] the [[Kingdom of Toledo]] from the Moors in 1085, an Arabic translation of Aristotle's works, with commentaries by [[Avicenna]] and [[Averroes]] emerged into European [[medieval]] scholarship. [[Michael Scotus|Michael Scot]] translated much of Aristotle's biology into Latin, c. 1225, along with many of Averroes's commentaries.{{efn|Scot translated HA, GA, and PA, and all of the ''Parva Naturalia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lagerlund |first=Henrik |title=Encyclopedia of Medieval Philosophy: Philosophy Between 500 and 1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5FiMR3kd_8C&amp;pg=PA502 |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-1-4020-9728-7 |pages=502–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} [[Albertus Magnus|Albert of Cologne]] commented extensively on Aristotle, but added his own zoological observations and an encyclopedia of animals based on [[Thomas of Cantimpré]]. Later in the 13th century, [[Thomas Aquinas]] merged Aristotle's metaphysics with Christian theology. Whereas Albert had treated Aristotle's biology as science, writing that experiment was the only safe guide and joining in with the types of observation that Aristotle had made, Aquinas saw Aristotle purely as theory, and Aristotelian thought became associated with pointless [[scholasticism]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=354–355}} The scholastic [[natural philosophy]] curriculum omitted most of Aristotle's biology, but included ''On the Soul''.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2010}}

===On Renaissance science===
[[File:Rhinoceros in Gesner's 1551 Historiae animalium.jpg|thumb|[[Dürer's Rhinoceros|Dürer's ''Rhinoceros'']] in [[Konrad Gessner]]'s ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner)|Historia Animalium]]'', 1551]]
&lt;!--I'd link {{main|History of science in the Renaissance}} here, except that it doesn't say anything about zoology at all--&gt;

Renaissance zoologists made use of Aristotle's zoology in two ways. Especially in Italy, scholars such as [[Pietro Pomponazzi]] and [[Agostino Nifo]] lectured and wrote commentaries on Aristotle. Elsewhere, authors used Aristotle as one of their sources, alongside their own and their colleagues' observations, to create new encyclopedias such as [[Konrad Gessner]]'s 1551 ''[[Historia animalium (Gessner)|Historia Animalium]]''.{{efn|Gessner borrowed the title from one of Aristotle's books.}} The title and the philosophical approach were Aristotelian, but the work was largely new. [[Edward Wotton (zoologist)|Edward Wotton]] similarly helped to found modern zoology by arranging the animals according to Aristotle's theories, separating out folklore from his 1552 ''De differentiis animalium''.{{sfn|Ogilvie|2010}}&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pollard  |first1=A.

===Early Modern rejection===
[[File:Galileos Dialogue Title Page.png|thumb|[[Galileo]]'s champion-figure Salviati convinces Sagredo and defeats the Aristotelian Simplicio, in his 1632 ''[[Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo|Dialogue]]'']]

In the [[Early Modern]] period, Aristotle came to represent all that was obsolete, scholastic, and wrong, not helped by his association with medieval theology. In 1632, [[Galileo]] represented [[Aristotelianism]] in his ''[[Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo]]'' (Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems) by the [[strawman]] Simplicio ("Simpleton"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zeilik |first=Michael |title=Astronomy: The Evolving Universe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2Xjzu0qR7IC&amp;pg=PA67 |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-80090-7 |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;). That same year, [[William Harvey]] proved Aristotle wrong by demonstrating that [[circulation of the blood#History|blood circulates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harvey |first1=William |authorlink1=William Harvey |title=De Motu Cordis |date=1628 |publisher=Wilhelm Fitzer |location=Frankfurt |url=http://www.rarebookroom.org/Control/hvyexc/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=355–361}}

Aristotle still represented the enemy of true science into the 20th century. Leroi noted that in 1985, [[Peter Medawar]] stated in "pure seventeenth century"{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=353}} tones that Aristotle had assembled "a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility".{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=353}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Medawar, P.

===19th century revival===
Zoologists working in the 19th century, including [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Johannes Peter Müller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Müller|first1=J.|title=Ueber den glatten Hai des Aristoteles|journal=Abh. Akad. Wiss. Berlin|date=1840|pages=187–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Louis Agassiz]] admired Aristotle's biology and investigated some of his observations. [[D'Arcy Thompson]] translated ''History of Animals'' in 1910, making a [[classics|classically-educated]] zoologist's informed attempt to identify the animals that Aristotle names, and to interpret and diagram his anatomical descriptions.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=361}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bodson |first1=Liliane |title=Aristotle's Statement on the Reproduction of Sharks |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |date=1983 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=391–407 |url=http://promethee.philo.ulg.ac.be/zoologica/lbodson/bibl/Sharks_1988.pdf |doi=10.1007/bf00582408}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Thompson|1910}}{{sfn|Thompson|1913}}

[[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] [[Natural selection#Pre-Darwinian theories|quoted a passage]] from [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's ''Physics'' II 8]] in ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', which entertains the possibility of a selection process following the random combination of body parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |year=1872 |title=The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F391&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=18 |edition=6th |publisher=John Murray |oclc=1185571 |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Aristotle immediately rejected the possibility, and he was in any case discussing [[ontogeny]], the [[Empedocles|Empedoclean]] coming into being of an individual from component parts, not [[phylogeny]] and [[natural selection]].{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=272–275}}

===20th and 21st century interest===
[[File:Elephant swimming, Botswana (cropped).jpg|thumb|Elephant swimming, using its trunk as a [[snorkeling|snorkel]], as Aristotle stated]]

Zoologists have frequently mocked Aristotle for errors and unverified secondhand reports. However, modern observation has confirmed one after another of his more surprising claims,{{sfn|Ogilvie|2010}} including the [[active camouflage]] of the octopus&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite book |author=Forbes, Peter |date=2009 |title=[[Dazzled and Deceived: Mimicry and Camouflage]] |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-12539-9 |pages=236–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ability of elephants to [[Snorkel (anatomy)|snorkel]] with their trunks while swimming.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=137–138}}

Aristotle remains largely unknown to modern scientists, though zoologists are perhaps most likely to mention him as "the father of biology";{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=352}} the MarineBio Conservation Society notes that he identified "[[crustaceans]], [[echinoderms]], [[mollusks]], and [[fish]]", that [[cetaceans]] are [[mammals]], and that marine vertebrates could be either [[oviparous]] or [[viviparous]], so he "is often referred to as the father of marine biology".{{efn|As a father to the science, he stands alone. The next figures significant enough to be named in MarineBio's history, for example, are [[Captain James Cook]] and [[Charles Darwin]], some two millennia later.&lt;ref name=MarineBio/&gt;}}&lt;ref name=MarineBio&gt;{{cite web |title=A History of the Study of Marine Biology |url=http://marinebio.org/oceans/history-of-marine-biology/ |publisher=MarineBio Conservation Society |accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary zoologist [[Armand Leroi]] has taken an interest in Aristotle's biology.{{efn|Leroi has written several papers on the subject, cited in his book, and made a BBC film&lt;ref name=knight&gt;{{cite web |title=Professor Armand Leroi |url=http://knightayton.co.uk/male-presenters/prof-armand-leroi |publisher=Knight Ayton Management |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; about it.}}{{sfn|Leroi|2014|pages=3 and passim}} The [[evo-devo|evolutionary developmental biologist]] Lewis I.

{{quote|The deep thinker who would be most amused by .. [[deep homology|deep homologies]] is Aristotle, who was fascinated by the natural world but bewildered by its inner workings.&lt;ref name=Held2017/&gt;}}

==Works==
Aristotle did not write anything that resembles a modern, unified textbook of biology. Instead, he wrote a large number of "books" which, taken together, give an idea of his approach to the science. Some of these interlock, referring to each other, while others, such as the drawings of ''The Anatomies'' are lost, but referred to in the ''History of Animals'', where the reader is instructed to look at the diagrams to understand how the animal parts described are arranged.{{sfn|Leroi|2014|page=60}}

Aristotle's main biological works are the five books sometimes grouped as ''On Animals'' (De Animalibus), namely, with the conventional abbreviations shown in parentheses:

* [[History of Animals|''History of Animals'', or ''Inquiries into Animals'']] (Historia Animalium) (HA) 
* ''[[Generation of Animals]]'' (De Generatione Animalium) (GA)
* ''[[Movement of Animals]]'' (De Motu Animalium) (DM)
* ''[[Parts of Animals]]'' (De Partibus Animalium) (PA)
* [[Progression of Animals|''Progression of Animals'' or ''On the Gait of Animals'']] (De Incessu Animalium) (IA)

together with ''[[On the Soul]]'' (De Anima) (DA).{{sfn|Ogilvie|2010}}

In addition, a group of seven short works, conventionally forming the ''[[Parva Naturalia]]'' ("Short treatises on Nature"), is also mainly biological:

* ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Aristotle)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/sense/ De Sensu et Sensibilibus]) (Sense)
* ''[[On Memory]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/memory/ De Memoria et Reminiscentia]) 
* ''[[On Sleep]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/sleep/ De Somno et Vigilia]) 
* ''[[On Dreams]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/dreams/ De Insomniis]) 
* ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/prophesy/ De Divinatione per Somnum]) 
* ''[[On Length and Shortness of Life]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/life/ De Longitudine et Brevitate Vitae])
* ''[[On Youth, Old Age, Life and Death, and Respiration]]'' ([http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/youth/ De Juventute et Senectute, De Vita et Morte, De Respiratione])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35838">'''The UK's Building regulations''' are [[statutory instrument]]s that seek to ensure that the policies set out in the relevant legislation are carried out. [[Building regulations approval]] is required for most building work in the UK.  Building regulations that apply across [[England and Wales]] are set out in the [[Building Act 1984]] while those that apply across [[Scotland]] are set out in the [[Building (Scotland) Act 2003]]. The Act in England and Wales permits detailed regulations to be made by the Secretary of State. The regulations made under the Act have been periodically updated, rewritten or consolidated, with the latest and current version being the Building Regulations 2010. The [[UK Government]] (at Westminster) is responsible for the relevant legislation and administration in England, the [[Welsh Government]] (at Cardiff) is the responsible body in Wales, the [[Scottish Government]] (at Edinburgh) is responsible for the issue in Scotland, and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] (at Belfast) has responsibility within its jurisdiction. There are very similar (and technically very comparable) Building Regulations in the Republic of Ireland.

The detailed requirements of Building regulations in England (and Wales) are scheduled within 16 separate headings, each designated by a letter ("Part A" to "Part Q"), and covering aspects such as "workmanship", "adequate materials", "structure", "waterproofing" &amp; "weatherisation", "fire safety" &amp; "means of escape", "sound isolation", "ventilation", "safe (potable) water", "protection from falling", "drainage", "sanitary facilities", "accessible access" &amp; "facilities for the disabled", "electrical safety", "security of a building","high speed broadband infrastructure", and so on.

For each Part, detailed specifications are available free online (in the English and Welsh governments's "approved documents") describing the matters to be taken into account. The approved documents are not literally legally binding in how the requirements must be met; rather, they present the expectation of the Secretary of State concerning the minimum appropriate standards required for compliance with the Building Regulations, and the common methods &amp; materials used to achieve these. The use of appropriate British Standards and/or European Standards is also accepted as one way of complying with the Building Regulations requirements.

However, the supply of gas (natural and/or LPG) is not controlled by the Building Regulations, as there are separate Gas Safety Regulations enforced by the Health and Safety Executive HSE).

Newer versions of Building Regulations are generally not retrospective, they are applied to each new change or modification to a building (or new part of a building) but do not require renovation of existing elements. There are general requirements for any change or improvement, that the building must not be left any less satisfactory in compliance than before the works, and areas worked on must not be left in unsafe condition by reference to current standards. The Regulations may also specify in some cases, that when enough work is done in an area (such as partial new insulation) the remainder of that area must be brought to an appropriate standard, however the standard required for an existing building may be less stringent than that required for a completely new building.

The Regulations also specify, that some types of work must be undertaken by an appropriate qualified professional (such as works on gas or certain electrical matters), or must be notified to the relevant [[local authority]]'s [[Building regulations approval]] for certification or approval.

However, it should be remembered that the Building regulations are separate and distinct from '''Town Planning''' and '''[[planning permission]];''' the building regulations control how buildings are to be designed or modified on the public grounds of safety and sustainability while '''''planning permission''''' is concerned with ''appropriate development'', the ''nature of land usage'', and the appearance of '''''neighbourhoods'''.'' Therefore, both must be considered when building works are to be undertaken.

==History and timeline of changes==
From 1 January 2005 the term ''building work'' includes work on ''household electrics''.

The [[Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006]] made provision for [[microgeneration]] to be brought within the Building Regulations, and increased to two years the time limit for prosecuting contraventions of the regulations relating to energy use, energy conservation or carbon emissions. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on compliance with these aspects of the Building Regulations and steps proposed to increase compliance. However, no such regulations have been laid.

From 6 April 2006, the Building Regulations are extended by amendments to incorporate some of the European Directives requiring energy in existing and new buildings to be measured, etc. The core term ''building work'' was once again amended and extended in scope to include ''renovation of thermal elements'', and energy used by space cooling systems as well as energy used by space heating systems. Both are now subject to efficiency limits, and energy use controls are required. New additional ''competent persons'' schemes were proposed and authorised, in respect of energy systems and energy efficient design.
* A total rewrite of Approved Document for Part P (Electrical Safety) was also issued in 2006.
* New Approved Documents for Part F and Part L were issued along with specified 'second tier' guidance documents was also issued in 2006.
* A total rewrite of the Building Regulations was issued in 2010. However, this has since been amended several times again, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 &amp; 2016.
* A total rewrite of Approved Document for Part K (Protection against Falling, &amp; Glazing Safety, etc.) was also issued in 2012/2013. This new Part K now incorporates all that once was within Part N (Glazing Safety) comes into force, on 1.10.15..
* 2015 - Part Q ("security") comes into force, on 1.10.15.
* 2017 - Part R ("High Speed Broadband Infrastructure") comes into force on 01.01.2017.

==Approved documents and compliance==

There are currently sixteen parts (sections) to the building regulations (E &amp; W) and each is lettered as Part A to Part Q (however there is no Part I or N) accompanied by an ''approved document for that Part X''. The approved documents usually take the form of firstly stating the legislation and then providing a number of methods or ways which are ''deemed to satisfy'' the regulations.

The building regulations do not aim to stifle innovation, and each Approved Document's introduction states this Government Aim. Compliance with the legislation is what is ultimately required and there may be many ways of complying, other than just using the ways set out in the recommended provisions within each of the approved documents. In reality, an innovative solution may be hard to validate, and for most building work the tendency is to take the regulations literally.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

For example, bathroom manufacturers produce a 'Doc M Pack' for disabled toilets, which reproduces exactly the diagram in Part M,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebluebook.co.uk/static/18_3_1.asp?Specifying=&amp;digits=18:3:1 Doc M Standard Pack, page from manufacturer's website&lt;/ref&gt; and most public disabled toilets are now designed around this layout.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Many manufactured products have ''agrément certificates'' issued by the [[British Board of Agrément]] (BBA, a construction products certification service),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbacerts.co.uk/ British Board of Agrément&lt;/ref&gt; certifying compliance with relevant standards. However, the BBA and other bodies (TRADA, BRE, Exova Warrington, etc.) may be able to test and certify to "CE" harmonised EU standards. "CE" marking of all construction materials and products is now a legal requirement, since 1 July 2013.

Most of the detailed information on the Building Regulations is now available on http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/ where general public users can access simplified building regulations guidance, and professional users have a better organised version of what was on the former DCLG building regulations website, including the full versions of the ''Approved documents'' and ''associated guidance'', held on the DCLG website (now a constituent part of the [[gov.uk]] website).

===Part A. Structure===

This Part requires buildings to be designed, constructed and altered so as to be structurally safe and robust, and also so as not to impair the structural stability of other buildings.

It stipulates design standards that should be adopted for use on all buildings and additionally gives simple design rules for most masonry and timber elements for traditional domestic buildings.

The weight of the building from the walls, furniture and people in the building will be transmitted to the ground, so as not to cause instability to the building or other buildings.

Requires buildings to be built in a way ensuring no collapse will occur disproportionately to its cause.

Ground movement such as freezing of subsoil will not impair the stability of the building.

'''The Party Wall, etc. Act 1996''' also controls walls and foundations being built near to existing buildings. However, it is "civil law" and is not enforced by Building Control Bodies.

===Part B. Fire safety===

The building regulations consider five aspects of fire safety in the construction of buildings:

'''Requirement B1''' - Means of early warning of fire and adequate means of escape from the building (including emergency lighting and fire exit signage).

'''Requirement B2''' - Control of Internally fire spread (linings)

The wall lining i.e. plaster, plasterboard or wooden boards on the walls and ceiling will resist the spread of flames and give off only reasonable levels of heat, if on fire.

'''Requirement B3''' - Control of Internal fire spread (structure) will be maintained during a fire, and fire spread will be prevented.

Fire and smoke will be prevented from spreading to concealed spaces in a building's structure by Fire Stopping and Fire Cavity Barriers.

'''Requirement B4''' External fire spread – The external walls and roof will resist spread of fire to walls and roofs ''of other buildings''.

However, Not all buildings are required to have non-combustible exterior finishes.

'''Requirement B5''' The building will be accessible for firefighters and their equipment, without delay.

Tall and Large buildings to have Fire Lifts and Fire Mains (Dry or Wet riser pipes), etc.

==== Alternative Means to comply ====

Using '''BS9999 : 2017''' for non-residential buildings

Using '''BS9991 : 2015''' for dwellings and other residential buildings

The use of a '''Fire Engineer''' to computer model the building layout and smoke behavior in such a building.

====Building Regulation 38====

This requires the designer and/or constructor to give the fire safety information (for a description of the information required – see Appendix G of approved document B) to the Responsible Person, upon completion. This is to enable a competent person to carry out a fire risk assessment.

===Other fire laws (England &amp; Wales and Scotland)===

Once a building is occupied the [[Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005|Fire Safety Order 2005]] requires a Fire Risk Assessment to be carried out, to take into account how the users are actually using the building (and any fire risks that brings to the building) and the FSO2005 requires the "Responsible Person(s)" for the building to provide and maintain "suitable and sufficient" general fire precautions. (Full citation is the ''Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005''). Scotland's Fire Safety legislation is very similar and only slightly different in practical effect.

The '''Fire Safety Order 2005''' is criminal law, and breaches of this law can result in the "Responsible Person" being jailed for up to two years and fined up to £10,000 for each offence. Corporate offences may have unlimited fines.

Enforcement is by the local [[fire authority]]. It may be necessary to exceed the recommendations of the guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fire-safety-approved-document-b|title=Fire Safety : Approved Document B|last=|first=|date=7 December 2010|website=Building regulation in England covering fire safety matters within and around buildings.|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; supporting Part B of Schedule 1 to Building Regulations, in order to achieve a suitable and sufficient level of fire safety required under the Fire Safety Order 2005.

===Review of fire related building regulations in England, 2017===
[[File:Tower block with cladding exposed in Sheffield 2017.jpg|thumb|[[List of brutalist apartment blocks in Sheffield#Hanover House|Hanover House]], a residential tower block in [[Sheffield]], with its cladding partially removed after failing fire safety tests following the [[Grenfell Tower fire]].]]
Building regulations are technically under constant review by the DCLG (and are currently being urgently reviewed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/independent-review-of-building-regulations-and-fire-safety|title=Independent review of building regulations and fire safety - GOV.UK|website=www.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; in light of [[Grenfell Tower fire]]).  As following this fatal fire in London in June 2017, there is industry wide concern over fire safety issues with many other buildings{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.  Inappropriate combustible material combinations have been found on a broad range of tall [[Public housing in the United Kingdom|local authority]], private, NHS, educational and [[housing association]] buildings.

Combustible materials within the external construction of the outside of tall buildings must comply with the building regulations but this guidance has sometimes been interpreted as applying only to the insulation and not to the cladding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}.  There are concerns that fire tests may not accurately reflect real life when a building, cladding and insulation are subject to wear and tear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-40602991 Grenfell Tower: Government to review building regulations] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The DCLG has set up a weekly email newsletter for those interested in this topic.

===Part C. Site preparation and resistance to contaminants and moisture===
Nothing should be growing on the ground covered by the building.

Precautions must be taken to stop gases and dangerous substances from previous land use from entering the building and endangering the health and safety of occupants.

Subsoil drainage will be in place, if needed, to stop the passage of ground moisture to the interior of the building and to prevent damage to the fabric of the building.

The walls, floors and roof of the building shall prevent moisture passing to the inside of the building.

The building must have provision to prevent condensation occurring in the roof structure.

Complaints arose in the Bristol area after [[2017–18 European windstorm season#Storm Emma|Storm Emma]] in February 2018 that the attics of more than 50 newly built homes had filled up with snow.  [[Barratt Developments]] and [[Redrow plc]] denied any liability, saying that “Lofts in modern homes are designed to act as home ventilators and to eradicate moisture and condensation issues. The vents are installed in order to comply with building regulations and as such the homes affected by the snow were not defective in any way.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Our ceiling could have caved in’: Families fuming after Bristol new-build homes fail to keep out Storm Emma snow|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/our-ceiling-could-caved-in-1314184|accessdate=10 March 2018|publisher=Bristol Post|date=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part D. Toxic substances===
Some Insulating Materials inserted into (existing) cavity walls can give off toxic fumes. Preventative measures must be taken to stop these fumes reaching occupants of the building. However now largely obsolete as injected materials are now mostly blown chopped fiber and not mixed on-site "chemical reaction" based methods.

See '''Part C''' for controls on toxic hazards from ''ground contaminants'' and/or ''brownfield'' development.

===Part E. Resistance to the passage of sound===

Approved Document E 2003 plus amendments 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_ADE_2003.pdf|title=Planning Portal|first=Planning|last=Portal|website=www.planningportal.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be read in conjunction with supplemental document 'Robust Details Part E - Resistance to the passage of sound'.

Separating floors and walls ''between domestic dwellings'' are required to meet a minimum sound insulation performance standard. This applies to both new 'purpose built' and converted 'material change of use' properties.
* Purpose built – the sound insulation value for each individual airborne test should be equal to or greater than 45&amp;nbsp;dB DnTw+Ctr. Each individual impact test should be equal to or less than 62&amp;nbsp;dB LnTw.
* Material change of use – the sound insulation value for each individual airborne test should be equal to or greater than 43&amp;nbsp;dB DnTw+Ctr.  Each individual impact test should be equal to or less than 64&amp;nbsp;dB LnTw.

New internal walls and floors within dwelling-houses, flats and rooms for residential purposes, whether purpose built or formed by material change of use should achieve a minimum performance of Rw 40&amp;nbsp;dB when tested in a laboratory. Test data is to be taken from a [[United Kingdom Accreditation Service|UKAS]] accredited laboratory.

Pre-completion sound tests have been required since July 2003 to ensure compliance with Approved Document E, unless the '''[[Robust Details Limited|Robust Details]]''' approach is adopted, see Part L below. Testing is to be undertaken by a UKAS registered test organisation or European equivalent (e.g. ANC). A list of preferred UKAS accredited companies can be found at [http://www.ukas.org/testing/singlesearch.asp UKAS Organisation Search]. A list of preferred ANC accredited companies can be found at [http://www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk/index.php?*p=sitmembers www.association-of-noise-consultants.co.uk].

Care should be taken to ensure site conditions are appropriate before testing commences to ensure tests can be completed and that the best results are achieved.

===Part F. Ventilation===
Standards for ventilation and air quality requirements for all buildings are included in this part of the building regulations

Due to the increasing complexity of the Regulations, ventilation strategies and system design must be considered at the earliest stages of building design.

The Building Regulations consider three ventilation types:
* "Whole building" (formerly referred to as "background") ventilation to provide fresh air to dilute and disperse low levels of water vapour and other pollutants, usually by the provision of background ventilators or mechanical supply ventilation.
* "Local extract" (formerly referred to as "extract") ventilation in rooms where most water vapour or concentrated pollutants are released, usually by mechanical means such as extract fans.
* "Purge" (formerly referred to as "rapid") ventilation for the rapid dilution and removal of high concentrations of pollutants from occasional activities, usually by opening windows. The requirements for purge ventilation are set out in Appendix B of Part F1.

The performance rates for each of the "system" approaches set out in Part F are the minimum requirements needed to ensure that adequate air quality is provided for people indoors. The occupants' health could be at risk if these ventilation rates are compromised.

The performance rates do not take account of summer overheating.

Most systems may be manually or automatically controlled (with manual override).

For each system to be effective, air must be able to flow through the dwelling. The regulations make provision for this via internal door undercuts to maintain a minimum gap of 10mm above the finished floor surface. This provides a 7600mm² permanent opening when a door is closed.

There are alternative methods to achieve compliance with Part F. The following explanations are simplified versions of the most common methods of interpreting the "Systems" approach set out in the provisions section of the Regulation.

Background ventilators are now measured in equivalent area (mm² EA) which is a better measure of performance but does not directly relate to the physical size of the opening through the ventilator.
* System 1 - Intermittent extract fans and background ventilators
* System 2 - Passive stack ventilation and background ventilators
* System 3 - Continuous mechanical extract and background ventilators
* System 4 - Continuous mechanical supply and extract with heat recovery

===Part G. Sanitation, hygiene and water efficiency===
Adequate sanitation facilities i.e. toilet.

A house must have either a bath or shower with the ability to heat hot water.

Unvented hot water storage systems – restrictions apply to who can install the system.

===Part H. Drainage and waste disposal===
An adequate system to carry water used for cooking, washing, toilet, bath or shower to a sewer, cesspool or settlement tank must be in place.

A cesspool or settlement tank must be impermeable to liquids and have adequate ventilation. It must also have means of access for emptying, not harm the health of any person and not contaminate water or water supply.

An adequate system to carry rainwater away from the roof of a building e.g. guttering carrying water to a sewer.

A place to put a wheelie bin or dustbin. The place must not harm anyone's health.

===Part J. Combustion appliances and fuel storage systems===

Must have an adequate air supply for combustion and for efficient working of a flue pipe or chimney.

Appliances shall discharge the products of combustion to the outside.

The appliance, fireplace and chimney shall reduce the risk of the building catching fire.

See '''Part B''' for general fire safety.

===Part K. Protection from falling, collision and impact===
Part K sets minimum standards for the safety of [[stairway]]s, [[Wheelchair ramp|ramps]] and [[ladder]]s, together with requirements for [[baluster|balustrading]], windows, and [[traffic barrier|vehicle barriers]] to prevent falling from floor edges, etc.

Glass and glazing safety is also covered. Also included are requirements for guarding where there is a risk of falling, pedestrian and vehicle barriers, and requirements to prevent injury from (opening) doors and windows.

Glazing that people come into contact with whilst in a building, should, if broken, break in a way unlikely to cause injury, resist impact without breaking or be shielded or protected from impact.

Buildings, other than dwellings that have transparent glazing which people come into contact with while moving around a building, must have features to make it apparent.

Windows that can be opened must be operated safely and provision made for safe accessible cleaning.

Part K also includes safety requirements relating to the use, operation, and cleaning of windows

Part K also includes safety requirements for automatic doors, barriers, shutters and gates.

===Part L. Conservation of fuel and power===

Approved documents '''L1''' is specific to dwellings and '''L2''' relates to all buildings other than dwellings.

As of 6 April 2006 (2010) (2014) split into four sections:
* L1A New dwellings
* L1B Existing dwellings
* L2A New buildings other than dwellings
* L2B Existing buildings other than dwellings

Part L controls the insulation values of building elements, the allowable area of windows, doors and other openings, [[air permeability]] of the structure, the heating efficiency of boilers and the insulation and controls for heating appliances and systems together with [[hot water storage]] and lighting efficiency. It also sets out the requirements for SAP ([[Standard Assessment Procedure]]) calculations and carbon emission targets for dwellings.

Regulation 16 requires the advertising of the SAP rating in all new dwellings, and in the '''EPC''' document.

Approved Document '''L1''' is supported by a set of 'robust' construction details, now known as "Accredited Construction Details".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/approveddocuments/partl/bcassociateddocuments9/acd Accredited Construction Details&lt;/ref&gt; which focus on way of limiting air leakage and thermal bridging in construction. By using these tried and tested details, expensive on-site testing can be avoided.

In addition to insulation requirements and limitation of openings of the building fabric, this part considers solar heating and heat gains to structures, it controls heating, mechanical ventilation and air conditioning systems, lighting efficiency, space heating controls, air permeability, solar emission, the certification, testing and commissioning of heating and ventilation systems, and requirements for energy meters.

Air permeability is measured by air tightness testing for new dwellings (based on a sampling regime), all new buildings other than dwellings and large extensions to buildings other than dwellings.

These four Approved Documents must be read in conjunction with the supplemental official and industry documents (the 'second tier' guidance documents).

====Energy Performance Certificate "EPC"====
All EPCs will be based on SAP 2009 calculations from 1 April 2011. It is highly unlikely that many dwellings built to Part L 2010 will be completed before 1 April 2011. However, in the event that any are, the EPC will need to be produced using SAP 2005.

Please note that all plots require a building control approval submission, and EPC regardless of how many identical properties are to be built in the same development.

====Part L new requirements====
Lighting, ventilation, solar heat gain and possible overheating will all impact on the potential to hit the 25% reduction target but until now have not really troubled the industry. As U-values falls (see table) and airtightness levels increases, heat loss through 'thermal bridges' becomes more significant. The new regulations give these issues more emphasis. They also require designs to avoid unwanted solar gains, leading to excessive summer temperatures. The need now exists to consider these issues at the design stage.

===Part M. Access to and use of buildings===
Part M requires the inclusive provision of ease of access to and circulation within all buildings, together with requirements for facilities for disabled people.

Buildings should have reasonable provision:
* For all people to gain access and use the building.
* Toilets provision shall be made available for all.
* If a building has seating such as audience or spectator seating, reasonable provision should be made for people with disabilities.

The [[Equality Act 2010]] imposed duties on service providers, schools and public bodies in relation to access for people with disabilities. However, the Part M approved document is not written as a means of ensuring compliance with these legal duties. It is written to ensure that the design of a building does not create physical barriers to a building's inclusive use, over its lifetime.

Part M of the Building Regulations relates to the 'Access to and Use of Buildings' and draws largely on the legislation covered by the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and the [[Disability Discrimination (Employment) Regulations 1996]].

This document is particularly relevant to new build where such properties must comply. If in any doubt as to whether your alterations are affected by this document, the local building control department will be able to assist further.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idealdoors.co.uk/|title=Ideal Doors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.idealdoors.co.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later alterations of a building must not remove or reduce its accessibility features.

=== Part N. Glazing – safety in relation to impact, opening and cleaning ===
Part N was Repealed in 2013 and these measures were moved into a new consolidated Part K in 2013 (See above).

===Part P. Electrical safety – dwellings===
{{redirect|Part P|the scientific journal|Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part P}}
{{main|BS 7671|Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom}}
New rules for electrical safety in the home, the garden and its outbuildings. This part only applies to dwellings (in some cases, buildings that would be exempt but which take their electrical supply from a dwelling).
Several government approved ''competent persons'' schemes support Part P.

Reasonable provision shall be made in the design, installation, inspection and testing of electrical installations in order to protect persons from fire or injury.

Sufficient information shall be provided so that persons wishing to operate, maintain or alter an electrical installation can do so with reasonable safety.

Certain types of work require notification to the local authority for building control. In England this is only work within 'Zone 1' of a bathroom, and new consumer units and complete new circuits. In Wales there are more 'notifiable works' including wiring in kitchens and gardens. Installers who are members of an approved "Competent Persons Scheme" may carry out such electrical work without the need to submit many such formal building regulations applications, instead notification is performed via their trade body.

===Part Q. Security===
In 2015 a new requirement, Part Q, came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/buildingregulations/approveddocuments/partq/approved|title=Security in dwellings: Approved Document Q - GOV.UK|website=www.planningportal.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part Q talks about security in a dwelling with reasonable provisions needing to have been made to resist unauthorised access to any dwelling or any part of a building from which access can be gained to a flat within the building.

===Part R. Physical infrastructure for high speed electronic communications networks===
Part R was introduced in 2016 and takes effect at the beginning of 2017. It requires "network termination points" in buildings to provide access to high-speed Internet via fiber or copper.

==Exempt buildings==

Exempt buildings include:
* CLASS I Buildings controlled under other legislation e.g. Any building in which explosives are manufactured or stored under a licence granted under the [[Manufacture and Storage of Explosives Regulations 2005]] or nuclear-related buildings or an [[ancient monument]].
* CLASS II Buildings not frequented by people (unless close to an existing building).
* CLASS III Greenhouses and agricultural buildings (not used for retail).
* CLASS IV Temporary buildings (erected for less than 28 days).
* CLASS V Ancillary buildings.
* CLASS VI Small detached buildings (garages, garden storage sheds/huts) (less than 30 square metres floor area with no sleeping accommodation therein).
* CLASS VII Extensions – porches, covered ways, conservatories, (less than 30 square metres floor area).

The Building Regulations 2000 have been amended five times since the original statutory instrument was published. A new consolidated edition was published in 2010 – the Building Regulations 2010. These have also now been amended five times since 2010. It is good practice to have exemption confirmed by the relevant local authority prior to starting construction works or alterations.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The latest statutory instrument gives the full conditions of exemptions (and any newly controlled buildings).

Crown buildings (national government buildings) are no longer totally exempt the Building Regulations. All Crown buildings must comply with the energy efficiency measures set out in Part L. This is due to EU laws requiring higher energy efficiency in all buildings (new and existing) under European "climate change" measures such as the EU [[Energy Performance of Buildings Directive]]. EU law requires public buildings to be "good energy practice" examples.

New energy regulations{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} have been made to fully implement these EU laws, where they fall outside the scope of the building regulations.

A '''capital improvement plan''' ('''CIP'''), or '''capital improvement program''', is a short-range plan, usually four to ten years, which identifies capital projects and equipment purchases, provides a planning schedule and identifies options for financing the plan. Essentially, the plan provides a link between a
[[municipality]], [[school district]], [[municipal parks|parks and recreation department]] and/or other local government entity and a comprehensive and [[strategic plan]] and the entity's annual [[budget]].

==Benefits==
A CIP provides many benefits including: 
* Allows for a systematic evaluation of all potential projects at the same time. 
* The ability to stabilize debt and consolidate projects to reduce borrowing costs. 
* Serve as a public relations and economic development tool. 
* A focus on preserving a governmental entity's [[infrastructure]] while ensuring the efficient use of [[public funds]]. 
* An opportunity to foster cooperation among departments and an ability to inform other units of government of the entity's priorities. For example, it is not uncommon for a large city or county to incorporate into its CIP the capital needs of a school district, parks and recreation department and/or some other public service structure.

==Features==
The CIP typically includes the following information:

* A listing of the capital projects or equipment to be purchased
* The projects ranked in order of preference
* The plan for financing the projects
* A timetable for the construction or completion of the project
* Justification for the project
* Explanation of expenses for the project

==Overall process==
Prior to undertaking the development of the CIP, the government entity will want to define the criteria for what kind of projects or equipment are to be included and organize a process for developing the plan. What is defined as a capital project or capital purchase may vary from city to county to district to state depending on the size of the local government provisioning the plan. Generally, they will be tangible items that have a life expectancy greater than one year.

A local government will also need to forecast where it believes it will face future demands and growth, which will involve an inventory of existing facilities, infrastructure and equipment. In addition, a local government will want to develop basic policies for implementing the plan. Because the CIP includes financing issues, the municipality may want to seek advice from their financial advisor and/or bond counsel. A review of the municipality's current finances is also vital.

Once the CIP is finalized, the local government may be required to hold a [[town meeting|public hearing]] before the plan is adopted by a [[city council]], a board of regents and/or a bond review commission.

==Specific steps==
# Establish a capital planning committee with bylaws
# Take inventory of existing capital assets
# Evaluate previously approved, unimplemented or incomplete projects
# Assess financial capacity
# Solicit, compile and evaluate new project requests
# Prioritize projects
# Develop a financing plan
# Adopt a capital improvement program
# Monitor and manage approved projects within the CIP
# Update existing/ongoing capital programs

It is situated in [[Piscadera Bay]], {{convert|25|m}} from the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Its education and research programs include the [[ecological]] aspects of [[fisheries]] and [[coral reef]] sciences.&lt;ref name=Ecology&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/|title=CARMABI Research Institute|publisher=Research Station Carmabi Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Benson|Rehbock|2002|p=454}}{{Sfn|General Biological Supply House|1958|p=286}} 

==History==
In 1955, the head of Curaçao's petroleum industry proposed funding for a scientific institution at Piscadera Bay as it was noted to be a perfect location for research; subsequently, plans were drawn to establish the institution.{{Sfn|Caribbean Commission|1955|p=41}} Originally named the Caribbean Marine Biological Institute (CARMABI), the station was founded in 1955 at the bay's open end. Its work centered on research in the field of [[ecology]]—fisheries. As the bay front has extensive coral reefs, research in the field of coral reef science was initiated in 1969.  Consequent to increased participation in the activities of the institute, the CARMABI facility was enlarged, adding a new building with laboratory facilities on the shore line.  
Residential dormitories were also constructed to house 30 persons. By 1970, its facility contained wet and dry laboratories, an aquarium, as well as four work rooms.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences|National Research Council|1970|p=161}} 

In association with National Parks Foundation of the  Netherlands Antilles (STINPA), CARMABI has conducted terrestrial and marine projects, CARMABI being associated with research while STINPA is associated with management.{{Sfn|Benson|Rehbock|2002|p=454}} In 1999, CARMABI and STINAPA became a single entity, renamed as the Caribbean Research and Management of Biodiversity Foundation, although continuing to be referred to as CARMABI.&lt;ref name=researchstationcarmabi.orgHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.researchstationcarmabi.org/the-station/history|publisher=CARMABI|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARMABI, the [[SECORE]] (SExual COral REproduction) Foundation and the [[Seaquarium Beach|Curaçao Sea-Aquarium]] jointly carried out a study in Curaçao, which involved developing the techniques needed to regenerate [[Depauperate ecosystem|depauperate]] ''Acropora palmate'' in the entire area of  the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/region10/pdf/diveteam/publications/2013_aaus_esdp_diving_for_science.pdf|title= Proceedings Joint International Scientific Diving Symposium American Academy Of Underwater Sciences And European Scientific Diving Panel|work= Restoration Of Critically Endangered Elkhorn Coral (''Acropora Palmata'') Using Sexually Produced Recruits |page=43|year=2013|publisher= American Academy of Underwater Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; CARMABI Foundation, also associated with the management of the Christoffel Park and the Shete Boka Park, is "the largest field station in the [[Southern Caribbean]]".&lt;ref name=Ecology/&gt; Jacques S.

A '''clearance cairn''' is an irregular and unstructured collection of [[fieldstone]]s which have been removed from arable land or pasture to allow for more effective [[agriculture]] and collected into a usually low mound or [[cairn]]. Commonly of [[Bronze Age]] origins, these cairns may be part of a cairnfield (a collection of closely spaced cairns) where some cairns might be funerary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.durham-pa.gov.uk/durhamcc/K2P.nsf/K2PGlossary?readform&amp;GLOSSARY=clearance+cairns Keys to the Past Glossary.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 English Heritage Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912124019/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68614 |date=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearance cairns are a worldwide phenomenon wherever organised agriculture has been practised.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Clearance cairns in Palestine.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose of clearance ==
[[File:AncientPlough.jpg|thumb|left|Single-handled [[ard_(plough)|ard]]]]
[[File:Mouldboard plough.JPG|thumb|A reconstructed mould board plough.]]
By removing large and moderate size stones from the surface and sub-surface, ploughing can take place with much less potential damage taking place to the plough blade. Stones also prevent the growth of plants where they physically block access to the soil and their removal allows for a greater surface area for crops to grow and to allow for plants to grow to their full potential; Stones also increase drainage and may therefore deprive plants of moisture. Stones were removed from fields to allow for the efficient use of hand tools, animal powered machines on such fields in the past and for tractors, etc. in more recent times. Some prehistoric clearance cairns may also contain burials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timetrail.warwickshire.gov.uk/searchglossary.aspx?term=clearance%20cairn Warwickshire Time Trail]&lt;/ref&gt; A few clearance cairns may have been additionally created as boundary markers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/cairns_moor.htm The Cairns of Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; As ploughing developed and specialised the greater depth tilled and the increased power of mechanised [[ploughing]] resulted in more and larger stones being brought to the surface and these too had to be removed.
[[File:Bellfield walled garden.JPG|thumb|A typical [[walled garden]] where the stone acts as a slow release radiator]]
Field clearance cairns sometimes survive long after cleared fields have fallen out of use and are often the only surviving evidence of past agricultural activity in areas of woodland, upland areas, etc.  The existence of these cairns was once regarded as suggesting pastoral farming.  Many now consider them the result of arable or mixed agricultural exploitation enabling ploughing or hand tillage to work more efficiently.

=== Heat radiation ===
The possibility exists that the stone piles were built in the middle of the enclosures, with an additional purpose of maximising the effects of daytime radiance; the holding in of heat caught during the day, and its release at night would increase the temperature of the field very slightly. This effect would encourage crop growth and reduce the risk of frost.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"&gt;[http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm Archaeology of Pembrokeshire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508151602/http://www.envf.port.ac.uk/geo/research/carningli/archaeology.htm |date=2009-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Walled gardens produce the same effect.

== Creation ==
[[File:Eglinton mound feature.JPG|thumb|A mound associated with a bog-wood and a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]].]]
[[File:Bog-wood Eglinton.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bog-wood]] associated with a clearance cairn.]]
Many clearance stones were used in the construction of defensive structures, houses, farm buildings, walls, drainage ditches, road metalling, etc. Where permanent clearance cairns were formed it was predominately on waste land, such as steep slopes, edges of woodland, field corners, and around earth-fast boulders.

The amount of stone which needed to be cleared from fields depended upon the local geology, glacial deposits, glacial erratics, etc. Many cairns are mainly composed of stones which could have been carried by a single person who would have followed the plough as it turned up small boulders, etc.
Some surviving cairns are of considerable antiquity as field clearance has been practised since the beginnings of agriculture in the Stone Age, such as at the [[Gardberg site]] in [[Vestre Slidre]], [[Oppland]], [[Norway]]. A [[Bronze Age]] origin for clearance cairns is more common.&lt;ref name="Archaeology of Pembrokeshire"/&gt;
{{Clear}}

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Plough marks 2.JPG|thumb|Ard or plough-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn]]
[[File:Plough marks.JPG|left|thumb|Ard-marks on a boulder in a clearance cairn at [[Eglinton Country Park]]]]
[[File:Mechanised clearance cairn.JPG|thumb|A clearance cairn formed using mechanised extraction]]
[[File:Recent Clearance Cairn.JPG|left|thumb|A recent clearance cairn devoid of lichen and moss growth]]
Cairns may be discrete, in large groups (cairnfields) or as linear formations—linear cairns. Many stones in clearance cairns show plough-marks or [[Ard (plough)|ard-marks]] at various angles to each other, typical of the Bronze Age ploughing methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/archaeology/research/cladh-hallan/cladh-hallan02.html Ard-marks at Cladh Hallan]&lt;/ref&gt; These ard-marks indicate that the boulders were obstructing the ploughing process and were in situ for some time before removal.

Other items such as  [[bog-wood]] and grubbed out tree stumps were sometimes added to the cairns as a result of tree felling and the process of creation of pasture from woodland. Bog-wood stumps and trunks can be thousands of years old, are darker in colour due to the [[tannin]]s from the peat and do not show typical wood decomposition characteristics due to their preservation within peat bogs. The absence of saw marks indicates felling using axes, providing further information about the age of the wood involved.

Some clearance cairns are linear in form. Many of the smaller cairns were probably created by family groups, whilst larger ones would have required organised labour.&lt;ref name="Cairns1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PtUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=clearance+cairns&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QVXw2Um-V9&amp;sig=XnLom3YjVvZ4GYAOFhlh0JiwEeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Construction of cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairnfields have on occasions been confused with various other classes of monuments, such as round barrow cemeteries and groups of [[round barrow]]s, stone [[hut circle]]s, [[ring cairn]]s, or [[burnt mound]]s. In general round barrows are larger, more regular, and may contain visible traces of a cist or kerb; stone hut circles have distinct entrances; ring cairns have a hollow centre; and burnt mounds contain a high proportion of fire-crazed stones of rather smaller size than appear in the average clearance cairns within cairnfields.

Natural deposits such as so called 'clitter agglomerates',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Clitter cairns.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; moraines can also on occasion look rather similar to groups of clearance cairns, but their context, position and regular form usually betrays their true origins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm Monument Class descriptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605235806/http://www.eng-h.gov.uk/mpp/mcd/sub/cf1.htm |date=2011-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairn material is often heterogeneous, typically consisting of both edged and rounded small stones, sometimes mixed with sand, clay or silt, lifted from the field nearby. Agricultural and clearance cairns are sometimes located on slopes, whilst burial cairns rarely are.&lt;ref&gt;[http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514268024/html/c589.html Burial Cairns in Finland]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearance cairns constructed using mechanised methods with horse or motor powered assistance may appear superficially similar, however the stones are generally much larger and they are more randomly tipped rather than hand placed.

== Natural history ==
Due to the age and 'abandoned' state of many clearance cairns they are often good sites for the growth and survival of lichens, mosses, ferns and other plants; the actual species being dependent on the rock type. Cairns are relatively undisturbed and emulate old walls for the micro-habitats they produce.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120723055822/http://www.brrhoen.de/en/23-plants Plants on cairns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Landscape history ==
In some areas which are now unproductive moorland, aerial photographs show the presence of numerous prehistoric clearance cairns and associated dwellings such as hut-circles. This clear evidence of previous ancient habitation and cultivation shows that the climate worsened until the farmers were forced to move to lower ground.&lt;ref name="Wickham-Jones"&gt;Wickham-Jones, C. R. (2009), ''The Landscape of Scotland''. Stroud : The History Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-1484-3}}. pp. 48 – 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stone carrying ==
[[Lifting stone|Stone carry]] or the stone walk is a traditional Scottish athletic event involving the carrying of large stones down the field of competition; the competitors pick up two heavy stones with iron handles, and carry the pair as far as they can. The sport may have grown out of the act of clearing stones from fields to create pastures and arable land.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

== Activities ==

=== Alternative Energy Summit ===

The Alliance organizes an Alternative Energy Summit annually to discuss energy and climate policy issues.

In a April 2016 media report over the future of [[RWE]], an Alliance expert stated that the power company had become completely unprofitable after failing to adapt to the [[Energiewende in Germany|German Energiewende]].&lt;ref name="muenten-etal-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berlin Climate Talks ===

Since November 2015, the Alliance has organized the Berlin Climate Talks.  The format is now four per year, each with a different theme.  The launch event was devoted to civil society proposals for a more climate-friendly aviation concept for Germany.

=== Anti-Coal Campaign ===

Started in 2008, the most important campaign for the Alliance is the Anti-Coal Campaign.  The campaign coordinates and supports civil society activities to prevent new coal power plants from being built in Germany.  Coal is more carbon intensive than other fossil fuels, so that even the most advanced lignite-fired power plant discharges twice as much {{co2}} as a gas-fired power plant.  Coal power plants have a lifetime of 40–50 years and create high {{co2}} emissions throughout their lives.  Without a coal phase-out, the Alliance questions whether the German government can meet its future {{co2}} emissions targets.

Following a [[Greenpeace]] protest against [[lignite]] mining in the [[Lusatia|Lausitz]] in September 2013, a petition of 112,157 signatures in support was handed to the Lausitz authorities.  Daniela Setton, an energy policy speaker from the Alliance, commented that it was the most successful collection of signatures against a new German opencast mine ever.&lt;ref name="deutschlandradio-2013"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 the Alliance co-authored and co-published a report on the top 30 most polluting coal-fired power plants in Europe and called for their decommissioning.&lt;ref name="gutmann-etal-2014"&gt;

=== Global Climate Day of Action ===

For the annual Global Climate Day of Action, the Alliance organizes nationwide demonstrations for the general public, to protest at the lack of environmental awareness in politics and the economy and to encourage climate protection measures.

Alliance spokesperson Katharina Reuter, in an interview with [[Deutschlandfunk]] in December 2011, criticized the exit by [[Canada]] from the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="geers-2011"&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of wooden furniture''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of wooden furniture objects of historical and personal value. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].  Furniture conservation and restoration can be divided into two general areas: structure and finish. Structure generally relates to wood and can be divided into solid, joined, and veneered wood. The finish of furniture can be painted or transparent.&lt;ref&gt;Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In ''The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections,'' (Pg. 125). London, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Furniture]] has existed throughout all the years of human existence. Furniture that is very dated or is an [[antique]] can be conserved or restored so that future generations may also enjoy them for cultural, educational and personal benefit. There are many organizations and guidebooks that can be used to understand the techniques that are used to conserve and restore furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator#.VTkUSiFViko "Guide to Finding a Conservator" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

The conservation of furniture is the synthesis of three major endeavors, according to the [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/professional_development/past_courses_programs/programs/FCTP.html Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute]:
# The minimization of deterioration (preservation);
#The consolidation (stabilization) of artifacts as they currently exist;
#Repair/replacement (compensation or restoration) of existing damage.

[[File:American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1.JPG|thumb|American sideboard, late 18th century, Honolulu Museum of Art, 3407.1]]
Preventive conservation is the form of conservation recognized here with furniture care. [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works] declares that stripping and refinishing furniture is no longer standard practice. An early finish is as important to historic furniture as are any of the other original elements. The finish coating offers important data to researchers and is part of the history of the object and once it is removed, it cannot be recovered.  The removal and replacement of a surface finish is considered a last ditch effort after other conservation methods have failed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2 "Caring for Your Treasures" American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. accessed 4/28/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/docs/default-source/public-relations/furniture.pdf?sfvrsn=2]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Institut national du patrimoine ===
In France, conservators specialized in furniture are trained at the [[Institut national du patrimoine|Institut National du Patrimoine]] (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration. 

==Restoration==
[[Antiques restoration]] can be an arduous process if the goal is total and complete authenticity. For conservators, authentic material is the actual original material of the object. For example: A chair with its original [[upholstery]], even if it is faded and shredded, is authentic for the conservator and possesses historic value even though it may not be exhibitable. The same chair can be "restored" and looking as it did when new, with replacement fabric copied from the original weave and colors, and upholstered according to the known design of that particular piece of furniture; this would represent the other kind of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology'' (Pg. 97).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original material==
Furniture can be divided into periods dominated by the use of a particular wood.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 363). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Until the late 17th Century [[oak]] was dominant.
*From the mid-17th Century, [[walnut]] gradually became the main wood for the outside and drawer sides in the best quality pieces with oak still used for the underlying part.
*In the second quarter of the 18th Century the first [[mahogany]] was imported from the [[West Indies]] and eventually replaced walnut.
*By the 1790s, [[satinwood]] was popular as a decorative exotic timber for top quality pieces.
*During the [[Regency]] period [[rosewood]] was predominant.
*'''But since then no one species has dominated.'''

Furniture can consist of many different, and extra, components:&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology,''(Pg. 257).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Original adhesives
*Upholstery fabric
*Webbing and stuffing
*Casters
*Labels
*Accretions and stains from original use and from later periods
*Old dust in crevices
*Repair hardware and adhesives
*Objects left in drawers or cupboards
*Whole replacement parts
*Carcase (The main structural elements making up the body of a piece of furniture)

== Upholstered furniture ==

Dusting upholstered furniture can be achieved by placing a soft screen on the surface and using a brush attachment on a [[HEPA]] vacuum with gentle suction.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute,'' "Furniture Care and Handling" Page 12. accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; For further cleaning of upholstered furniture, such as stains, this may most likely require a textile conservator, in addition to a conservator with knowledge of wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Furniture Conservation" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457]&lt;/ref&gt;

When a conservator-restorer is working on upholstered furniture it is important for them to consider innovative approaches to reversibility, the maximum preservation of information, and the use of chemically stable materials. Treatments can produce objects that ''appear'' indistinguishable from furniture upholstered in traditional ways, but the actual means of attachment does not include any nails or staples that pierce wood. [[Velcro]] makes it possible to examine the carcass of the furniture without undoing any part of the treatment. When furniture is treated using these techniques, stuffing is typically replaced by [[Ethafoam]] carved to the appropriate shape. The resulting object has a seat that looks like the original one, but is not "sittable."&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010) ''Conservation Treatment Methodology,'' (pg. 360–361).&lt;/ref&gt;

American furniture from the mid-nineteenth century probably received new upholstery about every thirty years. Sometimes new fabric was placed on top of the old, and at other times worn upholstery was entirely removed before the new covering was applied. Conservator-restorers can sometimes find threads of original fiber evidence on the chair frame, usually around tack holes. This can guide them to the creation of a reproduction of the original upholstery if an original fabric is not available.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.'' (pg. 50–53) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marie Antoinette's chair===
The [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] has a '''case study''' on their [http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-blog/the-conservation-of-marie-antoinettes-chair website] on the description of the conservation treatment that was carried out on [[Marie Antoinette]]'s chair in preparation for its display in the new Europe galleries due to open later in 2015. The chair was made in 1788 by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803). The chair has been re-upholstered several times, re-gilded and over-painted. The last intervention was in the 1970s when it was upholstered in blue swagged fabric and partially painted a greyish blue.

==Varnish==
A [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[varnish]], [[cellulose nitrate]], was developed in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation suitable for commercial furniture until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, cellulose nitrate discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems.

In a '''case study''' of an armoire with this condition from the 1930s from [http://www.mfa.org/ The Museum of Fine Arts] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]:
"Conservators used a more stable synthetic [[resin]], a type of acrylic copolymer dissolved in a solvent, to consolidate weakened areas of the original varnish without significantly changing the glossiness of its finish or its color. To provide a consistent overall finish, they tinted a portion of that solution the same color as the aged cellulose nitrate to fill some of the more jarring losses. In the future, the new varnish will not be easy to remove, if it can be removed at all, but the synthetic resin used by the conservators is known to have good aging properties." &lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.''(Pg. 76) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conditions==
[[File:Braunfaeule Holz FI20070208.jpg|thumb|Dry Rot]]
The following is a list of '''Wood Terms''' to describe conditions, as suggested by ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition:''&lt;ref&gt;Demeroukas, Marie. Buck, edited by Rebecca A.; Gilmore, Jean Allman (2010). MRM5 : museum registration methods (5th ed. ed.). Washington, DC: AAM Press, American Association of Museums. (pgs. 229–230). {{ISBN|978-1-933253-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alligatoring:''' Series of hairline cracks in old varnish, creating the appearance of [[alligator]] hide.

'''Checking:''' Slight gapping between wood cells that creates a [[checkerboard]]-like pattern. Found where wood is cut straight across the grain for carving, such as in a ball-and-claw foot.

'''Dry rot:''' Decay of seasoned timber caused by fungi that consume the [[cellulose]] of wood, leaving a soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder.

'''Shrinkage:''' A loss of mass or size in response to dry relative humidity conditions.

== Preventable damage ==
Preventive conservation is the best form of conservation that you can do for furniture without a scientific conservation degree.

===The impact of the environment===
A poorly controlled environment can cause detached veneer, cracks, and flaking paint.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Preventive Conservation" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Light====
Light easily causes color fading. Light is a major concern for furniture because the stains and color of wood are very susceptible to both natural and artificial light.&lt;ref&gt;Podmaniczky, Michael S. (2000) Furniture. In ''The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collections,'' (pg. 131). London, University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Temperature and relative humidity ====
To prevent cracks and veneer cleavage, avoid placing furniture near radiators, heat vents or other areas where temperature and [[relative humidity]] (RH) fluctuate widely. A stable relative humidity is particularly important to furniture since rapid changes cause different parts of the object to expand and contract at different rates and to different degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.winterthur.org/?p=457 "Furniture and Wooden Objects" Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=295]&lt;/ref&gt; If the relative humidity is over 60% [[fungi]], such as molds and mildews, will become rampant on wooden furniture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html  "Biological Deterioration &amp; Damage to Furniture &amp; Wooden Objects" Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute'' accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/learn_more/taking_care/biodetwood.html]&lt;/ref&gt; '''The recommended range for wooden furniture is 45%–55% RH.'''&lt;ref&gt;Klim, Susan. (1992). Furniture Conservation. In ''Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators,''(Pg.106). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Impacts of change in RH on wooden furniture:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Low RH''
*Wood shrinks and splits
*Joints become loose and the elements no longer fir together tightly
*Veneers and inlays suffer – If the underlying carcase wood shrinks, cracks will appear in the veneer and inlays become loose
*When the glues holding them down fail, veneers lift
*Causes polishes to shrink, craze and flake

''High RH''
*Swelling can cause moving parts such as cabinet doors or drawers to jam
*If glue fails, veneer peels away
*[[Corrosion]] affects nails holding things in place, metal inlay and fillings
*Insects and rot may flourish as the content of the wood rises

Fast and constant cycling of RH fluctuations causes the most damage for all of the above to create rapid structural weakening.

====Pests====
[[File:Lyctoxylon dentatum.jpg|thumb|Powderpost Beetle]]
A common furniture pest is the [[powderpost beetle]], less than a quarter-inch long, which lays its eggs in small crevices. The insect larvae burrow into the wood, creating networks of tunnels as they eat their way along the grain. As they mature to adults, they bore out of the wood leaving an “exit” or “flight” hole and fly off to lay their eggs, completing the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp  "Insect Activity," American Institute for Conservation  of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTJgzSHBzGc]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Photo to the right—''

Here is another '''case study''' of an early 19th-century bed with an infestation of woodworms from The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston:

"To protect the bed from damage and prevent pests from spreading to other works of art, it was critical to treat the new acquisition before it entered the building. Conservators completely sealed the bed in a giant impermeable bag and placed an oxygen scavenger inside. In this case, the scavenger was made of fine iron particles. Iron reacts rapidly with oxygen, binding the gas itself and thereby removing it from the air. With the appropriate amount of scavenger in the sealed environment, the conservators brought the oxygen down from normal air levels of 20 percent to less than 0.1 percent. After about four weeks in containment, all of the bed's woodworms in all life stages suffocated. Then the object could be safely brought into the Museum. No toxic chemicals were involved in the treatment, and the conservators disposed of the spent scavenger safely."&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Richard. (2009) ''Conservation: MFA Highlights.''(Pg. 132) United States: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Handling and moving furniture====
Perhaps the greatest cause of damage to furniture is people due to misuse and mishandling, creating physical damage.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Always'' wear clean cotton gloves and handle objects as little as possible. Check furniture for damage or loose joins before moving it. Remove objects from the surface and then remove drawers, shelves, and doors. Elements that cannot be removed should be secured with soft cloth (cotton) straps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as structural damage, dents, surface wear, scratches, stains and wax from candles are all evidence of past use. Water splashed from repeated floor washing, or spilt from flower displays damages bare or polished surfaces, most commonly leaving white marks. Cups and glasses leave 'rings' on polished surfaces. Alcohol spilt will remove the polished surface almost instantly.&lt;ref&gt;Capadose, Jeremy. (2011) Furniture. In ''The National Trust Manual of Housekeeping: Care and conservation of collections in historic houses'' (Pg. 365). Swindon, Wiltshire. National Trust Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Furniture maintenance==
For the most part, maintaining furniture simply means keeping it clean, carefully.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf Smithsonian ''Museum Conservation Institute,'' "Furniture Care and Handling" Page 10. accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/smithsonianmcifurniturecare.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cleaning===
Furniture oils are not recommended for maintenance as many of them contain linseed oil or other drying oils, and when used repeatedly will create a gummy, insoluble surface coating that darkens and obscures the grain of the wood. Other furniture polishes contain non-drying oils such as lemon oil, but attract and entrap dirt and grime. Silicone polishes are also not recommended as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future finish treatments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTkbESFVikp "Caring for Your Treasures," American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures/furniture#.VTJgzSHBzGc]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tools for furniture care===
The Hammond-Harwood House and City of Bowie Museums Collector’s Corner Workshop Series provides a resource on Furniture Cleaning and Care which addresses the tools and techniques of furniture cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture-cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf Hammond-Harwood House, City of Bowie Museums. "Furniture Cleaning and Care," Pages 1-2, accessed 4/23/2015 [https://sustainingplaces.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/furniture-cleaning-and-care-handout.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Petroleum-free nitrile gloves
*Cotton cloths
*Synthetic cloths, “Pel cloth” and “Preserve-It” 
*Brushes, “Hake” or “Windsor-Newton” brushes
*Distilled water
*Liquefied hide glue, “Titebond Liquid Hide Glue,” “Old Brown Glue”
*Cotton swab, balls, or wool
*Brush cleaner, “The Master’s”
*Paste or butchers wax, “Butchers,” “Johnson,” “Goddard’s,” and “Trewax,”

[https://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/index-eng.aspx The Canadian Conservation Institute] recommends that Micro-crystalline wax (a scent- and colour-free white paste wax that is available at specialty tool supply stores) can be used to increase the gloss of the finish, which will make it easier to remove fingerprints. Do this only once a year and only to the surfaces that are handled, being careful to avoid wax build-up around metal fittings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx CCI-ICC, "How to Care for Wooden Furniture," 4/1/2002. accessed 4/23/2015 [http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/resources-ressources/objectscollectionsobjets/furniture-meubles/449-eng.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
The [http://www.si.edu/mci/english/professional_development/past_courses_programs/programs/FCTP.html Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute] has a graduate-level course of study Furniture Conservation Training Program that was established in 1986.

[[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library]] sponsors two graduate programs with The [http://www.artcons.udel.edu/ University of Delaware]. The [http://www.winterthur.org/?p=634 Winterthur] program in American Material Culture, founded in 1952, and the Winterthur-University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation founded in 1974.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Constraint-based grammars''' can perhaps be best understood in contrast to [[generative grammar]]s. A generative grammar lists all the transformations, merges, movements, and deletions that can result in all [[well-formedness|well-formed]] sentences, while constraint-based grammars, take the opposite approach, allowing anything that is not otherwise constrained. "The grammar is nothing but a set of constraints that structures are required to satisfy in order to be considered well-formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A constraint-based grammar is more like a data base or a knowledge representation system than it is like a collection of algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12611">In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''corner transfer matrix''' describes the effect of adding a quadrant to a lattice. Introduced by [[Rodney Baxter]] in 1968 as an extension of the Kramers-Wannier row-to-row transfer matrix, it provides a powerful method of studying lattice models. Calculations with corner transfer matrices led Baxter to the exact solution of the [[hard hexagon model]] in 1980.

==Definition==

Consider an IRF (interaction-round-a-face) model, i.e. a square lattice model with a [[Spin (physics)|spin]] σ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; assigned to each site ''i'' and interactions limited to spins around a common face. Let the total energy be given by

:&lt;math&gt;E=\sum_{all\atop faces}\epsilon\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where for each face the surrounding sites ''i'', ''j'', ''k'' and ''l'' are arranged as follows:

[[Image:CTM - IRF model.png|200px|Arrangement of sites around a face]]

For a lattice with ''N'' sites, the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{N}=\sum_{all\atop spins}\prod_{all\atop faces}w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum is over all possible spin configurations and ''w'' is the Boltzmann weight

:&lt;math&gt;w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right)=\exp\left(-\epsilon\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right)/k_{B}T\right).&lt;/math&gt;

To simplify the notation, we use a [[Ising model|ferromagnetic Ising-type lattice]] where each spin has the value +1 or −1, and the ground state is given by all spins up (i.e. the total energy is minimised when all spins on the lattice have the value +1). We also assume the lattice has 4-fold rotational symmetry (up to boundary conditions) and is reflection-invariant. These simplifying assumptions are not crucial, and extending the definition to the general case is relatively straightforward.

Now consider the lattice quadrant shown below:

[[Image:CTM - lattice quadrant.png|400px|Lattice quadrant with ½m(m+1) faces]]

The outer boundary sites, marked by triangles, are assigned their ground state spins (+1 in this case). The sites marked by open circles form the inner boundaries of the quadrant; their associated spin sets are labelled {σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,σ&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;} and {σ'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,…,σ'&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}, where σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = σ'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; possible configurations for each inner boundary, so we define a 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; matrix entry-wise by

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\sigma|\sigma'}=\delta\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1}'\right)\sum_{interior\atop spins}\prod_{all\atop faces}w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The matrix ''A'', then, is the corner transfer matrix for the given lattice quadrant. Since the outer boundary spins are fixed and the sum is over all interior spins, each entry of ''A'' is a function of the inner boundary spins. The Kronecker delta in the expression ensures that σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = σ'&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so by ordering the configurations appropriately we may cast ''A'' as a block diagonal matrix:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{cccc}
 &amp;  &amp; \begin{array}{ccccc}
\sigma_{1}'=+1 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \sigma_{1}'=-1\end{array}\\
A &amp; = &amp; \left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; |\\
 &amp; A_{+} &amp;  &amp; | &amp;  &amp; 0\\
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; |\\
- &amp; - &amp; - &amp; | &amp; - &amp; - &amp; -\\
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; |\\
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; | &amp;  &amp; A_{-}\\
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp; |\end{array}\right] &amp; \begin{array}{c}
\sigma_{1}=+1\\
\\\\\\\sigma_{1}=-1\end{array}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

Corner transfer matrices are related to the partition function in a simple way. In our simplified example, we construct the full lattice from four rotated copies of the lattice quadrant, where the inner boundary spin sets σ, σ', σ" and σ'" are allowed to differ:

[[Image:CTM - full lattice.png|400px|Full lattice with 2m(m+1) faces]]

The partition function is then written in terms of the corner transfer matrix ''A'' as

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{N}=\sum_{\sigma,\sigma',\sigma'',\sigma'''}A_{\sigma|\sigma'}A_{\sigma'|\sigma''}A_{\sigma''|\sigma'''}A_{\sigma'''|\sigma}=\textrm{tr}A^{4}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Discussion==

===Recursion relation===

A corner transfer matrix ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (defined for an ''m''×''m'' quadrant) may be expressed in terms of smaller corner transfer matrices ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; (defined for reduced (''m''-1)×(''m''-1) and (''m''-2)×(''m''-2) quadrants respectively). This recursion relation allows, in principle, the iterative calculation of the corner transfer matrix for any lattice quadrant of finite size.

Like their row-to-row counterparts, corner transfer matrices may be factored into face transfer matrices, which correspond to adding a single face to the lattice. For the lattice quadrant given earlier, the face transfer matrices are of size 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; and defined entry-wise by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(U_{i}\right)_{\sigma|\sigma'}=\delta\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1}'\right)\cdots\delta\left(\sigma_{i-1},\sigma_{i-1}'\right)w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{i+1},\sigma_{i}',\sigma_{i-1}\right)\delta\left(\sigma_{i+1},\sigma_{i+1}'\right)\cdots\delta\left(\sigma_{m},\sigma_{m}'\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where 2 ≤ ''i'' ≤ ''m''+1. Near the outer boundary, specifically, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\left(U_{m}\right)_{\sigma|\sigma'}=\delta\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1}'\right)\cdots\delta\left(\sigma_{m-1},\sigma_{m-1}'\right)w\left(\sigma_{m},+1,\sigma_{m}',\sigma_{m-1}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(U_{m+1}\right)_{\sigma|\sigma'}=\delta\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1}'\right)\cdots\delta\left(\sigma_{m},\sigma_{m}'\right)w\left(+1,+1,+1,\sigma_{m}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

So the corner transfer matrix ''A'' factorises as

:&lt;math&gt;A=F_{2}\cdots F_{m+1},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;F_{j}=U_{m+1}\cdots U_{j}.&lt;/math&gt;

Graphically, this corresponds to:

[[Image:CTM - FTM factorisation.png|400px|Graphical representation of factorisation]]

We also require the 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; matrices ''A''* and ''A''**, defined entry-wise by

:&lt;math&gt;\left(A^{*}\right)_{\sigma|\sigma'}=\delta\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1}'\right)A_{\sigma_{2},\ldots,\sigma_{m}|\sigma_{2}',\ldots,\sigma_{m}'},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(A^{**}\right)_{\sigma|\sigma'}=\delta\left(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{1}'\right)\delta\left(\sigma_{2},\sigma_{2}'\right)A_{\sigma_{3},\ldots,\sigma_{m}|\sigma_{3}',\ldots,\sigma_{m}'},&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''A'' matrices whose entries appear on the RHS are of size 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-1&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-2&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-2&lt;/sup&gt; respectively. This is more clearly written as

:&lt;math&gt;A^{*}=I_{2}\otimes A_{2^{m-1}}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
A &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; A\end{array}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^{**}=I_{2}\otimes I_{2}\otimes A_{2^{m-2}}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
A &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; A &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; A &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; A\end{array}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Now from the definitions of ''A'', ''A''*, ''A''**, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;A^{*}=F_{3}\cdots F_{m+1},A^{**}=F_{4}\cdots F_{m+1}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow A=F_{2}A^{*},A^{*}=F_{3}A^{**}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow A=A^{*}\left(A^{**}\right)^{-1}U_{2}A^{*},&lt;/math&gt;

which gives the recursion relation for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.

===Diagonal form===

When using corner transfer matrices to perform calculations, it is both analytically and numerically convenient to work with their diagonal forms instead. To facilitate this, the recursion relation may be rewritten directly in terms of the diagonal forms and eigenvector matrices of ''A'', ''A''* and ''A''**.

Recalling that the lattice in our example is reflection-invariant, in the sense that

:&lt;math&gt;w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right)=w\left(\sigma_{k},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{i},\sigma_{l}\right)=w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{l},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{j}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

we see that ''A'' is a symmetric matrix (i.e. it is diagonalisable by an [[orthogonal matrix]]). So we write

:&lt;math&gt;A=\alpha_{m}PA_{d}P^{T},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; is a diagonal matrix (normalised such that its numerically largest entry is 1), ''α''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; is the largest eigenvalue of ''A'', and ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt;''P'' = ''I''. Likewise for ''A''* and ''A''**, we have

:&lt;math&gt;A^{*}=\alpha_{m-1}P^{*}A_{d}^{*}\left(P^{*}\right)^{T},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A^{**}=\alpha_{m-2}P^{**}A_{d}^{**}\left(P^{**}\right)^{T},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;*, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;**, ''P''* and ''P''** are defined in an analogous fashion to ''A''* and ''A''**, i.e. in terms of the smaller (normalised) diagonal forms and (orthogonal) eigenvector matrices of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''m''-2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;.

By substituting these diagonalisations into the recursion relation, we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;A_{t}=\kappa RA_{d}R^{T},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa=\frac{\alpha_{m}\alpha_{m-2}}{\alpha_{m-1}^{2}},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;R=\left(P^{*}\right)^{T}P,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_{t}=A_{d}^{*}\left(R^{*}\right)^{T}\left(A_{d}^{**}\right)^{-1}U_{2}R^{*}A_{d}^{*}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; is also symmetric, and may be calculated if ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;*, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;** and ''R''* are known; diagonalising ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; then yields its normalised diagonal form ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;, its largest eigenvalue ''κ'', and its orthogonal eigenvector matrix ''R''.

==Applications==

===Spin expectation value===

Corner transfer matrices (or their diagonal forms) may be used to calculate quantities such as the spin [[Expected value|expectation value]] at a particular site deep inside the lattice. For the full lattice given earlier, the spin expectation value at the central site is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \sigma_{1}\right\rangle =\frac{1}{Z_{N}}\sum_{all\atop spins}\sigma_{1}\prod_{all\atop faces}w\left(\sigma_{i},\sigma_{j},\sigma_{k},\sigma_{l}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With the configurations ordered such that ''A'' is block diagonal as before, we may define a 2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;×2&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; diagonal matrix

:&lt;math&gt;S=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
I &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; -I\end{array}\right],&lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left\langle \sigma_{1}\right\rangle =\frac{\textrm{tr}SA^{4}}{\textrm{tr}A^{4}}=\frac{\textrm{tr}\alpha_{m}^{4}PSA^{4}P^{T}}{\textrm{tr}\alpha_{m}^{4}PA^{4}P^{T}}=\frac{\textrm{tr}SA_{d}^{4}}{\textrm{tr}A_{d}^{4}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Partition function per site===

Another important quantity for lattice models is the partition function per site, evaluated in the [[thermodynamic limit]] and written as

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\left(Z_{N}\right)^{1/N}.&lt;/math&gt;

In our example, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\kappa=\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\left(\alpha_{m}^{4}\textrm{tr}A_{d}^{4}\right)^{1/N}\sim\alpha_{m}^{4/N},&lt;/math&gt;

since tr ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is a convergent sum as ''m'' → ∞ and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; becomes infinite-dimensional. Furthermore, the number of faces 2''m''(''m''+1) approaches the number of sites ''N'' in the thermodynamic limit, so we have

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_{m}\sim\kappa^{m\left(m+1\right)/2},&lt;/math&gt;

which is consistent with the earlier equation giving ''κ'' as the largest eigenvalue for ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;. In other words, the partition function per site is given exactly by the diagonalised recursion relation for corner transfer matrices in the thermodynamic limit; this allows ''κ'' to be approximated via the iterative process of calculating ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; for a large lattice.

The matrices involved grow exponentially in size, however, and in actual numerical calculations they must be truncated at each step. One way of doing this is to keep the ''n'' largest eigenvalues at each step, for some fixed ''n''. In most cases, the sequence of approximations obtained by taking ''n'' = 1,2,3,… converges rapidly, and to the exact value (for an exactly solvable model).

A '''cyanide''' is a [[chemical compound]] that contains the group C≡N. This group, known as the '''cyano group''', consists of a [[carbon]] atom [[triple-bond]]ed to a [[nitrogen]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01486.html ''cyanides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In inorganic cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the anion CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  For the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as [[sodium cyanide]] and [[potassium cyanide]], these compounds are highly toxic.&lt;ref name="CMC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php| title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide| publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute|year=2006| accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially.  It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts.

Organic cyanides are usually called [[nitrile]]s. In nitriles, the CN group is linked by a [[covalent bond]] to carbon.  For example, in [[acetonitrile]], the cyanide group is bonded to [[methyl]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Because they do not release cyanide ions, nitriles are generally far less toxic than cyanide salts.  Some nitriles, which occur naturally as [[cyanohydrin]]s, release hydrogen cyanide.

{{see also|Isocyanide}}
In [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]], [[organic compound]]s that have a&amp;nbsp;–C≡N [[functional group]] are called [[nitrile]]s. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/N04151.html ''nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NCBI-MeSH [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009570 ''Nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a nitrile is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, [[acetonitrile]], also known as [[methyl]] cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called [[cyanohydrin]]. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release [[hydrogen cyanide]]. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion are referred to as '''cyanides'''.

The word is derived from the Greek ''kyanos'', meaning dark blue, as a result of its being first obtained by the heating of the pigment known as [[Prussian blue]].

==Occurrence and reactions==

===In nature===
[[File:Removal of cyanide poison from cassava.jpg|thumb|left|Removal of cyanide from [[cassava]] in [[Nigeria]].]]
Cyanides are produced by certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]] and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of [[bitter almond]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[peach]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=71&amp;tid=19 |title=ToxFAQs for Cyanide |accessdate=2008-06-28 |date = July 2006|publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, cyanides are usually bound to [[sugar]] molecules in the form of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s and defend the plant against [[herbivore]]s. [[Cassava]] roots (also called manioc), an important [[potato]]-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which [[tapioca]] is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J. |last=Vetter |title=Plant cyanogenic glycosides |journal=Toxicon |year=2000 |volume=38 |pages=11–36 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 |pmid=10669009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.

The [[Madagascar]] bamboo ''[[Cathariostachys madagascariensis]]'' produces cyanide as a deterrent to grazing. In response, the [[golden bamboo lemur]], which eats the bamboo, has developed a high tolerance to cyanide.

===Pyrolysis and combustion product===
Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or [[pyrolysis]] of certain materials under [[oxygen deficient environment|oxygen-deficient condition]]s. For example, it can be detected in the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[tobacco]] smoke. Certain [[plastic]]s, especially those derived from [[acrylonitrile]], release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===Coordination chemistry===
{{main|Cyanometalate}}
The cyanide anion is a [[ligand]] for many [[transition metals]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, A. G. The Chemistry of Cyano Complexes of the Transition Metals; Academic Press: London, 1976{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high affinities of metals for this [[anion]] can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include:
*hexacyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape.  
*the tetracyanides, [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;
*the dicyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.

Among the most important cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds [[potassium ferrocyanide]] and the pigment [[Prussian blue]], which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.&lt;ref name=Holl&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-12-352651-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prussian blue was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to [[blueprints]], [[bluing (fabric)|bluing]], and [[cyanotype]]s.

The [[enzymes]] called [[hydrogenase]]s contain cyanide [[ligand]]s attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases proceeds from [[carbamoyl phosphate]], which converts to [[cystein]]yl [[thiocyanate]], the CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reissmann |first1=Stefanie |last2=Hochleitner |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Wang |first3=Haofan |last4=Paschos |first4=Athanasios |last5=Lottspeich |first5=Friedrich |last6=Glass |first6=Richard S. |last7=Böck |first7=August |title=Taming of a Poison: Biosynthesis of the NiFe-Hydrogenase Cyanide Ligands |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5609 |pages=1067–70 |year=2003 |pmid=12586941 |doi=10.1126/science.1080972 |bibcode=2003Sci...299.1067R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Nitriles}}
Because of the cyanide anion's high [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]], cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a [[halide]] group (e.g., the [[chloride]] on [[methyl chloride]]). In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN can be called methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as [[acetonitrile]]. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 [[synthon]]; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be [[wiktionary:functionalize|functionalized]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
:RX + CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → RCN + X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nucleophilic substitution]]) followed by
# RCN + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrolysis]] under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or
# 2 RCN + [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + (second step) 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[amine|2 RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + LiAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (under [[reflux]] in dry [[diethyl ether|ether]], followed by addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)

==Manufacture==
{{main|Hydrogen cyanide#Production and synthesis}}
The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the [[Andrussow process]] in which gaseous [[hydrogen cyanide]] is produced from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Gaseous hydrogen cyanide may be dissolved in aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] solution to produce [[sodium cyanide]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Cyanide poisoning}}
Many cyanides are highly toxic. The cyanide anion is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (also known as aa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the fourth complex of the [[electron transport chain]] (found in the membrane of the [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from [[cytochrome c]] to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=David L.|last2=Cox|first2=Michael M.|title=Lehniger Principles of Biochemistry|publisher=[[Worth Publishers]]|year=2000|location=New York|edition=3rd|isbn=1-57259-153-6|pages=668,670–71,676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissues that depend highly on [[aerobic respiration]], such as the [[central nervous system]] and the [[heart]], are particularly affected. This is an example of [[histotoxic hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=Biller&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most hazardous compound is [[hydrogen cyanide]], which is a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts about cyanide:Where cyanide is found and how it is used|last=Anon|date=June 27, 2013|work=CDC Emergency preparedness and response|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen cyanide is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a cyanide salt. Alkaline solutions of cyanide are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of [[polyurethane]]s; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution as little as 200&amp;nbsp;mg, or exposure to airborne cyanide of 270 [[parts per million|ppm]], is sufficient to cause death within minutes.&lt;ref name=Biller/&gt;

Organic [[nitrile]]s do not readily release cyanide ions, and so have low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Antidote===
[[Hydroxocobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be safely eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|814287|Cyanide Toxicity|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: [[amyl nitrite]] pearls (administered by inhalation), [[sodium nitrite]], and [[sodium thiosulfate]]. The goal of the antidote was to generate a large pool of [[ferric]] iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The [[nitrite]]s [[oxidize]] [[hemoglobin]] to [[methemoglobin]], which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the [[cytochrome oxidase]] enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to [[thiocyanate]] by the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]]. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for [[rhodanese]], needed in order to produce thiocyanate.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhary, M.; Gupta, R. "Cyanide Detoxifying Enzyme: Rhodanese" Current Biotechnology, 2012, vol. 1, pp. 327-335. {{DOI|10.2174/2211550111201040327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, [[asthma]], or [[bronchitis]]. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates.&lt;ref&gt;Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Mining===
{{Main|Gold cyanidation}}
Cyanide is mainly produced for the [[mining]] of [[gold]] and [[silver]]: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores. In the ''[[cyanide process]]'', finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Rubo |first2=Raf |last2=Kellens |first3=Jay |last3=Reddy |first4=Norbert |last4=Steier |first5=Wolfgang |last5=Hasenpusch |chapter=Alkali metal cyanides |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/14356007.i01_i01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::4 Au + 8 NaCN + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 Na[Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + 4 NaOH

Silver is less [[Noble metal|"noble"]] than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
::Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 NaCN + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + NaSH + NaOH
The "pregnant liquor" containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a [[tailing pond]] or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed. The metal is recovered from the "pregnant solution" by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems. A number of [[List of gold mining disasters|environmental disasters]] have followed the overflow of tailing ponds at gold mines. Cyanide contamination of waterways has resulting in numerous cases of human and aquatic species mortality.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Cyanide is also used in [[electroplating]], where it stabilizes metal ions in the electrolyte solution prior to their deposition.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Industrial organic chemistry===
Some nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., [[adiponitrile]] is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:
RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCN → RCH(CN)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |date=August 1916 |title=THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY WITH CYANOCUPROL |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207–211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===
[[Potassium ferrocyanide]] is used to achieve a blue color on cast [[bronze sculpture]]s during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==

===Prussian blue===
[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the [[sodium fusion test]]. The resulting mixture is acidified with [[mineral acid]]. The formation of [[Prussian blue]] is a positive result for cyanide.

===''para''-Benzoquinone in DMSO===
A solution of [[1,4-Benzoquinone|''para''-benzoquinone]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] reacts with inorganic cyanide to form a cyano[[phenol]], which is [[fluorescent]].

===Copper and an aromatic amine===
As used by [[fumigation|fumigators]] to detect [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[copper]](II) salt and an aromatic amine such as [[benzidine]] is added to the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-''bis''-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.

===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===
A sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis—Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Corrinoids colorimetry===

A solution of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as [[cobalamin]] or [[cobinamide]], reacts with free cyanide in an aqueous sample. The binding of cyanide to the corrinoid cobalt center leads to a color change from orange to violet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inorganic Chemistry of Vitamin B12|last=Pratt|first=J.M.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|page=44|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for semi-quantification by naked-eye. Precise quantification of the cyanide content is feasible by [[UV-vis spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelder|first=F.H.|year=2008|title=Specific Colorimetric Detection of Cyanide Triggered by a Conformational Switch in Vitamin B12 |url= |journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=47|pages=1264–1266|via=|doi=10.1021/ic702368b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2009|title=Side chains of cobalt corrinoids control the sensitivity and selectivity in the colorimetric detection of cyanide|url=|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=48|pages=1272–1274|via=|doi=10.1021/ic900053h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption of the corrinoid on a solid phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2012|title=Complex samples cyanide detection with immobilized corrinoids |url= |journal=ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces|volume=4|pages=725–729|via=|doi=10.1021/am201357u}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows detection of cyanide even in colored samples, rendering this method appropriate for the analysis of cyanide in water, wastewater, blood, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tivana, Da Cruz Francisco, Zelder, Bergenståhl, Dejmek |first= |year=2014 |title=Straightforward rapid spectrophotometric quantification of total cyanogenic glycosides in fresh and processed cassava products|url=|journal=Food Chemistry |volume=158 |pages=20–27|via= |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2012|title=Rapid visual detection of blood cyanide |url= |journal=Analytical Methods |volume=4|pages=2632–2634|via= |doi=10.1039/c2ay25595b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this technology is non-toxic and considerably less prone to interference than the pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry method.

===Gas diffusion flow injection analysis—amperometry===
Instead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.

These structures have existed for many centuries and after falling out of use and their function having been forgotten the more substantial earth or stone examples have attracted names such as ''Roman Trenches'', ''Old Fortifications'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; The hinds were the main target of the hunt.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Silz cerf8.jpg|thumb|290px|Red Deer stags and hinds]]
Deer hay winds, folds and elricks were sites where by means of traps wild deer were killed or caught. Evidence that during Saxon times deer hunting was taking place in this fashion survives in a tract written by a 10th-century monk called Ælfric who wrote "''I weave myself nets and set them in a suitable place and urge on my dogs so that they chase the wild animals until they come into the nets unawares and are thus ensnared and I kill them in the nets.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Saxon documents 'Deer Parks' are recorded to as 'Derhage' or 'Deer-hay'. The Saxon word ''haga'' means a palisade or pale, an enclosure, hedge, or set of nets&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JZ7GlfI8UToC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;lpg=PA229&amp;dq=How+were+Deer+hayes+used?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=toP0x4LJYd&amp;sig=roOVjtpC5bi_C89-TdDVhvQxvOw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiTu5-miIjPAhVmLcAKHcPgDn8Q6AEIOTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=How%20were%20Deer%20hayes%20used%3F&amp;f=false Wharton's Pocket Law Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm#H Forests and Chases in England and Wales, c. 1000 to c. 1850. A Glossary of Terms and Definitions.]&lt;/ref&gt; and is also regarded as the etymological root of the word hay. The term ''haga'' or hay effectively came to mean a deer park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''haga'', ''hage'', ''hege'', ''haia'', etc. all relate to the managing of deer.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doomsday Book]] records 31 parks with a few still held by Anglo-Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; The 'deer-hays' of Anglo-Saxon times would have been more or less temporary structures although some may have developed into places where deer were kept until such a times as they were needed at which point they would be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Farjon, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;

Imparkment developed from the 12th to the 14th centuries, reaching its peak in the early 1300s at which time around 3,200 parks in England covered up to 2% of the total land area representing about a quarter of the country’s woodland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'elerc' or 'erelc' in Gaelic originally meant 'ambush' and later meant a 'deer trap' described as a funnel-like defile, artificial or natural into which deer were herded so that they could be contained and then killed. The personal or place name '[[Elrick]]' is linked to such deer traps.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, p.52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic name ''Tainchell'' was the term used for the group of beaters who took part.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; The Gaelic word 'eilid' means a hind and this association may explain why the word after linguistic evolution in Wigtownshire to 'eileirg' or ' eileirig' with the meaning of 'deer-trap' and the local place-names 'Eldrig', 'Elrig', 'Elrick', etc. derive from this source and some of the defiles used in the hunt can still be identified.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ordnance gazetteer of Scotland - a survey of Scottish topography, statistical, biographical, and historical (1882) (14804905703).jpg|thumb|left|250px|Quillisfield or Coilsfield House.]]
The capture and movement of deer from the wild or from established deer hays or parks was necessary for establishing new ones and for restocking existing ones to replace animals lost via excessive hunting or disease and at times to introduce new breeding stock to maintain vigour in isolated and inbred populations. Deer might also be managed in terms of castrating stags and selectively culling diseased or elderly animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In feudal times the monarch would at times make gifts of live deer to those who were in the royal favour to replenish or establish herds, and a system of capturing deer therefore had to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Coilsfield Deer Hay, Tarbolton - ditch system with parallel banks, South Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|250px|A section of the Parkmoor Deer Hay trenches at Coilsfield]]
To create a deer park the person had to own the land, purchase a license from the monarch and have sufficient funds to empark the area, constructing pales and ditches, deer leaps or salters, etc. Some parks even had towers from which the deer could be shot with bows and arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thirty-seven parks or hays are listed in the Domesday Book, and of these nine belonged to the king, five by bishops or monastic houses and twenty three by Norman knights, etc. These hays or parks were isolated in the countryside by physical land divisions such as pales with ditches and served to protect the deer which were to be used for hunting and to help keep out predators whilst also preventing wild deer from eating crops in areas where farming was prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term 'fence month' was applied to the time during fawning and to the annual rut time in the autumn during which the deer were not disturbed and this restricted the period when deer hay winds and elricks could be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legendarydartmoor.co.uk/deer_park.htm Legendary Dartmoor]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both wattle fencing and nets may have been employed in the 'wynding of the deer hay' and it was also important that the animals could be separated into small groups to reduce the chance of them goring each other by accident.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; A wide entrance that narrowed down on a gently rising slope would also slow their progress when pursued by hounds and places where people could hide,&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; possibly with hounds until required would be advantageous.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The beaters would also separate the stags from the hinds if required.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks or deer hay winds were a places in Scotland and England&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; where deer could be channelled and confined in a corral, a practice that ceased to be used in the 18th century although the practice had a brief resurgence in the days of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], husband of [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Stone lined pits and boulders once heated in fires have been found in association with elricks which may have been used to cook or render the venison from the newly slaughtered animals.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; A deer hunt of this type was recorded in the medieval romance ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''.&lt;ref&gt;MacQueen, p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Red Deer ([[Cervus elaphus]]) and later introduced Fallow Deer ([[Dama dama]]) are suited for enclosure in deer parks however European Roe Deer ([[Capreolus capreolus]]) are not as they are aggressive towards other deer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt; Fallow Deer were introduced by the Normans from [[Sicily]], probably in the early twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forestofbowland.com/files/uploads/pdfs/cooper_deer_salters_in_leagram_park_v1.pdf Deer Salters in Leagram Park.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples of Deer Hays and Elricks===
[[File:Windy Gill, Water of Fail, Tarbolton.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The Windy Gill and the Water of Fail]]
Near Parkmill Farm on Parkmoor (NS 4425 2693), [[Tarbolton]] in [[South Ayrshire]] is a complex system of interlinking deep trenches running down to the Water of Fail that were given the name 'Roman Trenches'.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.151&lt;/ref&gt; The local historian John Smith circa 1895 examined them and also identified what he regarded as an ''Ancient British Stockade'' which had been taken following a siege by Roman troops during which the 'Roman Trenches' were built.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.153&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the trenches are still around 9 feet deep and are recorded to have once been much deeper.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p.152&lt;/ref&gt; They lie within a few hundred metres from a medieval deer park's boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Parkmoor Roman Trenches, Tarbolton.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parkmoor 'Roman trenches']]
In 1428 it is recorded that [[John Stewart of Darnley|John Stewart]] of [[Darnley]] near Glasgow held a deer park with a ditch, bank and pale in the Tarbolton area.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, page 215&lt;/ref&gt; Place names such as Parkmoor, Parkmill and Parkhill reflect the existence of a deer park in this area and a park with a building and pale is recorded on the 1654 map of Kyle by the cartographer Blaeu&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; taken from an earlier map by [[Timothy Pont]]. Herman Moll's map of 1732 shows at least four deer parks in the vicinity of Parkmoor at [[Fail Monastery|Fail Abbey]], Park Mill, at Coilsholm Wood and at Barskimming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.nls.uk/view/00000274 The South Part of the Shire of Air, containing Kyle and Carrick by H. Moll]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once known as 'Quillisfield' the estate was given to the monks of [[Melrose Abbey]] by [[John de Graham|Sir John de Graham]] of [[Dunduff Castle|Dunduff]], Lord of Tarbolton in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harpguitars.net/blog/2011/10/hgg9-scheduled-events/ 'Coilsfield' by Nathaniel Gow]&lt;/ref&gt; After the reformation Coilsfield Castle and Estate was acquired by the Cunninghames of Caprington, it was then sold to the Montgomerie family in 1661. In around 1847 the Coilsfield estate was sold to William Orr who had agreed to become the heir of the architect of the house, John Paterson, on the understanding that he would change his name to Paterson but and also buy the Coilsfield estate, renaming it Montgomerie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://landedfamilies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/189-arthur-of-carlung-house-barshaw.html Landed Families of Britain and Ireland.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The RCAHMS describes these features on the old Coilsfield Estate as an "''irregular series of artificially-cut ditches run roughly parallel in a SE-NW direction down a gently W-facing and wooded slope at c70m OD. They are closely spaced, mostly V-shaped, and range from 0.5m to 2.0m in depth with little evidence of upcast banking. Some conjoin to form wider channels which fade at the steeper slopes above the water of Fail.''"&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/42710/parkmill RCAHMS Parkmoor 'Roman Trenches']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Nuthill Estate, 'Old Fortifications'.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The 'Old Fortifications' at Nuthill.]]
Taylor has associated the local place names of Wyndford and Windy Gill at Parkmoor with an early 16th-century reference to the ''winding of the hay yard'' to catch deer at the Nuthill Estate in Fife and has suggested that this made reference to the construction of wattle fencing and nets along the line of the trench banks in preparation for catching deer and that the system of trenches may have been known as a 'wynd'.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scots language]] the word 'Wynd' has been used since at least the 13th century to describe frequently winding, narrow streets or alleys which aptly describes the appearance of known deer hay winds and elricks&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/dost/wynd_n_2 Scots Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and wynding would be the creation of narrow alleys or entrances.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; At Parkmoor the deer would naturally enter the Windy Gill to drink&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; and could then be driven by men and hounds towards the deer hay wind. The area that was supposed by John Smith to be an ''Ancient British Stockade'' and the area later used as a bowling green may have been involved in the processing of the deer by comparison with the use of elricks.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.51&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the Nuthill Estate in Fife (NO234079) are a system of trenches surveyed by Thomas Winter in 1757 and recorded as 'The Trenches are Old Fortifications' or 'Roman Trenches'. This complex system of trenches and banks are located near the old royal hunting park of Falkland.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; This feature is considered to have been used to capture deer from the Lomond Hills by corralling them and then taking suitable hinds and stags to the nearby royal hunting park.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The Falkland Treasurers Accounts of 1505 refer to a payment of 14 shillings to "''John Balfour for ranging through the countryside with bloodhounds to drive the deer to the park''" and for the "''winding of the hay yard to catch them''".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Fields or enclosures called ‘Deerends’ are recorded just to the west of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onomastics.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Falkland-to-Strathmiglo-13-Sept-2014-leaflet.pdf Living Lomonds Landscape Project]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Glen of the Bar - geograph.org.uk - 1465166.jpg|thumb|200px|The Glen of the Bar elrick]]
At Nuthill at least seven trenches can still be discerned with a present-day depth of up to 2 metres and a length of 150 to 200 metres. Some are cut through the bedrock and they curve towards each other towards the west at the bottom of a slope that joins a water course. The glen or gill then acts as a natural channel that runs towards the old Falkland Deer Park and the Lomond Hills lie above.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; A number of place names suggest the past use of the site such as 'Deerends', 'Greyhound Den' and 'Burn of Deer'.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.157&lt;/ref&gt; 

Indications of similar systems of trenches exist at [[Chillingham Castle|Chillingham Park]] in [[Northumberland]] and [[Erringden]] Park in Yorkshire, additionally "''Montrose's Camp''" near [[Fyvie Castle]] has features in common with deer hay winds famously militarily utilised by [[Fyvie Castle|Montrose]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.160&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kington, Worcestershire|Kington]] in Worcestershire is recorded to have had a deer hay.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; 

The as yet unidentified system of trenches and banks at the High Parks in the Cadzow Wood area (NS 7343 5347) of [[Chatelherault Country Park]] have a number of characteristics in common with deer hay winds and are located in an area closely associated with the hunting of deer by royalty and others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://canmore.org.uk/site/45727/cadzow Cadzow - Canmore entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some deer hay winds may have consisted of banks and ditches several kilometres long that were used to direct deer for the purpose of capture&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.58&lt;/ref&gt; such as with the so-called "''Deil's Dyke''" near [[New Cumnock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

Elricks have been identified at [[Dalkeith]] and others may have existed at the Glen of the Bar in Galloway, on the [[Isle of Rum]] and on the [[Isle of Jura]] where in one case stone walls may have channelled the deer into a corral.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; An unusual 'deer trap' may have been the function of a structure with foot high walls at Wet Sleddle Slack near [[Shap]] in [[Cumbria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

A relevant quote here is that "''Deer hunting has left physical traces on the landscape in the form of banks and dykes used either as park boundaries or for trapping the deer''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bob_newcumnock/deilsdyke_B/ History of the Parish of New Cumnock]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Micro-history==
The fourteenth century treatise ''The Book of Hunting'' illustrates a scene ''The Gathering before the Stag Hunt'' which clearly portrays wattle fencing of the kind used in a deer hay wind.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; 

The town of [[Hayes and Harlington Urban District|Hayes]] in West Middlesex derives its name from the presence of a deer hay in the area.

The village of [[Elrick]] near Aberdeen is named after an elrick and the surname 'Elrick' is common in the area.

In 1559 seven acres of land near Tarbolton named Longhuntflat was leased by John Stewart and his wife Helen Cunninghame of Halrig.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dependency need''' is "the vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth." (Segen, 1992)  A dependency need is thought to be characterized by two components: (1) It is a real need of an organism, something that must be present in order for the organism to be able to thrive, (2) It is something that an individual cannot provide for him or herself.  It is well known that [[infant]]s have many dependency needs; some of these needs are obvious, others have only come to the attention of researchers as the result of [[epidemiological]] studies.  The more obvious needs of infants include: adequate feeding, adequate watering, adequate cleaning, adequate shelter, and more specifically, keeping the infant's body temperature within the narrow range of normalcy. On the other hand, it was not well known until the middle of the 20th century that infants also required the presence of warmth and affection, known as "[[maternal]] warmth".  The greatest number of dependency needs seem to be encompassed in infancy, however, dependency needs begin to change and decrease with age and [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]]. This marked decrease in dependency needs as an individual gets older can be largely attributed to the notion that, as an individual gets older, he or she becomes capable of providing these things for him or herself. However, to some extent, these needs remain present even into adulthood. Even as adults, people have certain universal dependency needs that remain constant throughout the lifespan that they are not able to provide for themselves; these include: the [[belongingness|need to belong]], need for affection, as well as the need for emotional support.   These needs can usually be met by partnership, in which both partners get used to depending on one another. If adults lack partnership, their needs can usually be met by family and/or friend relationships.

==Importance ==

Dependency need is an important psychological concept, encompassing the fields of [[psychological]], [[evolutionary]], and [[ethological]] theory.  [[Need]], in general, is a concept greatly studied in varying psychological fields, by psychologists with varying specialties.  Need is particularly important to the area of [[personality psychology]].  The concept of need can be defined as a "state of tension within a person", and as the need is satisfied, the state of tension is reduced. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008) It is thought that all individuals have needs, and that needs organize perceptions, guiding individuals to see what they want (or need) to see (Larsen &amp; Buss).  A physical or psychological need is capable of organizing action by compelling an individual to do what is necessary in order to fulfill such a need. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  After action has been taken to fulfill the need, the need subsides until it is again desired and recurs.

== History ==

It can be hypothesized that the concept of dependency need originated from the well-known psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and [[Abraham Maslow]]'s ideas about needs.  According to Murray, a need can be defined as a "potentiality or readiness to respond in a certain way under certain circumstances." (Murray, 1938)  Murray purposed a list of [[fundamental human needs]].  Each need was thought to be associated with "(1) a specific desire or intention, (2) a particular set of emotions, and (3) specific action tendencies." (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Murray believed that human beings had their own [[hierarchy of needs]], unique to each individual. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008) It is thought that each individual's various needs exist at different levels of strength.

According to Maslow, the concept of need can be defined primarily by an individual's [[goal]]s. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Maslow was a firm believer of [[self-actualization]], the process of becoming "more and more what one idiosyncratically is, becoming everything that one is capable of becoming." (Larson &amp; Buss, 2008)  Maslow believed that needs were hierarchically organized, with more basic needs found toward the bottom of the hierarchy and the self-actualization need at the top.  The needs defined by Murray and Maslow (physiological needs, safety needs, belongingness needs, esteem needs, self-actualization needs) seem to correspond with the vital needs encompassed in the concept of dependency need.

== Attachment theory's relevance ==

Dependency needs can sometimes be associated with [[Attachment Theory]].  Attachment can be defined as a "deep and enduring emotional bond that connects one person to another across time and space." (Ainsworth, 1973; Bowlby, 1969)  Attachment is thought to first occur between an infant and his or her primary caregiver. (Hetherington &amp; Parke, 1999)  [[Harry Harlow]] and his research in [[developmental psychology]] showed that attachment between infant and caregiver is vitally important to the [[psychological development]] of the infant and requires physical contact with a warm and responsive mother. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  These early experiences and reactions of the infants to the primary caregivers become working models for later adult relationships. (Larsen &amp; Buss, 2008)  Therefore, conclusions can be visibly drawn linking attachment and dependency need; vital, infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth (dependency need) can stem from the type of interaction between that of an infant and his or her primary caregiver.  Three different types of attachment styles, securely attached, avoidantly attached, and ambivalent attached, can result from varying levels and styles of care a primary caregiver provides an infant.

== Further breakdown ==

Dependency needs can be categorized into biological needs and social needs.

=== Biological needs ===

Biological needs are basic survival needs, such as protection from harm, consumption of food, and regulation of body temperature; they are mechanisms used to promote and maintain proper body functioning.

=== Social needs ===

Social needs are "acquired psychological processes that activate emotional responses to particular need-relevant incentives." (Reeve, 2009)  Need for eye contact, expression of positive emotions by caretakers or loved ones, and cuddling—anything that fosters a sense of [[emotional security]]—can be defined as a social need.  There are four basic social needs: '''power''', '''achievement''', '''intimacy''', and '''affiliation.'''  People who have [[need for power|power needs]] look to gain dominance, achieve high statuses, and/or achieve high positions in their occupations, households, or social groups or organizations. These people look for leadership roles, and are usually happy and content when they are in control.  People who have [[need for achievement|achievement needs]] are willing to seek out and accomplish tasks.  The strive for achievement can develop strongly in children when influenced by their parents. Intimacy needs are linked to affiliation needs.  Intimacy needs can be sought out and met when in close, personal relationships with others. Fulfillment of intimacy needs can help decrease an individual's chance of developing onset of depression, as well as help reduce an individual's fears of being rejected.  [[need for affiliation|Affiliation needs]] are people's needs to feel a sense of involvement and "belonging" within a social group; affiliation needs have to do more with the acceptance of behavior.  It is [[human nature]] for people to want to be liked by others and get approval from them.  It is also innate for people to want to maintain healthy and positive relationships with others around them.

=== Key contributors ===

There have been numerous theorists who have done research in relation to dependency need.

'''Robert Bornstein''', a professor of psychology, researched certain levels of dependency needs, as well as [[personality disorder]]s related to dependency needs, including [[dependent personality disorder]] (DPD) and [[histrionic personality disorder]] (HPD).  Henry Murray's publication, Explorations in Personality (1938) describes differences and similarities between types of dependency needs.

As mentioned previously, [[Abraham Maslow]] was a key contributor to the establishment of a dependency need theory.  His need theory, [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]], is thought to help a person achieve the unsatisfied needs of one's self.  In his hierarchy, he outlined five needs crucial to [[Developmental psychology|human development]] and happiness across the lifespan; they are thought to occur in stages.  The five stages include, physiological needs, safety needs, social needs, self-esteem needs, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are needs that everyone has to have in order to survive, such as air, food, water, and sleep.  After a person has attained these physiological needs, he or she then focuses his or her attention to safety needs. Safety needs help an individual feel secure in order to make him or her feel safe, physically and emotionally. An example of this can be seen in people's choices of where they choose to live and work, and attaining medical insurance.  After safety needs are met, social needs are the focus of attention.  Social needs have to do with interactions with others (friends, family, romantic partners) and receiving love. After these needs have been met, one's self-esteem needs begin to arise. Esteem needs can be both internal and external. Having and achieving self-respect, receiving attention, and accomplishing achievements are examples of self-esteem needs. After one succeeds in the area of [[self-esteem]], [[self-actualization]] needs are to be met. One's full potential as a person, his or her ''self-actualization'', helps him or her keep developing as a person throughout the lifespan. (Maslow, 2002)

Another key contributor to the establishment of dependency need theory was Sigmund Freud's theory of [[psychosexual development]].

'''Freud's theory of psychosexual development'''

[[Sigmund Freud]] came up with a five-stage theory that stated human beings are born with sexual energy; this energy was thought to develop in five stages (oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages). The first stage, the [[oral stage]], occurs from birth to 2 years of age.  The key component of the oral stage is the child's fascination with his or her mouth, more specifically, putting items into his or her mouth, breast feeding, etc. The child is thought to get great pleasure from such objects being placed in his or her mouth. The second stage, the [[anal stage]], occurs from 18 months of age to 3 years. In this stage, the child's main focus is on his or her anus, and the experience of toilet training is thought to be quite pleasurable. The third phase, the [[phallic stage]], occurs from 3 years of age to 6 years of age. In this stage, the main focus of the child is on discovering his or her genital region. Children become more aware of their own bodies, the bodies of other children, as well as their parents' bodies. Children also become aware of anatomical sex differences between male and female genitalia.  Freud believed during this stage, that boys had the idea that they needed to compete with their fathers in order to possess their mothers.  He also believed that girls felt penis envy towards males, and therefore blamed their mothers for not having a penis; the girls then competed for psychosexual possession of their fathers. The fourth stage, the [[latency stage]], occurs from 6 years of age until the child reaches puberty.  In this stage, children are thought to be "latent" of sexual energies, however sexual urges still remain. During this time, children play with the same sex friends.  The final stage in psychosexual development is the [[genital stage]], occurring from puberty through the rest of adulthood.  In this stage, individuals focus on detaching from their parents, doing their own thing and not relying as much on their parents. In this stage, genitalia is the main focus and sexual energy and urges are normal. The person's concern is now focused on mature, adult friendships and family relationships, as well as intimate relationships, and adult responsibilities. (Basic, 2011)

There are differences and similarities worth noting when it comes to biological needs and social needs. Biological needs are required for survival in everyday life, whereas social needs are acquired and learned. Similarities between the two include the relevance that an individual requires both types of needs in one's life in order to live happy, healthy lives in which he or she is able to thrive and succeed; if an individual's needs are not met, he or she may become sad and/or depressed.

== What happens when dependency needs are not met ==

A person's vital needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth are ever so important to an individual.  If these dependency needs are not met, particularly when an individual is younger, emotional, psychological, as well as physical problems may result down the road. Also, [[mental retardation]] or even death can result in extreme cases of neglect of dependency needs (usually in cases when biological needs are neglected). In general, depression, sadness, and loneliness are likely results if dependency needs are not met no matter what age an individual is.

== Key experiments ==

Many experiments relating the importance of dependency need have been conducted over the years; here, three influential experiments are outlined.

=== Harry Harlow monkey experiment ===
[[File:Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) (5780783616).jpg|thumb|upright|Harlow exclusively used rhesus macaques in his experiments.]]

When this study was conducted in 1957, [[Harry Harlow]] was questioning current theories about dependency and love. At this time, Harlow and his team stated that love began developing as a feeding bond between an infant and its mother; this notion applied to family members, as well. It was also thought that humans, along with other social animals, lived in organized societies in order to regularize sexual contact. Harlow, being fascinated with the concept of love and nurturing, worked with monkeys to test these theories. (Berger, 2005)

In Harlow's monkey experiment, newborn monkeys were separated from their mothers almost immediately after birth. They were then raised with substitute "mothers" made of either (1) wire or (2) wood covered with a soft cloth. In one of the experiments, both the wire and wood mothers were presented to the infant monkey in the same cage, and only one wore a nipple, which the infant was able to nurse from. Some of the monkeys nursed from the wire mother, and others from the cloth mother. According to Berger, Harlow found that even when the wire mother was the source of food the infant monkey spent more of its time with the cloth surrogate. Harlow also found that the cloth mother provided not only food to the infant monkeys, but also was able to provide comfort and security for them.  The interpretation made by Harlow about this was that the liking for the cloth surrogate mother showed the importance of [[affection]], emotion, nurturance, and dependency in mother child relationships.

=== René Spitz orphan study ===

The phenomenon of infant dependency need was first noticed in [[René Spitz]]'s orphan study.  It was during this study that researchers learned of the higher mortality rates for infants maintained in [[orphanage]]s. When the obvious factors such as inadequate [[nutrition]], contagious [[disease]]s, etc., were ruled out, researchers discovered that mortality rates could be greatly ameliorated by having the nurses in charge of the infants in the orphanages [[cuddle]] them in a way that approximated the amount of cuddling infants would normally receive from their own [[parent]]s.

Spitz's orphan study focused on two groups of children, starting when the children were infants, and continued all the way until they reached 12 years of age. The first group of children were raised in an orphanage; the children in this group only received minimal care, let alone any special, one-on-one time with a caregiver. In the second group, each infant received individual care from various women caregivers serving a prison sentence; these caregivers were with the children for the first year of their lives. When the children in each group turned two years old, dramatic differences occurred between them.

Results from the experiment showed drastic differences. It was found that children raised in the orphanage, whom had received minimal care, had less developmental progress than children raised in the prison. Only 26 kids could walk, and only a few could talk. Some of the orphanage kids had signs of mental retardation and were psychologically and socially underdeveloped for their age. Whereas in the prison group, most all the children had reached the point of full development for their age division.

Defined previously, dependency needs are "The vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, [[affection]], shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth" (Segen, 1992). When those needs are not met psychological, emotional, physical and attachment problems can arise. This was shown in the Spitz orphan study. (Shepard, 2013)

=== Types of attachment ===

"[[Attachment theory]] states that a child's first relationship is a love relationship that will have profound, long-lasting effects on an individual's subsequent development." (Colin, 1991) The closeness of the child to the person providing protection and a sense of [[security]] will becomes this figure to the child. This figure lays the foundation for the child to be able to form other secure relationships in the future.  There are four main types of attachment, including: secure, anxious/avoidant, anxious/ambivalent and disorganized/disoriented.

In securely attached babies, the baby's attachment figure is an effective secure base from them. They are able to explore the world and can even handle brief separation in an environment unfamiliar to them. They are secure in the fact that they know the attachment figure will return and that there is little to no anxiety experienced. (Colin, 1991)

In anxious/avoidant attachment, the baby is [[anxious]] about the attachment figure's (typically a parent) responsiveness. The baby then develops a defensive strategy for managing his or her own anxiety. The baby experiencing this situation has very little, to no confidence in relation to being responded to; so when the baby seeks care, the child expects to be rejected. For example, if the baby is hungry, he or she will not tell anyone/cry because he or she doesn't expect anyone to meet this need. (Colin, 1991)

In anxious/ambivalent attachment, signs of [[anxiety]], anger, and mixed feelings about the attachment figure are present in the baby; this is especially true after brief separations of the baby from the attachment figure, occurring in unfamiliar environments. (Colin, 1991)

In disorganized/disoriented babies, the baby does not have a consistent strategy for managing separation and reunion with his or her attachment figure. Some of the babies show to be depressed, demonstrate avoidant behavior, express anger, and/or show disturbing behaviors. Infants in this category have typically been [[child abuse|maltreated]]. (Colin, 1991)

== Today and future ==

=== Current research ===

The research currently being done in the last few years in relation to dependency need relates largely to [[attachment theory]].  Most studies of attachment theory focus on how attachment relates to other aspects in the individual's life; for example, how an individual's attachment style (developed early on) affects his or her display of emotions after a break-up, or how an individual's attachment style affects his or her ability to make new friends in college.

A study done in 2010 by Stephanie Parade, Esther Leerke, and Nayena Blankson looked at the correlation between an individual's attachment to his or her parents and how well he or she is able to make friends; this study specifically focused on college-age individuals. The study also looked at [[social anxiety]] as the mediator.  The results of this study show that the more securely attached a person is to his or her parents; the easier it is for him or her to make friends.  These findings are consistent to Bowlby's proposition. The authors also found that social anxiety only showed up in the minority. The participants in the minority group had less social anxiety when they had a secure relationship with their parents, which in turn helped them be more sociable overall. (Parade, Leerke, &amp; Blankson, 2010)

Another current study done by Gnilka, Ashby, and Noble, looked at "adult attachment styles and the psychological outcomes, like hopelessness and [[life satisfaction]], using maladaptive and [[adaptive]] perfectionism as the mediators." (Gnika, Ashby, &amp;  Noble, 2013) The results show that having high levels of avoidant or anxiety attachment will cause low maladaptive perfectionism, which overall makes one more likely to have low life satisfaction and high levels of hopelessness. These findings can benefit counselors when working with patients who have problems with [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]].

==== Relationship to female suicide attempts ====

Not a whole lot of research is going on in this field today.  One article, done in 1995, looked at female suicide and dependency needs. The focus of the article was on the dependency needs of female adolescent suicide attempters and non-attempters. It also looked at other social network and intimate relationships for both suicide attempters and non-attempters. The authors hypothesized that dependency needs would be higher in suicide attempters. The results displayed a similarity in both groups, although, the sample size was too small to generalize to attempters. The article suggests future research on the range of dependency and the effect dependency might have on suicide. (Beettridge &amp; Favreau, 1995)

=== Viability ===

In the last decade, research on the topic of dependency need has been declining.  The theory of dependency need has largely been incorporated into [[attachment theory]].

== Conclusions ==

Vital, originally infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth, more specifically known as "dependency needs", change and decrease with age and maturity. As an individual gets older, these needs usually decrease in strength and can normally be met individually, or fulfilled by relationships among partners, family members or friends.

By looking at historical research pioneered by Murray, Maslow, Freud, and Harlow, as well as more recent concepts developed by Spritz, Colin, Parade et al., Beettridge &amp; Favreau, one can determine that dependency need is an important psychological concept, encompassed in many areas of psychology.  Throughout time, the basic needs related to safety, love, affection, and protection have seemed to be a subject of utmost importance.  No matter the way one theorizes the concept of dependency need, it is well known that all humans seem to have these basics needs.  It is also known that if these needs are somehow not adequately met, the person who has been neglected in this way, will likely suffer deep-seated emotional, psychological, and possibly even physical hardships.

Today, the concept of dependency need is largely interrelated with the concept of attachment theory. Nowadays, a lot of attachment theory studies are interested in seeing if there is a relationship between a person's style of attachment (developed in infancy) and the way in which he or she deals with whatever life throws his or her way (years later); i.e., dealing with emotions after a break-up or making friendships in college. Conclusions can be visibly drawn linking attachment and dependency need; vital, infantile needs for mothering, love, affection, shelter, protection, security, food, and warmth (dependency need) can stem from the type of interaction between that of an infant and his or her primary caregiver.  Attachment theory can also go beyond infancy to look at how early interactions have shaped an individual's personality, and how he or she deals with life situations years and years down the road.  Dependency need continues to be a concept that is of great interest to psychologists (more specifically tied into attachment theory) and is ever-present in the everyday lives of all human beings.

'''Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI)''' also called Decentralized Artificial Intelligence&lt;ref&gt;Demazeau, Yves, and J-P. Müller, eds. Decentralized Ai. Vol. 2. Elsevier, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of [[Multi-agent system|Multi-Agent Systems]].

==Definition==
Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is an approach to solving complex learning, [[automated planning|planning]], and decision making problems. It is [[embarrassingly parallel]], thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes ([[Intelligent agent|agents]]), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive to changes in the problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.

DAI systems do not require all the relevant data to be aggregated in a single location, in contrast to monolithic or centralized Artificial Intelligence systems which have tightly coupled and geographically close processing nodes. Therefore, DAI systems often operate on sub-samples or hashed impressions of very large datasets. In addition, the source dataset may change or be updated during the course of the execution of a DAI system.

==Goals==
The objectives of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are to solve the [[automated reasoning|reasoning]], planning, learning and perception problems of [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]], especially if they require large data, by distributing the problem to autonomous processing nodes (agents). To reach the objective, DAI requires:
* A [[Distributed computing|distributed system]] with robust and elastic computation on unreliable and failing resources that are loosely coupled
* Coordination of the actions and communication of the nodes
* Subsamples of large data sets and [[online machine learning]]

There are many reasons for wanting to distribute intelligence or cope with multi-agent systems. Mainstream problems in DAI research include the following:
* Parallel problem solving: mainly deals with how classic artificial intelligence concepts can be modified, so that [[multiprocessor]] systems and clusters of computers can be used to speed up calculation.
* Distributed problem solving (DPS): the concept of [[Intelligent agent|agent]], autonomous entities that can communicate with each other, was developed to serve as an [[abstraction]] for developing DPS systems. See below for further details.
* Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS): a branch of DAI that builds the foundation for simulations that need to analyze not only phenomena at [[macroscopic|macro]] level but also at [[microscopic scale|micro]] level, as it is in many [[social simulation]] scenarios.

==History==
In the 1975 distributed artificial intelligence emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interaction of intelligent agents[2]. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived as a group of intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving [1]. In [[Multi-agent system]]s the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.

==Examples==
Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving are the two main DAI approaches. There are numerous applications and tools.

==Approaches==
Two types of DAI has emerged: 
* In [[Multi-agent system]]s agents coordinate their knowledge and activities and reason about the processes of coordination. Agents are physical or virtual entities that can act, perceive its environment and communicate with other agents. The agent is autonomous and has skills to achieve goals. The agents change the state of their environment by their actions. There are a number of different coordination techniques[3].
* In distributed problem solving the work is divided among nodes and the knowledge is shared. The main concerns are task decomposition and synthesis of the knowledge and solutions.

DAI can apply a bottom-up approach to AI, similar to the [[subsumption architecture]] as well as the traditional top-down
approach of AI. In addition, DAI can also be a vehicle for [[emergence]].

==Applications==
Areas where DAI have been applied are:
* Electronic commerce, e.g. for [[Trading strategy|trading strategies]] the DAI system learns financial trading rules from subsamples of very large samples of financial data
* Networks, e.g. in [[telecommunication]]s the DAI system controls the cooperative resources in a WLAN network http://dair.uncc.edu/projects/past-projects/wlan-resource
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Routing]], e.g. model vehicle flow in transport networks
* [[Scheduling (production processes)|Scheduling]], e.g. [[flow shop scheduling]] where the resource management entity ensures local optimization and cooperation for global and local consistency
* Multi-Agent systems, e.g. [[Artificial life|Artificial Life]], the study of simulated life 
* Electric power systems, e.g. COndition Monitoring Multi-Agent System (COMMAS) applied to transformer condition monitoring, and IntelliTEAM II Automatic Restoration System &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Catterson|first=Victoria M.|last2=Davidson|first2=Euan M.|last3=McArthur|first3=Stephen D.

==Agents and Multi-agent systems==
Notion of Agents: Agents can be described as distinct entities with standard boundaries and interfaces designed for problem solving.

Notion of Multi-Agents:Multi-Agent system is defined as a network of agents which are loosely coupled working as a single entity like society for problem solving that an individual agent cannot solve.

==Software agents==
The key concept used in DPS and MABS is the abstraction called [[software agent]]s. An agent is a virtual (or physical) [[Wiktionary:autonomy|autonomous]] entity that has an understanding of its environment and acts upon it. An agent is usually able to communicate with other agents in the same system to achieve a common goal, that one agent alone could not achieve. This communication system uses an [[agent communication language]].

A first classification that is useful is to divide agents into:
* reactive agent – A reactive agent is not much more than an automaton that receives input, processes it and produces an output.
* deliberative agent – A [[deliberative agent]] in contrast should have an internal view of its environment and is able to follow its own plans.
* hybrid agent – A hybrid agent is a mixture of reactive and deliberative, that follows its own plans, but also sometimes directly reacts to external events without deliberation.

Well-recognized agent architectures that describe how an agent is internally structured are:
* [[ASMO (cognitive architecture)|ASMO]] (emergence of distributed modules)
* [[BDI software agent|BDI]] (Believe Desire Intention, a general architecture that describes how plans are made)
* [[InterRAP]] (A three-layer architecture, with a reactive, a deliberative and a social layer)
* PECS (Physics, Emotion, Cognition, Social, describes how those four parts influences the agents behavior).
* [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] (a rule-based approach)

== Challenges==
The challenges in Distributed AI are:

1.How to carry out communication and interaction of agents and which communication language or protocols should be used.

2.How to ensure the coherency of agents.

3.How to synthesise the results among 'intelligent agents' group by formulation, description, decomposition and allocation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23604">A Dominance signal is used in a [[dominance hierarchy]] or [[pecking order]] to indicate an animal's [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]]. Dominance signals are a type of [[internal environment]] signal that demonstrate the signalers attributes &lt;sup&gt;[[Dominance signal#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. Dominance signals are necessary for several species for [[mating]], maintaining social hierarchies and defending territories&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laidre|first=Mark E.|last2=Elwood|first2=Robert W.|title=Motivation matters: cheliped extension displays in the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus, are honest signals of hunger|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347208001012|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=75|issue=6|pages=2041–2047|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominance signals also provide information about an animals [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Animals have developed [[conflict management]] strategies to reduce frequency of aggressive incidents in competitive matters. This [[evolution]] is the basis of dominance signals&lt;sup&gt;[[Dominance signal#cite note-3|[3]]].&lt;/sup&gt;
[[File:Galapagos_dominance_display.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Galapagos_dominance_display.jpg|thumb|Two [[Galápagos tortoise|Galapagos tortoises]] engage in a dominance display in an enclosure on [[Santa Cruz Island]].]]
Dominance signals can be operationally defined by (1) acts or displays produced by signalers, (2) which conveys meaning messages to recipients such that (3) the signal is met with a response and (4) the response results in dominance being displayed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For example, (1) hermit claws raise their claws performing a threat signal, (2) which expresses intent to attack to challenger (3) and the challenger makes a decision to retreat which (4) reinforces signaller's dominance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The earliest study of animal signals can be attributed to [[Charles Darwin]]'s "The Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals", which introduced the comparative study of signals across all animals&lt;sup&gt;[[Dominance signal#cite note-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt;. Expressive abilities of the face are the basis of nonverbal expression.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehu|first1=Marc|last2=Scherer|first2=Klaus R.|date=11 February 2012|title=A psycho-ethological approach to social signal processing|journal=Cognitive Processing|volume=13|issue=S2|pages=397–414|doi=10.1007/s10339-012-0435-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facial signals help maintain dominance or "status" relationships by allowing species to predict the outcome of their encounter, and calculate the cost of their own fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] furthered the essential framework for studying animal signals with his ‘four questions’ about the [[phylogeny]], function, development and mechanism of signals or any other behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calisi|first=Rebecca M.|title=An integrative overview of the role of gonadotropin-inhibitory hormone in behavior: Applying Tinbergen’s four questions|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0016648014001026|journal=General and Comparative Endocrinology|volume=203|pages=95–105|doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.03.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dominance signals''' are the basis of animal hierarchies and are triggered by stress environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These signals are used to maintain courtship dominance, social dominance and territorial and resource dominance both within and between different species. Dominance signals are prominent far beyond the ethology literature, as humans express them in several forms.

== Modalities ==
Animals use several [[modality (semiotics)|modalities]] of communication to express [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]]. Aggressive encounters between competing individuals can result in significant costs for animals. To minimize fighting costs and increase [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]], many species have [[evolved]] specialized signalling systems to assert dominance by electing specific cues or signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marler|first=Peter|date=1967-08-18|title=Animal Communication Signals: We are beginning to understand how the structure of animal signals relates to the function they serve|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/157/3790/769|journal=Science|language=en|volume=157|issue=3790|pages=769–774|doi=10.1126/science.157.3790.769|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17842771}}&lt;/ref&gt; These signals allow individuals to gauge the status of [[conspecifics]] and not engage in combat with individuals of higher rank or strength.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Posner|first=Michael I.|last2=Nissen|first2=Mary J.|last3=Klein|first3=Raymond M.|title=Visual dominance: An information-processing account of its origins and significance.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-295X.83.2.157|journal=Psychological Review|language=en|volume=83|issue=2|pages=157–171|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.83.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such signals are found in several [[species]] and can present themselves in many different ways.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Visual dominance signals ===
[[Visual communication]] is a common [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]] signal among animals. They are an effective modality as they come at a low cost to the animal and minimize risk. The [[Gila monster|Gila Monster]] (''Heloderma suspectum'') for example, express bright orange splotches during [[territorial conflict]] to warn competitors that they are poisonous, and thus assert their dominance over a territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=1908-1992.|first=Bogert, Charles M. (Charles Mitchill),|last2=Rafael.|first2=Martín del Campo,|date=1956|title=The gila monster and its allies : the relationships, habits, and behavior of the lizards of the family Helodermatidae. Bulletin of the AMNH ; v. 109, article 1|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/1232|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acoustic dominance signals ===
[[Acoustics|Acoustic]] [[communication]] is often used by animals to express dominance. Acoustic sounds can vary substantially in amplitude, duration, and frequency structure which can influence how the signal is received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-41494-7_1|title=Animal Communication and Noise|last=Brumm|first=Henrik|date=2013|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642414930|series=Animal Signals and Communication|pages=1–4|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-41494-7_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal communication|Vocalizations]] can be effective for a species as it may decrease physical interaction, which may decrease injury costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claridge|first=M F|date=1985-01-01|title=Acoustic Signals in the Homoptera: Behavior, Taxonomy, and Evolution|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.en.30.010185.001501|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=297–317|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.30.010185.001501|issn=0066-4170}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern elephant seal]]s (''Mirounga angustirostris''), for example, have a [[Polygynous animal mating|polygynous]] breeding system in which adult males establish dominance hierarchies that facilitates [[copulation]] with females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haley|first=Michael P.|last2=Deutsch|first2=Charles J.|last3=Boeuf|first3=Burney J. Le|title=Size, dominance and copulatory success in male northern elephant seals, Mirounga angustirostris|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347284713613|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=48|issue=6|pages=1249–1260|doi=10.1006/anbe.1994.1361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acoustic signalling is detrimental in resolving competition between males for mates. Elephant seals express unique acoustic signals that allow males to remember the violations of past rivals and recall which seals are dominant.

=== Tactile dominance signals ===
[[Haptic communication|Tactile]] signals occur when physical contact is made between two competing animals and can only be transmitted over very short distances.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Charles C.|date=1977-02-01|title=Communication and Displays of Snakes|url=https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/17/1/217/172168|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=217–223|doi=10.1093/icb/17.1.217|issn=1540-7063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tactile communication is often very important in building and maintaining relationship among social animals as it can establish hierarchies.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; [[Snake|Snakes (''Serpentes'')]] engage in tactile communication to compete for dominance. This communication is often referred to as a [[Combat|combat ritual]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; It involves interaction sequences between two male snakes and has been recorded in four groups of snakes including [[Colubridae|colubrids]], [[Elapidae|elapids]], [[Viperinae|viperines]] and [[crotalines]].&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; During competition, the male snakes will exert pressures through pushing, flipping or entwining, which will result in one physically subduing the other. The dominant male will then proceed to copulate with the females.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Electrical dominance signals ===
Electric signalling is a mode of communication often used by [[aquatic animal]]s living in murky water. Electric signalling can minimize fighting costs and allow dominance to be exerted in low visibility conditions.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Mary|last2=Heiligenberg|first2=Walter|title=Court and spark: electric signals in the courtship and mating of gymnotoid fish|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347285801391|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=33|issue=1|pages=254–265|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(85)80139-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Electric fish|Electric Fish]] (''Sternarchorhynchus''), the frequency of [[electric organ discharge]] signals the dominance status of individuals.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt;

== Underlying mechanisms ==
Dominance signals, like other animal behaviours, have internal underlying [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that allow for the external display to occur. Underlying mechanisms may include [[hormone]]s, [[sensory organ]]s, [[cognitive map]]s, [[spatial memory]], [[associative learning]], [[Brain Structure and Function|brain structure]], [[mental representation]]s and [[neural]] [[morphology (biology)|morphology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Szylman|first=P.|last2=Better|first2=O. S.|last3=Chaimowitz|first3=C.|last4=Rosler|first4=A.|date=1976-02-12|title=Role of hyperkalemia in the metabolic acidosis of isolated hypoaldosteronism|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=294|issue=7|pages=361–365|doi=10.1056/NEJM197602122940703|issn=0028-4793|pmid=1674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pukeko._(Porphyrio_porphyrio)._(12083002914).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pukeko._(Porphyrio_porphyrio)._(12083002914).jpg|thumb|154x154px|[[Pukeko|The Pukeko]], or New Zealand Swamp Hen, displaying a red badge, used for asserting social [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance]].]]
Dominance signalling in animals is often a result of [[hormone]] changes. Hormones can work in either [[positive feedback loop]]s or [[negative feedback loop]]s and can alter the [[phenotype]]s of behaviour.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dey|first=Cody J.|last2=Dale|first2=James|last3=Quinn|first3=James S.|date=2014-01-22|title=Manipulating the appearance of a badge of status causes changes in true badge expression|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1775/20132680|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=281|issue=1775|pages=20132680|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.2680|issn=0962-8452|pmid=24285201|pmc=3866412}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pukeko]] (''Porphyrio porphyrio melanotus''), for example, badge display is an indicator of dominance. It has been found that altering a Pukeko’s badge can actually change [[Androgen|androgen circulation]] and can cause feedback effects on the individuals [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In a field study by Cody Dey, researchers found that Pukeko which had the apparent size of their [[frontal shield]] decreased, received more aggression and also decreased their true shield relative to individuals who did not have their apparent shield size altered.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

== Courtship dominance signals ==
Dominance signals used during courtship are driven by interactions between a male’s fitness and a female’s preference. Dominance signals influence a female’s choice of mate because the power of a signal may be a reflection of the male’s [[genetics|genetic]] success.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krakauer|first=Alan H.|title=Kin selection and cooperative courtship in wild turkeys|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature03325|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=434|issue=7029|pages=69–72|doi=10.1038/nature03325|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wild turkeys (''Meleagris gallppavo'') ===
[[File:Eastern_Wild_Turkeys.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eastern_Wild_Turkeys.jpg|thumb|Eastern [[Wild turkey|Wild Turkey's]] in [[Social interaction|Social Interaction]]]]

Dominance signals are elicited in wild turkeys during [[courtship]]. Wild turkeys fundamentally follow a dominant hierarchy as a way to increase their inclusive fitness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The dominant subordinate relationship occurs between two brothers. One brother, the dominant, copulates while the other male, the subordinate, helps.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After birth, the physical appearance of the male turkeys is used to indicate dominance. Physical characters such as height, bulk, and density are evaluated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Gymnotoid electric fish (''Eigenmannia virescens'') ===
[[Electric fish]] express dominance signals during courtship by exerting electric organ discharge “chirps”.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; The “chirps” are an indicator of a male’s aggressiveness and size. The more “chirps” a male electric fish produces, increases his likelihood of reproductive success. Continual bouts of chirping can last hours on evenings prior to courting. The electric chirps stimulate females to spawn.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The chirp involves a slight increase in frequency followed by a cessation of the male dominant frequency.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Chirps are normally short and abrupt during aggressive encounters when courting females, however, become softer during actual [[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]].&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

== Social dominance signals ==
Social dominance is formed through dominance [[hierarchies]]. Such hierarchies arise when a member of social group elicits a dominance signal to initiate competitive interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hebets|first=Eileen A.|date=2008-11-01|title=Seismic signal dominance in the multimodal courtship display of the wolf spider Schizocosa stridulans Stratton 1991|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/19/6/1250/197617|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=19|issue=6|pages=1250–1257|doi=10.1093/beheco/arn080|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gorillas (''Gorilla beringei graueri'') ===
[[File:Young_gorilla_drumming_chest_(3956000911).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Young_gorilla_drumming_chest_(3956000911).jpg|thumb|283x283px|A Young [[Gorilla]] chest-drumming.]]Gorilla’s chest-drumming is a signal used to demonstrate social dominance.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stewart|first=Kelly J.|last2=Harcourt|first2=Alexander H.|date=1994-01-01|title=Gorillas&amp;apos; Vocalizations During Rest Periods: Signals of Impending Departure?|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853994x00127|journal=Behaviour|language=en|volume=130|issue=1|pages=29–40|doi=10.1163/156853994x00127|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This non-verbal, rapid chest-drumming creates a sound because gorillas have air sacks on both sides of their throat. The drumming is often accompanied by screaming and non-specified sounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This signal is used as a warning signal to young gorilla to back-down if they are trying to join their [[tribe]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This signal will only cease if the young male backs-down or if they engage in battle.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The young males are not challenging the dominant for [[courtship]] behaviour alone, but rather are trying for group-wide control.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixson|first=Alan F.|date=1977-05-01|title=Observations on the displays, menstrual cycles and sexual behaviour of the "Black ape" of Celebes (Macaca nigra)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04141.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Zoology|language=en|volume=182|issue=1|pages=63–84|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04141.x|issn=1469-7998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chest-drumming is also used a sign of victory after a battle and demonstrates who is the male dominant.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As gorillas are male dominant, females do not produce these dominance signals. [[Silverback gorilla]]s also use chest-drumming to command their family to follow them, reinforcing familial dominance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Dominance signals that reinforce hierarchy are crucial for survival for animals like gorillas who are extremely aggressive. A Gorilla’s chest drumming, for example, reduces intra-species aggression by making the dominant-subordinate relationship clear. For social animals like gorillas, having and maintaining a dominant male is crucial to maintain their way of life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Territorial dominance signals ==
Dominance signals are often elicited over competition for [[territory]]. Dominance over a territory can be highly beneficial as it would provide abundant recourse. However, the cost of holding a territory can also be quite high. Dominance signals allow signalers to convey the dominant-[[subordinate]] relationship to a receiver avoiding physical contact.

=== Atlantic salmon (''Salmo salar'') ===
[[File:Atlantic_Salmon_Adults_(5198590842).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atlantic_Salmon_Adults_(5198590842).jpg|thumb|183x183px|Adult [[Atlantic salmon|Atlantic Salmon]] returning to their river to [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].]]

Dominance signals used by [[Atlantic salmon|Atlantic Salmon]] allow for territory to be defended. When an Atlantic salmon is challenged by another salmon for territory and resources, a physical change in colour display occurs.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Connor|first=Kirstine I.|last2=Metcalfe|first2=Neil B.|last3=Taylor|first3=Alan C.|title=Does darkening signal submission in territorial contests between juvenile Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar ?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003347299912605|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=58|issue=6|pages=1269–1276|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1260}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a subordinate male enters the territory of a dominant male, it will become darker after assessment of the dominant male, while the dominant male remains his original colour.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This change in colour has been recorded in the [[sclera]] of the eye and the overall body coloration.

== Human dominance signals ==
Dominance signals are typically associated with [[ethology]]. However, humans display such signals as it is an innate characteristic. Fundamentally, all social species must have expressions of dominance and engage in hierarchy systems to function.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/hdbk_nonverbalcomm/n15.xml|title=The SAGE Handbook of Nonverbal Communication|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|last2=Dunbar|first2=Norah E.|date=2006|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=279–298|doi=10.4135/9781412976152.n15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[voice pitch]] is one of the most prevalent dominance signal and has evolutionary ties to non-human primates.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puts|first=David Andrew|last2=Hodges|first2=Carolyn R.|last3=Cárdenas|first3=Rodrigo A.|last4=Gaulin|first4=Steven J.C.|title=Men's voices as dominance signals: vocal fundamental and formant frequencies influence dominance attributions among men|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513807000463|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=28|issue=5|pages=340–344|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physically, men's vocal folds and vocal tracts are longer than those of women, which produces a lower fundamental frequency and closer spacing of formant frequencies in men.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These differences are not fully clear from an evolutionary perspective; However, it has been suggested that voice pitch is linked to male dominance competition.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Current research on male voice pitch suggests that lower pitch is perceived as increasing dominance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Lower pitch voices also tend to be indicators of physical and social dominance.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other [[Speech|vocalization]] signals include loud rapid speaking tempo and clear articulation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Physical size is one of the most prevalent dominance signals a human can elicit. Height, weight, bulk, and muscularity send signals of strength and can hold power over subordinate males.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other non-verbal signals that are perceived as signs of dominance are rapid gait, straight postures, firm and strong stances, animated gesturing, and clothing or hair styles that create a bulkier appearance.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montepare|first=Joann M.|last2=Zebrowitz-McArthur|first2=Leslie|title=Perceptions of adults with childlike voices in two cultures|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/002210318790045X|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=23|issue=4|pages=331–349|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(87)90045-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial expression is used as a dominance signal in humans. Derived from our [[primate]] [[ancestor]]s, faces of mature members have broader faces with a more defined jaw, smaller ratio of eye size to face size and larger noses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Younger members are perceived as having baby-faced features which includes rounder, softer faces, larger eyes when compared to face ratio, and smaller noses.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; These facial features can be used as dominance signals as baby-faced individuals are perceived as weak and submissive compared to mature faces which can indicate physical and social dominance.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

More subtle dominance signals have also been suggested such as head nods, less arm wrap, increasing gestures, and more left leg lean.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gifford|first=Robert|title=A lens-mapping framework for understanding the encoding and decoding of interpersonal dispositions in nonverbal behavior.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.2.398|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=66|issue=2|pages=398–412|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.2.398}}&lt;/ref&gt; These subtle differences are associated with perception of dominance among males.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Little research has been conducted regarding how or if, women elicit subtle dominance signals to express dominance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In [[music]], the '''dynamics''' of a piece is the variation in [[loudness]] between [[note (music)|notes]] or [[phrase (music)|phrases]]. Dynamics are indicated by specific [[musical notation]], often in some detail. However, dynamics markings still require interpretation by the performer depending on the musical context: for instance a ''piano'' (quiet) marking in one part of a piece might have quite different objective loudness in another piece, or even a different section of the same piece. The execution of dynamics also extends beyond loudness to include changes in [[timbre]] and sometimes [[tempo rubato]].
==Purpose and interpretation==
Dynamics are one of the [[musical expression|expressive elements of music]]. Used effectively, dynamics help musicians sustain variety and interest in a musical performance, and communicate a particular emotional state or feeling.

Dynamic markings are always relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thiemel|first1=Matthias|title=Dynamics|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08458|website=Grove Music Online (subscriber only access)|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=7 July 2017|ref=Grove Dynamics}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{serif|'''''p'''''}} never indicates a precise level of [[loudness]], it merely indicates that music in a passage so marked should be considerably quieter than {{serif|'''''f'''''}}. There are many factors affecting the interpretation of a dynamic marking. For instance, the middle of a [[phrase (music theory)|musical phrase]] will normally be played louder than the beginning or ending, to ensure the phrase is properly shaped, even where a passage is marked {{serif|'''''p'''''}} throughout.  Similarly, in [[polyphony|multi-part music]], some [[part (music)|voices]] will naturally be played louder than others, for instance to emphasis the melody and the bass line, even if a whole passage is marked at one dynamic level. Some instruments are naturally louder than others - for instance, a [[tuba]] playing ''piano'' will likely be louder than a [[guitar]] playing ''fortissimo'', while a high-pitched instrument like the [[piccolo]] playing in its upper register can usually sound loud even when its actual decibel level is lower than that of other instruments.

Further, a dynamic marking does not necessarily only affect loudness of the music. A ''forte'' passage is not usually "the same as a ''piano'' passage but louder". Rather, a musician will often use a different approach to other aspects of expression like [[timbre]] or [[Articulation (music)|articulation]] to further illustrate the differences. Sometimes this might also extend to [[tempo]]. It's important for a performer to be able to control dynamics and tempo independently, and thus novice musicians are often instructed "don't speed up just because it's getting louder!". However, in some circumstances, a dynamic marking might also indicate a change of tempo.{{efn|For instance, in Schubert's string quartet ''[[Death and the Maiden Quartet|Death and the Maiden]]'', the ''dimenuendo'' marking is followed by ''[[a tempo]]'', indicating that the dimenuendo is a reduction in speed as well as in loudness. In the same work Schubert uses ''decrescendo'' to indicate a reduction in loudness with no change in speed.}}

In some [[scorewriter|music notation program]]s, there are default [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] key velocity values associated with these indications, but more sophisticated programs allow users to change these as needed. Apple's [[Logic Pro]] 9 (2009-2013) and Avid's [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]] 5 (2007-2009) use the following values: Sibelius 5 defines the following values, though these may be adjusted in Sibelius, within the range 0-127:

The two basic dynamic indications in music are:
* {{serif|'''''p'''''}} or ''piano'', meaning "soft".&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite book |first=Don Michael |last=Randel |authorlink=Don Michael Randel |publisher=Harvard University Press Reference Library |location=Cambridge, MA, US |year=2003 |title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vtp"&gt;{{cite web | title=Piano  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textp/Piano.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More subtle degrees of loudness or softness are indicated by:
* {{serif|'''''mp'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-piano'',  meaning "half soft".
* {{serif|'''''mf'''''}}, standing for ''mezzo-forte'',  meaning "half loud".&lt;ref name="vtd"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dynamics  | work=Virginia Tech Multimedia Music Dictionary | url=http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/textd/Dynamics.html  | accessdate=2012-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'', standing for ''più piano'' and meaning "softer".
* ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', standing for ''più forte'' and meaning "louder".

Use of up to three consecutive {{serif|'''''f'''''}}s or {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s is also common:
* {{serif|'''''pp'''''}}, standing for ''pianissimo'' and meaning "very soft".
* {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}, standing for ''fortissimo'' and meaning "very loud".
* {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, standing for ''pianississimo'' and meaning "more than very soft".
* {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, standing for ''fortississimo'' and meaning "more than very loud".&lt;ref name="vtd" /&gt;

===Changes===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)]] --&gt;
{{anchor|Abrupt changes|Gradual changes}}
{{redirect-multi|2|Crescendo|Diminuendo}}

[[Image:Dynamic's Note Velocity.svg|thumb|350px|Note Velocity is a [[MIDI]] measurement of the speed that the key travels from its rest position to completely depressed, with 127, the largest value in a 7-bit number, being instantaneous, and meaning as strong as possible. {{audio|MIDI dynamics fff to ppp.mid|Play a C major chord at each dynamic from fff to ppp}}]]

Three Italian words are used to show gradual changes in volume:

* '''''crescendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|cresc.}}'') translates as "increasing" (literally "growing").
* '''''decrescendo''''' (abbreviated to ''{{serif|decresc.}}'') translates as "decreasing".
* '''''diminuendo''''' (abbreviated ''{{serif|dim.}}'') translates as "diminishing".

Signs sometimes referred to as "[[hairpin]]s"&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Michael and Bourne, Joyce: ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'' (1996), entry "Hairpins".&lt;/ref&gt; are also used to stand for these words (See image). If the angle lines open up ([[File:Music-crescendo.svg|15x15px]]), then the indication is to get louder; if they close gradually ([[File:Music-diminuendo.svg|15x15px]]), the indication is to get softer. The following notation indicates music starting moderately strong, then becoming gradually stronger and then gradually quieter:

:&lt;score lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \relative c'' {
        \time 4/4
        \override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #2.5
        a4._\mf\&lt; gis16 a\! c4.\&gt; b8\! a4
    }
&lt;/score&gt;

Hairpins are usually written below the [[staff (music)|staff]] (or between the two staves in a [[grand staff]]), but are sometimes found above, especially in music for [[singer]]s or in music with multiple melody lines being played by a single performer. They tend to be used for dynamic changes over a relatively short space of time (at most a few [[bar (music)|bars]]), while ''{{serif|cresc.}}'', ''{{serif|decresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|dim.}}'' are generally used for changes over a longer period. Word directions can be extended with dashes to indicate over what time the event should occur, which may be as long as multiple pages. The word ''morendo'' ("dying") is also sometimes used for a gradual reduction in dynamics (and tempo).

For greater changes in dynamics, ''{{serif|cresc. molto}}'' and ''{{serif|dim. molto}}'' are often used, where the ''molto'' means "much". Similarly, for more gradual changes ''{{serif|poco cresc.}}'' and ''{{serif|poco dim.}}'' are used, where "poco" translates as ''a little'', or alternatively with ''poco a poco'' meaning "little by little''.

Sudden changes in dynamics may be notated by adding the word ''subito'' (meaning "suddenly") as a prefix or suffix to the new dynamic notation. ''Subito piano (''abbreviated ''{{serif| sub. '''p'''}}'') ("suddenly soft") indicates that the dynamics quickly, almost abruptly, lower the volume to approximately the {{serif|'''''p'''''}} range. It is often purposefully used to subvert the listeners expectation and will signify an intimacy expression. Although it uses the ''piano'' {{serif|'''''p'''''}} dynamic symbol, the performer has slight freedom in their interpretation, causing it to vary based on the preceding loudness or character of the piece.

{{anchor|Sudden_changes_and_accented_notes}}
[[Accent (music)|Accented notes]] can be notated  ''sforzando'', ''sforzato'', ''forzando'' or ''forzato'' (abbreviated {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}) ("forcing" or "forced"), or using the sign '''&gt;''', placed above or below the head of the note.

''Sforzando'' (or ''sforzato'', ''forzando'', ''forzato'') indicates a forceful accent and is abbreviated as {{serif|'''''sf'''''}}, {{serif|'''''sfz'''''}} or {{serif|'''''fz'''''}}. There is often confusion surrounding these markings and whether or not there is any difference in the degree of accent. However, all of these indicate the same expression, depending on the dynamic level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gerou |first=Tom |first2=Linda |last2= Lusk |title= Essential Dictionary of Music Notation: The Most Practical and Concise Source for Music Notation |year=1996 |publisher=Alfred Music Publishing |location= Van Nuys, CA |isbn= 978-0882847306 |pages=37–38 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=6PELtxxrz_QC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=sf+sfz+fz#v=onepage&amp;q=sf%20sfz%20fz&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent of the ''sforzando'' is determined purely by the performer.

The [[fortepiano (musical dynamic)|fortepiano]] notation {{serif|'''''fp'''''}} indicates a ''forte'' followed immediately by ''piano''. By contrast, {{serif|'''''pf'''''}} is an abbreviation for ''poco forte'', literally "a little loud" but (according to Brahms) meaning ''with the character of forte, but the sound of piano'', though rarely used because of possible confusion with ''[[#Words and phrases indicating changes of dynamics|pianoforte]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeffreysolow.com/Writings/AnEnigmaticMarkingExplainedVcS.doc An Enigmatic Marking Explained], by Jeffrey Solow, Violoncello Society Newsletter, Spring 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

While the typical range of dynamic  markings is from {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}, some pieces use additional markings of further emphasis. Extreme dynamic markings imply an extreme range of loudness, or, alternatively, imply an extremely subtle distinction between very small differences of loudness within a normal range. This kind of usage is most common in orchestral works from the late 19th-century onwards. Generally, these markings are supported by the [[orchestration]] of the work, with heavy forte markings brought to life by having many loud instruments like brass and percussion playing at once.

In [[Gustav Holst|Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} occurs twice in "Mars" and once in "Uranus", often punctuated by organ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/5/59/IMSLP05396-Holst_-_THE_PLANETS_-_Suite_for_Large_Orchestra_-_Partitur.pdf|title=The Planets|last=Holst|first=Gustav|publisher=Goodwin &amp; Tabb|year=1921|isbn=|location=London|pages=29, 42, 159|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]] marks a bassoon solo {{serif|'''''pppppp'''''}} (6 {{serif|'''''p'''''}}s) in his [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|''Pathétique'' Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/b/b5/IMSLP504312-PMLP2511-Tchaikovsky_-_Symphony_No.6_in_B_minor,_Op.74;_TH_30;_CW_27,_'Pathetic'.pdf|title=Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Symphonies in Full Score|last=Tchaikovsky|first=Peter Ilyitch|publisher=Dover Publications|year=1979|isbn=048623861X|location=New York|page=First movement, just before Allegro vivo|nopp=y|oclc=6414366}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses {{serif|'''''ffff'''''}} in passages of his ''[[1812 Overture]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://ks.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/f1/IMSLP01078-Tchaikovsky_-_1812_Overture.pdf|title=P.I.

==History==
''On Music'', one of the ''[[Moralia]]'' attributed to the philosopher [[Plutarch]] in the first century AD, suggests that ancient Greek musical performance included dynamic transitions – though dynamics receive far less attention in the text than does [[rhythm]] or [[harmony]].

The [[renaissance music|Renaissance]] [[composer]] [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] was one of the first to indicate dynamics in [[music notation]], but dynamics were used sparingly by composers until the late 18th century. [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach]] used some dynamic terms, including ''forte'', ''piano'', ''più piano'', and ''pianissimo'' (although written out as full words), and in some cases it may be that {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} was considered to mean ''pianissimo'' in this period.

The fact that the [[harpsichord]] could play only "terraced" dynamics (either loud or soft, but not in between), and the fact that composers of the period did not mark gradations of dynamics in their scores, has led to the "somewhat misleading suggestion that [[Baroque music|baroque]] dynamics are 'terraced dynamics'," writes [[Robert Donington]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Donington|Donington, Robert]]: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, baroque musicians constantly varied dynamics: in 1752, [[Johann Joachim Quantz]] wrote that "Light and shade must be constantly introduced ... by the incessant interchange of loud and soft."&lt;ref&gt;Donington, Robert: ''Baroque Music'' (1982) WW Norton, 1982. {{ISBN|0-393-30052-8}}. Page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, the [[harpsichord]] in fact becomes louder or softer depending on the thickness of the musical texture (four notes are louder than two). This allowed composers like J.S. Bach to build dynamics directly into their compositions, without the need for notation.

In the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]], composers greatly expanded the vocabulary for describing dynamic changes in their scores. Where [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] specified six levels ({{serif|'''''pp'''''}} to {{serif|'''''ff'''''}}), [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] used also {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}} (the latter less frequently), and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] used a range of terms to describe the dynamics he wanted. In the slow movement of Brahms's [[Horn Trio (Brahms)|trio for violin, horn and piano (Opus 40)]], he uses the expressions {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}}, ''molto piano'', and ''[[quasi niente]]'' to express different qualities of quiet. Many Romantic and later composers added ''{{serif|più '''p'''}}'' and ''{{serif|più '''f'''}}'', making for a total of ten levels between {{serif|'''''ppp'''''}} and {{serif|'''''fff'''''}}.

== Relation to audio dynamics ==
The introduction of modern recording techniques has provided alternative ways to control the dynamics of music. [[Dynamic range compression]] is used to control the [[Dynamic range#Music|dynamic range]] of a recording, or a single instrument. This can affect loudness variations, both at the micro-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering Audio|last=Katz|first=Robert|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=0-240-80545-3|location=Amsterdam: Boston|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; and macro scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/dynamic-range-loudness-war|title='Dynamic Range' &amp; The Loudness War|last=Deruty|first=Emmanuel|date=September 2011|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=2018-01-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many contexts, the meaning of the term ''dynamics'' is therefore not immediately clear. To distinguish between the different aspects of dynamics, the term ''performed dynamics'' can be used to refer to the aspects of music dynamics that is controlled exclusively by the performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elowsson|first=Anders|last2=Friberg|first2=Anders|date=|title=Predicting the perception of performed dynamics in music audio with ensemble learning|url=http://www.speech.kth.se/prod/publications/files/4106.pdf|journal=The Acoustical Society of America|volume=141 |issue=3|pages=2224–2242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative''' (ECAI) is a [[digital humanities]] initiative involving numerous academic professors and institutions around the world with the stated goal of creating a networked digital [[atlas]] by creating tools and setting standards for dynamic, digital maps.

ECAI was established in 1997 by Emeritus Prof. [[Lewis Lancaster]] of the University of California, Berkeley, and has held two meetings per year most years from 1998 - 2009 (ongoing), one of which is often in conjunction with the Pacific Neighbourhood Consortium. The initiative is based at UC Berkeley.

The ECAI 'clearinghouse' of distributed digital datasets was developed from 1998 by the Archaeological Computing Laboratory at the University of Sydney, and uses the ACL's [[TimeMap]] software.

An '''engineering apprenticeship''' in the [[United Kingdom]] is an [[apprenticeship]] in [[mechanical engineering]] or [[electrical engineering]] or [[aeronautical engineering]] to train craftsmen, technicians, senior technicians, [[Incorporated Engineer]]s and [[Chartered Engineer]] for vocational oriented work and professional practice. Chartered Engineers are usually formed through a university degree programme at the Masters Engineering level and may undertake a short form of post graduate apprenticeship. A typical example is the apprenticeships formerly available at the [[British Thomson-Houston]] and [[English Electric]] companies at [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] in England. Subjects covered included mathematics, engineering sciences, [[limits and fits]], [[metallurgy]], [[foundry]] technology, [[engineering drawing]], [[design]], [[materials science]] for engineering materials, [[metalworking]] by hand, operating [[machine tool]]s, and basic features of engineering design. Also refer to [[apprenticeship]] and the UK and German section. Elite technical apprenticeships (4-6 years long) have been a decades long tradition at UK companies such as [[BAE Systems]], [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]], [[Bombardier Aerospace]] ([[Short Brothers]]), and  [[Babcock International]].

'''Epidemic dropsy''' is a form of [[edema]] of extremities due to [[poisoning]] by ''' ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' ''' (Mexican prickly poppy).&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"&gt;{{ cite journal |author1=Sharma, B.

Epidemic dropsy is a clinical state resulting from use of edible oils adulterated with ''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' seed oil.

[[Sanguinarine]] and [[dihydrosanguinarine]] are two major toxic alkaloids of argemone oil, which cause widespread capillary dilatation, proliferation and increased capillary permeability. When mustard oil is adulterated deliberately (as in most cases) or accidentally with argemone oil, [[proteinuria]] (specifically loss of [[human serum albumin|albumin]]) occurs, with a resultant edema as would occur in [[nephrotic syndrome]].

Other major symptoms are [[wikt:bilateral|bilateral]] [[pitting edema]] of extremities, [[headache]], [[nausea]], loose bowels, [[erythema]], [[glaucoma]] and [[dyspnea|breathlessness]].

Leakage of the protein-rich plasma component into the extracellular compartment leads to the formation of [[edema]]. The haemodynamic consequences of this vascular dilatation and permeability lead to a state of relative [[hypovolemia]] with a constant stimulus for fluid and salt conservation by the kidneys. Illness begins with gastroenteric symptoms followed by cutaneous erythema and pigmentation. Respiratory symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath and [[orthopnoea]], progressing to frank right-sided congestive cardiac failure, are seen.

Mild to moderate anaemia, hypoproteinaemia, mild to moderate renal [[azotemia]], retinal haemorrhages, and glaucoma are common manifestations. There is no specific therapy. Removal of the adulterated oil and symptomatic treatment of congestive cardiac failure and respiratory symptoms, along with administration of antioxidants and multivitamins, remain the mainstay of treatment.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

'''Epidemic dropsy''' occurs as  an [[epidemic]] in places where use of [[mustard oil]], (from the seeds of Brassica ''juncea'' commonly known as [[Indian mustard]] ) as cooking medium is common.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

==Cause==
===''Argemone mexicana''===
[[File:Argemone_mexicana_flower_2.jpg|thumb|''[[Argemone mexicana]]'']]

''[[Argemone mexicana]]'' (family Papaveraceae), a native of West Indies and naturalized in India, is known as “Shailkanta” in Bengal and “Bharbhanda” in Uttar Pradesh. It is also popularly known as “Pivladhatura” or “Satyanashi”, meaning devastating. The plant grows wildly in mustard and other fields. Its seeds are black in colour and are similar to the dark coloured mustards seeds (''[[Brassica juncea]]'') in shape and size. Adulteration of argemone seeds in light yellow colored mustard seeds (''Brassica compestris'') can easily be detected, but these seeds are rather difficult to visualize when mixed with dark coloured mustard seeds.

Argemone seeds yield approximately 35% oil. Alkaloid content in argemone oil varies from 0.44% to 0.50%.  Argemone seeds find use as a substitute because of the easy availability, low cost and their complete miscibility of their oil with mustard oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

== Mechanism of toxicity ==

Mortality is usually due to heart failure, pneumonia, respiratory distress syndrome or renal failure and is around 5%. Long-term follow-up studies are scanty so the long-term effects of argemone oil toxicity have not been documented. It has been reported that 25% of cases will have oedema beyond 2 months and 10% beyond 5 months. Pigmentation of skin and excessive loss of hair, which lasted 4–5 months following the disease. The majority of patients completely recover in about 3 months.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

'''[[Reactive oxygen species|ROS]] and [[Oxidative stress]]''' : Studies in the blood of dropsy patients has revealed that there is extensive ROS production (singlet oxygen and hydrogen peroxide) in the argemone oil intoxication leading to depletion of total antioxidants in the body and especially lipid-soluble antioxidants such as vitamin E and A (tocopherol and retinol).&lt;ref name="pmid15715957"/&gt; There is an extensive damage to the anti-oxidant defense system (anti-oxidant enzymes and anti-oxidants) of blood. Prior, in vitro studies have shown that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in AO induced toxicity causing peroxidative damage of lipids in various hepatic sub-cellular fractions including microsomes and mitochondria of rats. The damage in hepatic microsomal membrane causes loss of activity of cytochrome P-450 and other membrane bound enzymes responsible for xenobiotic metabolism which leads to delayed bioelimination of sanguinarine and enhances its cumulative toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reddy | first1 = N.

'''Pulmonary Toxicity''': The decrease in glycogen levels following argemone oil intoxication  could be due to enhanced glycogenolysis leading to the formation of glucose-1-phosphate, which enters the glycoltic pathway resulting in accumulation of pyruvate in the blood of experimental animals and dropsy patients. The enhancement of glycogenolysis can further be supported by the interference of sanguinarine in the uptake of glucose through blocking of sodium pump via Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase and thereby inhibiting the active transport of glucose across intestinal barrier. It is well established that increased pyruvate concentration in blood uncouples oxidative phosphorylation,  and this may be responsible for thickening of interalveolar septa and disorganized alveolar spaces in lungs of argemone oil-fed rats and the breathlessness as has been observed in human victims.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;
      
'''Cardiac Failure''':The inhibition of [[NaKATPase|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase]] activity of heart by sanguinarine is due to interaction with the cardiac glycoside receptor site of the enzyme, which may be responsible for producing degenerative changes in [[cardiac muscle]] fibers in the auricular wall of rats fed argemone oil and could be related to tachycardia and cardiac failure in Epidemic Dropsy patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Seifen | first1 = E. | last2 = Adams | first2 = R.

==Diagnosis==
Nitric acid test and paper chromatography test are used in the detection of argemone oil.Paper chromatography test is the most sensitive test.

== Treatment ==
Withdrawal of the contaminated cooking oil is the most important initial step. Bed rest with leg elevation and a protein-rich diet are useful. Supplements of calcium, antioxidants (vitamin C and E), and thiamine and other B vitamins are commonly used. Corticosteroids and antihistaminics such as promethazine have been advocated by some investigators, but demonstrated efficacy is lacking. Diuretics are used universally but caution must be exercised not to deplete the intravascular volume unless features of frank congestive cardiac failure are present, as oedema is mainly due to increased capillary permeability. Cardiac failure is managed by bed rest, salt restriction, digitalis and diuretics. Pneumonia is treated with appropriate antibiotics. Renal failure may need dialysis therapy and complete clinical recovery is seen. Glaucoma may need operative intervention, but generally responds to medical management.&lt;ref name="pmid10621875"/&gt;

==Prevalence==
[[File:Brassica juncea - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-168.jpg|thumb|''[[Brassica juncea]]'']]

Besides India, widespread epidemics have been reported from Mauritius, Fiji Islands, Northwest Cape districts of South Africa, Madagascar and also from Nepal. Apart from a South African study, where the epidemic occurred through contamination in wheat flour, all the epidemics occurred through the consumption of mustard oil contaminated with argemone oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

In these populations mustard oil is the prime edible oil by culture.

The earliest reference to argemone oil poisoning was made by Lyon,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Lyon, I. B. | title = Textbook of Medical Jurisprudence for India | edition = 1st | year = 1889 | page = 214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who reported four cases of poisoning in Calcutta in 1877 from the use of this oil in food.

Since then, epidemic dropsy has been reported from Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Assam, J&amp;K, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi and Maharashtra, mainly due to consumption of food cooked in argemone oil mixed with mustard oil or occasionally by body massage with contaminated oil.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt;

The epidemic in [[1998 Delhi oil poisoning|1998 at New Delhi]], India is the largest so far, in which over 60 persons lost their lives and more than 3000 victims were hospitalized.&lt;ref name="pmid9189656"/&gt; Few studies reported the findings in patients affected with this condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kar HK, Jain RK, Sharma PK, Gautam RK, Kumar P, Bhardwaj M | year = 2001 | title = Epidemic dropsy: A study of cutaneous manifestations with histopathological correlation | url = | journal = Indian J Dermatol Venereol Leprol | volume = 67 | issue = 4| pages = 178–9 | pmid = 17664732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after that the epidemics occurred at alarming frequency in Gwalior (2000), Kannauj (2002) and Lucknow (2005) cities of India.&lt;ref name=pmid15715957&gt;{{ cite journal | last1 = Das | first1 = M. | last2 = Babu | first2 = K. | last3 = Reddy | first3 = N.

{{Semiotics}}

'''Ethnosemiotics''' is a disciplinary perspective which links [[semiotics]] concepts to [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods.

==Definition==
[[Algirdas Julien Greimas]] and Joseph Courtés defined for the first time ethnosemiotics in ''[[Semiotics]] and language: an analytical dictionary''.

"Ethno-semiotics is not truly an autonomous semiotics. If it were, it would be in competition with a field of knowledge already established under the name of ethnology or anthropology, whose contribution to the advent of semiotics itself is considerable. Rather, it is a privileged area of curiosities and of methodological exercises ... . 
Given that general semiotics authorizes the treatment of non-linguistic (gestual, somatic, etc.) syntagmatic concatenations as discourses or texts, the field of ethno-linguistics can be enlarged to become an ethno-semiotics; analyses, still rare, of rituals and ceremonies lead us to suppose that ethnology can become, once again, the privileged locus for the construction of general models of signifying behavior."&lt;ref&gt;Algirdas Julien Greimas, Joseph Courtés Semiotics and language: an analytical dictionary Indiana University Press, 1982 - 409 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2000s, in Italy, the interest toward the discipline has been renewed thanks to the studies and the researches of Maurizio del Ninno, Tarcisio Lancioni, and Francesco Marsciani. Under the direction of Francesco Marsciani, in Bologna in 2007 the Ethnosemiotic Centre of the Bologna University (CUBE) was founded, active in different fields of inquiry. In 2015, CUBE's experience led to the series Quaderni di Etnosemiotica and the Ethnosemiotics lab.

==Focus and fields of inquiry==
The ethnosemiologist analyses the systems of signifiers which are individuated in specific cultural contexts through the observation and the application of the [[Ethnography|ethnographic methods]]. At the present, the principal researchers which have been realized are focused on urban spaces, therapy, rituals, folklore, everyday practices. 
In Italy we can distinguish two approaches to ethnosemiotics:

* the Urbin school, founded by Maurizio del Ninno, which follows the theoretical framework of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] and [[Georges Dumézil]], close to French [[Social Anthropology]].
* the Bologna-Siena school, founded by Tarcisio Lancioni and Francesco Marsciani, which were concerned by the development of a set of concepts and methods to apply semiotic analysis to different aspects of everyday life.

From 2015 the Ethnosemiotics Lab leads researches both in the theoretical and the methodological field. Developed inside CUBE, active at the Bologna University, it conducts multidisciplinary researches. The synergy between ethnographic observation and the analysis of the manifested values offers active results from the point of view of the capacity to describe social phenomena.

Professional development for educators may include [[teacher training]], and is usually considered pre-service, or before beginning teaching. However faculty development ''and'' professional development may both be used to refer to on-going professional learning for educators. Such learning may take place during work hours, such as "in-service" within K-12 settings, or it may be beyond work hours. These learning pursuits may be for credit or noncredit; therefore they may be with a college or university, through a school district, or private consulting agency. Additionally educators may pursue [[self-directed learning]] professional development, although the term faculty development is less commonly applied to this scope of activity.

K-12 faculty development and professional development and higher education faculty development and professional development have very different traditions, practices and terminologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/606752555|title=Keeping pace with technology, vol. 1 : the promise and potential for k-12 educators|last=King|first=Kathleen P.|publisher=Hampton Press|year=2002|isbn=1572734329|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=|oclc=606752555}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/954710961|title=Keeping pace with technology, vol. 2 : the challenge and promise for higher education faculty|last=King|first=Kathleen P.|publisher=Hampton Press|year=2003|isbn=157273471X|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=|oclc=954710961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher education faculty development is beginning to take place not just face-to-face but also online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lowenthal|first=Patrick R.|date=September 2008|title=Online Faculty Development and Storytelling: An Unlikely Solution to Improving Teacher Quality|url=http://jolt.merlot.org/vol4no3/lowenthal_0908.pdf|journal=MERLOT Journal of Online Learning and Teaching|volume=4|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''foot''' (plural '''feet''') is an [[anatomical]] structure found in many [[vertebrates]]. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the [[leg]] made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails.

==Etymology==
The word "foot", in the sense of meaning the "terminal part of the leg of a vertebrate animal" comes from "Old English fot "foot," from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Frisian fot, Old Saxon fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fuß, Gothic fotus "foot"), from PIE root *ped- "foot." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=foot |title=Foot |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802093751/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=foot |archivedate=2 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "[p]lural form feet is an instance of i-mutation." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Baby-baby-feet-bed-325690.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The feet of a newborn [[infant]].]]
The human foot is a strong and complex mechanical structure containing 26 [[bone]]s, 33 [[Joint (anatomy)|joints]] (20 of which are actively articulated), and more than a hundred [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s, and [[ligament]]s.&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel"&gt;Podiatry Channel, ''Anatomy of the foot and ankle''&lt;/ref&gt; The joints of the foot are the [[ankle]] and [[subtalar joint]] and the [[interphalangeal articulations of the foot]]. An anthropometric study of 1197 North American adult Caucasian males (mean age 35.5 years) found that a man's foot length was 26.3&amp;nbsp;cm with a [[standard deviation]] of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hawes MR, Sovak D |title=Quantitative morphology of the human foot in a North American population |journal=Ergonomics |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1213–26 |date=July 1994 |pmid=8050406 |doi= 10.1080/00140139408964899|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot can be subdivided into the hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot:

The ''hindfoot'' is composed of the [[Talus bone|talus]] (or ankle bone) and the [[calcaneus]] (or heel bone). The two long bones of the lower leg, the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]], are connected to the top of the talus to form the [[ankle]]. Connected to the talus at the [[subtalar joint]], the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

The five irregular bones of the ''midfoot'', the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[Navicular bone|navicular]], and three [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] bones, form the [[arches of the foot]] which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to the hind- and fore-foot by muscles and the [[plantar fascia]].&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

The ''forefoot'' is composed of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming the [[metatarsus]]. Similar to the fingers of the hand, the bones of the toes are called [[Phalanx bones|phalanges]] and the [[big toe]] has two phalanges while the other four toes have three phalanges each. The joints between the phalanges are called [[interphalangeal articulations of foot|interphalangeal]] and those between the metatarsus and phalanges are called [[metatarsophalangeal joint|metatarsophalangeal]] (MTP).&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

{{anchor|dorsum}}
Both the midfoot and forefoot constitute the ''dorsum'' (the area facing upwards while standing) and the ''planum'' (the area facing downwards while standing).

{{anchor|instep}}

The ''instep'' is the arched part of the top of the foot between the toes and the ankle.

=== Bones ===
[[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of bones in lower leg and foot.]]

* [[tibia]], [[fibula]]
* [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (7): [[Talus bone|talus]], [[calcaneus]], [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiformes]] (3), [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], and [[Navicular bone|navicular]]
* [[metatarsus]] (5): [[First metatarsal bone|first]], [[Second metatarsal bone|second]], [[Third metatarsal bone|third]], [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth]], and [[fifth metatarsal bone]]
* [[Phalanges of the foot|phalanges]] (14)

There can be many [[sesamoid bone]]s near the metatarsophalangeal joints, although they are only regularly present in the distal portion of the [[first metatarsal bone]].&lt;ref name="Platzer-220"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arches ===
{{Main|Arches of the foot}}
The human foot has two [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] arches and a transverse arch maintained by the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the "keystone" ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the tarsometatarsal joints. Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or [[flat feet]].&lt;ref name="Marieb-Hoehn-244"&gt;Mareb-Hoehn 2007, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscles ===
The muscles acting on the foot can be classified into extrinsic muscles, those originating on the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating on the dorsal (top) or plantar (base) aspects of the foot.

==== Extrinsic ====
[[File:Gray437.png|thumb|80px|Anterior leg muscles.]]
All muscles originating on the lower leg except the [[popliteus muscle]] are attached to the bones of the foot. The tibia and fibula and the interosseous membrane separate these muscles into anterior and posterior groups, in their turn subdivided into subgroups and layers.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-256"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anterior group''

''Extensor group'': [[Tibialis anterior muscle|tibialis anterior]] originates on the proximal half of the tibia and the interosseous membrane and is inserted near the [[tarsometatarsal joint]] of the first digit. In the non-weight-bearing leg tibialis anterior flexes the foot dorsally and lift its medial edge ([[supination]]). In the weight-bearing leg it brings the leg towards the back of the foot, like in rapid walking. [[Extensor digitorum longus muscle|Extensor digitorum longus]] arises on the lateral tibial condyle and along the fibula to be inserted on the second to fifth digits and proximally on the fifth metatarsal. The extensor digitorum longus acts similar to the tibialis anterior except that it also dorsiflexes the digits. [[Extensor hallucis longus muscle|Extensor hallucis longus]] originates medially on the fibula and is inserted on the first digit. As the name implies it dorsiflexes the big toe and also acts on the ankle in the unstressed leg. In the weight-bearing leg it acts similar to the tibialis anterior.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-258"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peroneal group'': [[Peroneus longus muscle|peroneus longus]] arises on the proximal aspect of the fibula and [[Peroneus brevis muscle|peroneus brevis]] below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral [[malleolus]]. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first tarsometatarsal joint, while peroneus brevis reaches the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-260"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Gray438.png|100|Gray439.png|80|Deep and superficial layers of posterior leg muscles}}
''Posterior group''

The ''superficial layer'' of posterior leg muscles is formed by the [[triceps surae]] and the [[Plantaris muscle|plantaris]]. The triceps surae consists of the [[Soleus muscle|soleus]] and the two heads of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]]. The heads of gastrocnemius arise on the [[femur]], proximal to the condyles, and soleus arises on the proximal dorsal parts of the tibia and fibula. The tendons of these muscles merge to be inserted onto the calcaneus as the [[Achilles tendon]]. Plantaris originates on the femur proximal to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and its long tendon is embedded medially into the Achilles tendon. The triceps surae is the primary plantar flexor and its strength becomes most obvious during ballet dancing. It is fully activated only with the knee extended because the gastrocnemius is shortened during knee flexion. During walking it not only lifts the heel, but also flexes the knee, assisted by the plantaris.&lt;ref name="Platzer-262"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''deep layer'' of posterior muscles [[Tibialis posterior muscle|tibialis posterior]] arises proximally on the back of the interosseous membrane and adjoining bones and divides into two parts in the sole of the foot to attach to the tarsus. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it produces plantar flexion and supination, and, in the weight-bearing leg, it proximates the heel to the calf. [[Flexor hallucis longus muscle|flexor hallucis longus]] arises on the back of the fibula (i.e. on the lateral side), and its relatively thick muscle belly extends distally down to the [[flexor retinaculum of foot|flexor retinaculum]] where it passes over to the medial side to stretch across the sole to the distal phalanx of the first digit. The [[Popliteus muscle|popliteus]] is also part of this group, but, with its oblique course across the back of the knee, does not act on the foot.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-264"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intrinsic ====
On the ''back'' (top) ''of the foot'', the tendons of [[Extensor digitorum brevis muscle|extensor digitorum brevis]] and [[Extensor hallucis brevis muscle|extensor hallucis brevis]] lie deep to the system of long extrinsic extensor tendons. They both arise on the calcaneus and extend into the dorsal [[aponeurosis]] of digits one to four, just beyond the penultimate joints. They act to dorsiflex the digits.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-268"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

{{triple image|right|Gray443.png|83|Gray444.png|91|Gray445.png|100|Plantar aspects of foot, varying depths (superficial to deep)}}

Similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, there are three groups of muscles in the ''sole of foot'', those of the first and last digits, and a central group:

''Muscles of the [[Hallux|big toe]]'': [[Abductor hallucis muscle|abductor hallucis]] stretches medially along the border of the sole, from the calcaneus to the first digit. Below its tendon, the tendons of the long flexors pass through the [[Tarsal tunnel|tarsal canal]]. It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. [[Flexor hallucis brevis muscle|flexor hallucis brevis]] arises on the medial cuneiform bone and related ligaments and tendons. An important plantar flexor, it is crucial for ballet dancing. Both these muscles are inserted with two heads proximally and distally to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. [[Adductor hallucis muscle|Adductor hallucis]] is part of this group, though it originally formed a separate system (see [[contrahens]].) It has two heads, the oblique head originating obliquely across the central part of the midfoot, and the transverse head originating near the metatarsophalangeal joints of digits five to three. Both heads are inserted into the lateral sesamoid bone of the first digit. Adductor hallucis acts as a tensor of the plantar arches and also adducts the big toe and then might plantar flex the proximal phalanx.

''Muscles of the [[Fifth toe|little toe]]'': Stretching laterally from the calcaneus to the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti minimi]] form the lateral margin of the foot and is the largest of the muscles of the fifth digit. Arising from the base of the fifth metatarsal, [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti minimi]] is inserted together with abductor on the first phalanx. Often absent, [[Opponens digiti minimi muscle|opponens digiti minimi]] originates near the cuboid bone and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal bone. These three muscles act to support the arch of the foot and to plantar flex the fifth digit.

''Central muscle group'': The four [[Lumbrical muscle (foot)|lumbricals]] arise on the medial side of the tendons of flexor digitorum longus and are inserted on the medial margins of the proximal phalanges. [[Quadratus plantae muscle|Quadratus plantae]] originates with two slips from the lateral and medial margins of the calcaneus and inserts into the lateral margin of the flexor digitorum tendon. It is also known as flexor accessorius. [[Flexor digitorum brevis muscle|Flexor digitorum brevis]] arise inferiorly on the calcaneus and its three tendons are inserted into the middle phalanges of digits two to four (sometimes also the fifth digit). These tendons divide before their insertions and the tendons of flexor digitorum longus pass through these divisions. Flexor digitorum brevis flexes the middle phalanges. It is occasionally absent. Between the toes, the [[Dorsal interossei muscles (foot)|dorsal]] and [[Plantar interossei muscles|plantar interossei]] stretch from the metatarsals to the proximal phalanges of digits two to five. The plantar interossei adducts and the dorsal interossei abducts these digits and are also plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints.

==Clinical significance==
{{Main|Diseases of the foot}}
Due to their position and function, feet are exposed to a [[List of disorders of foot and ankle|variety]] of potential [[infection]]s and [[injuries]], including [[athlete's foot]], [[bunion]]s, [[Ingrown nail|ingrown toenails]], [[Morton's neuroma]], [[plantar fasciitis]], [[plantar wart]]s and [[stress fracture]]s. In addition, there are several [[genetic disorder]]s that can affect the shape and function of the feet, including a [[club foot]] or [[flat feet]].

This leaves humans more vulnerable to medical problems that are caused by poor leg and foot alignments. Also, the wearing of shoes, sneakers and boots can impede proper alignment and movement within the ankle and foot. For example, [[High-heeled footwear]] are known to throw off the [[neutral spine|natural weight balance]] (this can also affect the lower back). For the sake of posture, flat soles with no heels are advised.

A [[physician|doctor]] who specializes in the treatment of the feet practices [[podiatry]] and is called a podiatrist. A [[pedorthist]] specializes in the use and modification of footwear to treat problems related to the lower limbs.

*[[Jones fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– a fracture of the [[fifth metatarsal]]
*[[March fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– a fracture of the distal third of one of the metatarsals occurring because of recurrent stress
*[[Calcaneal fracture]]

Foot [[sweat]] is the major cause of [[foot odor]]. Sweat itself is odorless, but it creates a beneficial environment for certain bacteria to grow and produce bad-smelling substances.

==Pronation==
{{main|Pronation of the foot}}
In anatomy, [[pronation]] is a rotational movement of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the [[gait]]. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate in many different ways based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of pronation include neutral pronation,  underpronation (supination), and overpronation.

;Neutral pronation
An individual who neutrally pronates initially strikes the ground on the [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] side of the [[heel]]. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the [[metatarsus]], the foot will roll in a [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|medial]] direction, such that the weight is distributed evenly across the metatarsus. In this stage of the gait, the [[knee]] will generally, but not always, track directly over the [[hallux]].

This rolling inwards motion as the foot progresses from heel to toe is the way that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a [[heel strike (gait)|heel strike]] gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot.

;Overpronation
As with a neutral pronator, an individual who overpronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, however, the foot will roll too far in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[hallux]]. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track inwards.

An overpronator does not absorb shock efficiently. Imagine someone jumping onto a diving board, but the board is so flimsy that when it is struck, it bends and allows the person to plunge straight down into the water instead of back into the air. Similarly, an overpronator's arches will collapse, or the ankles will roll inwards (or a combination of the two) as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[external rotation]] at the [[hip]], knee, or [[ankle]] will be more likely to overpronate than one whose bone structure has [[internal rotation]] or central alignment. An individual who overpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the medial (inside) side of the shoe towards the toe area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Overpronation, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130924213417/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | archivedate = 24 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When choosing a running or walking shoe, a person with overpronation can choose shoes that have good inside support—usually by strong material at the inside sole and arch of the shoe.  It is usually visible.  The inside support area is marked by strong greyish material to support the weight when a person lands on the outside foot and then roll onto the inside foot.

;Underpronation (supination)

[[File:Underpronation.jpg|thumb|Underpronation of foot]]
An individual who underpronates also initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will not roll far enough in a medial direction. The weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[fifth metatarsal]], towards the lateral side of the foot. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track laterally of the [[hallux]].

Like an overpronator, an underpronator does not absorb shock efficiently&amp;nbsp;– but for the opposite reason. The underpronated foot is like a diving board that, instead of failing to spring someone in the air because it is too flimsy, fails to do so because it is too rigid. There is virtually no give. An underpronator's arches or ankles don't experience much motion as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[internal rotation]] at the hip, knee, or ankle will be more likely to underpronate than one whose bone structure has external rotation or central alignment. Usually&amp;nbsp;– but not always&amp;nbsp;– those who are [[bow-legged]] tend to underpronate.{{Citation needed|reason=some sources say instead that those who are bow-legged tend to overpronate|date=November 2013}} An individual who underpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the lateral (outside) side of the shoe towards the rear of the shoe in the heel area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Supination, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917160412/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | archivedate = 17 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Humans usually wear [[shoe]]s or similar footwear for protection from hazards when walking outside. There are a number of contexts where it is considered inappropriate to wear shoes. Some people consider it rude to wear shoes into a house and a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Marae]] should only be entered with bare feet.

[[Foot fetishism]] is the most common form of sexual fetish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/rex-ryans-foot-video-not-necessarily-unhealthy/story?id=12467617 |title=Rex Ryan's Apparent Foot Fetish Not Necessarily Unhealthy |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chaimedia.com/list/197.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101215643/http://www.chaimedia.com/list/197.html |archivedate=2012-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{Main|Comparative foot morphology}}

A [[paw]] is the soft foot of a mammal, generally a quadruped, that has claws or nails (e.g., a cat or dog's paw). A hard foot is called a [[hoof]]. Depending on style of locomotion, animals can be classified as [[plantigrade]] (sole walking), [[digitigrade]] (toe walking), or [[unguligrade]] (nail walking).

The metatarsals are the bones that make up the main part of the foot in humans, and part of the leg in large animals or paw in smaller animals. The number of metatarsals are directly related to the mode of locomotion with many larger animals having their digits reduced to two ([[elk]], [[cow]], [[sheep]]) or one ([[horse]]). The metatarsal bones of feet and paws are tightly grouped compared to, most notably, the human hand where the thumb metacarpal diverges from the rest of the metacarpus.&lt;ref name="France-537"&gt;France 2008, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical and cultural usage==
[[File:Study of a pair of feet crossed at the ankles RMG PY5986.tiff|thumb|Study of a pair of feet crossed, 1847, by Margaret Louisa Herschel, daughter of [[John Herschel]], from the [[Royal Museums Greenwich]]]]
The word "foot" is used to refer to a "...linear measure was in Old English (the exact length has varied over time), this being considered the length of a man's foot; a unit of measure used widely and anciently. In this sense the plural is often foot. The current inch and foot are implied from measurements in 12c." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The word "foot" also has a musical meaning; a "...metrical foot (late Old English, translating Latin pes, Greek pous in the same sense) is commonly taken to represent one rise and one fall of a foot: keeping time according to some, dancing according to others."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The word "foot" was used in Middle English to mean "a person" (c. 1200).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The expression "...to put one's best foot foremost first recorded 1849 (Shakespeare has the better foot before, 1596)".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The expression to "...put one's foot in (one's) mouth "say something stupid" was first used in 1942.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The expression "put (one's) foot in something" meaning to "make a mess of it" was used in 1823.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The word "footloose" was first used in the 1690s, meaning "free to move the feet, unshackled"; the more "figurative sense of "free to act as one pleases" was first used in 1873.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Like "footloose", "flat-footed" at first had its obvious literal meaning (in 1600, it meant "with flat feet") but by 1912 it meant "unprepared" (U.S. baseball slang).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Fructification''' ({{Lang-la|fructificatio}}) are the generative parts of the [[plant]] ([[flower]] and [[fruit]]) (as opposed to its vegetative parts: [[trunk (botany)|trunk]], [[root]]s and [[Leaf|leaves]]). Sometimes it is applied more broadly to the generative parts of [[gymnosperm]]s, [[fern]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and [[Lycopodiophyta|lycophytes]], though they produce neither fruit nor flower.

Since the works of [[Andrea Caesalpino]] (1519–1603) the characters of fructification have been extensively used as a basis for the [[scientific classification]] of plants. [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) raised the description of the parts of fructification to an unprecedented level of precision. He insisted that [[genus|genera]] and the higher groups of plants must be characterised in terms of the fructification alone without using vegetative parts (which can be used only to characterise the [[species]] within genera). At that time it was believed that all plants have flowers and fruits. It was not until the nineteenth century that the important difference between [[seed]]s and [[spore]]s was recognised and the use of terms flower and fruit was restricted to the flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s).

Later plant [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] used a more balanced approach and re-introduced the use of the vegetative parts of the plant as a basis for characters at different levels of taxonomic [[hierarchy]].

'''Globe at Night''' is an international scientific research program that [[crowdsource]]s measurements of [[light pollution]] in the night sky. At set time periods within each year, the project asks people to count the number of stars that they can see from their location and report it to the project's website. The coordinating researchers compile this information to produce a public, freely available map of global light pollution. By September 2011, almost 70,000 measurements had been made.&lt;ref name=ng/&gt; The use of data collected by the public makes the program an example of [[citizen science]].&lt;ref name=SciRep&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kyba|first=Christopher C.

[[Light pollution]], the introduction of artificial light into formerly dark ecosystems, has numerous [[ecological light pollution|adverse ecological effects]]. Exposure to artificial light can prove fatal for some organisms (e.g. moths that fly into a burning flame), can interrupt a life cycle phase for others (e.g. [[glowworm]]s are unable to attract mates), and can reduce the possibilities for finding food (because of increased risk of predation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Catherine Rich and Travis Longcore|title=Ecological consequences of artificial night lighting|publisher=Island Press|date=2006|isbn=1-55963-128-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Light at night can also interfere with the [[chronobiology]] of many animals, including humans, through suppression of [[melatonin]] secretion.&lt;ref name=navara&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navara|first=KJ|author2=Nelson|title=The dark side of light at night: physiological, epidemiological, and ecological consequences|journal=J Pineal Res|date=2007|volume=43|pages=215–224|doi=10.1111/j.1600-079X.2007.00473.x|pmid=17803517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this technique, observers are reporting a naked eye [[limiting magnitude]] (NELM) between 1 and 7.

== Accuracy of measurements ==

[[File:Relationship between naked eye limiting magnitude and predicted sky luminance.png|thumb|When Globe at Night observations are averaged together, they are very strongly related to the sky brightness in the location. This is a single panel from [http://www.nature.com/srep/2013/130516/srep01835/fig_tab/srep01835_F2.html this image].]]

The standard deviation of an individual Globe at Night observation is approximately 1.2 stellar magnitudes.&lt;ref name="SciRep"/&gt; Due to the [[law of large numbers]], when the observations are considered in aggregate, the errors from individual observations cancel each other out, leading to very stable mean values. This means that Globe at Night observations could be used to estimate global or regional trends in sky luminance.&lt;ref name="SciRep"/&gt;

== Conversion of measurements into other units ==
Globe at Night observations identify the dimmest stars that are visible given the surrounding conditions.

In 2014, the project expanded to also include data obtained via the [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cosalux.welovestars Loss of the Night app] for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices, and the [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dsm-lite/id626796278?mt=8 Dark Sky Meter app] for [[iOS]] devices. In addition, new star charts were added to extend the standard map based campaign throughout the whole year. In 2015, as part of the [[International Year of Light]], two "International Nights of Skyglow Observation" were introduced, to encourage data submission in March and September.&lt;ref name=IYL_blog&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kyba|first1=Christopher|title=Help measure how the night sky is changing|url=http://light2015blog.org/2015/02/09/help-measure-how-the-night-sky-is-changing/|publisher=International Year of Light Blog|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''HH-suite''' is an open-source software package for sensitive [[protein]] sequence searching. It contains programs that can search for similar protein sequences in protein sequence databases. Sequence searches are a standard tool in modern biology with which the function of unknown proteins can be inferred from the functions of proteins with similar sequences. 

==Sequence searches in biology==

Proteins are central players in all of life's processes. To understand how life in cells is organised, we have to understand what each of the proteins involved in these molecular processes does. This is particularly important in order to understand the origin of diseases. But for a large fraction of the approximately 20 000 human proteins the structures and functions remain unknown. Many proteins have been investigated in model organisms such as many bacteria, baker's yeast, fruit flies, zebra fish or mice, for which experiments can be often done more easily than with human cells. To predict the function, structure, or other properties of a protein for which only its sequence of amino acids is known, the protein sequence is compared to the sequences of other proteins in public databases. If a protein with sufficiently similar sequence is found, the two proteins are likely to be evolutionarily related ([[Homology (biology)#Sequence homology|"homologous"]]). In that case, they are likely to share similar structures and functions. Therefore, if a protein with a sufficiently similar sequence and with known functions and/or structure can be found by the sequence search, the unknown protein's functions, structure, and domain composition can be predicted.  Such predictions greatly facilitate the determination of the function or structure by targeted validation experiments.

==Description==

The HH-suite  [[HHpred / HHsearch|HHsearch]]  contains HHsearch
&lt;ref name="pmid15531603"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Söding J | title = Protein homology detection by HMM-HMM comparison | journal = Bioinformatics | year =  2005 | volume = 21 | issue = 7 | pages = 951–960 | pmid = 15531603 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/bti125}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and HHblits 
&lt;ref name="pmid22198341"&gt;{{ cite journal |vauthors=Remmert M, Biegert A, Hauser A, Söding J | title = HHblits: Lightning-fast iterative protein sequence searching by HMM-HMM alignment. | journal = Nat. Methods | year =  2011 | volume = 9 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–175 | pmid = 22198341 | doi = 10.1038/NMETH.1818}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
among other programs and utilities. HHsearch is among the most popular methods for the detection of remotely related sequences and for protein structure prediction, having been cited over 2000 times in Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=hhsearch+soeding Number of citations to HHsearch on Google Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt; The HHsearch and HHblits programs owe their power to the fact that both the query and the database sequences are represented by [[multiple sequence alignment]]s (MSAs). In these MSAs, the query or database sequence is written in a table together with homologous (related) sequences in such a way that each column contains homologous amino acid residues, that is, residues that have descended from the same residue in the ancestral sequence. The frequencies of amino acids in the columns of such an MSA can be interpreted as probabilities to observe an amino acid in a further homologous sequence at that position. To facilitate automatic scoring of potential sequences for their relatedness to the sequences in the MSA, the MSAs are succinctly described by profile [[hidden Markov model]]s (HMMs). These are extensions of [[position-specific scoring matrix|''position-specific scoring matrices'']] (PSSMs). The core algorithms for '''H'''MM-'''H'''MM alignment give HH-suite its name.

[[HHpred / HHsearch|HHsearch]] takes as input a [[multiple sequence alignment]] or a profile [[hidden Markov Model]] (HMM) and searches a database of profile HMMs for homologous (related) proteins. 
[[HHpred / HHsearch|HHsearch]] is often used for [[homology modeling]], that is, to build a model of the structure of a query protein for which only the sequence is known: For that purpose, a database of proteins with known structures such as the [[Protein Data Bank|protein data bank]] is searched for "template" proteins similar to the query protein. If such a template protein is found, the structure of the protein of interest can be predicted based on a pairwise [[multiple sequence alignment|sequence alignment]] of the query with the template protein sequence. In the [[CASP| CASP9]] protein structure prediction competition in 2010, a fully automated version of HHpred based on HHsearch and HHblits was ranked best out of 81 servers in template-based structure prediction [http://predictioncenter.org/casp9/groups_analysis.cgi?type=server&amp;tbm=on&amp;tbmfm=on&amp;submit=Filter CASP9 TBM/FM].

[[File:HHblits-Schematic.png|thumb|Iterative sequence search scheme of HHblits]]
HHblits was added to the HH-suite in 2011. It can build high-quality [[multiple sequence alignment]]s (MSAs) starting from a single query sequence or MSA. From the query, a profile HMM can be calculated. By using MSAs instead of single sequences, the sensitivity of sequence searches and the quality of the resulting sequence alignments can be improved dramatically. MSAs are also the starting point for a multitude of downstream computational methods, such as methods to predict the secondary and tertiary structure of proteins, to predict their molecular functions or cellular pathways, to predict the positions in their sequence or structure that contribute to enzymatic activity or ligand-binding, to predict evolutionarily conserved residues, disease-causing versus neutral mutations, the proteins' cellular localization and many more. This explains the importance to produce MSAs of the highest quality.

HHblits works similarly to [[PSI-BLAST]], the most popular iterative sequence search method. HHblits generates a profile HMM from the query sequence and iteratively searches through a large database of profile HMMs, such as HH-suite's uniprot20 database. The uniprot20 database contains all public, high-quality protein sequences that are collected in the [[UniProt]] database. These sequences are clustered and aligned into multiple sequence alignments, from which the profile HMMs in uniprot20 are generated. Significantly similar sequences from the previous search are added to the query profile HMM for the next search iteration. Compared to [[PSI-BLAST]] and [[HMMER]], HHblits is faster, up to twice as sensitive and produces more accurate alignments.&lt;ref name="pmid22198341"/&gt; HHblits uses the same HMM-HMM alignment algorithms as HHsearch, but it employs a fast prefilter that reduces the number of database HMMs for which to perform the slow HMM-HMM comparison from tens of millions to a few thousands.

The HH-suite comes with a number of useful databases of profile HMMs that can be searched using HHblits and HHsearch, among them a clustered version of the [[UniProt| UniProt database]], HMMs for the [[Protein Data Bank|protein data bank]] of protein structures, for the [[Pfam| Pfam database]] of protein family alignments, the [[Structural Classification of Proteins database|SCOP database]] of structural protein domains, and many more.

The HH-suite runs on most Linux and Unix distributions, including RedHat, Debian, Ubuntu, and Mac OS X. A [[Debian]] package is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/hhsuite Debian hhsuite package]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview of programs in HH-suite ==

In addition to HHsearch and HHblits, the HH-suite contains programs and perl scripts for format conversion, filtering of MSAs, generation of profile HMMs, the addition of secondary structure predictions to MSAs, the extraction of alignments from program output, and the generation of customized databases.

[[File:original face enso.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ensō]], the Zen Circle.]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Hitsuzendō'''''|筆禅道|"way of Zen through brush"}} is believed by [[Zen Buddhism|Zen Buddhists]] to be a method of achieving [[samādhi]] (Japanese: 三昧 ''sanmai''), which is a unification with the highest reality. Hitsuzendo refers specifically to a school of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] calligraphy to which the rating system of modern [[calligraphy]] (well-proportioned and pleasing to the eye) is foreign. Instead, the calligraphy of Hitsuzendo must breathe with the vitality of eternal experience.{{Clarify|date=March 2011}}

==Origins==
[[Yokoyama Tenkei]] (1885–1966), inspired by the teachings of [[Yamaoka Tesshu]] (1836–1888), founded the Hitsuzendo line of thought as a "practice to uncover one's [[Buddha nature|original self]] through the brush." This was then further developed by [[Omori Sogen]] Roshi as a way of Zen practice. Hitsuzendo is practised standing, using a large brush and ink, usually on newspaper roll. In this way, the whole body is used to guide the brush, in contrast to writing at a table.

==History==
{{Main|Japanese calligraphy}}
Calligraphy was brought to Japan from China and Chinese masters such as [[Wang Xizhi]] 王羲之 (Jp: Ou Gishi; 303-361) have had a profound influence, especially on the ''karayō'' style which is still practiced today. The indigenous Japanese ''wayō tradition'' (和様書道, wayō-shodō) only appeared towards the end of the [[Heian era]]. However, the calligraphy of Zen scholars was often more concerned with spiritual qualities and individual expression and shunned technicalities which led to unique and distinctly personal styles.&lt;ref name="Nakata_73"&gt;Nakata, Yujiro. ''The Art of Japanese Calligraphy'', Weatherhill/Heibonsha, New York/Tojyo, 1973. {{ISBN|0-8348-1013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese calligraphy has three basic styles: Kaisho 楷書, Gyōsho 行書, and Sōsho 草書.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qg7RAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=An Introduction to Japanese Kanji Calligraphy|last=Kunii|first=Takezaki|last2=Godin|first2=Bob|date=2013-01-29|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=9781462905928|location=|pages=8|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==
True creativity is not the product of consciousness but rather the "phenomenon of life itself."{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} True creation must arise from mu-shin 無心, the state of "no-mind," in which thought, emotions, and expectations do not matter.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Truly skilful Zen calligraphy is not the product of intense "practice;" rather, it is best achieved as the product of the "no-mind" state, a high level of [[spirituality]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, and a heart free of disturbances.

To write Zen calligraphic characters that convey truly deep meaning, one must focus intensely and become one with the meaning of the characters they create.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In order to do this, one must free one's mind and heart of disturbances and focus only on the meaning of the character. Becoming one with what you create, essentially, is the philosophy behind Zen Calligraphy and other Japanese arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7840">The '''Indonesia Project''' is a center of research and graduate training on the [[Indonesian economy]] at the [[Australian National University]] (ANU). It is located in the Arndt-Corden Department of Economics, [[Crawford School of Public Policy]], part of the [[ANU]] College of Asia and the Pacific in Canberra. It was established in 1965 with an initial grant from the [[Ford Foundation]].

== History ==
In 1963, when he became head of the Department of Economics in the Research School of Pacific Studies, Professor [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz W. Arndt]] decided to devote substantial resources from the new department to the study of the Indonesian economy.  He worked to recruit research fellows and doctoral students, established a relationship with numerous Indonesian institutions and international academics, and initiated a publication program. These initiatives quickly matured into the ''Indonesia Project''. As part of the activities of the project, the academic journal '''''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies''''' ('''''BIES''''') was established in 1965. Several academic staff were recruited to work on the Indonesian economy including Dr David Penny and Professor {{ill|Panglaykim|id|J. Panglaykim}}.  Among the young scholars awarded scholarships to work on various aspects of Indonesian economy shortly after the establishment of the project were Anne Booth, Howard Dick, Stephen Grenville, Hal Hill, Chris Manning, Peter McCawley and Phyllis Rosendale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCawley|first=Peter|author2=colleagues|title=Heinz Arndt: An Appreciation|journal=Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies|date=August 2002|volume=38|issue=2|pages=163–178|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/000749102320145039|accessdate=11 May 2011|doi=10.1080/000749102320145039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Indonesia Project has sponsored many activities related to studies of the Indonesian economy since the mid-1960s. These include the following:

* Support for the [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cbie20/current ''Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies (BIES)''], published three times each year. Professor Arndt was the editor of the BIES from 1965 to 1980. His successors as editor were Professors Anne Booth and Hal Hill and Associate Professors Ross McLeod and Pierre van der Eng. The current editors are Associate Professors Blane Lewis and Arianto Patunru.
* The [http://crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/update/ Indonesia Update] conference, held annually at the ANU since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;For a report on the 2001 conference, see Carla Bianpoen, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2001/10/10/do-women-provide-a-different-leadership.html Do women provide a different leadership?'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 10 October 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [http://crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/seminars/ Indonesia Study Group] at the ANU which meets around 40 times each year to discuss a wide range of topics relating to Indonesian studies.
* The [http://www.crawford.anu.edu.au/acde/ip/lpem/ Forum Kajian Pembangunan] (Development Studies Forum) which is a series of regular Jakarta seminars held with partner agencies to discuss development issues.
* Support for active links with scholarly institutions in Indonesia such as the [[Centre for Strategic and International Studies (Indonesia)|''Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS)'']], the [http://www.fe.ui.ac.id/index.php/lembaga-feui/lpem Lembaga Penyelidikan Ekonomi dan Masyarakat] (Institute for Social and Economic Research) at the Economics Faculty, University of Indonesia, the [http://www.smeru.or.id/ SMERU] research institute, and the Economics Faculty, [[Gadjah Mada University]], in Yogyakarta.
* The annual [[Mohamad Sadli|Sadli]] Memorial Lecture in Jakarta.
* The [http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/blogs/indonesiaproject/about/Indonesia Indonesia Project] blog.
*A wide range of other meetings and conferences, both at the ANU, at other universities in Australia and Indonesia, and with public and private organisations in Australia in Indonesia.
*An active program of public outreach; staff and students in the project often contribute to media comment in Australia and overseas, and often provide blog commentary on current developments in Indonesia.

During the early years after the Indonesia Project was established, the main activities focused on economic issues in Indonesia. Later, and especially after Professor J.A.C. Mackie&lt;ref&gt;Thee Kian Wie, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/05/06/prof-jamie-mackie-a-forceful-advocate-close-indonesia-australia-relations.html Prof. Jamie Mackie, a forceful advocate for close Indonesia-Australia relations'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 6 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; became head of the Department of Political and Social Change at the ANU in 1980, the activities of the Indonesia project widened to include issues in other areas such as politics, government, social studies, and a range of other topics.  Senior staff of the Department of Political and Social Change such as Professor Ed Aspinall and Associate Professor Greg Fealy, and of the School of Culture, History and Language at the ANU such as Dr Marcus Mietzner and Professor Kathryn Robinson, are now involved with Indonesia Project events.

The Indonesia Project has an active policy of working in close partnership with Indonesian colleagues.  Well-known Indonesian scholars and public policy makers who have worked with the project since the mid-1960s include Professor [[Armida Alisjahbana]], Professor [[Boediono]], Dr [[Hadi Soesastro]], Dr [[Muhamad Chatib Basri]], Professor [[Mari Pangestu]], Professor Panglaykim, Professor Mubyarto, Professor [[Mohamad Sadli]], Dr [[Sri Mulyani Indrawati]], and Dr [[Thee Kian Wie]].

== Management of the Project ==
Professor Arndt led the Indonesia Project from its inception until 1980.&lt;ref&gt;For a review of some of the work of the Indonesia Project during the period of Arndt's leadership, see Thee Kian Wie, '[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2002/05/18/in-memoriam-prof-arndt-a-great-friend-indonesia.html In Memoriam: Prof. Arndt, a great friend to Indonesia'], ''The Jakarta Post'', 18 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter McCawley took over management from 1980 to 1986, followed by Professor Hal Hill from 1986 to 1998. Associate Professor Chris Manning led the Project from 1998 to 2011. Associate Professor Budy Resosudarmo is the current Head of the Indonesia Project. Dr Robert Sparrow is the Project's Research Coordinator and Dr Arianto Patunru is the Project's Policy Engagement Coordinator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indonesia Project Annual Reports (1980), (1985), (1998), (2012) |publisher=Indonesia Project|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Project has received strong external funding support from both the [http://www.dfat.gov.au/ Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT)] and [[AusAID]] for many years. Staff of the Indonesia Project cooperate closely with [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|DFAT]] staff in both Canberra and in [http://www.indonesia.embassy.gov.au/jakt/cooperation.html Jakarta].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11686">'''Kenneth P. Green''' is an environmental scientist and director at the [[Fraser Institute]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Education and career ==
Green holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from [[University of California]], Los Angeles; a Master of Science in Genetics from [[San Diego State University]]; and a Doctorate of Environmental Science and Engineering (D.Env.) from University of California, Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green’s research has focused on energy and environmental policy at think tanks in North America. After completing his doctoral degree in 1994, he studied environmental policy at the Libertarian [[Reason Foundation]] in California. He then spent three years studying Canadian and American environmental policy at the fiscally-conservative [[Fraser Institute]] in Vancouver, British Columbia. On returning to the United States, Green was executive director of the [[Environmental Literacy Council]] for one year before joining the American Enterprise Institute in 2006. He returned to Canada in 2013, becoming Senior Director, Energy and Natural Resources of the Fraser Institute. There, his research concerned energy and natural resource policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fraserinstitute.org/author.aspx?id=14827&amp;txID=2729]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green has also served on advisory and review boards.  From 1996 to 1999, he was a member of the California [[REACH Commission]], and from 1996 to 2001, he was a member of the [[California Departmental Transportation Advisory Committee]]. He has twice served as expert reviewer for publications of the [[United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group]], including a 1999 special report on aviation and the global atmosphere, and a 2001 volume on the science of climate change.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Green’s work has appeared in [[National Review]], Financial Times, [[Wall Street Journal]], Financial Post, [[Washington Post]], [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], and the [[Los Angeles Times]]. He has written policy analyses, articles in popular magazine, opinion columns, book chapters, and a textbook for middle-school students entitled ''Global Warming: Understanding the Debate''. In 2011, he published a supplementary textbook for college students studying energy and energy policy, ''Abundant Energy: Fuel of Human Flourishing''. Green has been a guest on talk radio and television news programs, and has given presentations on public policy to student groups, business groups, and legislative staff. He has testified before local, regional, and national regulatory and legislative bodies, including appearances before committees of both houses of the United States Congress, the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and U.S. House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In 2011, in written testimony to the [[United States Senate|United States Senate's]] Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee he said "In conclusion, the idea that government can create jobs in the economy is a myth." During Committee questioning he conceded "It would be absurd to say the government cannot create jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franken|first1=Al|title=Giant of the Senate|date=May 30, 2017|publisher=Twelve|location=2896}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, he co-authored an article with [[Steven F. Hayward]] entitled, 'Market-Friendly Energy', in ''[[The 4% Solution: Unleashing the Economic Growth America Needs]]'', published by the [[George W. Bush Presidential Center]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Views ==
Green describes himself as “a [[free-market environmentalist]],” and believes that most environmental problems stem from an absence of properly defined and enforced property rights, and/or insufficient societal wealth to afford environmental protection. He has testified that although he believes the environment worth protecting such environmental protection must not harm other American values considered cardinal such as property rights, due process, economic freedom, individual liberty, and personal responsibility.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

On climate change, Green has repeatedly stated that he believes the climate is warming, and greenhouse gases are partially responsible. He is, however skeptical of computer models that contain unsubstantiated assumptions about positive feedback loops, and he has expressed contempt for computerized projections of future or regional climate change, comparing them to “computerized horoscopes.” Green has testified that as no technology currently exists to significantly and affordably reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the near term, he favors an agenda of adaptation and resilience-building. To hedge against the risk of more extreme climate change, Green favors increased research into [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Concerning energy policy, Green considers himself an “energy realist,” and does not believe there are currently technologies that can substantially or affordably substitute for conventional energy sources such as coal, nuclear power, oil, and natural gas. To the extent that such alternatives do exist, Green has shown they pose environmental and economic challenges, and he believes they should not be hastily adopted without considering potential unintended adverse consequences.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3786">[[Image:Oniscus asellus - male front 2 (aka).jpg|200 px|right|thumb|[[Woodlice|Woodlouse]] activity decreases as humidity increases.]]
'''Kinesis''', like a [[taxis]] or [[tropism]], is a movement or activity of a cell or an organism in response to a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (such as [[gas exposure]], [[irradiance|light intensity]] or ambient [[temperature]]).

Unlike taxis, the response to the stimulus provided is non-directional. The animal does not move toward or away from the stimulus but moves at either a slow or fast rate depending on its "[[comfort zone]]." In this case a fast movement (non-random) means that the animal is searching for its comfort zone but a slow movement indicates that it has found it.

==Types==
There are two main types of kineses, both resulting in aggregations. However, the stimulus does not act to attract or repel individuals.

'''Orthokinesis''': in which the speed of movement of the individual is dependent upon the stimulus intensity. For example, the [[animal locomotion|locomotion]] of a woodlice in relation to humidity. With increased humidity there is an increase in the percentage time that the woodlice will remain stationary.

'''Klinokinesis''': in which the frequency or rate of turning is proportional to stimulus intensity. For example the behaviour of the [[flatworm]] (Dendrocoelum lacteum) which turns more frequently in response to increasing light thus ensuring that it spends more time in dark areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biological-concepts.com/views/search.php?term=1325|title=Result of Your Query|website=www.biological-concepts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic model of kinesis==

The kinesis strategy controlled by the locally and instantly evaluated well-being ([[Fitness landscape|fitness]]) can be described in simple words: Animals stay longer in good conditions and leave quicker bad conditions. If the well-being is measured by the local reproduction coefficient then the minimal [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction-diffusion]] model of kinesis can be written as follows:
&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Gorban,N. Çabukoǧlu, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322652430_Basic_Model_of_Purposeful_Kinesis Basic model of purposeful kinesis], [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecocom.2018.01.002 Ecological Complexity], Volume 33, January 2018, Pages 75-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each population in the biological community,

&lt;math&gt; \partial_t u_ i ( x,t)
   =  D_{0i} \nabla \left(e ^{-\alpha_i r_i(u_1,\ldots,u_k,s)} \nabla u_i \right)+r_i (u_1,\ldots,u_k,s) u_i,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
&lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is the population density of  ''i''th species,

&lt;math&gt;r_i&lt;/math&gt; is the reproduction coefficient, which depends on all &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; and on  ''s'',
&lt;math&gt;D_{0i}&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium [[diffusion]] coefficient (defined for equilibrium &lt;math&gt;r_i=0&lt;/math&gt;). The coefficient &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;  characterises dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the reproduction coefficient.

The models of kinesis were tested with typical situations. It was demonstrated that kinesis is beneficial for assimilation of both patches and fluctuations of food distribution. Kinesis may delay [[Invasive species|invasion]] and spreading of species with the [[Allee effect]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6047">In [[statistics]], '''latent variables''' (from [[Latin]]: [[present participle]] of ''lateo'' (“lie hidden”), as opposed to [[observable variable]]s), are [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] that are not directly observed but are rather [[Statistical inference|inferred]] (through a [[mathematical model]]) from other variables that are observed (directly measured). Mathematical models that aim to explain observed variables in terms of latent variables are called [[latent variable model]]s. Latent variable models are used in many disciplines, including [[psychology]], [[demography]], [[economics]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[machine learning]]/[[artificial intelligence]], [[bioinformatics]], [[natural language processing]], [[econometrics]], [[management]] and the [[social sciences]].

Sometimes latent variables correspond to aspects of physical reality, which could in principle be measured, but may not be for practical reasons. In this situation, the term '''hidden variables''' is commonly used (reflecting the fact that the variables are "really there", but hidden). Other times, latent variables correspond to abstract concepts, like categories, behavioral or mental states, or data structures. The terms '''hypothetical variables''' or '''hypothetical constructs''' may be used in these situations.

One advantage of using latent variables is that they can serve to [[Dimensionality reduction|reduce the dimensionality]] of data. A large number of observable variables can be aggregated in a model to represent an underlying concept, making it easier to understand the data. In this sense, they serve a function similar to that of scientific theories. At the same time, latent variables link observable ("[[sub-symbolic]]") data in the real world to symbolic data in the modeled world.

==Examples of latent variables==

===Psychology=== 

Latent variables, as created by factor analytic methods, generally represent "shared" variance, or the degree to which variables "move" together.   Variables that have no correlation cannot result in a latent construct based on the common [[Factor analysis|factor model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tabachnick |first1=B.G. |last2=Fidell |first2=L.S. |title=Using Multivariate Analysis |publisher=Allyn and Bacon |location=Boston |year=2001 |isbn=0-321-05677-9 }}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===

Examples of latent variables from the field of [[economics]] include [[quality of life]], business confidence, morale, happiness and conservatism: these are all variables which cannot be measured directly. But linking these latent variables to other, observable variables, the values of the latent variables can be inferred from measurements of the observable variables. Quality of life is a latent variable which cannot be measured directly so observable variables are used to infer quality of life. Observable variables to measure quality of life include wealth, employment, environment, physical and mental health, education, recreation and leisure time, and social belonging.

==Common methods for inferring latent variables==

* [[Hidden Markov model]]s
* [[Factor analysis]]
* [[Principal component analysis]]
* [[Partial least squares regression]]
* [[Latent semantic analysis]] and [[Probabilistic latent semantic analysis]]
* [[EM algorithm]]s

===Bayesian algorithms and methods===

[[Bayesian statistics]] is often used for inferring latent variables.

* [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation]]
* The [[Chinese Restaurant Process]] is often used to provide a prior distribution over assignments of objects to latent categories.
* The [[Indian buffet process]] is often used to provide a prior distribution over assignments of latent binary features to objects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13277">[[File:Moon-Mdf-2005.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The waxing gibbous [[Moon]] as viewed from [[Earth]]]]

The [[Moon]] is the largest [[natural satellite]] of and the closest major [[astronomical object]] to [[Earth]]. The Moon may be [[observation|observed]] by using a variety of [[optical instrument]]s, ranging from the [[naked eye]] to large [[telescope]]s. The Moon is the only celestial body upon which surface features can be [[visual acuity|discerned]] with the unaided eyes of most people.

==Optimal viewing times==
[[File:ComputerHotline - Grande-lune (by).JPG|thumb|right|70px|[[Shadow]]s provide a sense of depth.]]
Contrary to popular belief, the Moon should ideally not be viewed at its full [[lunar phase|phase]]. During a full moon, rays of sunlight are hitting the visible portion of the moon [[perpendicular]] to the surface. As a result, there is less surface detail visible during a full moon than during other phases (such as the quarter and crescent phases) when sunlight hits the Moon at a much shallower angle. The brightness of a full moon as compared to a phase where a smaller percentage of the surface is illuminated tends to wash out substantial amounts of detail and can actually leave an [[afterimage]] on an observer's eye that can persist for several minutes. First quarter (six to nine days past [[new moon]]) is generally considered the best time to observe the Moon for the average stargazer. [[Shadow]]s and detail are most pronounced along the "[[terminator (solar)|terminator]]", the dividing line between the illuminated (day side) and dark (night side) of the Moon.

==Suggested viewing tools==

===Naked eye===

[[File:Moon names.svg|500px|right|Lunar nearside with major [[Lunar maria|maria]] and [[Impact crater|crater]]s labeled]]
[[File:Earthshine Karonen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Earthshine]] reflecting off the Moon. The bright region at left is directly illuminated by sunlight, while the rest of the Moon is faintly lit by sunlight reflected off the Earth.]]

Generally, the Moon can be viewed even with the naked eye, however it may be more enjoyable with optical instruments. The primary lunar surface features detectable to the naked eye are the [[lunar maria]] or "seas", large [[basalt]]ic plains which form imaginary figures as the traditional "[[Moon Rabbit]]" or familiar "[[Man in the Moon]]". The maria cover about 35% of the surface. The contrast between the less reflective dark gray maria and the more reflective gray/white lunar highlands is easily visible without optical aid. Under good viewing conditions, those with keen eyesight may also be able to see some of the following features:
#Bright region around [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]]
#[[Mare Nectaris]]
#[[Mare Humorum]]
#Bright region around [[Kepler (lunar crater)|Kepler]]
#[[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi]] region
#[[Plinius (crater)|Plinius]] region
#[[Mare Vaporum]]
#[[Lubiniezky (crater)|Lubiniesky]] region
#[[Sinus Medii]]
#Faintly shaded area near [[Sacrobosco (crater)|Sacrobosco]]
#Dark spot at foot of [[Mons Huygens]]
#[[Riphean Mountains (Moon)|Riphean Mountains]]

Another interesting phenomenon visible with the naked eye is [[Earthshine]]. Best visible shortly before or after new a moon (during the waning and waxing crescent phases respectively), Earthshine is the faint glow of the non-illuminated (night) side of the Moon caused by sunlight reflecting off the surface of Earth (which would appear nearly full to an observer situated on the Moon at this time) and onto the night side of the Moon. By the time the Moon reaches first its quarter however, the sunlight illuminated portion of the Moon becomes far too bright for Earthshine to be seen with the naked eye, however it can still be observed telescopically.

===Binoculars and telephoto camera lenses===
Binoculars are commonly used by those just beginning to observe the Moon and many experienced [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomer]]s prefer the view in binoculars to a telescopic view due to the larger [[field of view]]. Their high level of portability makes them the simplest device used to see more detail on the surface beyond naked eye observing.

The primary disadvantage of binoculars is that they cannot be held very steady unless one utilizes a commercial or homemade binocular tripod. The recent introduction of [[image-stabilized binoculars]] has changed this to some extent; however, cost is still an issue.

The average pair of binoculars will bring the moon approximately as close as can be observed with a 200mm camera lens. The photos below were shot with a 200mm lens. The first photo was taken on 13 November, 2016 at 6:20pm PST, observing the new supermoon just hours before it would officially become the largest [[supermoon]] since 1948. The second photo was shot 24 hours later, and the contrast was enhanced to bring out details such as mountainous terrain. The next supermoon will not occur this large until the year 2034.

File:Super-Moon-3 11-14-2016.jpg|[[Supermoon]] officially on {{start date|2016|11|14}}, at 7:19 pm PST
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Telescopes===
To some it may be more desirable to utilize a telescope in which case far more options for observing the Moon exist. Even a small, well-made telescope will show the observer much greater detail than is visible with the naked eye or small binoculars. As the [[aperture]] of the telescope mirror (in the case of a [[reflecting telescope]]) or lens (in the case of a [[refracting telescope]]) increases, smaller and smaller features will begin to appear. With large amateur telescopes, features as small as 0.6 miles (1&amp;nbsp;km) in diameter can be observed depending on atmospheric conditions.

Most astronomers use different kinds of filters in order to bring out the contrast of certain surface features. Simple [[neutral density filter]]s are also common as they can cut down the amount of light reaching the eye by 60–95%, something that is helpful especially when observing a full or gibbous moon so the surface does not appear as washed out.

==Lunar occultations==
[[Image:OccultJupiter 6-7-2005 6-07PM Nelson NZ.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jupiter]] (the bright object in the upper right) a few minutes before being occulted by the Moon on June 16, 2005]]
An [[occultation]] is an astronomical event where a celestial object appears completely hidden by another, closer body (with a greater [[angular diameter]]) due to the passage of the closer object directly between the more distant object and the observer. Due to the large apparent size of the Moon, lunar occultations are quite common and when a bright celestial object is involved, the result is an event that can be easily observed using the naked eye. The Moon almost constantly occults faint stars as it orbits the Earth but because even a young Moon appears immensely brighter than these stars, these events are difficult to observe using amateur telescopes. However, the Moon does frequently occult brighter stars and even [[planets]] due to its close proximity to the [[ecliptic]].
Four first [[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] stars, [[Regulus]], [[Spica]], [[Antares]], and [[Aldebaran]], are sufficiently close to the ecliptic that they may be occulted by the Moon. In addition, two [[star cluster]]s visible to the naked eye, the [[Beehive Cluster]] and the [[Pleiades]], are often occulted. Depending on one's location on the Earth, there are usually several occultations involving naked eye objects every year and many more that can be observed using binoculars or a telescope.

Accurate timings (accuracy at least +/-0.02 seconds) of lunar occultations are scientifically useful in fields such as lunar topography, [[astrometry]], and [[binary star]] studies and are collected by the International Occultation Timing Association - [http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/iotandx.htm IOTA]. The archive of lunar occultations observations, (1623 to the present day) are maintained at [[VizieR]].&lt;ref&gt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016yCat....102033H&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transient Lunar Phenomena==

A transient lunar phenomenon (TLP) or "Lunar Transient Phenomena" (LTP), refers to short-lived lights, colors, or changes in appearance of the [[lunar surface]].

Claims of these phenomena go back at least 1,000 years, with some having been observed independently by multiple witnesses or some in the scientific community. Nevertheless, the majority of transient lunar phenomena reports are irreproducible and do not possess adequate control experiments that could be used to distinguish among alternative [[hypotheses]]. Few reports concerning these phenomena are ever published in [[peer reviewed]] scientific journals, and rightfully or wrongfully, the lunar scientific community rarely discusses these observations.

Most lunar scientists will acknowledge that transient events such as [[outgassing]] and impact cratering do occur over [[geologic time]]: the controversy lies in the frequency of such events.

A number of astronomical societies around the world have implemented their own TLP watch programs and TLP alert networks.

===Blinking devices===

A number of observers employ different colored [[Filter (optics)|filters]] to determine colored transient events on the Moon. By quickly alternating filters of opposing colors in the telescopic light path, faintly colored areas on the Moon can stand out more by appearing to flicker on and off. A red area will appear brighter when viewed through a red filter and darker when seen through a blue filter. It is possible to alternate the filters manually however, this requires a certain dexterity of the hand and good coordination. A purpose built filter wheel is much more viable alternative, and this can be motorized, so the observer can devote all of their concentration to what is going on through the eyepiece. There are, however a number of features on the Moon that will appear to blink naturally, among them being the southwestern part of [[Fracastorius (crater)]], and a section of the western wall of [[Plato (crater)]]. A special filter wheel called a "crater extinction device" is capable of measuring the brightness of an individual lunar feature to be measured according to the point where it ceases to be visible.

==Crescent Moon==
During the first two weeks, the Moon is called 'crescent' (when the illuminated portion increases) while it is 'falling' for the next two weeks.
For two weeks, the crescent Moon wanes before and waxes after [[new moon]], or "change of Moon".{{cn|date=December 2018}} The Moon when other than crescent or dark, is called a gibbous, waxing before and waning after [[full moon]].

==Other items of interest==

Because the Moon is so bright, it is especially interesting to see objects "superimposed" on it. One particular point of interest is an ISS ([[International Space Station]]) transit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7529">In [[theoretical computer science]], '''multiparty communication complexity''' is the study of [[communication complexity]] in the setting where there are more than 2 players.

In the traditional two–party [[communication complexity|communication game]], introduced by {{harvtxt|Yao|1979}},&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2):\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\},\  x_1,x_2\in\{0,1\}^{n'},\  2n'=n&lt;/math&gt;

Player ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knows the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knows the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, but ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; does not know the value of ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;2. 

In other words, the players know the other's variables, but not their own. The minimum number of bits that must be communicated by the players to compute ''f'' is the [[communication complexity]] of ''f'', denoted by&amp;nbsp;''κ''(''f'').

The multiparty communication game, defined in 1983,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Because of this property, sometimes this model is called "numbers on the forehead" model, since if the players were seated around a round table, each wearing their own input on the forehead, then every player would see all the others' input, except their own.

The formal definition is as follows: ''k'' players: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; intend to compute a Boolean function 

: &lt;math&gt;f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n):\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;

On set ''S''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;} of variables there is a fixed partition ''A'' of ''k'' classes ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, and player ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; knows every variable, ''except'' those in ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, for ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,2,...,''k''. The players have unlimited computational power, and they  communicate with the help of a blackboard, viewed by all players.

The aim is to compute ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;), such  that at the end of the computation, every player knows this value. The cost of the computation is the number of bits written onto the blackboard for the given input ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) and partition ''A''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;). The cost of a multiparty protocol is the maximum number of bits communicated for any ''x'' from the set {0,1}&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and the given partition ''A''. The ''k''-party communication complexity, ''C''&lt;sup&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''), of a
function ''f'', with respect to partition ''A'', is the minimum of costs of those ''k''-party protocols which compute ''f''. The ''k''-party symmetric communication complexity of ''f'' is defined as 

: &lt;math&gt;C^{(k)}(f)=\max_AC^{(k)}_A(f) &lt;/math&gt;

where the maximum is taken over all ''k''-partitions of set ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;).

== Upper and lower bounds ==

For a general upper bound both for two and more players, let us suppose that ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is one of the smallest classes  of the partition ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''A''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can compute any Boolean function of ''S'' with |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 bits of communication: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; writes down the |''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;| bits of ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the blackboard, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; reads it, and computes and announces the value ''f''(''x''). So, we can write:

: &lt;math&gt;C^{(k)}(f)\leq\bigg\lfloor{n\over k}\bigg\rfloor+1.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Mystery Play Metz.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a performance of the Mystery Play of [[Clement of Metz|Saint Clement]] in [[Metz]] during the Middle Ages.]]

'''Mystery plays''' and '''miracle plays''' (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably&lt;ref&gt;'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only). Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Augustus William|title=History of English dramatic literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|year=1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are among the earliest formally developed [[Play (theatre)|plays]] in [[medieval Europe]]. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[Church (building)|churches]] as [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] with accompanying [[antiphon]]al song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vernacular Drama | Medieval Drama." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208054447/https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |archive-date=8 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]'' used in its sense of ''[[miracle]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=December 2009|chapter=mystery, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an occasionally quoted derivation is from ''ministerium'', meaning ''[[craft]]'', and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the [[craft guilds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gassner|first=John|author2=Quinn, Edward|title=The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama|publisher=Methuen|location=London|year=1969|pages=203–204|chapter=England: middle ages|oclc=249158675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Mystery play 001.jpg|thumb|Mystery play, [[Flanders]], 15th century]]
As early as the fifth century living tableaux were introduced into sacred services.&lt;ref name=bellinger&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/medieval/bellinger001.html Bellinger, Martha Fletcher, "A Thousand Years Of Quiescence And The Beginnings Of Sacred Drama", ''A Short History of the Drama'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1927. pp. 115-21]&lt;/ref&gt;
The plays originated as simple ''[[Trope (religion)|tropes]]'', verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.

The ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'' is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body.&lt;ref name=bellinger/&gt; These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.

In 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a [[Papal bull|papal edict]] forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play|Secunda Pastorum]]'' of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.

These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as [[York]], performed and produced by [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ''ministerium''&lt;!-- with 'i', misterium means mystery --&gt; meaning "occupation" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England]] in 1534.

The mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery Play | Dramatic Genre." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as ''Corpus Christi cycles''. These cycles were often performed during the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]&lt;/ref&gt; although these collections are sometimes referred to as "cycles," it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys &lt;ref&gt;http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=13&amp;division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&amp;division=div&amp;id=AnoTown&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;part=13&amp;tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is strongly suggestive. In "The London Burial Grounds" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet "Wakefield Master" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &amp;mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.

The best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.

The dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.

==Spanish mystery plays==

The [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracle play==
Miracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}&lt;/ref&gt; however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances. [[Robert Chambers (journalist)|Robert Chambers]], writing in the 19th century, notes that "especially in England, miracle [came] to stand for religious play in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite indeed book|last=Chambers|first=Robert|title=Cyclopaedia of English Literature|publisher=Robert Chambers|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|year=1844|oclc=311881902}}, quoted in {{cite book|last=Clopper|first=Lawrence M.|title=Drama, play, and game: English festive culture in the medieval and early modern period|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2001|pages=69–70|isbn=978-0-226-11030-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornish language]] miracle plays were performed in [[plain-an-gwarry (theatre)|plain-an-gwarrys]]. To capture the attention of the audience, "the plays were often noisy, bawdy and entertaining".&lt;ref name=HC&gt;[http://www.historic-cornwall.org.uk/a2m/medieval/plain_an_gwarry/st_just/st_just.htm ''St Just Plain-an-Gwarry''.] Historic Cornwall. Retrieved 23 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern performances==
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101125612/http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ |date=1 November 2015 }}, ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],

In 1977 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] commissioned [[Tony Harrison]] to create ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a re-working of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first=Tony |authorlink= |title=The Mysteries |year=1985 |publisher=Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-13790-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions won [[Bill Bryden]] the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discovery-space/previous-productions/the-globe-mysteries The Globe Mysteries]. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Isango Ensemble]] produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/concerts-by-candlelight/isango-ensemble-mysteries The Isango Ensemble Mysteries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201183331/http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/concerts-by-candlelight/isango-ensemble-mysteries |date=1 December 2016 }} 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor [[Edward Woodward]] in the role of God. The large cast also included [[Daniel MacPherson]], [[Thomas James Longley]] and [[Joseph McManners]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News.

The '''observable universe''' is a [[celestial sphere|spherical region]] of the [[Universe]] comprising all [[matter]] that can be [[observation|observed]] from [[Earth]] at the present time, because [[electromagnetic radiation]] from these [[astronomical object|objects]] has had time to reach Earth since the beginning of the [[metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion]]. There are at least 2 trillion [[galaxy|galaxies]] in the observable universe.&lt;ref name="Conselice"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Galaxy Number Density at ''z'' &lt; 8 and Its Implications |first=Christopher J. |last=Conselice et al |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=830 |issue=2 |year=2016 |arxiv=1607.03909v2 |bibcode= 2016ApJ...830...83C |doi=10.3847/0004-637X/830/2/83 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20161017"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fountain |first=Henry |title=Two Trillion Galaxies, at the Very Least |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/two-trillion-galaxies-at-the-very-least.html |date=17 October 2016 |work=[[New York Times]] |access-date=17 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the Universe is [[isotropy|isotropic]], the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly [[equidistant|the same]] in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a [[sphere|spherical]] volume (a [[ball (mathematics)|ball]]) centered on the observer. Every location in the Universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one [[geocentric model|centered on Earth]].

The word ''observable'' in this sense does not refer to the capability of modern technology to detect [[light]] or other information from an object, or whether there is anything to be detected. It refers to the physical limit created by the [[speed of light]] itself. Because no signals can travel faster than light, any object farther away from us than light could travel in the [[age of the Universe]] (estimated {{as of|2015|lc=y}} around {{val|13.799|0.021|ul=billion}} years&lt;ref name="Planck 2015"/&gt;) simply cannot be detected, as they have not reached us yet. Sometimes astrophysicists distinguish between the ''visible'' universe, which includes only signals emitted since [[Recombination_(cosmology)|recombination]]—and the ''observable'' universe, which includes signals since the beginning of the cosmological expansion (the [[Big Bang cosmology|Big Bang]] in traditional [[physical cosmology]], the end of the [[inflationary epoch]] in modern cosmology).

According to calculations, the current ''[[comoving distance]]''—proper distance, which takes into account that the universe has expanded since the light was emitted—to particles from which the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMBR) was emitted, which represent the radius of the visible universe, is about 14.0 billion [[parsec]]s (about 45.7 billion light-years), while the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is about 14.3 billion parsecs (about 46.6 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Gott III|first = J.

Since the expansion of the universe is known to accelerate and will become exponential in the future, the light emitted from all distant objects, past some time dependent on their current [[redshift]], will never reach the Earth. In the future all currently observable objects will slowly freeze in time while emitting progressively redder and fainter light. For instance, objects with the current redshift ''z'' from 5 to 10 will remain observable for no more than 4–6 billion years. In addition, light emitted by objects currently situated beyond a certain comoving distance (currently about 19 billion parsecs) will never reach Earth.&lt;ref name=Loeb2002&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.047301|title=Long-term future of extragalactic astronomy|journal=Physical Review D|volume=65|issue=4|year=2002|last1=Loeb|first1=Abraham|arxiv=astro-ph/0107568|bibcode=2002PhRvD..65d7301L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The universe versus the observable universe ==
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}
Some parts of the universe are too far away for the light emitted since the [[Big Bang]] to have had enough time to reach Earth, and so lie outside the observable universe. In the future, light from distant galaxies will have had more time to travel, so additional regions will become observable. However, due to [[Hubble's law]], regions sufficiently distant from the Earth are expanding away from it faster than the speed of light ([[special relativity]] prevents nearby objects in the same local region from moving faster than the speed of light with respect to each other, but there is no such constraint for distant objects when the space between them is expanding; see [[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion) and furthermore the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|expansion rate appears to be accelerating]] due to [[dark energy]]. Assuming dark energy remains constant (an unchanging [[cosmological constant]]), so that the expansion rate of the universe continues to accelerate, there is a "future visibility limit" beyond which objects will ''never'' enter our observable universe at any time in the infinite future, because light emitted by objects outside that limit would never reach the Earth. (A subtlety is that, because the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Hubble parameter]] is decreasing with time, there can be cases where a galaxy that is receding from the Earth just a bit faster than light does emit a signal that reaches the Earth eventually.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575 Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?] (see the last two paragraphs)&lt;/ref&gt;) This future visibility limit is calculated at a [[comoving distance]] of 19 billion parsecs (62 billion light-years), assuming the universe will keep expanding forever, which implies the number of galaxies that we can ever theoretically observe in the infinite future (leaving aside the issue that some may be impossible to observe in practice due to redshift, as discussed in the following paragraph) is only larger than the number currently observable by a factor of 2.36.&lt;ref name="mapofuniverse2"&gt;The comoving distance of the future visibility limit is calculated on p. 8 of Gott et al.'s [http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ms.pdf A Map of the Universe] to be 4.50 times the [[Hubble radius]], given as 4.220 billion parsecs (13.76 billion light-years), whereas the current comoving radius of the observable universe is calculated on p. 7 to be 3.38 times the Hubble radius. The number of galaxies in a sphere of a given comoving radius is proportional to the cube of the radius, so as shown on p. 8 the ratio between the number of galaxies observable in the future visibility limit to the number of galaxies observable today would be (4.50/3.38)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Friday, 3 Apr 2009. According to the [https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=102715275 transcript], [[Brian Greene]] makes the comment "And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared.

For example, the current distance to this horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening ''at present'' can eventually reach the Earth in the future if the event is less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal will never reach the Earth if the event is more than 16 billion light-years away.&lt;ref name=ly93 /&gt;

Both popular and professional research articles in cosmology often use the term "universe" to mean "observable universe".{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This can be justified on the grounds that we can never know anything by direct experimentation about any part of the universe that is [[Causality (physics)|causally disconnected]] from the Earth, although many credible theories require a total universe much larger than the observable universe.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} No evidence exists to suggest that the boundary of the observable universe constitutes a boundary on the universe as a whole, nor do any of the mainstream cosmological models propose that the universe has any physical boundary in the first place, though some models propose it could be finite but unbounded, like a higher-dimensional analogue of the 2D surface of a sphere that is finite in area but has no edge. It is plausible that the [[galaxy|galaxies]] within our observable universe represent only a minuscule fraction of the galaxies in the universe. According to the theory of [[cosmic inflation]] initially introduced by its founder, [[Alan Guth]] (and by D. Kazanas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title="Dynamics of the Universe and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking" Kazanas, D., Ap. J. (Lett.), 241, L59-L63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;), if it is assumed that inflation began about 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang, then with the plausible assumption that the size of the universe before the inflation occurred was approximately equal to the speed of light times its age, that would suggest that at present the entire universe's size is at least 3×10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times the radius of the observable universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan H.

If the universe is finite but unbounded, it is also possible that the universe is ''smaller'' than the observable universe. In this case, what we take to be very distant galaxies may actually be duplicate images of nearby galaxies, formed by light that has circumnavigated the universe. It is difficult to test this hypothesis experimentally because different images of a galaxy would show different eras in its history, and consequently might appear quite different.

=== Misconceptions on its size === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Universe]] --&gt;
[[File:Incorrect plaque at the Rose Center for Earth and Space, April 2011.jpg|thumb|An example of the misconception that the radius of the observable universe is 13 billion light-years. This plaque appears at the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in New York City.]]
Many secondary sources have reported a wide variety of incorrect figures for the size of the visible universe. Some of these figures are listed below, with brief descriptions of possible reasons for misconceptions about them.

;13.8 billion light-years
:The [[age of the universe]] is estimated to be 13.8 billion years. While it is commonly understood that nothing can accelerate to velocities equal to or greater than that of light, it is a common misconception that the radius of the observable universe must therefore amount to only 13.8 billion light-years. This reasoning would only make sense if the flat, static [[Minkowski space]]time conception under special relativity were correct. In the real universe, [[spacetime]] is curved in a way that corresponds to the [[Expansion of the universe|expansion of space]], as evidenced by [[Hubble's law]]. Distances obtained as the speed of light multiplied by a cosmological time interval have no direct physical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Ned Wright, [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html "Why the Light Travel Time Distance should not be used in Press Releases"].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the early 1980s, more and more structures have been discovered. In 1983, Adrian Webster identified the Webster LQG, a [[large quasar group]] consisting of 5 quasars. The discovery was the first identification of a large-scale structure, and has expanded the information about the known grouping of matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the [[Giant Void]], which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on [[redshift survey]] data, in 1989 [[Margaret Geller]] and [[John Huchra]] discovered the "[[CfA2 Great Wall|Great Wall]]",&lt;ref name="redshift"&gt;{{cite journal |author= M. J. Geller |author2=J. P.

The existence of this structure escaped notice for so long because it requires locating the position of galaxies in three dimensions, which involves combining location information about the galaxies with distance information from [[redshift]]s.
Two years later, astronomers Roger G. Clowes and Luis E. Campusano discovered the [[Clowes–Campusano LQG]], a [[large quasar group]] measuring two billion light-years at its widest point which was the largest known structure in the universe at the time of its announcement. In April 2003, another large-scale structure was discovered, the [[Sloan Great Wall]]. In August 2007, a possible supervoid was detected in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12546-biggest-void-in-space-is-1-billion-light-years-across.html Biggest void in space is 1 billion light years across – space – 24 August 2007 – New Scientist]. Space.newscientist.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; It coincides with the '[[CMB cold spot]]', a cold region in the microwave sky that is highly improbable under the currently favored cosmological model. This supervoid could cause the cold spot, but to do so it would have to be improbably big, possibly a billion light-years across, almost as big as the Giant Void mentioned above.
[[File:Large-scale structure of light distribution in the universe.jpg|thumb|Computer simulated image of an area of space more than 50 million light-years across, presenting a possible large-scale distribution of light sources in the universe—precise relative contributions of galaxies and quasars are unclear.]]
Another large-scale structure is the [[SSA22 Protocluster]], a collection of galaxies and enormous gas bubbles that measures about 200 million light-years across.

In 2011, a large quasar group was discovered, [[U1.11]], measuring about 2.5 billion light-years across. On January 11, 2013, another large quasar group, the [[Huge-LQG]], was discovered, which was measured to be four billion light-years across, the largest known structure in the universe at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wall | first = Mike | url = http://www.foxnews.com/science/2013/01/11/largest-structure-in-universe-discovered/ | title = Largest structure in universe discovered | date = 2013-01-11 | publisher = [[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, astronomers discovered the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]],&lt;ref name=2014paper&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Horváth |first1=I |last2=Hakkila |first2=Jon |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. | title = Possible structure in the GRB sky distribution at redshift two | date = 2014 |arxiv=1401.0533 |bibcode=2014A&amp;A...561L..12H |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201323020 |volume=561 |journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics |pages=L12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite arXiv |last = Horvath |first = I. |last2= Hakkila |first2=J. |last3=Bagoly |first3=Z. |title = The largest structure of the Universe, defined by Gamma-Ray Bursts |date = 2013 |eprint=1311.1104 |class=astro-ph.CO}}&lt;/ref&gt; an even bigger structure twice as large as the former.

===End of Greatness===
The ''End of Greatness'' is an observational scale discovered at roughly 100&amp;nbsp;[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] (roughly 300 million light-years) where the lumpiness seen in the large-scale structure of the [[universe]] is [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogenized]] and [[isotropic|isotropized]] in accordance with the [[Cosmological Principle]].&lt;ref name=Kirshner /&gt; At this scale, no pseudo-random [[fractal]]ness is apparent.&lt;ref&gt;LiveScience.com, [https://news.yahoo.com/universe-isnt-fractal-study-finds-215053937.html "The Universe Isn't a Fractal, Study Finds"], Natalie Wolchover,22 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[supercluster]]s and [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] seen in smaller surveys are [[random]]ized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent. It was not until the [[redshift survey]]s of the 1990s were completed that this scale could accurately be observed.&lt;ref name=Kirshner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Extravagant Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy and the Accelerating Cosmos |author=Robert P Kirshner |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qQ_mV2prqNYC&amp;pg=PA71 |page=71 |isbn=0-691-05862-8 |date=2002 |publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Observations===
[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|399px|thumb|"Panoramic view of the entire near-infrared sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The image is derived from the [[2MASS|2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC)]]—more than 1.5 million galaxies, and the Point Source Catalog (PSC)—nearly 0.5 billion Milky Way stars. The galaxies are color-coded by '[[redshift]]' obtained from the [[Uppsala General Catalogue|UGC]], [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics|CfA]], Tully NBGC, LCRS, [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]], 6dFGS, and [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] surveys (and from various observations compiled by the [[NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database|NASA Extragalactic Database]]), or photo-metrically deduced from the [[K band (infrared)|K band]] (2.2 μm). Blue are the nearest sources (''z'' &lt; 0.01); green are at moderate distances (0.01 &lt; ''z'' &lt; 0.04) and red are the most distant sources that 2MASS resolves (0.04 &lt; ''z'' &lt; 0.1). The map is projected with an equal area Aitoff in the Galactic system (Milky Way at center)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Large Scale Structure in the Local Universe: The 2MASS Galaxy Catalog |last=1Jarrett |first1=T. H. |date=2004 |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=396–403 |doi=10.1071/AS04050 |arxiv=astro-ph/0405069 |bibcode=2004PASA...21..396J}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another indicator of large-scale structure is the '[[Lyman-alpha forest]]'. This is a collection of [[Spectral line|absorption lines]] that appear in the spectra of light from [[quasar]]s, which are interpreted as indicating the existence of huge thin sheets of intergalactic (mostly [[hydrogen]]) gas. These sheets appear to be associated with the formation of new galaxies.

Caution is required in describing structures on a cosmic scale because things are often different from how they appear. [[Gravitational lens]]ing (bending of light by gravitation) can make an image appear to originate in a different direction from its real source. This is caused when foreground objects (such as galaxies) curve surrounding spacetime (as predicted by [[general relativity]]), and deflect passing light rays. Rather usefully, strong gravitational lensing can sometimes magnify distant galaxies, making them easier to detect. [[Weak Gravitational Lensing|Weak lensing]] (gravitational shear) by the intervening universe in general also subtly changes the observed large-scale structure. 

The large-scale structure of the universe also looks different if one only uses [[redshift]] to measure distances to galaxies. For example, galaxies behind a galaxy cluster are attracted to it, and so fall towards it, and so are slightly blueshifted (compared to how they would be if there were no cluster) On the near side, things are slightly redshifted. Thus, the environment of the cluster looks a bit squashed if using redshifts to measure distance. An opposite effect works on the galaxies already within a cluster: the galaxies have some random motion around the cluster center, and when these random motions are converted to redshifts, the cluster appears elongated. This creates a "''[[Redshift-space distortions|finger of God]]''"—the illusion of a long chain of galaxies pointed at the Earth.

===Cosmography of Earth's cosmic neighborhood===
At the centre of the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]], a gravitational anomaly called the [[Great Attractor]] affects the motion of galaxies over a region hundreds of millions of light-years across. These galaxies are all [[redshift]]ed, in accordance with [[Hubble's law]]. This indicates that they are receding from us and from each other, but the variations in their redshift are sufficient to reveal the existence of a concentration of mass equivalent to tens of thousands of galaxies.

The Great Attractor, discovered in 1986, lies at a distance of between 150 million and 250 million light-years (250 million is the most recent estimate), in the direction of the [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] and [[Centaurus]] [[constellation]]s. In its vicinity there is a preponderance of large old galaxies, many of which are colliding with their neighbours, or radiating large amounts of radio waves.

In 1987, [[astronomer]] [[R. Brent Tully]] of the [[University of Hawaii]]'s Institute of Astronomy identified what he called the [[Pisces–Cetus Supercluster Complex]], a structure one billion [[light-year]]s long and 150 million light-years across in which, he claimed, the Local Supercluster was embedded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/10/science/massive-clusters-of-galaxies-defy-concepts-of-the-universe.html?pagewanted=all Massive Clusters of Galaxies Defy Concepts of the Universe N.Y.

==Mass of ordinary matter==
The mass of the observable universe is often quoted as 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt; tonnes or 10&lt;sup&gt;53&lt;/sup&gt; kg.&lt;ref name="Paul Davies 2006 43"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, mass refers to ordinary matter and includes the [[interstellar medium]] (ISM) and the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM). However, it excludes [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]]. This quoted value for the mass of ordinary matter in the universe can be estimated based on critical density. The calculations are for the observable universe only as the volume of the whole is unknown and may be infinite.
===Estimates based on critical density===
Critical density is the energy density for which the universe is flat.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter]].&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no dark energy, it is also the [[density]] for which the expansion of the universe is poised between continued expansion and collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michio Kaku|title=Parallel Worlds| url= https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_4_8?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=parallel+worlds&amp;sprefix=Parallel%2Cstripbooks%2C271| accessdate=1 July 2013 |date=2005|publisher=Anchor Books|isbn=978-1-4000-3372-0|page=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Friedmann equations]], the value for &lt;math&gt;\rho_c&lt;/math&gt; critical density, is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard F. Schutz|title=Gravity from the ground up|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEZNXvYwyNwC&amp;pg=PA361|accessdate=1 May 2011|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45506-0|pages=361–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]] and H = ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the present value of the [[Hubble constant]]. The current value for ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', due to the European Space Agency's Planck Telescope, is ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 67.15 kilometers per second per mega parsec. This gives a critical density of {{val|0.85|e=-26|u=kg/m3}} (commonly quoted as about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter). This density includes four significant types of energy/mass: ordinary matter (4.8%), neutrinos (0.1%), [[cold dark matter]] (26.8%), and [[dark energy]] (68.3%).&lt;ref name='planck_cosmological_parameters'&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1303.5076 | title=Planck 2013 results. XVI. Cosmological parameters | author=Planck collaboration | journal=Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics | date=2013|bibcode = 2014A&amp;A...571A..16P | doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201321591 | volume=571 | pages=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that although neutrinos are [[Standard Model]] particles, they are listed separately because they are difficult to detect and so different from ordinary matter. The density of ordinary matter, as measured by Planck, is 4.8% of the total critical density or {{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}. To convert this density to mass we must multiply by volume, a value based on the radius of the "observable universe". Since the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]] (radius) is now about 46.6 billion light-years. Thus, volume ({{sfrac|4|3}}''πr''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) equals {{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}} and the mass of ordinary matter equals density ({{val|4.08|e=-28|u=kg/m3}}) times volume ({{val|3.58|e=80|u=m3}}) or {{val|1.46|e=53|u=kg}}.

=={{anchor|Matter content}} Matter content – number of atoms==
&lt;!-- [[Atoms in the universe]] redirects here --&gt;
{{Main|Abundance of the chemical elements}}
Assuming the mass of ordinary matter is about {{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} (refer to previous section) and assuming all atoms are [[hydrogen atom]]s (which in reality make up about 74% of all atoms in our galaxy by mass, see [[Abundance of the chemical elements]]), calculating the estimated total number of atoms in the observable universe is straightforward. Divide the mass of ordinary matter by the mass of a hydrogen atom ({{val|1.45|e=53|u=kg}} divided by {{val|1.67|e=-27|u=kg}}). The result is approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt; hydrogen atoms.

==Most distant objects==
{{main|List of the most distant astronomical objects}}
The most distant [[astronomical object]] yet announced as of 2016 is a galaxy classified [[GN-z11]]. In 2009, a [[gamma ray burst]], [[GRB 090423]], was found to have a [[redshift]] of 8.2, which indicates that the collapsing star that caused it exploded when the universe was only 630 million years old.&lt;ref name="NASAGRB"&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/28apr_grbsmash/ New Gamma-Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record – NASA Science].

Universetoday.com (2009-10-28). Retrieved on 2011-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; so a distance of about 13 billion light-years was widely quoted in the media (or sometimes a more precise figure of 13.035 billion light-years),&lt;ref name="NASAGRB" /&gt; though this would be the "light travel distance" (''see'' [[Distance measures (cosmology)]]) rather than the "[[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|proper distance]]" used in both [[Hubble's law]] and in defining the size of the observable universe (cosmologist [[Edward L. Wright|Ned Wright]] argues against the common use of light travel distance in astronomical press releases on [http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~wright/Dltt_is_Dumb.html this page], and at the bottom of the page offers online calculators that can be used to calculate the current proper distance to a distant object in a flat universe based on either the redshift ''z'' or the light travel time). The proper distance for a redshift of 8.2 would be about 9.2 [[Megaparsecs|Gpc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meszaros, Attila |display-authors=etal |journal=Baltic Astronomy |volume=18 |title=Impact on cosmology of the celestial anisotropy of the short gamma-ray bursts |pages=293–296 |date=2009 |arxiv=1005.1558 |bibcode=2009BaltA..18..293M }}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 30 billion light-years. Another record-holder for most distant object is a galaxy observed through and located beyond [[Abell 2218]], also with a light travel distance of approximately 13 billion light-years from Earth, with observations from the [[Hubble telescope]] indicating a redshift between 6.6 and 7.1, and observations from [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescopes indicating a redshift towards the upper end of this range, around 7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic0404/ Hubble and Keck team up to find farthest known galaxy in the Universe|Press Releases|ESA/Hubble].

==Horizons==
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
The limit of observability in our universe is set by a set of cosmological horizons which limit—based on various physical constraints—the extent to which we can obtain information about various events in the universe. The most famous horizon is the [[particle horizon]] which sets a limit on the precise distance that can be seen due to the finite [[age of the universe]]. Additional horizons are associated with the possible future extent of observations (larger than the particle horizon owing to the [[expansion of space]]), an "optical horizon" at the [[Cosmic microwave background|surface of last scattering]], and associated horizons with the surface of last scattering for [[cosmic neutrino background|neutrinos]] and [[gravitational wave background|gravitational waves]].

'''R/V ''Rachel Carson''''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]]. The vessel is part of the [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System|UNOLS]] fleet. It is capable of conducting operations within the [[Salish Sea]] and coastal waters of the western United States and British Columbia. She can accommodate up to 28 persons, including the crew, for day operations, while up to 13 can be accommodated for multi-day operations.&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"/&gt;

==Service history==

===R/V ''Aora'', 2003–2016=== 
The ship was originally launched in May 2003 at the Macduff Shipyard in [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]], Scotland, as the 
R/V ''Aora'', a [[fisheries research vessel]].&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/RV_Rachel_Carson |title=R/V Rachel Carson |date=2018 |website=University of Washington School of Oceanography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was based at the [[University Marine Biological Station Millport]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverclydephotography.uk/2010/12/rv-aora.html |title=R/V Aora |last=Ward |first=Gerard |date=6 December 2010 |website=River Clyde Photography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the station was closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx |title=Millport History |website=[[Field Studies Council]] |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R/V ''Rachel Carson'', 2017–present=== 
In 2015 the University of Washington's School of Oceanography wanted to replace the fifty-year old {{ship|RV|Clifford A. Barnes}}, but were unable to raise the funds required to design and build a replacement. In December 2016 they found the ''Aora'' for sale on a yacht-trading website.&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |title=UW launches 1st voyage Saturday on bigger, better research ship |last=Farley |first=Glenn  |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[KING-TV]] |access-date=25 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407042551/https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |archive-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irso.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irso.info/wp-content/uploads/Russell-RV-Rachel-Carson-Presentation-26-Sept-2018-IRSO-copy.pdf |title=R/V Rachel Carson |first=Doug |last=Russell |date=26 September 2018 |website=International Research Ship Operators |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an inspection in March 2017, the ship was purchased for $1.07m on 8 August 2017,&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt; with the aid of a $1m gift.&lt;ref name="new-uw-vessel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/10/new-uw-vessel-rv-rachel-carson-will-explore-regional-waters/ |title=New UW vessel, RV Rachel Carson, will explore regional waters |last=Hickey |first=Hannah |date=May 10, 2018 |website=UW News |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme of maintenance and some modifications at the MacDuff yard were completed in October, and the ''Rachel Carson'' was transported by ship from [[Rotterdam]] to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] by early November.&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macduffshipdesign.com/news/the-rachel-carson-transported-to-the-university-of-washington/ |title=The "Rachel Carson" transported to the University of Washington |date=16 December 2017 |website=MacDuff Ship Design |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then transported to the University of Washington, arriving on 28 December.

[[File:Boyd Orr Building.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Robertson Centre for Biostatistics is in the [[Boyd Orr Building]], University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK, 2007]] 

'''The Robertson Centre for Biostatistics''' is a specialised biostatistical research centre in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].  It is part of the College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences and the Institute of Health and Wellbeing at the [[University of Glasgow]]. All scales of research are carried out at the centre from multi-site clinical trials to small scale research projects. The centre also has interests in the development of novel informatics solutions for clinical research, statistical issues in epidemiology and health [[economic evaluation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rcb.gla.ac.uk Robertson Centre for Biostatistics], retrieved 4 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The centre led the WOSCOP study (New England Journal of Medicine 1995; 333:1301-7) which found that treatment with [[Pravastatin]] significantly reduced the risk of [[myocardial infarction]] and the risk of death from [[cardiovascular]] causes without adversely affecting the risk of death from noncardiovascular causes in men with moderate [[hypercholesterolaemia]] and no history of myocardial infarction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070815164733/http://www.gla.ac.uk/pathologicalbiochemistry/lipids/woscops.html The WOSCOP Study], retrieved 4 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Robertson Centre joined with the [[Glasgow Clinical Research Facility]] and [[NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde|Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS]] R&amp;D division in November 2007 to create a [[UKCRN]] registered [[Clinical Trials Unit]] - the [[Glasgow Clinical Trials Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.gla.ac.uk/media/media_58210_en.doc University Of Glasgow Press Release]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, retrieved 4 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48269">In [[computer science]], a '''rough set''', first described by [[Poles|Polish]] computer scientist [[Zdzislaw Pawlak|Zdzisław I. Pawlak]], is a formal approximation of a [[crisp set]] (i.e., conventional set) in terms of a pair of sets which give the ''lower'' and the ''upper'' approximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory (Pawlak 1991), the lower- and upper-approximation sets are crisp sets, but in other variations, the approximating sets may be [[fuzzy sets]].

==Definitions==
The following section contains an overview of the basic framework of rough set theory, as originally proposed by [[Zdzislaw Pawlak|Zdzisław I. Pawlak]], along with some of the key definitions. More formal properties and boundaries of rough sets can be found in Pawlak (1991) and cited references. The initial and basic theory of rough sets is sometimes referred to as ''"Pawlak Rough Sets"'' or ''"classical rough sets"'', as a means to distinguish from more recent extensions and generalizations.

===Information system framework===
Let &lt;math&gt;I = (\mathbb{U},\mathbb{A})&lt;/math&gt; be an information system ([[attribute-value system]]), where &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty, finite set of objects (the universe) and &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a non-empty, finite set of attributes such that &lt;math&gt;a:\mathbb{U} \rightarrow V_a&lt;/math&gt; for every &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; is the set of values that attribute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; may take. The information table assigns a value &lt;math&gt;a(x)&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;V_a&lt;/math&gt; to each attribute &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and object &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the universe &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.

With any &lt;math&gt;P \subseteq \mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; there is an associated [[equivalence relation]] &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \mathrm{IND}(P) = \left\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{U}^2 \mid \forall a \in P, a(x)=a(y)\right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relation &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; is called a &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-indiscernibility relation''. The partition of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a family of all equivalence classes of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; and is denoted  by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/\mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt;).

If &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\in \mathrm{IND}(P)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are ''indiscernible'' (or indistinguishable) by attributes from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; .

The equivalence classes of the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-indiscernibility relation are denoted &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

===Example: equivalence-class structure===
For example, consider the following information table:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:30%" border="1"
|+ Sample Information System
! Object !! &lt;math&gt;P_{1}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{2}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{3}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;P_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{1}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{4}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{5}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 0 || 1 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{8}&lt;/math&gt;
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 2 || 1
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{9}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 1 || 0 || 2 || 2
|-
! &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;
| 2 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|}

When the full set of attributes &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4},P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt; is considered, we see that we have the following seven equivalence classes:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the two objects within the first equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from each other based on the available attributes, and the three objects within the second equivalence class, &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, cannot be distinguished from one another based on the available attributes. The remaining five objects are each discernible from all other objects.

It is apparent that different attribute subset selections will in general lead to different indiscernibility classes. For example, if attribute &lt;math&gt;P =\{ P_{1}\}&lt;/math&gt; alone is selected, we obtain the following, much coarser, equivalence-class structure:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{5},O_{7},O_{9},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4},O_{6},O_{8}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Definition of a ''rough set''===
Let &lt;math&gt;X \subseteq \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; be a target set that we wish to represent using attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; that is, we are told that an arbitrary set of objects &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; comprises a single class, and we wish to express this class (i.e., this subset) using the equivalence classes induced by attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. In general, &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed exactly, because the set may include and exclude objects which are indistinguishable on the basis of attributes &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, consider the target set &lt;math&gt;X = \{O_{1},O_{2},O_{3},O_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;, and let attribute subset &lt;math&gt;P = \{P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3}, P_{4}, P_{5}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the full available set of features.  It will be noted that the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; cannot be expressed exactly, because in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P,&lt;/math&gt;, objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3}, O_{7}, O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; are indiscernible. Thus, there is no way to represent any set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; which ''includes'' &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; but ''excludes'' objects &lt;math&gt;O_{7}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;.

However, the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be ''approximated'' using only the information contained within &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; by constructing the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-lower and &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-upper approximations of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\underline P}X= \{x \mid [x]_P \subseteq X\}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
  {\overline P}X = \{x \mid [x]_P \cap X \neq \emptyset \}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Lower approximation and positive region====
The &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-lower approximation'', or ''positive region'', is the union of all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which are contained by (i.e., are subsets of) the target set – in the example, &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \{O_{1}, O_{2}\} \cup \{O_{4}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of the two equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which are contained in the target set. The lower approximation is the complete set of objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt; that can be ''positively'' (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

====Upper approximation and negative region====
The &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;''-upper approximation'' is the union of all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; which have non-empty intersection with the target set – in the example, &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \{O_{1}, O_{2}\} \cup \{O_{4}\} \cup \{O_{3}, O_{7}, O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt;, the union of the three equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt; that have non-empty intersection with the target set. The upper approximation is the complete set of objects that in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt; that ''cannot'' be positively (i.e., unambiguously) classified as belonging to the ''complement'' (&lt;math&gt;\overline X&lt;/math&gt;) of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the upper approximation is the complete set of objects that are ''possibly'' members of the  target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}-{\overline P}X&lt;/math&gt; therefore represents the ''negative region'', containing the set of objects that can be definitely ruled out as members of the target set.

====Boundary region====
The ''boundary region'', given by set difference &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X - {\underline P}X&lt;/math&gt;, consists of those objects that can neither be ruled in nor ruled out as members of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

In summary, the lower approximation of a target set is a ''conservative'' approximation consisting of only those objects which can positively be identified as members of the set. (These objects have no indiscernible "clones" which are excluded by the target set.) The upper approximation is a ''liberal'' approximation which includes all objects that might be members of target set. (Some objects in the upper approximation may not be members of the target set.) From the perspective of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}/P&lt;/math&gt;, the lower approximation contains objects that are members of the target set with certainty (probability = 1), while the upper approximation contains objects that are members of the target set with non-zero probability (probability &gt; 0).

====The rough set====
The tuple &lt;math&gt;\langle{\underline P}X,{\overline P}X\rangle&lt;/math&gt; composed of the lower and upper approximation is called a ''rough set''; thus, a rough set is composed of two crisp sets, one representing a ''lower boundary'' of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and the other representing an ''upper boundary'' of the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

The ''accuracy'' of the rough-set representation of the set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; can be given (Pawlak 1991) by the following:

:&lt;math&gt;
\alpha_{P}(X) = \frac{\left | {\underline P}X \right |} {\left | {\overline P}X \right |} 
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the accuracy of the rough set representation of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{P}(X)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \leq \alpha_{P}(X) \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, is the ratio of the number of objects which can ''positively'' be placed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to the number of objects that can ''possibly'' be placed in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; – this provides a measure of how closely the rough set is approximating the target set. Clearly, when the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., boundary region empty), then &lt;math&gt;\alpha_{P}(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and the approximation is perfect; at the other extreme, whenever the lower approximation is empty, the accuracy is zero (regardless of the size of the upper approximation).

====Objective analysis====
Rough set theory is one of many methods that can be employed to analyse uncertain (including vague) systems, although less common than more traditional methods of [[probability]], [[statistics]], [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]] and [[Dempster–Shafer theory]]. However a key difference, and a unique strength, of using classical rough set theory is that it provides an objective form of analysis (Pawlak et al. 1995). Unlike other methods, as those given above, classical rough set analysis requires no additional information, external parameters, models, functions, grades or subjective interpretations to determine set membership – instead it only uses the information presented within the given data (Düntsch and Gediga 1995).  More recent adaptations of rough set theory, such as dominance-based, decision-theoretic and fuzzy rough sets, have introduced more subjectivity to the analysis.

===Definability===
In general, the upper and lower approximations are not equal; in such cases, we say that target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''undefinable'' or ''roughly definable'' on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. When the upper and lower approximations are equal (i.e., the boundary is empty),  &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = {\underline P}X&lt;/math&gt;, then the target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''definable'' on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. We can distinguish the following special cases of undefinability:

* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''internally'' ''undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X \neq \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''no'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but there ''are'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''externally undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X \neq \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there ''are'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, but there are ''no'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.
* Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is ''totally undefinable'' if &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}X = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{\overline P}X = \mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, there are ''no'' objects which we can be certain belong to target set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, and there are ''no'' objects which we can definitively exclude from set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, we cannot decide whether any object is, or is not, a member of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

===Reduct and core===
An interesting question is whether there are attributes in the information system (attribute-value table) which are more important to the knowledge represented in the equivalence class structure than other attributes.  Often, we wonder whether there is a subset of attributes which can, by itself, fully characterize the knowledge in the database; such an attribute set is called a ''reduct''.

Formally, a reduct is a subset of attributes &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED} \subseteq P&lt;/math&gt; such that

* &lt;math&gt;[x]_{\mathrm{RED}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the equivalence classes induced by the reduced attribute set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; are the same as the equivalence class structure induced by the full attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;.
* the attribute set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; is ''minimal'', in the sense that &lt;math&gt;[x]_{(\mathrm{RED}-\{a\})} \neq [x]_P&lt;/math&gt; for any attribute &lt;math&gt;a \in \mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt;; in other words, no attribute can be removed from set &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{RED}&lt;/math&gt; without changing the equivalence classes &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

A reduct can be thought of as a ''sufficient'' set of features – sufficient, that is, to represent the category structure. In the example table above, attribute set &lt;math&gt;\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is a reduct – the information system projected on just these attributes possesses the same equivalence class structure as that expressed by the full attribute set:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases} 
\{O_{1},O_{2}\} \\ 
\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\} \\ 
\{O_{4}\} \\ 
\{O_{5}\} \\
\{O_{6}\} \\
\{O_{8}\} \\
\{O_{9}\} \end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Attribute set &lt;math&gt;\{P_3,P_4,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is a reduct because eliminating any of these attributes causes a collapse of the equivalence-class structure, with the result that &lt;math&gt;[x]_{\mathrm{RED}} \neq [x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

The reduct of an information system is ''not unique'': there may be many subsets of attributes which preserve the equivalence-class structure (i.e., the knowledge) expressed in the information system.  In the example information system above, another reduct is &lt;math&gt;\{P_1,P_2,P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;, producing the same equivalence-class structure as &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;.

The set of attributes which is common to all reducts is called the ''core'': the core is the set of attributes which is possessed by ''every'' reduct, and therefore consists of attributes which cannot be removed from the information system without causing collapse of the equivalence-class structure.  The core may be thought of as the set of ''necessary'' attributes – necessary, that is, for the category structure to be represented. In the example, the only such attribute is &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt;; any one of the other attributes can be removed singly without damaging the equivalence-class structure, and hence these are all ''dispensable''.  However, removing &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; by itself ''does'' change the equivalence-class structure, and thus &lt;math&gt;\{P_5\}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''indispensable'' attribute of this information system, and hence the core.

It is possible for the core to be empty, which means that there is no indispensable attribute: any single attribute in such an information system can be deleted without altering the equivalence-class  structure. In such cases, there is no ''essential'' or necessary attribute which is required for the class structure to be represented.

===Attribute dependency===
One of the most important aspects of database analysis or data acquisition is the discovery of attribute dependencies; that is, we wish to discover which variables are strongly related to which other variables. Generally, it is these strong relationships that will warrant further investigation, and that will ultimately be of use in predictive modeling.

In rough set theory, the notion of dependency is defined very simply. Let us take two (disjoint) sets of attributes, set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; and set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, and inquire what degree of dependency obtains between them.  Each attribute set induces an (indiscernibility) equivalence class structure, the equivalence classes induced by &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x]_P&lt;/math&gt;, and the equivalence classes induced by &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q = \{Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, \dots, Q_N \}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is a given equivalence class from the equivalence-class structure induced by attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, the ''dependency'' of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt;, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\gamma_{P}(Q) =  \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \left | {\underline P}Q_i \right |} {\left | \mathbb{U} \right |} \leq 1
&lt;/math&gt;

That is, for each equivalence class &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, we add up the size of its lower approximation by the attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;{\underline P}Q_i&lt;/math&gt;.  This approximation (as above, for arbitrary set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) is the number of objects which on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; can be positively identified as belonging to target set &lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt;. Added across all equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;[x]_Q&lt;/math&gt;, the numerator above represents the total number of objects which – based on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; – can be positively categorized according to the classification induced by attributes &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;. The dependency ratio therefore expresses the proportion (within the entire universe) of such classifiable objects.  The dependency &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{P}(Q)&lt;/math&gt; "can be interpreted as a proportion of such objects in the information system for which it suffices to know the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; to determine the values of attributes in &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;".

Another, intuitive, way to consider dependency is to take the partition induced by Q as the target class C, and consider P as the attribute set we wish to use in order to "re-construct" the target class C. If P can completely reconstruct C, then Q depends totally upon P; if P results in a poor and perhaps a random reconstruction of C, then Q does not depend upon P at all.

Thus, this measure of dependency expresses the degree of ''functional'' (i.e., deterministic) dependency of attribute set &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; on attribute set &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;; it is ''not'' symmetric.  The relationship of this notion of attribute dependency to more traditional information-theoretic (i.e., entropic) notions of attribute dependence has been discussed in a number of sources (e.g., Pawlak, Wong, &amp; Ziarko 1988; Yao &amp; Yao 2002; Wong, Ziarko, &amp; Ye 1986, Quafafou &amp; Boussouf 2000).

==Rule extraction==
The category representations discussed above are all ''extensional'' in nature; that is, a category or complex class is simply the sum of all its members. To represent a category is, then, just to be able to list or identify all the objects belonging to that category.  However, extensional category representations have very limited practical use, because they provide no insight for deciding whether novel (never-before-seen) objects are members of the category.

What is generally desired is an ''intentional'' description of the category, a representation of the category based on a set of ''rules'' that describe the scope of the category.  The choice of such rules is not unique, and therein lies the issue of [[inductive bias]]. See [[Version space]] and [[Model selection]] for more about this issue.

There are a few rule-extraction methods.  We will start from a rule-extraction procedure based on Ziarko &amp; Shan (1995).

===Decision matrices===

Let us say that we wish to find the minimal set of consistent rules ([[logical implication]]s) that characterize our sample system.  For a set of ''condition'' attributes &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P} = \{P_1, P_2, P_3, \dots , P_n\}&lt;/math&gt; and a decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q, Q \notin \mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt;, these rules should have the form &lt;math&gt;P_i^a P_j^b \dots P_k^c \to Q^d&lt;/math&gt;, or, spelled out,

:&lt;math&gt;(P_i=a) \land (P_j=b) \land \dots \land (P_k=c) \to (Q=d)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\{a, b, c, \dots\}&lt;/math&gt; are legitimate values from the domains of their respective attributes.  This is a form typical of [[association rules]], and the number of items in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; which match the condition/antecedent is called the ''support'' for the rule.  The method for extracting such rules given in {{Harvtxt|Ziarko|Shan|1995}} is to form a ''decision matrix'' corresponding to each individual value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;.  Informally, the decision matrix for value &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; of decision attribute &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; lists all attribute–value pairs that ''differ'' between objects having &lt;math&gt;Q = d &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q \ne d&lt;/math&gt;.

This is best explained by example (which also avoids a lot of notation).  Consider the table above, and let &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; be the decision variable (i.e., the variable on the right side of the implications) and let &lt;math&gt;\{P_1,P_2,P_3\}&lt;/math&gt; be the condition variables (on the left side of the implication). We note that the decision variable &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; takes on two different values, namely &lt;math&gt;\{1, 2\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We treat each case separately.

First, we look at the case &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and we divide up &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{U}&lt;/math&gt; into objects that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and those that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that objects with &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; in this case are simply the objects that have &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;, but in general, &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; would include all objects having any value for &lt;math&gt;P_{4}&lt;/math&gt; ''other than'' &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, and there may be several such classes of objects (for example, those having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2,3,4,etc.&lt;/math&gt;).)  In this case, the objects having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2,O_3,O_7,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; while the objects which have &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;\{O_4,O_5,O_6,O_8,O_9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The decision matrix for &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; lists all the differences between the objects having &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; and those having &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;;  that is, the decision matrix lists all the differences between &lt;math&gt;\{O_1,O_2,O_3,O_7,O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{O_4,O_5,O_6,O_8,O_9\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We put the "positive" objects (&lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;) as the rows, and the "negative" objects &lt;math&gt;P_{4} \ne 1&lt;/math&gt; as the columns.

To read this decision matrix, look, for example, at the intersection of row &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; and column &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt;, showing &lt;math&gt;P_1^2,P_3^0&lt;/math&gt; in the cell.  This means that ''with regard to'' decision value &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;, object &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; differs from object &lt;math&gt;O_{6}&lt;/math&gt; on attributes &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;, and the particular values on these attributes for the positive object &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; are &lt;math&gt;P_1=2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3=0&lt;/math&gt;. This tells us that the correct classification of &lt;math&gt;O_{3}&lt;/math&gt; as belonging to decision class &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt; rests on attributes &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt;;  although one or the other might be dispensable, we know that ''at least one'' of these attributes is ''in''dispensable.

Next, from each decision matrix we form a set of [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] expressions, one expression for each row of the matrix. The items within each cell are aggregated disjunctively, and the individuals cells are then aggregated conjunctively. Thus, for the above table we have the following five Boolean expressions:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \\ 
(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \\
(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Each statement here is essentially a highly specific (probably ''too'' specific) rule governing the membership in class &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=1&lt;/math&gt;  of the corresponding object. For example, the last statement, corresponding to object &lt;math&gt;O_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, states that all the following must be satisfied: 
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or  &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or both.
# &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0.
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or  &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or both.
# Either &lt;math&gt;P_1&lt;/math&gt; must have value 2, or &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or &lt;math&gt;P_3&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0, or any combination thereof.
# &lt;math&gt;P_2&lt;/math&gt; must have value 0.

It is clear that there is a large amount of redundancy here, and the next step is to simplify using traditional [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]].  The statement &lt;math&gt;(P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^1 \lor P_2^2)&lt;/math&gt;  corresponding to objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{1},O_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; simplifies to &lt;math&gt;P_1^1  \lor P_2^2&lt;/math&gt;, which yields the implication

:&lt;math&gt;(P_1=1)  \lor (P_2=2) \to (P_{4}=1)&lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the statement &lt;math&gt;(P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_1^2 \lor P_2^0 \lor P_3^0) \land (P_2^0)&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to objects &lt;math&gt;\{O_{3},O_{7},O_{10}\}&lt;/math&gt; simplifies to &lt;math&gt;P_1^2 P_2^0 \lor P_3^0 P_2^0&lt;/math&gt;.  This gives us the implication

:&lt;math&gt;(P_1=2 \land P_2=0) \lor (P_3=0 \land P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1)&lt;/math&gt;

The above implications can also be written as the following rule set:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1=1) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_2=2) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_1=2) \land (P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1) \\
(P_3=0) \land (P_2=0) \to (P_{4}=1) 
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

It can be noted that each of the first two rules has a ''support'' of 1 (i.e., the antecedent matches two objects), while each of the last two rules has a support of 2.  To finish writing the rule set for this knowledge system, the same procedure as above (starting with writing a new decision matrix) should be followed for the case of &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt;, thus yielding a new set of implications for that decision value (i.e., a set of implications with &lt;math&gt;P_{4}=2&lt;/math&gt; as the consequent). In general, the procedure will be repeated for each possible value of the decision variable.

===LERS rule induction system===

The data system LERS (Learning from Examples based on Rough Sets) Grzymala-Busse (1997) may induce rules from inconsistent data, i.e., data with conflicting objects.  Two objects are conflicting when they are characterized by the same values of all attributes, but they belong to different concepts (classes). LERS uses rough set theory to compute lower and upper approximations for concepts involved in conflicts with other concepts.

Rules induced from the lower approximation of the concept ''certainly'' describe the concept, hence such rules are called ''certain''.  On the other hand, rules induced from the upper approximation of the concept describe the concept ''possibly'', so these rules are called ''possible''.  For rule induction LERS uses three algorithms: LEM1, LEM2, and IRIM.

The LEM2 algorithm of LERS is frequently used for rule induction and is used not only in LERS but also in other systems, e.g., in RSES (Bazan et al. (2004).  LEM2 explores the search space of [[attribute-value pair]]s.  Its input data set is a lower or upper approximation of a concept, so its input data set is always consistent.  In general, LEM2 computes a local covering and then converts it into a rule set.  We will quote a few definitions to describe the LEM2 algorithm.

The LEM2 algorithm is based on an idea of an attribute-value pair block.  Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty lower or upper approximation of a concept represented by a decision-value pair &lt;math&gt;(d, w)&lt;/math&gt;.  Set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ''depends'' on a set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of attribute-value pairs &lt;math&gt;t = (a, v)&lt;/math&gt;  if and only if

: &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \neq [T] = \bigcap_{t \in T} [t] \subseteq X.&lt;/math&gt;

Set &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a ''minimal complex'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and no proper subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; exists such that &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; depends on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; be a nonempty collection of nonempty sets of attribute-value pairs.  Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''local covering'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the following three conditions are satisfied:

each member &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal complex of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;,

: &lt;math&gt;
\bigcup_{t \in \mathbb{T}} [T]  = X, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; is minimal, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{T}&lt;/math&gt; has the smallest possible number of members.

For our sample information system, LEM2 will induce the following rules:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{cases}
(P_1, 1) \to (P_4, 1) \\
(P_5, 0) \to (P_4, 1) \\
(P_1, 0) \to (P_4, 2) \\
(P_2, 1) \to (P_4, 2)
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Other rule-learning methods can be found, e.g., in Pawlak (1991), Stefanowski (1998), Bazan et al. (2004), etc.

==Incomplete data==

Rough set theory is useful for rule induction from incomplete data sets. Using this approach we can distinguish between three types of missing attribute values: ''lost values'' (the values that were recorded but currently are unavailable), ''attribute-concept values'' (these missing attribute values may be replaced by any attribute value limited to the same concept), and ''"do not care" conditions''  (the original values were irrelevant).  A  ''concept'' (''class'') is a set of all objects classified (or diagnosed) the same way.

Two special data sets with missing attribute values were extensively studied: in the first case, all missing attribute values were lost (Stefanowski and Tsoukias, 2001), in the second case, all missing attribute values were "do not care" conditions (Kryszkiewicz, 1999).

In attribute-concept values interpretation of a missing attribute value, the missing attribute value may be replaced by any value of the attribute domain restricted to the concept to which the object with a missing attribute value belongs (Grzymala-Busse and Grzymala-Busse, 2007).  For example, if for a patient the value of an attribute Temperature is missing, this patient is sick with flu, and all remaining patients sick with flu have values high or very-high for  Temperature when using the interpretation of the missing attribute value as the  attribute-concept value, we will replace the missing attribute value with  high and very-high.  Additionally, the ''characteristic relation'', (see, e.g., Grzymala-Busse and Grzymala-Busse, 2007) enables to process data sets with all three kind of missing attribute values at the same time: lost, "do not care" conditions, and attribute-concept values.

==Applications==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

Rough set methods can be applied as a component of hybrid solutions in [[machine learning]] and [[data mining]]. They have been found to be particularly useful for [[rule induction]] and [[feature selection]] (semantics-preserving dimensionality reduction). Rough set-based data analysis methods have been successfully applied in bioinformatics, economics and finance, medicine, multimedia, web and text mining, signal and image processing, software engineering, robotics, and engineering (e.g. power systems and control engineering). Recently the three regions of rough sets are interpreted as regions of acceptance, rejection and deferment. This leads to three-way decision making approach with the model which can potentially lead to interesting future applications.

==History==

The idea of rough set was proposed by [[Zdzisław Pawlak|Pawlak]] (1981) as a new mathematical tool to deal with vague concepts. Comer, Grzymala-Busse, Iwinski, Nieminen, Novotny, Pawlak, Obtulowicz, and Pomykala have studied algebraic properties of rough sets. Different algebraic semantics have been developed by P. Pagliani, I. Duntsch, M. K. Chakraborty, M. Banerjee and A. Mani; these have been extended to more generalized rough sets by D. Cattaneo and A. Mani, in particular. Rough sets can be used to represent [[ambiguity]], [[vagueness]] and general [[uncertainty]].

==Extensions and generalizations==

Since the development of rough sets, extensions and generalizations have continued to evolve. Initial developments focused on the relationship - both similarities and difference - with [[fuzzy sets]]. While some literature contends these concepts are different, other literature considers that rough sets are a generalization of fuzzy sets - as represented through either fuzzy rough sets or rough fuzzy sets.  Pawlak (1995) considered that fuzzy and rough sets should be treated as being complementary to each other, addressing different aspects of uncertainty and vagueness.

Three notable extensions of classical rough sets are:
* [[Dominance-based rough set approach]] (DRSA) is an extension of rough set theory for [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] (MCDA), introduced by Greco, Matarazzo and Słowiński (2001). The main change in this extension of classical rough sets is the substitution of the indiscernibility relation by a ''dominance'' relation, which permits the formalism to deal with inconsistencies typical in consideration of criteria  and preference-ordered decision classes.
* [[Decision-theoretic rough sets]] (DTRS) is a probabilistic extension of rough set theory introduced by Yao, Wong, and Lingras (1990).  It utilizes a Bayesian decision procedure for minimum risk decision making.  Elements are included into the lower and upper approximations based on whether their conditional probability is above thresholds &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt;.  These upper and lower thresholds determine region inclusion for elements.  This model is unique and powerful since the thresholds themselves are calculated from a set of six loss functions representing classification risks.
* [[Game-theoretic rough sets]] (GTRS) is a game theory-based extension of rough set that was introduced by Herbert and Yao (2011). It utilizes a game-theoretic environment to optimize certain criteria of rough sets based classification or decision making in order to obtain effective region sizes.

===Rough membership===

Rough sets can be also defined, as a generalisation, by employing a rough membership function instead of objective approximation. The rough membership function expresses a conditional probability that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; given &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R&lt;/math&gt;. This can be interpreted as a degree that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in terms of information about &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; expressed by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \R&lt;/math&gt;.

Rough membership primarily differs from the fuzzy membership in that the membership of union and intersection of sets cannot, in general, be computed from their constituent membership as is the case of fuzzy sets. In this, rough membership is a generalization of fuzzy membership. Furthermore, the rough membership function is grounded more in probability than the conventionally held concepts of the fuzzy membership function.

===Other generalizations===
Several generalizations of rough sets have been introduced, studied and applied to solving problems. Here are some of these generalizations:

*rough multisets (Grzymala-Busse, 1987)
*fuzzy rough sets extend the rough set concept through the use of fuzzy equivalence classes(Nakamura, 1988)
*Alpha rough set theory (α-RST) - a generalization of rough set theory that allows approximation using of fuzzy concepts (Quafafou, 2000)
*intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets (Cornelis, De Cock and Kerre, 2003)
*generalized rough fuzzy sets (Feng, 2010)
*rough intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Thomas and Nair, 2011)
*soft rough fuzzy sets and soft fuzzy rough sets (Meng, Zhang and Qin, 2011)
*composite rough sets (Zhang, Li and Chen, 2014)

'''Steven Todd Kirsch''' (born December 24, 1956) is an American [[serial entrepreneur]] who has started seven companies: [[Mouse Systems]], [[FrameMaker|Frame Technology Corp.]], [[Infoseek]], Propel, Abaca, [[OneID]], and Token. He invented and [[patent|patented]] an early version of the [[optical mouse]]. In 2007, his personal fortune was estimated at $230 million, the majority earned from the IPO of Infoseek and the acquisition of Frame Technology.&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

==Career==

Kirsch has a [[Bachelor of Science]] and a [[Master of Science]] in [[electrical engineering]] and [[computer science]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirschfoundation.org/who/about.html |title=Kirsch Foundation: About The Founders |publisher=Kirschfoundation.org |accessdate= July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steven Kirsch founded [[Mouse Systems Corporation]] in 1982. After he left the company, he co-founded [[FrameMaker|Frame Technology Corp.]] in 1986 to market the FrameMaker publishing software. After Frame was acquired by [[Adobe Systems]] for $500 million, he founded a [[Web portal]] company, [[Infoseek Corporation]], in 1994. After Infoseek was acquired by [[The Walt Disney Company]], he founded [[Propel Software Corporation]] in 1999. 

He set up a $75 million [[charitable fund]] and became an [[philanthropist]]. In 2003, [[Hillary Clinton]] presented Kirsch with a National Caring Award from the Caring Institute in [[Washington DC]]. The award celebrates those special individuals who, in transcending self, devote their lives in service to others, especially the disadvantaged, the poor, the disabled and the dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.caringinstitute.org/CaringAwards.taf?function=detail&amp;id=32800 |title=2003 Adult National Caring Award Winner |date= November 16, 2003 |publisher=Caringinstitute.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he founded Abaca, which made a [[spam filter]] (99.99% accurate according to two reviews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tolly Group Review of Abaca|url=http://www.abaca.com/downloads/Tolly_Abaca%20Email%20Protection%20Gateway.pdf|publisher=Tolly Group|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spam Star|url=http://www.abaca.com/downloads/networkcomputing_aug09.pdf|publisher=Network Computing|accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abaca was acquired by [[Proofpoint, Inc.]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work= Press release |date= July 25, 2013 |title= Proofpoint, Inc. Acquires Abaca Technology Corporation |url= http://investors.proofpoint.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=780479 |accessdate= January 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 11, 2007, Kirsch announced on his personal Web site that he had been diagnosed with [[Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia]], a rare blood cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= The one problem he can’t solve |work= San Francisco Magazine |author= Diana Kapp |date= February 22, 2011 |url= http://www.modernluxury.com/san-francisco/story/the-one-problem-he-cant-solve |accessdate= January 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His cancer was shrinking as a result of treatment using an experimental [[HDAC inhibitor]], [[LBH-589]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Suicidology''' is the scientific study of [[suicidal behaviour]], the causes of suicidalness and [[suicide prevention]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maris, Berman, Silverman|first=Ronald, Alan, Mortan|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Suicidology|year=2000|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=72 Spring Street, New York, NY 10012|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different fields and disciplines involved with suicidology, the two primary ones being psychology and sociology. Every year, about one million people die by suicide, which is a mortality rate of sixteen per 100,000 or one death every forty seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide prevention (SUPRE)|url=http://www.who.int/mental_health/prevention/suicide/suicideprevent/en/|publisher=WHO|accessdate=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide is largely preventable with the right actions, knowledge about suicide, and a change in society's view of suicide to make it more acceptable to talk about suicide.

==Short history==
Most suicidologists think about the history of suicide in terms of courts, church, press, morals, and society. In Ancient Greece, there were several opinions about suicide. It was tolerated and even lauded when committed by patricians (generals and philosophers) but condemned if committed by  [[plebeians]] (common people) or slaves. In Rome, suicide was viewed rather neutrally, even positively because life was held cheaply. During early Christianity, excessive martyrdom and a penchant toward suicide frightened church elders sufficiently for them to introduce a serious deterrent. Suicide was thought of as a crime because it precluded possibility of repentance, and it violated the sixth commandment which is ''Thou shall not kill''. During this time, St. [[Thomas Aquinas]] emphasized that suicide was a mortal sin because it disrupted God's power over man's life and death. However, nowhere in the Judeo-Christian Bible is there a directive forbidding suicide. This belief took hold and for hundreds of years thereafter played an important part in the Western view of suicide. Over the last 200 years, the main focus of suicide has moved from accusations that it is a sin to effort at compassion, understanding, and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shneidman|first=Edwin|title=Comprehending Suicide Landmarks in 20th-Century Suicidology|year=2001|publisher=American Psychological Association|location=750 First Street, NE Washingtion DC 20002|pages=5–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parts of study==
There are many points of study within suicidology. Suicidology studies not only death by suicide and attempted suicide but also partial self-destruction, [[suicidal ideation]], [[parasuicide]], and self-destructive behaviors and attitudes.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt; Suicidal ideation is when someone is having thoughts or showing gestures of suicide. For example, it could be as simple as someone saying that "life is not worth living any more" or it can be extreme as "I'm going to kill myself by jumping off a bridge." Parasuicide is when someone causes deliberate harm to themselves. For example, if someone were to take an overdose of medicine and live. Self-destructive behaviors are anything that cause harm to oneself. This can be intentional or unintentional. Some examples are alcoholism, risky sports, some sexual disorders, and eating disorders.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;   By way of a [[suicide note]] the person who is suiciding has the last word. It is also a way for the person to explain, bring closure (or not), to give guilt, to dictate wishes, to control, to forgive or to blame. Here is a list of the parts that might go into a suicide note.

==Contributors==
One of the first to contribute to the study of suicidology is Edwin S. Shneidman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Shneidman]]&lt;/ref&gt; Edwin Shneidman is considered to be the father of suicidology. Shneidman's definition of suicide is a conscious act of self-induced annihilation, best understood as a multidimensional malaise in a needful individual who defines an issue for which suicide is perceived as the best solution.  He thought of suicide as psychache or intolerable psychological pain. Another notable person in the field of suicidology is [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emile Durkheim]]&lt;/ref&gt;  To Durkheim the word suicide is applied to all cases of death resulting directly or indirectly from a positive or negative act of the victim himself, which he knows will produce this result. Basically he saw suicide as an external and constraining social fact independent of individual psychopathology.  In David J. Mayo's definition there were four elements to suicide. The first element: A suicide has taken place only if a death has occurred. The second element: The death must be of one's own doing. The third element: The agency of suicide can be active or passive and, lastly, it implies intentionally ending one's own life.  [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Karl Menninger]] had similar views on suicide. Their definition of suicide had three different aspects. One was a murder involving hatred or the wish to kill. The second one was a murder by the self often involving guilt or the wish to be killed. The last one is the wish to die. They thought of suicide being a murderous death wish that was turned back upon one's own self. Sigmund Freud also believed that we had two opposing basic instincts—life (eros) and death (thanatos)—and all instincts sought tension reduction. He also believed that suicide is more likely in advanced civilizations requiring greater repression of sexual and aggressive energy. Jean Baechler's definition of suicide was that suicide denotes all behavior that seeks and finds the solution to an existential problem by making an attempt on the life of the subject. Another worker in the field of suicidology was Joseph H. Davis. The definition he gave for suicide was a suicide is a fatal willful self-inflicted life-threatening act without apparent desire to live; implicit are two basic components lethality and intent. [[Albert Camus]] also did some work in this field. He believed that whether one can live or chooses to live is the only truly serious philosophical problem. He also claimed that man created a god in order to be able to live without a wish to kill himself and that the only human liberty is to come to terms with death. He introduced Darwinian thought into his teachings.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Suicide myths==
Here is a list of suicide myths and the truth behind these myths.&lt;ref name="Providing Access to Help 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Providing Access to Help|title=PATH Training Manual|year=2011|publisher=PATH|location=Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
! Myths !! Truths
|-
| People who die by suicide always leave notes. || Most people don't leave notes. Only a small percentage leave any type of explanations about why they've chosen to kill themselves.
|-
| People who die by suicide don't warn others. || Out of ten people who kill themselves, eight have given definite clues to their intentions. They leave numerous clues and warnings to others, although some of their clues may be non-verbal or difficult to detect.
|-
| People who talk about suicide are only trying to get attention. || Few die by suicide without first letting someone else know how they feel. People thinking about suicide give clues and warnings as cries for help. Over 70% who do threaten to kill themselves either make an attempt or die by suicide. 
|-
| Once someone has already decided to die by suicide, nothing is going to stop them. || Most of the time suicidal people are ambivalent about suicide. Most individuals don't want to die; they just want the pain they are feeling to stop. 
|-
| Once the emotional state improves, the risk of suicide is over. || The highest rates of suicide occur within about three months of an apparent improvement in a severely depressed state. Energy level is the important factor in someone who's improving having the energy to act on a suicidal impulse, if they perceive a stumbling block to recovery. 
|-
| After a person has attempted suicide, it is unlikely they will try again. || People who have attempted suicide are very likely to try again. 80% of people who die by suicide have made at least one previous attempt. 
|-
| Don't mention suicide to someone who's showing signs of severe depression; it will plant the idea in their mind and they will act on it. || Many depressed people have already considered suicide as an option. Talking about suicide generally provides a sense of relief and understanding to the person. Talking about suicide is one of the most helpful things you can do. 
|-
| A non-fatal attempt means that the person wasn't serious about ending their life. || Some people are naive about how to kill themselves. The attempt in and of itself is the most important factor, not the method.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4885">In [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], the '''Thurstone scale''' was the first formal technique to measure an [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]. It was developed by [[Louis Leon Thurstone]] in 1928, as a means of measuring attitudes towards [[religion]]. It is made up of statements about a particular issue, and each statement has a numerical value indicating how favorable or unfavorable it is judged to be. People check each of the statements to which they agree, and a [[mean]] score is computed, indicating their attitude.

==Thurstone scale==
Thurstone's method of pair comparisons can be considered a prototype of a [[normal distribution]]-based method for scaling-dominance matrices. Even though the theory behind this method is quite complex (Thurstone, 1927a), the algorithm itself is straightforward. For the basic Case V, the frequency dominance matrix is translated into proportions and interfaced with the standard scores. The scale is then obtained as a left-adjusted column marginal average of this standard score matrix (Thurstone, 1927b). The underlying rationale for the method and basis for the measurement of the "psychological scale separation between any two stimuli" derives from Thurstone's [[Law of comparative judgment]] (Thurstone, 1928).

The principal difficulty with this algorithm is its indeterminacy with respect to one-zero proportions, which return z values as plus or minus infinity, respectively. The inability of the pair comparisons algorithm to handle these cases imposes considerable limits on the applicability of the method.

The most frequent recourse when the 1.00-0.00 frequencies are encountered is their omission. Thus, e.g., Guilford (1954, p.&amp;nbsp;163) has recommended not using proportions more extreme than .977 or .023, and Edwards (1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;41–42) has suggested that '' “if the number of judges is large, say 200 or more, then we might use pij values of .99 and .01, but with less than 200 judges, it is probably better to disregard all comparative judgments for which pij is greater than .98 or less than .02."’ '' Since the omission of such extreme values leaves empty cells in the Z matrix, the averaging procedure for arriving at the scale values cannot be applied, and an elaborate procedure for the estimation of unknown parameters is usually employed (Edwards, 1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;42–46). An alternative solution of this problem was suggested by Krus and Kennedy (1977).

With later developments in psychometric theory, it has become possible to employ direct methods of scaling such as application of the [[Rasch model]] or unfolding models such as the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (HCM) (Andrich &amp; Luo, 1993).  The Rasch model has a close conceptual relationship to Thurstone's law of comparative judgment (Andrich, 1978), the principal difference being that it directly incorporates a person parameter.  Also, the Rasch model takes the form of a logistic function rather than a cumulative normal function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4685">A '''Virtual Season''' or '''Virtual Series''' is a [[fan_fiction|fan-driven]] continuation of a television program.  While they are typically written for [[Cancellation_(television)|cancelled programs]], they sometimes run concurrently with programs that are still airing original episodes.  Virtual Seasons can be written by a single author, by several collaborating authors in a [[fandom]], or even reproduced episodically in a single video or series of videos. These series can be written in [[screenplay]] or [[prose]] format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fanlore.org/wiki/Virtual_Season "Virtual Season"], [[Fanlore]] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Continuation "Continuation Fic"], ''TV Tropes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScriptFic "Script Fic"], ''TV Tropes''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:wallace tree 8x8.svg|thumb | Example of reduction on an 8x8 multiplier.]]

A '''Wallace tree''' is an [[Computational complexity theory|efficient]] [[Computer hardware|hardware]] implementation of a digital circuit that multiplies two integers, devised by Australian Computer Scientist [[Chris Wallace (computer scientist)|Chris Wallace]] in 1964.&lt;ref name="Wallace_1964"/&gt;

The Wallace tree has three steps:
# Multiply (that is – AND) each bit of one of the arguments, by each bit of the other, yielding &lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; results. Depending on position of the multiplied bits, the wires carry different weights, for example wire of bit carrying result of &lt;math&gt;a_4 b_3&lt;/math&gt; is 128 (see explanation of weights below).
# Reduce the number of partial products to two by layers of full and half adders.
# Group the wires in two numbers, and add them with a conventional [[adder (electronics)|adder]].&lt;ref name="Bohsali_2010"/&gt;

The second step works as follows.  As long as there are three or more wires with the same weight add a following layer:-
* Take any three wires with the same weights and input them into a [[full adder]]. The result will be an output wire of the same weight and an output wire with a higher weight for each three input wires.
* If there are two wires of the same weight left, input them into a [[half adder]].
* If there is just one wire left, connect it to the next layer.

The benefit of the Wallace tree is that there are only &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; reduction layers, and each layer has &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; propagation delay. As making the partial products is &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; and the final addition is &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;, the multiplication is only &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt;, not much slower than addition (however, much more expensive in the gate count). Naively adding partial products with regular adders would require &lt;math&gt;O(\log^2n)&lt;/math&gt; time. From a [[computational complexity theory|complexity theoretic]] perspective, the Wallace tree algorithm puts multiplication in the class [[NC (complexity)|NC&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;]].

These computations only consider [[gate delay]]s and don't deal with wire delays, which can also be very substantial.

The Wallace tree can be also represented by a tree of 3/2 or 4/2 adders.

It is sometimes combined with [[Booth encoding]].&lt;ref name="tufts_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weems_2001"/&gt;

==Weights explained==
The weight of a wire is the [[radix]] (to base 2) of the digit that the wire carries. In general, &lt;math&gt;a_nb_m&lt;/math&gt; &amp;ndash; have indexes of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;; and since &lt;math&gt;2^n 2^m = 2^{n + m}&lt;/math&gt; the weight of &lt;math&gt;a_n b_m&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2^{n + m}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
&lt;math&gt;n=4&lt;/math&gt;, multiplying &lt;math&gt;a_3a_2a_1a_0&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;b_3b_2b_1b_0&lt;/math&gt;:

# First we multiply every bit by every bit:
#* weight 1 – &lt;math&gt;a_0b_0&lt;/math&gt;
#* weight 2 – &lt;math&gt;a_0b_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_1b_0&lt;/math&gt;
#* weight 4 – &lt;math&gt;a_0b_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_1b_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2b_0&lt;/math&gt;
#* weight 8 – &lt;math&gt;a_0b_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_1b_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2b_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_3b_0&lt;/math&gt;
#* weight 16 – &lt;math&gt;a_1b_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_2b_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_3b_1&lt;/math&gt;
#* weight 32 – &lt;math&gt;a_2b_3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a_3b_2&lt;/math&gt;
#* weight 64 – &lt;math&gt;a_3b_3&lt;/math&gt;

'''Wireless Engineering''' is the branch of [[engineering]] which addresses the design, application, and research of wireless communication systems and technologies.

==Overview==
Wireless engineering is an engineering subject dealing with engineering problems using wireless technology such as radio communications and radar, but it is more general than the conventional radio engineering. It may include using other techniques such as acoustic, infrared, and optical technologies.

==History==
Wireless technologies have skyrocketed since their late 19th Century advancements. With the invention of the [[FM Radio]] in 1935, wireless communications have become a concentrated focus of both private and government sectors.

===In Education===
[[Auburn University]]'s Samuel Ginn College of Engineering was the first in the [[United States]] to offer a formalized undergraduate degree in such a field. The program was initiated by Samuel Ginn, an Auburn Alumni, in 2001.&lt;ref name="Auburn University"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auburn University's college of engineering divides their wireless engineering program into two areas of applicable study:  electrical engineering (pertaining to circuit design, [[digital signal processing]], [[electromagnetism|antenna design]], etc.), and software-oriented wireless engineering (communications networks, mobile platform applications, systems software, etc.)&lt;ref name="Auburn University 2"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macquarie University]] in [[Sydney]], was the first University to offer Wireless Engineering in [[Australia]]. The university works closely with nearby industries in research and teaching development in wireless engineering.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research.mq.edu.au/excellence/wireless_communications,&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka]] in [[Malacca]], was the first University to offer Wireless Communication Engineering in [[Malaysia]].

==Applications==
Wireless engineering contains a wide spectrum of application, most notably [[cellular networks]]. The recent popularity of cellular networks has created a vast career demand with a large repository. The popularity has also sparked many wireless innovations, such as increased network capacity, [[3G]], cryptology and network security technologies.

'''World Book Day''' is a charity event held annually in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] on the first Thursday in March. It is the local manifestation of ''[[World Book and Copyright Day]]'' (also known as ''International Day of the Book'' or ''World Book Days'') organized by [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|UNESCO]] to promote [[reading (activity)|reading]], [[publishing]] and [[copyright]]. On World Book Day, every child in full-time education in the UK is given a voucher to be spent on books.

The Day was first celebrated in 1995 in the United Kingdom. The original, global [[World Book Day]] event is generally observed on 23 April - it was changed in the UK to avoid clashes with Easter school holidays and with [[St George's Day]]. Conversely, a separate event [http://www.worldbooknight.org/ World Book Night] organized by independent charity [[The Reading Agency]] is held on 23 April.

==History==
The United Kingdom's own version of World Book Day began in 1998, launched by [[British Prime Minister|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] at the [[Globe Theatre]] in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Several million schoolchildren in the UK were given a special £1 World Book Day Book Token (€1.50 in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) which could be redeemed against any book in any UK bookshop. A specially created WBD anthology priced at £1 (€1.50 in Ireland) was also published. All World Book Day [[point of sale]] and the £1 book carried the special World Book Day logo to help unify the initiative through all outlets.

Since then, World Book Day UK has followed a similar pattern, gradually growing each year to encompass more initiatives, such as ''Spread The Word'', ''[[Quick Reads Initiative]]'' and ''Books for Hospitals''. Every year, the number of children receiving a World Book Day Book Token has increased.

In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 [[List of World Book Day Books|books]] were published, covering a wider age-range.  Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

In 2006, World Book Day began its support of and association with the ''Quick Reads''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literacytrust.org.uk/vitallink/Quickreads.html#background Quick Reads website]&lt;/ref&gt; initiative for adult emergent readers.

In 2007, World Book Day celebrated its 10th anniversary with the publication of 10 £1 books. Since then every child in full-time education in the UK and Ireland is entitled to receive a £1 World Book day Book token every year. They can swap their WBD token for one of specially-produced [[List of World Book Day Books|£1 WBD books]] or they can get £1 off a full-price book or audio book priced £2.99 or more.

==Administration==
World Book Day is a registered [[Charitable organization|charity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=1079257  Charity Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; It does not raise funds for itself but does support [http://www.bookaid.org Book Aid International]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookaid.org/cms.cgi/site/  Book Aid International website]&lt;/ref&gt; and Readathon as its nominated charities, encouraging schools to hold special fundraising events for children less fortunate than themselves. World Book Day is not funded by the British Government although the Quick Reads element does receive support from ACE, DIUS and NIACE. The funding for World Book Day activities comes principally from the major sponsor, National Book Tokens&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/index.asp?m=32&amp;c=1157  National Book Tokens website]&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK book trade (publishers and booksellers).
