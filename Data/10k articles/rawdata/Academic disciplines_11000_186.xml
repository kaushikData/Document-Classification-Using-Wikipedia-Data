An '''[[actin]] nucleation core''' is a [[protein trimer]] with three actin [[monomer]]s.  It is called a nucleation core because it leads to the energetically favorable elongation reaction once a [[tetramer]] is formed from a trimer.  Actin [[protein dimer]]s and trimers are energetically unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1074/jbc.M112.406744|pmid=23148219|pmc = 3537046|year=2013|last1=Liu|first1=S.

[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]]
An '''archivist''' (''AR-kiv-ist'') is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to [[Document|record]]s and [[archive]]s determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==
As [[Richard Pearce-Moses]] wrote:

:"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-to-do-it Manual|last=Hunter|first=Gregory|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.|others=|year=2003|isbn=|editor=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archive]]s practices is called [[archival science]].

The most common related occupations are [[librarian]]s, [[Curator|museum curators]], and [[records manager]]s. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate [[Professional association|professional organization]]s. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the [[metadata]], such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on [[provenance]]).

In addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the [[Curator|museum curator]] than with the librarian.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of [[records manager]], although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

==Duties and work environment==
Archivists' duties include acquiring and [[archival appraisal|appraising]] new collections, [[manuscript processing|arranging and describing records]], providing reference service, and preserving materials.  In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: [[provenance]] and [[original order]].  Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, [[finding aid]]s need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Kathleen D.|title=Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://saa.archivists.org/store/understanding-archives-and-manuscripts-afs-ii/339/|title=Understanding Archives and Manuscripts|last=O'Toole|first=James M. and Richard J. Cox|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=|editor=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists' work encompasses a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a [[Primary sources|primary source]] of knowledge, and influence [[collective memory]] and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Elena S. (2010). ''The Ethical Archivist''. Chicago: The Society of American Archivists. p. 22-26, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson (2010), chapter 1, "Codes of Ethics," p. 21-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of American Archivists first adopted a [https://www2.archivists.org/groups/committee-on-ethics-and-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-history code of ethics] in 1980;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Horn, David E (1989). "[http://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.52.1.nk661527341j0610 The Development of Ethics in Archival Practice]." ''The American Archivist'', 2(1), p. 64-71. It was based on an earlier statement produced in training programs at the National Archives, under Archivist of the United States [[Wayne C. Grover]], and published as "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015071393535;view=image;page=root;size=100;seq=713;num=307 The Archivist's Code]" (''American Archivist'', vol. 18, no. 4, p. 307-308).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Council on Archives]] adopted one in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 ICA Code of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929074919/http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 |date=29 September 2015 }}." International Council on Archives. Retrieved 2015-09-01. The ICA code is available in 23 languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as [[Manuscript processing|processing archivist]] and [[Reference interview|reference archivist]]) may be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Frances|date=|year=2000|title=Reference Service in an Academic Archives|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/science/article/pii/S0099133399001470|journal=The [[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/S0099-1333(99)00147-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including [[government agency|government agencies]], [[local authorities]], museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, [[colleges]] and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, [[genealogist]]s, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an [[individual]].

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or [[outreach]] programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]], [[Advertising campaign|promotional]] events, or even media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/guidelines/cu_guidelines4.asp|title=Guidelines for College and University Archives, Section IV. Core Archival Functions, Subsection D. Service |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Encoded Archival Description]], along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade.  Many archivists are now acquiring basic [[XML]] skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml|title=Encoded Archival Description |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Archives Hub| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125702/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Between_the_Forks_Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|An Archivist and volunteer worker with an exhibit on local history.  Project management, preservation of historic materials, and research skills are just a few of the abilities required in an archivist's background to make such public education efforts effective and exciting. {{speedy-image-c|22 April 2007}}]] --&gt;

Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of [[skills]]:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|conservation]] is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mary Lynn | last=Ritzenthaler | year=1993 | title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=Society of American Archivists | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the [[digital preservation|preservation]] of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/accredited-courses|title=Accredited courses|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first University to offer archival training was the [[University of New South Wales]], starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

Courses are now offered at [[Curtin University]] in [[Western Australia]], [[Charles Sturt University]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[University of South Australia]] at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at [[Edith Cowan University]] is being phased out.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via [[Open University Australia]] and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1970-1979/L6546.htm|title=L6546|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the [[Federal University of Santa Catarina]] (UFSC), the [[Federal University of Santa Maria]] (UFSM) and the [[São Paulo State University]] (UNESP) offer the degree in [[archival science]].

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the [[Universidad de La Salle]] offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.

Other institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:
* [[Universidad del Quindío]] – Professional degree: Professional in Information and Documentation, Library and Archival Sciences.
* [[Universidad de Antioquia, Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Archival Science.
* [[Universidad Católica de Manizales]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.
* [[Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] – SENA – in chain training with the [[Antioquia Institute of Technology|Tecnológico de Antioquia]] Tecnológico de Antioquia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042453/http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Technical degree: Professional Technical in Archives, Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the ''[[École des chartes]]'', founded in 1821. This prestigious ''[[grande école]]'' (literally, "grand schools) offers a diploma in "Archivist-Paleography" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the ''[[Institut national du patrimoine]]''. Most positions are reserved for European citizens.

Some universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: [[University of Angers|Angers]], [[University of Caen|Caen]], [[University of Dijon|Dijon]], [[Charles de Gaulle University - Lille III|Lille III]], [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], [[Upper Alsace University|Mulhouse]], [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University|Versailles Saint-Quentin]],

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the [[University College Dublin School of History and Archives]] offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.

===New Zealand===
[[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only tertiary institution in [[New Zealand]] provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]]. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary [[work experience]] before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in [[archival science]], [[public history]], history, [[library science]], or [[library and information science]]. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakel and Bastian |first=Elizabeth and Jeannette |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Archival Graduate Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=349–366 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/YakelBastian-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Society of American Archivists]] published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1 |title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=30 March 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics |accessdate=2015-09-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url=http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

The [[Academy of Certified Archivists]] offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Certified Archivists|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317200502/http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/| archivedate= 17 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/presidents-address-2/|title=2016 President’s Address {{!}} Welcome to the Academy of Certified Archivists|last=Jones|first=Louis|date=|website=www.certifiedarchivists.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]], the [[Archives and Records Association]] (UK/Ireland), the [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]], and the [[Australian Society of Archivists]], as well as any number of local or regional associations.  These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners.   In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of [[media preservation]] and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmelman |first=Nancy |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Continuing Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=367–395 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Zimmelman-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest predecessors of archival science - Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management, printed in 1571, translated by JBLD Strömberg. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm, Lundaboken, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Baldassare Bonifacio's ''De Archivis libris singularis'' of 1632.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sandri, 'Il "De Archivis" di Baldassare Bonifacio', ''Notizie delle Archive di Stato'', Roma, 1950, p. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled ''Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques'' (''Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives''), in which he systematized the archival theory of the ''[[respect des fonds]]'', first published by [[Natalis de Wailly]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hildesheimer, "Les Premières publications des Archives", ''Histoires de France, historiens de la France'', Paris, 1994, p. 280-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the ''Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven'' (''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives''). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving [[provenance]] and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name=Cook1997&gt;{{Citation

The next major text was the ''Manual of Archive Administration'' published in 1922 by [[Hilary Jenkinson]], then employed at the British [[Public Record Office]]: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.

In 1956, [[T. R. Schellenberg]], who is known as the "Father of American Archival Appraisal",&lt;ref name=Cook1997/&gt; published ''Modern Archives''. Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern [[Records Management]] as a separate but related discipline was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Theodore R. | last=Schellenberg | year=1956 | title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Ernst Posner]] published ''Archives in the Ancient World''.  Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.

In 1975, essays by [[Margaret C. Norton|Margaret Cross Norton]] were collected under the title of ''Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management''. Norton was one of the founders of the [[Society of American Archivists]], and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the [[Illinois]] State Archives.

==Archives 2.0==

Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as blogs, [[wiki]]s, as well as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open source]] philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theimer|first=Kate|date=2011|title=What is the Meaning of Archives 2.0?|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.1.h7tn4m4027407666|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* "Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not 'unmeasurable' results;
* Iterative products, not 'perfect' products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; community use, or research and reference help.

The '''Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research''' ('''ARI''') is the [[biodiversity]] [[scientific research|research]] organisation for the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|government]] of [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  It provides advice on ecologically sustainable land and water management issues and with regard to threatened native flora and fauna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenari.nsf/childdocs/-4FD1424937BDBBBE4A256A4000270FFA?open DSE: About the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730235349/http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenari.nsf/childdocs/-4FD1424937BDBBBE4A256A4000270FFA?open |date=30 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after [[Arthur Rylah|Sir Arthur Rylah]], a long-serving Victorian [[politics|politician]] and deputy state premier between 1955 and 1971. 

==History==

Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research (ARI) was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth on 8 April 1970 as part of the Fisheries and Wildlife Division.  The foundation Director was Alfred Dunbavin Butcher who also had an association with Melbourne Zoo and Healesville Sanctuary.  He had a keen interest in art and this attracted a large collection of wildlife art and the commissioning of a large mural at the institute.  
The institute was subsequently incorporated into various Victorian Government Departments since then including the Ministry for Conservation, the Department of Conservation Forests and Lands, the Department of Sustainability and Environment; and is currently (2017) within the Department of Environment Land Water and Planning.

==Publications==
There have been many published reports, journal articles, book sections, books, theses and conference proceedings from the ARI releasing information about scientific research on plants and animals.

The '''''Australasian Virtual Herbarium''''' ('''AVH''') is an online resource&lt;ref name="AVH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Australasian Virtual Herbarium|url=http://avh.chah.org.au/|website=AVH|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allows access to plant specimen data held by various Australian and New Zealand herbaria.&lt;ref name="AVH" /&gt;&lt;ref name=anbg/&gt;  It is part of the [[Atlas of Living Australia]] (ALA),&lt;ref name=blog2/&gt; and was formed by the amalgamation of '''''Australia's Virtual Herbarium'''''  and '''''NZ Virtual Herbarium'''''.&lt;ref name=NZVH/&gt;  As of 12 August 2014, more than five million specimens of the 8 million and upwards specimens available from participating institutions have been databased.&lt;ref name="AVH2" /&gt;

==Uses==
This resource is used by academics, students, and anyone interested in research in botany in Australia or New Zealand, since each record tells all that is known about the specimen: where and when it was collected; by whom; its current identification; and information on habitat and associated species.&lt;ref name=AVH/&gt;  [[Atlas of Living Australia|ALA]] post processes the original herbarium data, giving further fields with respect to taxonomy and quality of the data.&lt;ref name="ala"/&gt; All records are downloadable in their entirety, by anyone.&lt;ref name=AVHblog3/&gt; Examples of use of these records may be found in 
* journal articles on: e.g.,  sea warming;&lt;ref name=seaweed/&gt; marine biogeography;&lt;ref name=geog/&gt;  acacias;&lt;ref name=acacia/&gt;  weeds;&lt;ref name=Beaumont/&gt;&lt;ref name="DoddBurgman2015"/&gt; determining phytogeographical regions via species composition;&lt;ref name=Joger/&gt;; developing biodiverse plantings suitable for changing climatic conditions;&lt;ref name=Booth/&gt; phylogenetics and conservation;&lt;ref name="PollockRosauer2015"/&gt; and statistical issues arising when using herbaria data&lt;ref name="HyndmanMesgaran2015"/&gt; 
* some wikipedia range maps for, e.g., ''[[Tribonanthes violacea]]'', ''[[Blancoa canescens]]'' and ''[[Haemodorum coccineum]]''.

A [[google scholar]] search, using the phrase ''Australia's Virtual Herbarium'', shows that well over 200 articles (as of 3 May 2018) have been published using data from this resource.&lt;ref name=google1/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}}
'''Cell counting''' is any of various methods for the [[counting]] or similar [[quantification (science)|quantification]] of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in the [[life sciences]], including [[medicine|medical diagnosis and treatment]]. It is an important subset of [[cytometry]], with applications in [[research]] and clinical practice. For example, the [[complete blood count]] can help a [[physician]] to determine why a patient feels unwell and what to do to help. Cell counts within [[liquid]] media (such as [[blood]], [[blood plasma|plasma]], [[lymph]], or laboratory [[wikt:rinsate#Noun|rinsate]]) are usually expressed as a number of cells per unit of [[volume]], thus expressing a [[concentration]] (for example, 5,000 cells per milliliter).

== Uses ==

Numerous procedures in biology and medicine require the counting of cells. By the counting of cells in a known small [[volume]], the concentration can be mediated. Examples of the need for cell counting include:

* In medicine, the concentration of various [[blood cells]], such as [[red blood cells]] and [[white blood cells]], can give crucial information regarding the health situation of a person (see: [[complete blood count]]).
* In [[cell therapy]], to control the dose of cells [[route of administration#Injection|administered]] to a patient.
* Similarly, the concentration of [[bacteria]], [[viruses]] and other [[pathogen]]s in the [[blood]] or in other [[bodily fluid]]s can reveal information about the progress of an [[infectious disease]] and about the degree of success with which the [[immune system]] is dealing with the [[infection]].
* The cell concentration needs to be known for many [[experiment]]s in molecular biology, in order to adjust accordingly the amount of [[reagent]]s and chemicals that are to be applied in the experiment.
* Studies that examine the [[Population growth rate|growth rate]] of [[microorganism]]s (in other words: how fast they [[Cell division|divide]] to create new cells) require cell counting.
* Measurements of cell viability, i.e. measuring and calculating the fraction of dead and live cells, for example of cells exposed to poison.

== Manual Cell Counting ==

There are several methods for cell counting. Some are primitive and do not require special equipment, thus can be done in any biological [[laboratory]], whereas others rely on sophisticated electronic appliances.

=== Counting chamber ===
{{Main article|Hemocytometer}}
[[Image:Hemocytometer.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A counting chamber]]

A [[counting chamber]],(also known as hemocytometer), is a [[microscope slide]] that is especially designed to enable cell counting. The hemocytometer has two gridded chambers in its middle, which are covered with a special glass slide when counting. A drop of [[cell culture]] is placed in the space between the chamber and the glass cover, filling it by capillarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hemocytometer.org/hemocytometer-protocol/|title=Hemocytometer protocol|date=2013-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at the sample under the [[microscope]], the researcher uses the grid to manually count the number of cells in a certain area of known size. The separating distance between the chamber and the cover is predefined, thus the volume of the counted culture can be calculated and with it the concentration of cells. [[Vital stain|Cell viability]] can also be determined if viability dyes are added to the fluid.

Their advantage is being cheap and fast; this makes them the preferred counting method in fast biological experiments in which it needs to be merely determined whether a cell culture has grown as expected. Usually the culture examined needs to be diluted, otherwise the high density of cells would make counting impossible. The need for dilution is a disadvantage, as every dilution adds inaccuracy to the measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celeromics.com/en/resources/docs/Articles/Cell-counting-Neubauer-chamber.php|title=Basic Hemocytometer usage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plating and CFU counting ===

{{Main article|Colony-forming unit}}
[[File:S.aureusAgar.jpg|thumb|A picture of Staphylococcus aureus colonies growing on an agar plate (transmitted light). Such homogeneously spread colonies are suitable for CFU enumeration.]]

To quantify the number of cells in a culture, the cells can be simply plated on a [[petri dish]] with [[growth medium]]. If the cells are efficiently distributed on the plate, it can be generally assumed that each cell will give rise to a single [[Colony (biology)|colony]] or [[Colony-forming unit|Colony Forming Unit (CFU)]]. The colonies can then be counted, and based on the known volume of culture that was spread on the plate, the cell concentration can be calculated.

As is with counting chambers, cultures usually need to be heavily diluted prior to plating; otherwise, instead of obtaining single colonies that can be counted, a so-called "lawn" will form: thousands of colonies lying over each other. Additionally, plating is the slowest method of all: most microorganisms need at least 12 hours to form visible colonies.

Although this method can be time consuming, it gives an accurate estimate of the number of viable cells (because only they will be able to grow and form visible colonies). It is therefore extensively used in experiments aiming to quantify the number of cells resisting drugs or other external conditions (for instance the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]] or the [[gentamicin protection assay]]). In addition, the enumeration of colonies on agar plates can be greatly facilitated by using [[colony counter]]s.

== Automated Cell Counting ==

=== Electrical resistance ===
[[Image:Coultercounter.jpg|thumb|70px|right|The electrode of a Coulter counter]]

A [[Coulter counter]] is an appliance that can count cells as well as measure their volume. It is based on the fact that cells show great [[electrical resistance]]; in other words, they conduct almost no [[electricity]]. In a Coulter counter the cells, swimming in a solution that conducts electricity, are sucked one by one into a tiny gap. Flanking the gap are two [[electrode]]s that conduct electricity. When no cell is in the gap, electricity flows unabated, but when a cell is sucked into the gap the current is resisted. The Coulter counter counts the number of such events and also measures the [[Current (electricity)|current]] (and hence the resistance), which directly correlates to the volume of the cell trapped. A similar system is the [[CASY cell counting technology]].

Coulter and CASY counters are much cheaper than flow cytometers, and for applications that require cell numbers and sizes, such as [[cell-cycle]] research, they are the method of choice. Its advantage over the methods above is the large number of cells that can be processed in a short time, namely: thousands of cells per second. This offers great accuracy and [[statistical significance]].

=== Flow cytometry ===

[[Flow cytometry]] is by far the most sophisticated and expensive method for cell counting. In a flow cytometer the cells flow in a narrow stream in front of a [[laser]] beam. The beam hits them one by one, and a light detector picks up the light that is reflected from the cells.

Flow cytometers have many other abilities, such as analyzing the shape of cells and their internal and external structures, as well as measuring the amount of specific [[protein]]s and other [[biochemical]]s in the cells. Therefore, flow cytometers are rarely purchased for the sole purpose of counting cells.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

=== Image analysis  ===

Recent approaches consider the use of high-quality microscopy images over which a [[statistical classification]] algorithm is used to perform automated cell detection and counting as an [[image analysis]] task.&lt;ref name="han12cell"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Han, J.W. |author2=Breckon, T.P. |author3=Randell, D.A. |author4=Landini, G. | title=The Application of Support Vector Machine Classification to Detect Cell Nuclei for Automated Microscopy| journal=Machine Vision and Applications| year=2012| volume=23| number=1| pages=15–24| doi=10.1007/s00138-010-0275-y| url=http://www.durham.ac.uk/toby.breckon/publications/papers/han12cell.pdf| accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally performs with a constant error rate as an off-line (batch) type process. A range of [[image classification]] techniques can be employed for this purpose.&lt;ref name="han08cell"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Han, J.W. |author2=Breckon, T.P. |author3=Randell, D.A. |author4=Landini, G. | chapter=Radicular cysts and odontogenic keratocysts epithelia classification using cascaded Haar classifiers| title=Proc. 12th Annual Conference on Medical Image Understanding and Analysis|date=July 2008| pages=54–58| chapter-url=http://www.durham.ac.uk/toby.breckon/publications/papers/han08cell.pdf| accessdate=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stereologic cell counting ===
At present, stereologic cell counting with manual decision for object inclusion according to unbiased stereologic counting rules remains the only adequate method for unbiased cell quantification in histologic tissue sections, thus it's not adequate enough to be fully automated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Current automated 3D cell detection methods are not a suitable replacement for manual stereologic cell counting|journal = Frontiers in Neuroanatomy|volume = 8|pages = 27|last=Schmitz et al.|date=7 May 2014|doi=10.3389/fnana.2014.00027|pmid = 24847213|pmc = 4019880}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indirect Cell Counting ==

=== Spectrophotometry ===

[[Image:Spektrofotometri.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A spectrophotometer]]

Cell suspensions are [[turbid]]. Cells [[Absorbance|absorb]] and scatter the light. The higher the cell concentration, the higher the turbidity. [[Spectrophotometry|Spectrophotometer]]s can measure intensity of light very accurately. The cell culture is placed in a transparent [[cuvette]] and the absorption is measured relative to medium alone. Optical density (OD) is directly proportional to the biomass in the cell suspension in a given range that is specific to the cell type. Using spectrophotometry for measuring the turbidity of cultures is known as [[turbidometry]].

This has made spectrophotometry the methods of choice for measurements of bacterial growth and related applications. Spectrophotometry's drawback is its inability to provide an absolute count or distinguish between living and dead cells.

=== Impedance microbiology ===

[[Impedance microbiology]] is a rapid [[Microbiology|microbiological technique]] used to measure the microbial concentration (mainly [[bacteria]] but also [[yeasts]]) of a sample by monitoring the electrical parameters of the growth medium. It is based on the fact that bacteria [[metabolism]] transforms uncharged (or weakly charged) compounds into highly charged compounds thus changing the [[growth medium]] electrical properties. The microbial concentration is estimated on the time required for the monitored electrical parameters to deviate from the initial baseline value.
Different instruments (either built in a laboratory or commercially available) to measure the bacterial concentration using Impedance Microbiology are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Priego|first1=R.|last2=Medina|first2=L.M.|last3=Jordano|first3=R.|title=Bactometer system versus traditional methods for monitoring bacteria populations in salchichón during its ripening process|journal=Journal of Food Protection|date=2011|volume=74|issue=1|pages=145–148|doi=10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-244|pmid=21219778}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RABIT instrument|url=http://www.dwscientific.co.uk/rabit/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bac Trac instrument|url=http://microbiology.sylab.com/products/p/show/Product/product/bactrac-4300.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossi|first1=M.|last2=Lanzoni|first2=M.|last3=Pompei|first3=A.|last4=Lazzarini|first4=R.|last5=Matteuzzi|first5=D.|last6=Riccò|first6=B.|title=An embedded portable biosensor system for bacterial concentration detection|journal=Biosensors &amp; Bioelectronics|date=2010|volume=26|issue=3|pages=983–990|doi=10.1016/j.bios.2010.08.039|pmid=20833014|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01276579|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grossi|first1=M.|last2=Lazzarini|first2=R.|last3=Lanzoni|first3=M.|last4=Pompei|first4=A.|last5=Matteuzzi|first5=D.|last6=Riccò|first6=B.|title=A portable sensor with disposable electrodes for water bacterial quality assessment|journal=IEEE Sensors Journal|date=2013|volume=13|issue=5|pages=1775–1781|doi=10.1109/JSEN.2013.2243142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Content Threat Removal''' ('''CTR''') is a [[computer security|cyber security]] technology that defeats the threat posed by handling digital content in cyber space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|date=September 2017|publisher=Elsevier|journal=Computer Fraud and Security|title=Content security through transformation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other defences, including [[anti-virus|antivirus software]] and [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxed execution]], it does not rely on being able to detect threats. Similarly to [[Content Disarm &amp; Reconstruction|Content Disarm and Reconstruction]], CTR removes the threat without knowing whether it has done so, and acts without knowing if data contains a threat or not.

Detection strategies work by detecting unsafe content, and then blocking or removing that content. Content that is deemed safe is delivered to its destination. In contrast, Content Threat Removal assumes all data is hostile and delivers none of it to the destination, regardless of whether it is actually hostile. Although no data is delivered, the business information carried by the data is delivered, but using new data created for the purpose.

== Threat ==
Advanced attacks continuously defeat defences that are based on detection. These are often referred to as [[Zero-day (computing)|zero day]] attacks, because as soon as they are discovered attack detection mechanisms must be updated to identify and neutralise the attack, and until they are, all systems are unprotected. These attacks succeed because attackers are skilled in finding new ways of [[Evasion (network security)|evading detection]]. [[Polymorphic code]] can be used to evade the detection of known unsafe data and sandbox detection allows attacks to evade dynamic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/forensics/detecting-malware-sandbox-evasion-techniques-36667|title=Detecting Malware and Sandbox Evasion Techniques|first1=Dilshan|last1=Keragala|date=January 2016|publisher=SANS Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

A Content Threat Removal defence works by intercepting data on its way to its destination. The business information carried by the data is extracted and the data is discarded. Then entirely new, clean and safe data is built to carry the information to its destination.

The effect of building new data to carry the business information is that any unsafe elements of the original data are left behind and discarded. This includes executable data, macros, scripts and malformed data that triggers vulnerabilities in applications.

While CTR is a form of content transformation, not all transformations provide a complete defence against the content threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|title= Content Security through Transformation – Problem Statement|date=May 2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.13179.92969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability ==

CTR is applicable to user-to-user traffic, such as email and chat, and machine-to-machine traffic, such as web services. Data transfers can be intercepted by in-line application layer proxies and these can transform the way information content is delivered to remove any threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |invent1=Graham Wyatt|invent2=Timothy Dean|title= Threat mitigation in computer networks|pridate=March 2004|number=EP1721234A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CTR works by extracting business information from data and it is not possible to extract information from executable code. This means CTR is not directly applicable to web browsing, since most web pages are code. It can, however, be applied to content that is downloaded from, and uploaded to, web sites.

Although most web pages cannot be transformed to render them safe, web browsing can be isolated and the remote access protocols used to reach the isolated environment can be subjected to CTR.

CTR provides a solution to the problem of [[Stegware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|title= Stegware – Using Steganography for Malicious Purposes |date=December 2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.15283.53289}}&lt;/ref&gt; It naturally removes detectable steganography and eliminates symbiotic and permutation steganography through normalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Simon|last1=Wiseman|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319943090_Defenders_Guide_to_Steganography|title=Defenders Guide to Steganography|date=September 2017|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.21608.98561}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Availability ==

[[Deep-Secure|Deep Secure]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.deep-secure.com/content-threat-removal-video/|title=Content Threat Removal video}}&lt;/ref&gt; have pioneered the development of CTR.  A number of their products and services incorporate CTR, including [[Proxy server|application layer proxies]] for email and web services and ICAP (the [[Internet Content Adaptation Protocol]]) sidecar servers for uploaded and downloaded content.

Garrison provide a remote Desktop isolation solution where the display content is converted to a video signal that is then recoded as a video stream, using separate hardware chips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.garrison.com/technology.php|title= Silicon Assured Video Isolation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process removes any threat from the content of the display content.

Named after the English biochemist Herbert Grace Crabtree, the '''Crabtree effect''' describes the phenomenon whereby the yeast, ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', produces [[ethanol]] (alcohol) in aerobic conditions and high external [[glucose]] concentrations rather than producing biomass via the [[TCA cycle|tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle]], the usual process occurring aerobically in most yeasts e.g. ''[[Kluyveromyces]] spp''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''.'' This phenomenon is observed in most species of the ''Saccharomyces'', ''Schizosaccharomyces, Debaryomyces, Brettanomyces, Torulopsis, Nematospora, and Nadsonia'' genera.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Crabtree Effect: A Regulatory System in Yeast|last = De Deken|first = R.

This reduces the need of [[oxidative phosphorylation]] done by the TCA cycle via the [[electron transport chain]] and therefore decreases oxygen consumption.  The phenomenon is believed to have evolved as a competition mechanism (due to the antiseptic nature of ethanol) around the time when the first fruits on Earth fell from the trees.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors=Thomson JM, Gaucher EA, Burgan MF, De Kee DW, Li T, Aris JP, Benner SA |title=Resurrecting ancestral alcohol dehydrogenases from yeast. |journal=Nat.

'''''Darwin's Angel''''' is a book published in response to [[Richard Dawkins]]' ''[[The God Delusion]]''. It was written by [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]] and subtitled ''An Angelic Riposte to The God Delusion''.

Cornwell runs a "Public Understanding of Science" programme at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], one of the constituent colleges of the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has previously written reviews of religious and scientific books, including other works of Dawkins. He stated that he finds ''The God Delusion'' harmful in its failure to tackle the problem of extremism, and wrong on many important issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A great debate for heaven's sake |work=Cambridge Evening News |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/news/features/2007/09/17/01a992cd-b6a6-44a4-96aa-30ea96d47914.lpf |accessdate=5 October 2007 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
In this book, Cornwell adopts the persona of the [[guardian angel]] of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Gregor Mendel]], who is now looking after [[Richard Dawkins]]. He pens a letter to Dawkins in 21 chapters.&lt;ref&gt;The summaries here are quotes or direct paraphrases from the relevant chapters of Darwin's Angel.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''A Summary of your Argument'' suggests that Dawkins regards all claims about God's existence as "the exclusive province of science and reason".
# ''Your Sources'' suggests that the book ignores distinguished scholarship and uses inappropriate sources.
# ''Imagination'' suggests that Dawkins takes things too literally.
# ''Beauty'' suggests that Dawkins misunderstands the links between beauty, creativity and faith, and suggests he studies [[George Steiner]], [[William Blake]], [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[C. S. Lewis]].
# ''What is Religion'' suggests that religion is not science and that Dawkins should study sociologists of religion such as [[Émile Durkheim]].
# ''Is God Supernatural?'' claims that Dawkins' image of God is not what most theists believe in.
# ''Celestial Teapots'' suggests that the comparison with [[Russell's teapot]] is misplaced because Cornwell claims there are ''prima facie'', albeit inconclusive, grounds for believing in God.
# ''God's Simplicity'' claims that Dawkins imagines that God is an object but this is not how theologians think about God. 
# ''Theories of Everything'' claims that [[Stephen Hawking]] and others now believe a "[[Theory of Everything]]" is impossible due to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].
# ''Dawkins versus Dostoyevsky'' suggests that Dawkins mistakenly attributes the nihilistic views of [[Ivan Karamazov]] to [[Dostoyevsky]]. Dawkins responded to this chapter specifically by saying that he was either misunderstood or misquoted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richarddawkins.net/article,1610,Honest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity,Richard-Dawkins Richard Dawkins' Response to Cornwell] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011120904/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C1610%2CHonest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity%2CRichard-Dawkins |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Jesus, the Jews and the "Pigs"'' suggests that Dawkins relies on a single source when he discusses "the moral consideration for others" in Judaism and Christianity being originally intended to apply only to a narrowly defined in-group.
# ''Dawkins's Utopia'' claims that Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Hitler all used "science as an ideology combined with militant atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin's Angel p 86&lt;/ref&gt; He also claims that Stalin's atheism was foundational to his entire ideology, and that as atheism doesn't necessarily lead to violence, nor does religion.
# ''Fundamentalism'' suggests that it is important to distinguish between tolerant and violent forms of faith. Cornwell also claims it is a [[Category mistake|category error]] to confuse creationism and the "doctrine of creation".&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'' p 98&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Is Religious Education Child Abuse?'' questions whether being indoctrinated in a faith is tantamount to child abuse. He goes on to claim the [[Amish]] are a living testimony to the advantages of frugality and simplicity.
# ''Life After Death'' suggests that most religious believers ''hope'' for an afterlife,&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kenny argues that this is theologically unsound. Christians don't just hope for an afterlife, Christians "affirm in the creeds belief in a final judgement, a resurrection of the body, and an everlasting life."&lt;/ref&gt; In Dawkins' response to the book, he criticised Cornwell for quoting him out of context in this section. 
# ''Religious People Less Clever than Atheists?'' suggests that scientific eminence does not guarantee sound judgement, and that scientists are prejudiced against religious believers. 
# ''Does our Moral Sense have a Darwinian Origin?'' claims that there is more to morality than evolution can explain.
# ''The Darwinian Imperative'' claims that attempts to explain religion via evolution are simplistic. 
# ''Religion as a Bacillus'' discusses Dr [[Gerhard Wagner (Nazi physician)|Gerhard Wagner]], and states that describing all religious believers as infected with a virus has deplorable overtones.&lt;ref&gt;DA p 141-145.&lt;/ref&gt; 
# ''Does God Exist?'' suggests that Dawkins does not understand the question "why is there something rather than nothing?", which is why he finds it ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;DA pp152-153.&lt;/ref&gt; Cornwell goes on to say "the ludicrous anthropomorphic deity that rightly appals" Dawkins is not the view of God most Christian theologians hold.
# ''Being Religious'' suggests that being religious is not a question of factual beliefs but a personal relationship and quest based on prayer and love.

==Reviews and comments==

The book was praised by [[Salley Vickers]] in ''[[The Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article2361294.ece ''Darwin's Angel: An Angelic Response to the God Delusion''], 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madeleine Bunting]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Madeleine Bunting]] [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/madeleine_bunting/2007/09/the_smallest_signs_of_retreat.html ''The smallest signs of retreat''] [[The Guardian]] 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Polkinghorne]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Polkinghorne]] [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article2778493.ece "The truth in religion"] [[The Times Literary Supplement|TLS]] 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Stanford]] in ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Stanford]] [[The Independent]] 14 September 2007 [http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2959467.ece Doubts about Dawkins] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022042200/http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/reviews/article2959467.ece |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was named one of the 'Books of the Year' by the ''[[Financial Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;FT Magazine 8/9 Dec 2007 ''The Year in Books'' p37.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthony Kenny]] reviewed the book in ''[[The Tablet]]'' noting that both Cornwell and Dawkins fail to observe the prime rule of intellectual debate, that one should attack the opponent's arguments, not his personality. Kenny goes on to say that neither ''The God Delusion'' nor ''Darwin's Angel'' "provides the reader with sufficient grounds for a reasoned conclusion" about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Kenny]] in [[The Tablet]] 13 September 2007 [http://www.thetablet.co.uk/reviews/359 Argument not always angelic]&lt;/ref&gt; A profile of ''Darwin's Angel'' in ''[[New Scientist]]'' by Amanda Gefter criticised Cornwell for confusing two meanings of "religion" demarcated in ''[[The God Delusion]]'' and for holding one religion in higher esteem than any other. She also suggested that both books are part of a modern debate that is suffering from the fact that the two sides do not concentrate on one definition of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19526221.800-review-ian-angelic-riposte-to-the-god-delusioni-by-john-cornwell.html Review: ''An angelic riposte to the God Delusion'' by John Cornwell – 22 September 2007 – New Scientist Space&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Darwin's Angel'' is listed on the RichardDawkins.net website as one of several "fleas" following ''The God Delusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The fleas are multiplying |url=http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |accessdate=12 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140121235026/http://old.richarddawkins.net/articles/1617-the-fleas-are-multiplying |archivedate=21 January 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dawkins, the book contains a number of inaccurate portrayals of what he actually said. Dawkins questions whether these are "honest mistakes or willful mendacity".&lt;ref name=dawkins&gt;{{cite web |title=Honest Mistakes or Willful Mendacity |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,1610,Honest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity,Richard-Dawkins |accessdate=10 September 2007 |work=www.RichardDawkins.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011120904/http://richarddawkins.net/article%2C1610%2CHonest-Mistakes-or-Willful-Mendacity%2CRichard-Dawkins |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests six examples where his writing has been quoted out of context or otherwise misrepresented. For example, Cornwell suggests that Dawkins would have been in favour of [[Social Darwinism]] when in ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' Dawkins has explicitly condemned such views and says no one supports such ideas any more.&lt;ref name=dawkins /&gt;

'''Daseian notation''' (or '''dasian notation''') is the type of [[musical notation]] used in the ninth century [[Anonymous work|anonymous]] musical treatises ''[[Musica enchiriadis]]'' and ''[[Scolica enchiriadis]]''. The music of the ''Musica enchiriadis'' and ''Scolica enchiriadis'', written in Daseian notation, are the earliest known examples of written [[polyphonic music]] in history.&lt;ref name=grout&gt;Burkholder, Grout, and Palisca. ''A History of Western Music''. Norton, 2006, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
Musicologist [[Willi Apel]] has called the notation "a mediaeval imitation of the ancient Greek notation".&lt;ref name=apel&gt;Apel, Willi. ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music, 900-1600''. Revised 4th edition. Cambridge, MA: Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953, pp. 204-206.&lt;/ref&gt; The treatises themselves refer to it as "dasia"; the word derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''daseia'', which refers to "[[rough breathing]]" at the start of a word in spoken [[Greek literature|prosody]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Hiley, David. "Dasian [Daseian] Notation". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', ed Stanley Sadie. London:Macmillan, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daseian notation makes use of a [[staff (music)|staff]] of varying numbers of lines, from four to as many as eighteen, as well as a system of four shapes which are rotated in various ways to represent the full [[scale (music)|gamut]] of eighteen pitches used in the treatises. These eighteen pitches are based on a system of four repeating hexachords, resulting in the following scale: &lt;nowiki&gt; G A B♭ c | d e f g | a b c' d' | e' f♯' g' a' | b' c♯''.&lt;/nowiki&gt; This scale does not correspond to any known performance practice. When it is used to construct polyphonic music, as directed in the treatises, it results in a number of written [[tritone]]s, which were considered undesirable by theorists in performance and were probably mistakes of the author.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, Richard. ''Medieval Music''. Norton, 1978, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notational signs were then placed at the far left of the staff (similar in placement to modern [[clef]]), and some illustrations are supplemented with "T" and "S" in between the signs so as to clarify the placement of [[semitone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Grout, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Syllables of the spoken words were then written on the staff lines (see example above). If the pitch changed, the word syllables would be raised or lowered to a different staff line. This was used to notate [[organum]] in two, three and four-voice styles.&lt;ref name=apel/&gt;

In addition to the ''Enchiriadis'' treatises, this notation is also used in the ''Commemoratio brevis de tonis et psalmis modulandis'' treatise &lt;ref name=grove/&gt; and ''De organo (dictis autem, prout potuimus)'' &lt;ref&gt;Scriptorum de musica medii aevi nova series a Gerbertina altera, 4 vols., ed. Edmond de Coussemaker, pp. 74-78; http://www.chmtl.indiana.edu/tml/9th-11th/HUCORG&lt;/ref&gt;. However, despite the wide circulation of the ''Enchiriadis'' treatises, this notation was not widely used in practical sources. [[Music manuscript]]s of the ninth and tenth centuries record almost exclusively [[monophonic music]], and even the extant sources of polyphonic music, such as the [[Winchester Troper]], are written in unheighted [[neume]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppin, pp. 198-199.&lt;/ref&gt; This would continue until the development of the widely used staff system of [[Guido of Arezzo]] in the eleventh century.

[[Philipp Spitta]] was the first modern musicologist to correctly interpret this notation, in an 1889 publication.&lt;ref name=apel/&gt;

==Chlorination disinfection byproducts ==
Chlorinated [[disinfectant|disinfection agents]] such as [[chlorine]] and [[chloramine]] are strong [[oxidizing agent]]s introduced into water in order to destroy [[pathogenic]] microbes, to oxidize taste/odor-forming compounds, and to form a [[disinfectant residual]] so water can reach the consumer tap safe from microbial contamination. These disinfectants may react with naturally present [[fulvic acid|fulvic]] and [[humic acid|humic]] acids, amino acids, and other natural organic matter, as well as iodide and bromide ions, to produce a range of DBPs such as the [[trihalomethanes]] (THMs), [[haloacetic acids]] (HAAs), [[bromate]], and [[chlorite]] (which are regulated in the US), and so-called "emerging" DBPs such as [[nitromethane|halonitromethanes]], [[acetonitrile|haloacetonitriles]], [[haloamide]]s, [[furanone|halofuranones]], [[iodo-acid]]s such as [[iodoacetic acid]], iodo-THMs ([[iodotrihalomethanes]]), [[nitrosamine]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

Chloramine has become a popular disinfectant in the US, and it has been found to produce [[N-Nitrosodimethylamine|''N''-nitrosodimethylamine]] (NDMA), which is a possible human carcinogen, as well as highly [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] iodinated DBPs, such as [[iodoacetic acid]], when iodide is present in source waters.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/es801169k |title= Occurrence and Mammalian Cell Toxicity of Iodinated Disinfection Byproducts in Drinking Water |year=2008 |last1=Richardson |first1=Susan D. |last2=Fasano |first2=Francesca |last3=Ellington |first3=J.

Residual chlorine and other disinfectants may also react further within the distribution network — both by further reactions with dissolved natural organic matter and with biofilms present in the pipes. In addition to being highly influenced by the types of organic and inorganic matter in the source water, the different species and concentrations of DBPs vary according to the type of disinfectant used, the dose of disinfectant, the concentration of natural organic matter and bromide/iodide, the time since dosing (i.e. water age), temperature, and pH of the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=81–90 |doi=10.1515/REVEH.1997.12.2.81 |title=Drinking Water Chlorination By-Products And Cancer |year=1997 |last1=Koivusalo, |first1=Meri |last2=Vartiainen |first2=Terttu |journal=Reviews on Environmental Health |volume=12 |issue=2 |pmid=9273924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming pools using chlorine have been found to contain trihalomethanes, although generally they are below current EU standard for drinking water (100 micrograms per litre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=586–99 |doi=10.1038/sj.jea.7500139 |title=Uptake of chlorination disinfection by-products; a review and a discussion of its implications for exposure assessment in epidemiological studies |year=2000 |last1=Nieuwenhuijsen |first1=Mark J. |last2=Toledano |first2=Mireille B. |last3=Elliott |first3=Paul |journal=Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology |volume=10 |issue=6 |pmid=11140442}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations of trihalomethanes (mainly [[chloroform]]) of up to 0.43 ppm have been measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beech |first1=J.

Trichloramine is formed by the reaction of urea (from urine and sweat) with chlorine and gives the indoor swimming pool its distinctive odor.

==Byproducts from non-chlorinated disinfectants==
Several powerful oxidizing agents are used in disinfecting and treating drinking water, and many of these also cause the formation of DBPs. [[Ozone]], for example, produces ketones, carboxylic acids, and aldehydes, including formaldehyde.  Bromide in source waters can be converted by ozone into [[bromate]], a potent carcinogen that is regulated in the United States, as well as other brominated DBPs.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt; 

As regulations are tightened on established DBPs such as THMs and HAAs, drinking water treatment plants may switch to alternative disinfection methods. This change will alter the distribution of classes of DBP's.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;

==Occurrence==
DBPs are present in most drinking water supplies that have been subject to [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], [[chloramination]], ozonation, or treatment with chlorine dioxide. Many hundreds of DBPs exist in treated drinking water and at least 600 have been identified.&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Richardson |first=Susan D. | editor-last =Nriagu | editor-first =J.O. |title=Disinfection By-Products: Formation and Occurrence of Drinking Water |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Environmental Health |volume=2 | pages=110–13| publisher=Burlington Elsevier | year=2011 |isbn=978-0-444-52273-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low levels of many of these DBPs, coupled with the analytical costs in testing water samples for them, means that in practice only a handful of DBPs are actually monitored. Increasingly it is recognized that the genotoxicities and cytotoxicities of many of the DBPs not subject to regulatory monitoring, (particularly iodinated, nitrogenous DBPs) are comparatively much higher than those DBPs commonly monitored in the developed world (THMs and HAAs).&lt;ref name=Richardson07/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richardson08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=955–61 |doi=10.1021/es071754h |title=Occurrence, Synthesis, and Mammalian Cell Cytotoxicity and Genotoxicity of Haloacetamides: An Emerging Class of Nitrogenous Drinking Water Disinfection Byproducts |year=2008 |last1=Plewa |first1=Michael J. |last2=Muellner |first2=Mark G. |last3=Richardson |first3=Susan D. |last4=Fasano |first4=Francesca |last5=Buettner |first5=Katherine M. |last6=Woo |first6=Yin-Tak |last7=McKague |first7=A.

==Health effects==
Epidemiological studies have looked at the associations between exposure to DBPs in drinking water with cancers, adverse birth outcomes and birth defects.

'''Ethnolichenology''' is the study of the relationship between [[lichen]]s and people.  Lichens have and are being used for many different purposes by human cultures across the world. The most common human use of lichens is for dye, but they have also been used for medicine, food and other purposes.

==Lichens for dye==
Lichens are a common source of [[natural dye]]s.  The lichen dye is usually extracted by either boiling water or [[ammonia fermentation]].  Although usually called ammonia fermentation, this method is not actually a [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and involves letting the lichen steep in [[ammonia]] (traditionally [[urine]]) for at least two to three weeks.

In [[North America]] the most significant lichen dye is ''[[Letharia vulpina]]''.  Indigenous people through most of this lichen's range in North America traditionally make a yellow dye from this lichen by boiling it in water.

Many of the [[traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands]] were made from lichens including red dyes from the [[cudbear]] [[lichen]], ''[[Lecanora tartarea]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_xcbAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=corcur+lichen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ABzcJuixuP&amp;sig=vL0RFqTgPAnqdWLuJ4hS8cgWhcs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lU5uU_GnF8z-PKX2gJAI&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=corcur%20lichen&amp;f=false | title=Lichen | publisher=The Edinburgh Encyclopaedia | date=1832 | accessdate=10 May 2014 | author=Brewster, Sir David}}&lt;/ref&gt; the common orange lichen, ''[[Xanthoria parietina]]'', and several species of leafy ''[[Parmelia (lichen)|Parmelia]]'' lichens.  Brown or yellow lichen dyes (called [[crottle|crottle or crotal]]), made from ''[[Parmelia saxatilis]]'' scraped off rocks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=3594&amp;startset=7760752&amp;dtext=snd&amp;query=CROTTLE | title=Crottle | publisher=Dictionary of the Scots Language | accessdate=10 May 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221641/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/getent4.php?plen=3594&amp;startset=7760752&amp;dtext=snd&amp;query=CROTTLE | archivedate=12 May 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and red lichen dyes (called [[corkir]]) were used extensively to produce [[tartan]]s.

Purple dyes from lichens were historically very important throughout Europe from the 15th to 17th centuries.  They were generally extracted from ''[[Roccella (lichen)|Roccella]]'' spp. lichens imported from the [[Canary Islands]], [[Cape Verde Islands]], [[Madagascar]], or [[India]].  These lichens, and the dye extracted from them, are called [[orchil]] (variants [[archil]], [[orcein|orchilla]]).  The same dye was also produced from ''[[Ochrolechia]]'' spp. lichens in Britain and was called  cudbear.  Both ''[[Roccella (lichen)|Roccella]]'' spp. and ''[[Ochrolechia]]'' spp. contain the lichen substance [[orcin]], which converts into the purple dye [[orcein]] in the [[ammonia fermentation]] process.

[[Litmus]], a water-soluble pH indicator dye mixture, is extracted from ''[[Roccella (lichen)|Roccella]]'' species.

==Lichens for medicine==
Many lichens have been used medicinally across the world. A lichen's usefulness as a medicine is often related to the lichen secondary compounds that are abundant in most lichen thalli. Different lichens produce a wide variety of these compounds, most of which are unique to lichens and many of which are antibiotic. It has been estimated that 50% of all lichen species have antibiotic properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharnoff|first1=Sylvia|title=Lichens and People|url=http://www.lichen.com/people.html|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many lichen extracts have been found to be effective in killing Gram-positive bacteria, which included species that cause boils, scarlet fever, and pneumonia &lt;ref name="Richardson1974"&gt;Richardson, D. H. S. 1974. Vanishing Lichens. Their History, Biology and Importance. 231 pp. HafnerPress, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most potent lichen antibiotics is [[usnic acid]], as a result [[Usnea|''Usnea'' spp.]] are commonly used in traditional medicines.  ''Usnea'' was used in the United States as a fungal remedy of the mouth, stomach, intestines, anus, vagina, nose, ear, and skin, and in Finland it was used to treat wounds, skin eruptions, and athlete’s foot.&lt;ref name="Vartia1973"&gt;Vartia, K.O. 1973. Antibiotics in lichens. pp. 547-561. In Ahmadjian, V, Hale, ME, eds. The Lichens. p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Russia a preparation of the sodium salt of usnic acid was sold under the name Binan for the treatment of varicose and trophic ulcers, second and third degree burns, and for plastic surgery.&lt;ref name="Richardson1974"/&gt;

Other lichens commonly featured in folk medicines include [[Iceland moss]] and [[Lobaria|Lungwort]].

==Lichens for poisons==
[[File:Letharia vulpina JHollinger crop.jpg|thumb|right|''Letharia vulpina'', the wolf lichen]]
Only a few lichens are truly poisonous, with species of ''[[Letharia vulpina|Letharia]]'' and ''[[Vulpicida]]'' being the primary examples.  These lichens are yellow because they have high concentrations of the bright yellow toxin [[vulpinic acid]].

[[Letharia vulpina|Wolf lichen]] (''Letharia vulpina'') was used in [[Scandinavia]] to poison wolves. The process begins by adding the lichens to various baits such as reindeer blood and other meats, while sometimes mixing the concoction with ground glass or [[strychnine]]. Wolves that ate the concoction were reported to succumb in less than 24 hours. The [[Achomawi]] people of northern California use ''Letharia'' to poison arrowheads. The arrowheads would be soaked in the lichens for a year sometimes with the addition of rattlesnake [[snake venom|venom]]. Although toxic, wolf lichens were used to treat sores and inflammation by indigenous people in north California and southern British Columbia, and even taken internally as medicine.

==Lichens for food==
[[File:Closeup of wila lichen.jpg|thumb|left|The hairlike lichen commonly known as Wila (''Bryoria fremontii'') is edible.]]
There are records of lichens being used as food by many different human cultures across the world.  Lichens are eaten by people in North America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, and perhaps elsewhere.  Often lichens are merely [[famine food]]s eaten in times of dire needs, but in some cultures lichens are a staple food or even a delicacy.  Two problems often encountered with eating lichens is that they usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds, and that [[lichenin|lichen polysaccharides]] are generally indigestible to humans.  Many human cultures have discovered preparation techniques to overcome these problems.  Lichens are often thoroughly washed, boiled, or soaked in ash water to help remove secondary compounds.

In the past [[Iceland moss]] (''Cetraria islandica'') was an important human food in northern Europe and Scandinavia, and was cooked in many different ways, such as bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad.  [[Wila (lichen)|Wila]] (''Bryoria fremontii'') was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked.  It is even featured in a [[Sk'elep|Secwepemc story]].  [[Cladonia rangiferina|Reindeer lichen]] (''Cladina'' spp.) is a staple food of reindeer and caribou in the Arctic.  Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested lichen after they remove it from the [[rumen]] of caribou that have been killed.  It is often called 'stomach icecream'.  [[Rock Tripe|Rock tripe]] (''Umbilicaria'' spp. and ''Lasalia'' spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America.  One species of ''Umbilicaria'', [[Umbilicaria esculenta|Iwa-take]] (''U. esculenta''), is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods.  It is quite expensive, and is collected off the sides of cliffs.  In India, and other centers of curry powder production, [[garam masala]] sauce contains certain lichens used as bulking agents.

Very few lichens are poisonous.  Poisonous lichens include those high in [[vulpinic acid]]&lt;ref name="Emmerich1993"&gt;Emmerich, R., I. Giez, O. L. Lange, and P. Proksch.  1993.  Toxicity and antifeedant activity of lichen compounds against the polyphagous herbivorous insect Spodoptera littoralis.  Phytochemistry 33(6): 1389-1394.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[usnic acid]].&lt;ref name="Emmerich1993" /&gt;  Most (but not all) lichens that contain vulpinic acid are yellow, so any yellow lichen should be considered to be potentially poisonous.

==Lichens for embalming==
[[File:Lichen Julian Alps Sovenia 2.jpg|thumb|right|''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' was used in embalming.]]
[[Embalming]] began in [[Ancient Egypt]] around 5,000 years ago. The use of lichens in embalming dates to the [[18th Dynasty]], where ''[[Pseudevernia furfuracea]]'' was found in an Egyptian vase.&lt;ref name="Llano1944"&gt;Llano, G.A.P. 1944. Lichens: their biological and economic significance. The Botanical Review 10 (1): 1-65. Page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The process began with a slit in the abdomen; the organs and viscera were removed. The organs and viscera were wrapped in separate linen packets and replaced in the body or put in canopic jars between the legs. The body cavity was then packed with lichen, [[sawdust]], bruised [[myrrh]], [[Senna (plant)|cassia]], and other spices.&lt;ref name="Llano1944"/&gt; ''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' was employed due to its [[preservative]] and aromatic qualities. Also it was used simply as a highly absorbent, light-weight packaging material. It also contains antibiotic substances. These qualities helped inhibit bacterial decay of the mummies.&lt;ref name="Richardson1974"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baumann1960"&gt;Baumann, B.B. 1960. The botanical aspects of ancient Egyptian embalming and burial. Econ. Bot. 14(1):84-104. Page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Another discovery is that the Egyptians would grind and mix ''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' with their flour for bread. The bread was then placed with the mummy and thought to be the first meal for the mummy in its afterlife. ''Pseudevernia furfuracea'' was imported shiploads from the Grecian archipelago to Alexandria.&lt;ref name="Richardson1974"/&gt; Today, embalming fluids are colored from the lichen dye orchil into a product called [[Cudbear]], illustrating how a historical procedure can influence future practices.

==Other human uses of lichens==

'''Evelyn Hooker''' (née '''Gentry''', September 2, 1907 – November 18, 1996) was an American [[psychologist]] most notable for her 1957 paper "The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual" in which she administered several [[psychological test]]s to groups of self-identified male [[homosexual]]s and [[heterosexual]]s and asked experts to identify the homosexuals and rate their mental health. The experiment, which other researchers subsequently repeated, argues that homosexuality is not a mental disorder, as there was no detectable difference between homosexual and heterosexual men in terms of mental adjustment.

Her work argued that a [[false correlation]] between homosexuality and mental illness had formed the basis of classifying homosexuality as a [[mental disorder]] by studying only a [[sample group]] that contained homosexual men with a history of treatment for [[mental illness]]. This is of critical importance in refuting the existence of the category of cultural heterosexism because it argues that homosexuality is not developmentally inferior to heterosexuality.{{clarify|date=May 2013}} Her demonstration that it is not an illness led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]].&lt;ref name="ucd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/hooker2.html#biography | title=Evelyn Hooker, Ph.D.: September 2, 1907 – November 18, 1996 | publisher=UC Davis | accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Hooker was born Evelyn Gentry in North Platte, Nebraska, in her grandmother's house and grew up with eight brothers and sisters in the Colorado Plains. When she was 13, her family moved to [[Sterling, Colorado]].&lt;ref name="ucd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="changing"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0103938|title=Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey to Sterling would be one of Evelyn's fondest memories.&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"&gt;Jackson, K. T., Markoe, A., Markoe, K. (2001). The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives. Charles Scribner’s Sons. 4, 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evelyn's mother, Jessie Bethel, who had a third grade education, told her to pursue an education because that was the only thing that could not be taken away from her.&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt; The Gentry family was not wealthy in the least, and Evelyn was further stigmatized by her nearly six-foot stature. Still an advocate of education, Jessie Bethel enrolled Evelyn at Sterling High School, which was large and unusually progressive for the time.&lt;ref name="Milite, G. A. 2001 p. 307-308"&gt;Milite, G. A. (2001). The Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology. Gale Group. 307–308.&lt;/ref&gt; There, Evelyn was in an honors program and was able to take a course in psychology.&lt;ref name="Milite, G. A. 2001 p. 307-308"/&gt; Evelyn wanted to go to a teachers college, but her instructors saw her potential and encouraged her to go to the University of Colorado.  By the time she was ready to graduate, she had obtained a scholarship to the University of Colorado Boulder.&lt;ref name="feministvoices.com"&gt;Ball, L. (2010). Psychology’s Feminist Voices. http://www.feministvoices.com/evelyn-gentry-hooker/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 she became a student at the [[University of Colorado]] while working as a maid for a rich [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] family. Her mentor, Dr. [[Karl Munzinger]], guided her in her challenge of the then-prevalent psychological theory of [[behaviourism]]. She wrote her thesis paper on [[trial-and-error]] learning in rats.&lt;ref name="Shneidman"&gt;Shneidman, E. S. (1998). Evelyn Hooker (1907–1996). American Psychologist, 53(4), 480–481&lt;/ref&gt; He invited her to write her own case history. After receiving her [[Masters degree]], she became one of 11 women involved in the [[PhD]] program in [[psychology]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]], Baltimore, Maryland, having been refused referral from the chairman of [[Yale]] for being a female. She studied with [[Knight Dunlap]], who also generally did not approve of women doctorates.&lt;ref name="Shneidman"/&gt; She was awarded her PhD in 1932.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

In her early career, she wasn't especially interested in the psychology of homosexual people. After teaching for only one year at the [[Maryland College for Women]], she contracted [[tuberculosis]] and spent the next year in a [[sanatorium]] in [[Arizona]]. After her recovery she began teaching at Whittier College in Southern California.&lt;ref name="Milite, G. A. 2001 p. 307-308"/&gt; Then in 1937 Gentry received a fellowship to the [[Berlin Institute of Psychotherapy]], at which point she left Whittier. Evelyn lived with a Jewish family while she studied in Europe. While there, she got a first-hand look at the rise of Adolf Hitler and witnessed such events as the [[Kristallnacht]].&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt; She learned later that the Jewish family she lived with was killed in concentration camps. Before returning home, Evelyn went on a group tour to Russia, arriving just after a major purge. The events that Evelyn would see in Europe ultimately sparked her desire to help overcome social injustice.&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt;

When Evelyn was ready to return to work at Whittier, she found that she could not return.  The heads at Whittier were afraid of her because she had spent a year living in a totalitarian Europe. She and several other staff were let go because they were suspected of subversive behavior.&lt;ref name="Minton, H. L. 2002"&gt;Minton, H. L. (2002). Departing From Deviance: A History of Homosexual Rights and Emancipatory Science in America. The University of Chicago Press. 219–236.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, she applied for work in the psychology department at the University of California, Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="feministvoices.com"/&gt;  The chair of the psychology department at UCLA at the time was Knight Dunlap, Evelyn’s mentor from Johns Hopkins.&lt;ref name="Minton, H. L. 2002"/&gt;  Dunlap said he would like to give her a job, but they already had three female faculty members and they were “cordially disliked”.&lt;ref name="Minton, H. L. 2002"/&gt; She was able to get a position as a research associate, however. Evelyn quickly gained a reputation as a brilliant teacher and researcher. She stayed at UCLA for 31 years, where she conducted research and taught experimental and physiological psychology until 1970 when she went into private practice.&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt;

However, during the 1940s, she first became interested in what would turn out to be her life's work. Evelyn was teaching an introductory psychology class in 1944 when a student approached her after class. He identified himself as Sam From; he confided in her that he was gay and so were most of his friends.&lt;ref name="feministvoices.com"/&gt; She realized Sam was one of the brightest students in the class and quickly became friends with him. They would spend time between and after classes to talk and get to know each other. Sam introduced Evelyn to his circle of homosexual friends. They would go to clubs, bars, and parties where Evelyn was able to fraternize with more homosexuals.&lt;ref name="feministvoices.com"/&gt; Sam's closest friends were some of the most intelligent students Evelyn had the pleasure to meet, including [[Christopher Isherwood]] and [[Stephen Spender]], a writer and a poet.&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt; He challenged her to scientifically study "people like him".&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

Sam proposed a question to Evelyn: Why not conduct research on homosexuals to determine whether homosexuality was some sort of disease or disorder and not relevant to a person's psychological makeup?&lt;ref name="Milite, G. A. 2001 p. 307-308"/&gt; Sam urged her to conduct research on homosexuals, saying it was "her scientific duty to study people like us".&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt; Evelyn was intrigued by the question and further persuaded by her experience with social rejection as a child, witnessing the effects of racial and political persecution in her travels, and discrimination in her professional life.

Over the next two decades she became established professionally. In 1948 she moved to a guest cottage at the Salter Avenue home of Edward Hooker, professor of English at [[UCLA]] and [[poetry]] scholar. They married in [[London]] in 1951, and she took his surname. In the mid-fifties Christopher Isherwood became their neighbor. She was against the relationship of Christopher Isherwood with the much younger [[Don Bachardy]]; they were not welcome at her house.&lt;ref&gt;"Chris &amp; Don, A love story", a film by Guido Santi and Tina Mascara, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Sam From died in a car accident in 1956, just before Hooker's ground-breaking research was published. Hooker's husband died in January 1957 of [[cardiac arrest]].&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

The 1960s saw her work find a wider audience, and her conclusions were taken up by the [[gay rights movement]]. In 1961 Hooker was invited to lecture in Europe and in 1967, the director of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) asked her to produce a report on what the institution should do about homosexual men. [[Richard Nixon]]'s election in 1969 delayed the publication of the report, which was published by a magazine, without authorization, in 1970. The report recommended the [[decriminalization]] of homosexuality and the provision of similar rights to both homosexual and heterosexual people. The burgeoning gay rights movement seized on this.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

She retired from her research at UCLA in 1970 at the age of 63 and started a private practice in Santa Monica. Most of her clients were gay men and lesbians.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt; In her later life she would be awarded with the Distinguished Contribution in the Public Interest Award.&lt;ref name="feministvoices.com"/&gt;  The University of Chicago opened the Evelyn Hooker Center for Gay and Lesbian Studies in her honor. She was also the subject of the 1992 Academy Award–nominated film ''Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker''.&lt;ref name="feministvoices.com"/&gt;

Hooker died at her home in [[Santa Monica, California]], in 1996, at the age of 89.&lt;ref name="ucd"/&gt;

==Experiment==

Although Hooker had collected data about her homosexual friends since 1954, she felt this was of little value because of the lack of scientific rigor attached to the gathering of these data. She applied for a grant from the NIMH even though she was warned that it was highly unlikely she would receive it due to the controversy of the topic.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;[http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/hooker2.html Link Text], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; After all, the 1950s was at the height of the McCarthy era, and homosexuality was considered to be a mental disorder by psychologists, a sin by the church, and a crime by the law.&lt;ref name="Jackson, K. T. 2001"/&gt; The man in charge of awarding the grants, John Eberhart, personally met with Hooker and convinced by her charm he awarded her the grant.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;Ball, L. (2010). Profile of Evelyn Gentry Hooker. In A. Rutherford (Ed.), Psychology's Feminist Voices Multimedia Internet Archive. Retrieved from http://www.feministvoices.com/evelyn-gentry-hooker/&lt;/ref&gt;

She gathered two groups of men: one group would be exclusively homosexual, the other exclusively heterosexual. She contacted the [[Mattachine Society]] to find a large portion of homosexual men. The Mattachine Society was an organization whose purpose was to integrate homosexuals into society.&lt;ref name="Hooker, E. 1957"&gt;Hooker, E. (1957). The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual. Journal of Projective Techniques. 21, 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt; She had greater difficulty finding heterosexual men for the study. She gathered a sample of 30 heterosexual men and 30 homosexual men and paired them based on equivalent IQ, age, and education. For the interest of the study, it was required that none of the men from either group have previously been seen for psychological help, in disciplinary barracks in the Armed Services, in prison, showed evidence of considerable disturbance, or who were in therapy.&lt;ref name="Hooker"&gt;Hooker, E. (1957). The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual. Journal of Projective Techniques, 21(1), 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt; She also had to use her home to conduct the interview to protect the participants' anonymity.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

Hooker used three psychological tests for her study: the [[Thematic Apperception Test|TAT]], the [[Picture Arrangement Test|Make-a-Picture-Story test]] (MAPS test), and the [[Rorschach test|Rorschach inkblot test]].&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt; The Rorschach was used due to the belief of clinicians at the time that it was the best method for diagnosing homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Hooker"/&gt;

After a year of work, Hooker presented a team of three expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles. She decided to leave the interpretation of her results to other people, to avoid any possible bias.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

First, she contacted [[Bruno Klopfer]], an expert on Rorschach tests, to see if he would be able to identify the sexual orientation of people through their results at those tests. His ability to differentiate between the two groups was no better than chance.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt; Then [[Edwin Shneidman]], creator of the MAPS test, also analyzed the 60 profiles. It took him six months and he, too, found that both groups were highly similar in their psychological make-up.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt; The third expert was Dr [[Mortimer Mayer]], who was so certain he would be able to tell the two groups apart that he went through the process twice.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

The assumption was that these tests would prompt respondents to reveal their innermost anxieties, fears, and wishes.&lt;ref name="Minton, H. L. 2002"/&gt;  Each test response would be submitted in random order, with no identifying information, to Klopfer, Meyer, and Shneidman.&lt;ref name="Hooker, E. 1957"/&gt; The judges had two tasks: to arrive at an overall adjustment rating on a five-point scale, and to distinguish in pairs which participant was homosexual and heterosexual.&lt;ref name="Minton, H. L. 2002"/&gt; The three evaluators concluded that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt;

In 1956, Hooker presented the results of her research in a paper at the [[American Psychological Association]]'s convention in [[Chicago]].[2] The NIMH was so impressed with the evidence Hooker found they granted her the NIMH Research Career Award in 1961 to continue her work.&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt;
 
Her studies contributed to a change in the attitudes of the psychological community toward homosexuality and to the American Psychiatric Association's decision to remove homosexuality from its [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders#Seventh printing of the DSM-II.2C 1974|handbook of disorders]] in 1973. This in turn helped change the attitude of society at large.&lt;ref name="changing"/&gt; One element that did stay in the handbook of disorders was ego-dystonic homosexuality. Experts became concerned about using psychoanalytic approaches and behavior modification conversion therapy. In 1987 ego-dystonic homosexuality was also eliminated from the handbook when it was determined that psychological therapies could not cure homosexuality. &lt;ref&gt; Brookey, R. A. (2005).

'''Female education in STEM''' includes child and adult [[female]] represented in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.

The organization [[UNESCO]] has stated that this gender disparity is due to [[discrimination]], [[Bias|biases]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and expectations that influence the quality of [[education]] women receive and the subjects they study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479e.pdf|title=Cracking the code: Girls' and womens' education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100233-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender differences in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education participation are already visible in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of [[education]]. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally &lt;!-- Needs clear source --&gt;. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT{{fix|text=what?}} fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-and-gender-advancement-saga/|title=STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education|last=|first=|publisher=OECD|year=2016|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/|title=TIMSS ADVANCED 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT – TIMSS 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2014|last=|first=|publisher=National Science Board|year=2014|isbn=|location=Arlington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning achievement in STEM education ===
Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] but do less well in [[physics]] and [[earth science]].

The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS trend countries]]: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] but doing less well in "number". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies. There are large gaps in our knowledge of the situation in low- and middle-income countries in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], Central [[Asia]], and South and West Asia, particularly at secondary level.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=International Trends in Mathematics and Science Achievement, Curriculum and Instruction|last=Mullis, I.

== Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education ==
[[File:Expectations of a ICT career, by gender (PISA 2015).svg|thumb|upright=2|According to [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect a ICT career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Catherine André/VoxEurop/EDJNet |author2=Marzia Bona/OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |title=The ICT sector is booming.

According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: 
* '''Individual level:''' biological factors that may influence individuals’ abilities, skills, and [[Behavior|behaviour]] such as brain structure and function, [[Hormone|hormones]], [[genetics]], and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation.
* '''Family and peer level:''' parental beliefs and expectations, parental [[education]] and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences.
* '''School level:''' factors within the [[learning environment]], including teachers’ profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, [[Curriculum|curricula]], learning materials and resources, [[Teaching method|teaching strategies]] and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment.
* '''Societal level:''' social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s related to [[gender equality]], and gender stereotypes in the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual level ===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}
The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spearman, J. and Watt, H.|first=|date=2013|title=Perception shapes experience: The influence of actual and perceived classroom environment dimensions on girls’  motivations for science|url=|journal=Learning Environment Research|volume=16|pages=217-238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolmos, A., Mejlgaard, N., Haase, S. and Holgaard, J.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Motivational factors, gender and engineering in education|url=|journal=European Journal of Engineering Education|volume=38|pages=340-358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel, A.|first=|date=2015|title=The role of cultural contexts in explaining cross-national gender gaps in STEM Expectations|url=|journal=European Sociological Review|volume=32|pages=122-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su, R., Rounds, J. and Armstrong, P.I.|first=|date=2009|title=Men and things, women and people: A meta-analysis of sex differences in interests|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|pages=859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family and peer level ===
Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the [[higher education]] and career choices of girls than those of boys&lt;!-- Needs source if referring to "some research" --&gt;. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in [[mathematics]] and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== School level ===
Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender [[stereotype]]s may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level{{Clarify|reason=is university level STEM study meant? Native English speaker help needed.|date=March 2018}} study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a [[gender-equality paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719|title=The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education|last=G.

=== Societal level ===
Cultural and [[Norm (social)|social norms]] influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and [[Adult|adults]] and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge [[gender stereotypes]] about STEM abilities and careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Fluorescence recovery after [[photobleaching]]''' (FRAP) is a method for determining the kinetics of diffusion through tissue or cells. It is capable of quantifying the two dimensional lateral diffusion of a molecularly thin film containing fluorescently labeled probes, or to examine single cells. This technique is very useful in biological studies of [[cell membrane]] diffusion and protein binding. In addition, surface deposition of a fluorescing [[phospholipid]] bilayer (or monolayer) allows the characterization of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] (or [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]) surfaces in terms of surface structure and free energy.

Similar, though less well known, techniques have been developed to investigate the 3-dimensional [[diffusion]] and [[binding (molecular)|binding]] of molecules inside the cell; they are also referred to as FRAP.

==Experimental Setup==

The basic apparatus comprises an [[optical microscope]], a [[List of light sources|light source]] and some [[fluorescent]] probe. [[Fluorescence|Fluorescent emission]] is contingent upon absorption of a specific optical wavelength or color which restricts the choice of lamps. Most commonly, a broad [[spectrum]] [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[xenon]] source is used in conjunction with a color filter. The technique begins by saving a background image of the sample before photobleaching. Next, the light source is focused onto a small patch of the viewable area either by switching to a higher magnification microscope objective or with [[laser]] light of the appropriate wavelength. The fluorophores in this region receive high intensity illumination which causes their fluorescence lifetime to quickly elapse (limited to roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; photons before extinction). Now the image in the microscope is that of a uniformly fluorescent field with a noticeable dark spot. As Brownian motion proceeds, the still-fluorescing probes will diffuse throughout the sample and replace the non-fluorescent probes in the bleached region. This diffusion proceeds in an ordered fashion, analytically determinable from the [[diffusion equation]]. Assuming a [[Gaussian beam|Gaussian]] profile for the bleaching beam, the diffusion constant ''D'' can be simply calculated from:

:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{w^{2}}{4t_{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''w'' is the radius of the beam and ''t&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the "Characteristic" diffusion time.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(76)85755-4 |journal=Biophysical Journal |title=Mobility measurement by analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery kinetics |date=1976 |last1=Axelrod |first1=D |last2=Koppel |first2=D |last3=Schlessinger |first3=J |last4=Elson |first4=E |last5=Webb |first5=W |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1055–69 |pmid=786399 |pmc=1334945|bibcode=1976BpJ....16.1055A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sprague1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1529/biophysj.103.026765 |title=Analysis of Binding Reactions by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching |date=2004 |last1=Sprague |first1=Brian L. |last2=Pego |first2=Robert L. |last3=Stavreva |first3=Diana A. |last4=McNally |first4=James G. |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=86 |issue=6 |pages=3473–95 |pmid=15189848 |pmc=1304253|bibcode=2004BpJ....86.3473S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Supported Lipid Bilayers===

Originally, the FRAP  technique was intended for use as a means to characterize the mobility of individual lipid molecules within a cell membrane.&lt;ref name="Axelrod" /&gt; While providing great utility in this role, current research leans more toward investigation of artificial lipid membranes. Supported by hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates (to produce lipid bilayers or monolayers respectively) and incorporating [[membrane proteins]], these biomimetic structures are potentially useful as analytical devices for determining the identity of unknown substances, understanding cellular transduction, and identifying ligand binding sites.

===Protein Binding===
This technique is commonly used in conjunction with [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) [[fusion protein]]s, where the studied protein is fused to a GFP.  When excited by a specific wavelength of light, the protein will fluoresce.&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Kou Qin |author2=Chunmin Dong |author3=Guangyu Wu |author4=Nevin A Lambert |date=August 2011      | title = Inactive-state preassembly of Gq-coupled receptors and Gq heterotrimers| journal = Nature Chemical Biology  | volume =  7 | issue = 11  | pages =740–747  | doi=10.1038/nchembio.642 | pmid=21873996 | pmc=3177959}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the protein that is being studied is produced with the GFP, then the fluorescence can be tracked.  Photodestroying the GFP, and then watching the repopulation into the bleached area can reveal information about protein interaction partners, organelle continuity and protein trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23042527 |date=2012|last1=Day|first1=CA |last2=Kraft|first2=LJ |last3=Kang|first3=M|last4=Kenworthy|first4=AK|title=Analysis of protein and lipid dynamics using confocal fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)|pages=2–19|journal=Current Protocols in Cytometry|doi=10.1002/0471142956.cy0219s62 |volume=Chapter 2 |pmc=3538152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If after some time the fluorescence doesn't reach the initial level anymore, then some part of the fluorescence is caused by an immobile fraction (that cannot be replenished by diffusion).  Similarly, if the fluorescent proteins bind to static cell receptors, the rate of recovery will be retarded by a factor related to the association and disassociation coefficients of binding.  This observation has most recently been exploited to investigate protein binding.&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23900248 |date=2013|last1=Mazza|first1=D|last2=Mueller|first2=F|last3=Stasevich|first3=TJ|last4=McNally|first4=JG|title=Convergence of chromatin binding estimates in live cells|pages=691–2|volume=10|issue=8|journal=Nat Methods|doi=10.1038/nmeth.2573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" pmid=18434433"&gt;{{Cite journal  |author1=Kou Qin |author2=Pooja R.

==Applications Outside the Membrane==
FRAP can also be used to monitor proteins outside the membrane.  After the protein of interest is made fluorescent, generally by expression as a GFP fusion protein, a [[confocal microscope]] is used to photobleach and monitor a region of the [[cytoplasm]],&lt;ref name="Kou Qin"/&gt; [[mitotic spindle]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or another cellular structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19005234 |date=2008 |last1=Tripathi |first1=K |last2=Parnaik |first2=VK |title=Differential dynamics of splicing factor SC35 during the cell cycle |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=345–54 |journal=Journal of Biosciences |doi=10.1007/s12038-008-0054-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mean fluorescence in the region can then be plotted versus time since the photobleaching, and the resulting curve can yield kinetic coefficients, such as those for the protein's binding reactions and/or the protein's diffusion coefficient in the medium where it is being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16080269 |date=2005 |last1=Houtsmuller |first1=AB |title=Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching: Application to nuclear proteins |volume=95 |pages=177–99 |journal=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology |doi=10.1007/b102214}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the only dynamics considered are diffusion and binding/unbinding interactions, however, in principle proteins can also move via flow, i.e., undergo directed motion, and this was recognized very early by Axelrod et al.&lt;ref name="Axelrod"/&gt; This could be due to flow of the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm, or transport along filaments in the cell such as [[microtubules]] by [[molecular motors]].

The analysis is most simple when the fluorescence recovery is limited by either the rate of diffusion into the bleached area or by rate at which bleached proteins unbind from their binding sites within the bleached area, and are replaced by fluorescent protein. Let us look at these two limits, for the common case of bleaching a GFP fusion protein in a living cell.

===Diffusion-limited fluorescence recovery===
For a circular bleach spot of radius &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; and diffusion-dominated recovery, the fluorescence is described by an equation derived by Soumpasis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0006-3495(83)84410-5 |title=Theoretical analysis of fluorescence photobleaching recovery experiments |date=1983 |last1=Soumpasis |first1=D |journal=Biophysical Journal |volume=41 |pages=95–7 |pmid=6824758 |issue=1 |pmc=1329018|bibcode=1983BpJ....41...95S }}&lt;/ref&gt; (which involves [[modified Bessel function]]s &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=e^{-2\tau_D/t}\left(I_{0}(2\tau_D/t)+I_{1}(2\tau_D/t)\right)&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt; the characteristic timescale for diffusion, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time. &lt;math&gt;f(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the normalized fluorescence (goes to 1 as &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; goes to infinity). The diffusion timescale for a bleached spot of radius &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tau_D=w^2/(4D)&lt;/math&gt;, with ''D'' the diffusion coefficient.

Note that this is for an instantaneous bleach with a step function profile, i.e., the fraction &lt;math&gt;f_b&lt;/math&gt; of protein assumed to be bleached instantaneously at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_b(r)=b, ~~r&lt;w&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_b(r)=0, ~~r&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; the distance from the centre of the bleached area. It is also assumes that the recovery can be modelled by diffusion in two dimensions, that is also both uniform and isotropic. In other words, that diffusion is occurring in a uniform medium so the effective diffusion constant ''D'' is the same everywhere, and that the diffusion is isotropic, i.e., occurs at the same rate along all axes in the plane.

In practice, in a cell none of these assumptions will be strictly true.

#Bleaching will not be instantaneous. Particularly if strong bleaching of a large area is required, bleaching may take a significant fraction of the diffusion timescale &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;. Then a significant fraction of the bleached protein will diffuse out of the bleached region actually during bleaching. Failing to take account of this will introduce a significant error into ''D''.&lt;ref name="yang10"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03347.x |title=An improved strip FRAP method for estimating diffusion coefficients: Correcting for the degree of photobleaching |date=2009 |last1=Yang |first1=J. |last2=Köhler |first2=K. |last3=Davis |first3=D.

#The bleached profile will not be a radial step function. If the bleached spot is effectively a single pixel then the bleaching as a function of position will typically be diffraction limited and determined by the optics of the [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] used. This is not a radial step function and also varies along the axis perpendicular to the plane.
#Cells are of course three-dimensional not two-dimensional, as is the bleached volume. Neglecting diffusion out of the plane (we take this to be the ''xy'' plane) will be a reasonable approximation only if the fluorescence recovers predominantly via diffusion in this plane. This will be true, for example, if a cylindrical volume is bleached with the axis of the cylinder along the ''z'' axis and with this cylindrical volume going through the entire height of the cell. Then diffusion along the ''z'' axis does not cause fluorescence recovery as all protein is bleached uniformly along the ''z'' axis, and so neglecting it, as Soumpasis' equation does, is harmless. However, if diffusion along the ''z'' axis does contribute to fluorescence recovery then it must be accounted for.
#There is no reason to expect the cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm to be completely spatially uniform or isotropic.

Thus, the equation of Soumpasis is just a useful approximation, that can be used when the assumptions listed above are good approximations to the true situation, and when the recovery of fluorescence is indeed limited by the timescale of diffusion &lt;math&gt;\tau_D&lt;/math&gt;. Note that just because the Soumpasis can be fitted adequately to data does not necessarily imply that the assumptions are true and that diffusion dominates recovery.

===Reaction-limited recovery===
The equation describing the fluorescence as a function of time is particularly simple in another limit. If a large number of proteins bind to sites in a small volume such that there the fluorescence signal is dominated by the signal from bound proteins, and if this binding is all in a single state with an off rate k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;, then the fluorescence as a function of time is given by&lt;ref name = "bulinski01"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11719555 |date=2001 |last1=Bulinski |first1=JC |last2=Odde |first2=DJ |last3=Howell |first3=BJ |last4=Salmon |first4=TD |last5=Waterman-Storer |first5=CM |title=Rapid dynamics of the microtubule binding of ensconsin in vivo |volume=114 |issue=Pt 21 |pages=3885–97 |journal=Journal of Cell Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;f(t)=1-e^{-k_{\text{off}}t}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the recovery depends on the rate constant for unbinding, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'', only. It does not depend on the on rate for binding. Although it does depend on a number of assumptions&lt;ref name ="bulinski01" /&gt;
#The on rate must be sufficiently large in order for the local concentration of bound protein to greatly exceed the local concentration of free protein, and so allow us to neglect the contribution to ''f'' of the free protein.
#The reaction is a simple bimolecular reaction, where the protein binds to localised sites that do not move significantly during recovery
#Exchange is much slower than diffusion (or whatever transport mechanism is responsible for mobility), as only then does the diffusing fraction recovery rapidly and then acts as the source of fluorescent protein that binds and replaces the bound bleached protein and so increases the fluorescence. With '' r '' the radius of the bleached spot, this means that the equation is only valid if the bound lifetime &lt;math&gt;1/k_{\text{off}} &gt;&gt; r^2/D&lt;/math&gt;.
If all these assumptions are satisfied, then fitting an exponential to the recovery curve will give the off rate constant, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;''. However, other dynamics can give recovery curves similar to exponentials, so fitting an exponential does not necessarily imply that recovery is dominated by a simple bimolecular reaction. One way to distinguish between recovery with a rate determined by unbinding  and recovery that is limited by diffusion, is to note that the recovery rate for unbinding-limited recovery is independent of the size of the bleached area ''r'', while it scales as &lt;math&gt;r^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, for diffusion-limited recovery. Thus if a small and a large area are bleached, if recovery is limited by unbinding then the recovery rates will be the same for the two sizes of bleached area, whereas if recovery is limited by diffusion then it will be much slower for the larger bleached area.

===Diffusion and reaction===

In general, the recovery of fluorescence will not be dominated by either simple isotropic diffusion, or by a single simple unbinding rate. There will be both diffusion and binding, and indeed the diffusion constant may not be uniform in space, and there may be more than one type of binding sites, and these sites may also have a non-uniform distribution in space. Flow processes may also be important. This more complex behavior implies that a model with several parameters is required to describe the data; models with only either a single diffusion constant ''D'' or a single off rate constant, ''k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;'', are inadequate.

There are models with both diffusion and reaction.&lt;ref name="sprague1"/&gt; Unfortunately, a single FRAP curve may provide insufficient evidence to reliably and uniquely fit (possibly noisy) experimental data. Sadegh Zadeh '' et al.'' &lt;ref name="zadeh06"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1742-4682-3-36 |date=2006 |last1=Sadegh Zadeh |first1=Kouroush |last2=Montas |first2=Hubert J |last3=Shirmohammadi |first3=Adel |journal=Theoretical Biology and Medical Modelling |volume=3 |pages=36 |pmid=17034642 |title=Identification of biomolecule mass transport and binding rate parameters in living cells by inverse modeling |pmc=1635038}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that FRAP curves can be fitted by ''different'' pairs of values of the diffusion constant and the on-rate constant, or, in other words, that fits to the FRAP are not unique. This is in three-parameter (on-rate constant, off-rate constant and diffusion constant) fits. Fits that are not unique, are not generally useful.

Thus for models with a number of parameters, a single FRAP experiment may be insufficient to estimate all the model parameters. Then more data is required, e.g., by bleaching areas of different sizes,&lt;ref name="gonzalez11"/&gt; determining some model parameters independently, etc.

'''Fuzzy Markup Language''' ('''FML''') is a specific purpose markup language based on [[XML]], used for describing the structure and behavior of a [[fuzzy system]] independently of the hardware architecture devoted to host and run it.

==Overview==
FML was designed and developed by Giovanni Acampora during his Ph.D. course in Computer Science, at University of Salerno, Italy, in 2004. The original idea inspired Giovanni Acampora to create FML was the necessity of creating a cooperative fuzzy-based framework aimed at automatically controlling a living environment characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous devices whose interactions were devoted to maximize the human comfort under energy saving constraints. This framework represented one of the first concrete examples of [[AmI|Ambient Intelligence]]. Beyond this pioneering application, the major advantage of using XML to describe a fuzzy system is hardware/software interoperability. Indeed, all that is needed to read an FML file is the appropriate schema for that file, and an FML parser. This markup approach makes it much easier to exchange fuzzy systems between software: for example, a machine learning application could extract fuzzy rules which could then be read directly into a fuzzy inference engine or uploaded into a fuzzy controller. Also, with technologies like [[XSLT]], it is possible to compile the FML into the programming language of your choice, ready for embedding into whatever application you please. As stated by Mike Watts on his popular Computational Intelligence blog:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watts |first=Mike |url=http://computational-intelligence.blogspot.it/2011/05/fuzzy-markup-language.html |title=Computational Intelligence: Fuzzy Markup Language |publisher=Computational-intelligence.blogspot.it |date=2011-05-28 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although Acampora's motivation for developing FML seems to be to develop embedded fuzzy controllers for ambient intelligence applications, FML could be a real boon for developers of fuzzy rule extraction algorithms: from my own experience during my PhD, I know that having to design a file format and implement the appropriate parsers for rule extraction and fuzzy inference engines can be a real pain, taking as much time as implementing the rule extraction algorithm itself. I would much rather have used something like FML for my work."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A complete overview of FML and related applications can be found in the book titled ''On the power of Fuzzy Markup Language''&lt;ref name=Acampora2013/&gt; edited by Giovanni Acampora, Chang-Shing Lee, Vincenzo Loia and Mei-Hui Wang, and published by Springer in the series ''Studies on Fuzziness and Soft Computing''.

==FML at work: syntax, grammar and hardware synthesis==
FML allows fuzzy systems to be coded through a collection of correlated semantic tags capable of modeling the different components of a classical fuzzy controller such as knowledge base, rule base, fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules. Therefore, the FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. In order to design a well-formed XML-based language, an FML context-free grammar is defined by means of a XML schema which defines name, type and attributes characterized each XML element. However, since an FML program represents only a static view of a fuzzy logic controller, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator (XSLT) is provided to change this static view to a computable version. Indeed, XSLTs modules are able to convert the FML-based fuzzy controller in a general purpose computer language using an XSL file containing the translation description. At this level, the control is executable for the hardware. In short, FML is essentially composed by three layers:
* XML in order to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control;
* a XML Schema in order to define the legal building blocks;
* eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) in order to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific programming language.

===FML Syntax===
FML syntax is composed of XML tags and attributes which describe the different components of a fuzzy logic controller listed below:
*fuzzy knowledge base;
*fuzzy rule base;
*inference engine
*fuzzification subsystem;
*defuzzification subsystem.

In detail, the opening tag of each FML program is &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyController&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which represents the fuzzy controller under modeling. This tag has two attributes: ''name'' and ''ip''. The first attribute permits to specify the name of fuzzy controller and ''ip'' is used to define the location of controller in a computer network. The fuzzy knowledge base is defined by means of the tag &lt;code&gt;&lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which maintains the set of fuzzy concepts used to model the fuzzy rule base. In order to define the fuzzy
concept related controlled system, &lt;code&gt;&lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  tag uses a set of nested tags:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyVariable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines the fuzzy concept;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines a linguistic term describing the fuzzy concept; 
*a set of tags defining a shape of fuzzy sets are related to fuzzy terms. 
The attributes of &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyVariable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag are: ''name'', ''scale'', ''domainLeft'', ''domainRight'', ''type'' and, for only an output, ''accumulation'', ''defuzzifier'' and ''defaultValue''. The ''name'' attribute defines the name of fuzzy concept, for instance, ''temperature''; ''scale'' is used to define the scale used to measure the fuzzy concept, for instance, ''Celsius degree''; ''domainLeft'' and ''domainRight'' are used to model the universe of discourse of fuzzy concept, that is, the set of real values related to fuzzy concept, for instance [0°,40°] in the case of Celsius degree; the position of fuzzy concept into rule (consequent part or antecedent part) is defined by ''type'' attribute (input/output); ''accumulation'' attribute defines the method of accumulation that is a method that permits the combination of results of a variable of each rule in a final result; ''defuzzifier'' attribute defines the method used to execute the conversion from a fuzzy set, obtained after aggregation process, into a numerical value to give it in output to system; ''defaultValue'' attribute defines a real value used only when no rule has fired for the variable at issue.
As for tag &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it uses two attributes: ''name'' used to identify the linguistic value associate with fuzzy concept and ''complement'', a boolean attribute that defines, if it is true, it is necessary to consider the complement of membership function defined by given parameters. Fuzzy shape tags, used to complete the definition of fuzzy concept, are:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;TRIANGULARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;RIGHTLINEARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;LEFTLINEARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;PISHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;GAUSSIANSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;RIGHTGAUSSIANSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;LEFTGAUSSIANSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;TRAPEZOIDSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;SSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;ZSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;RECTANGULARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;SINGLETONSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Every shaping tag uses a set of attributes which defines the real outline of corresponding fuzzy set. The number of these attributes depends on the chosen fuzzy set shape.

In order to make an example, let us consider the ''Tipper Inference System'' described in Mathwork Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox Tutorial. This Mamdani system is used to regulate the tipping in, for example, a restaurant. It has got two variables in input (''food'' and ''service'') and one in output (''tip''). FML code for modeling part of knowledge base of this fuzzy system containing variables ''food'' and ''tip'' is shown below.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;FuzzyController name="newSystem" ip="127.0.0.1"&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
        &lt;FuzzyVariable name="food" domainleft="0.0" domainright="10.0" scale="" type="input"&gt;        
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="delicious" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;LeftLinearShape Param1="5.5" Param2="10.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="rancid" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="0.0" Param2="2.0" Param3="5.5"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
        &lt;/FuzzyVariable&gt;
        ...........
    	&lt;FuzzyVariable name="tip" domainleft="0.0" domainright="20.0" scale="Euro" defaultValue="0.0" defuzzifier="COG"        
 	               accumulation="MAX"  type="output"&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="average" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="5.0" Param2="10.0" Param3="15.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="cheap" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="0.0" Param2="5.0" Param3="10.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="generous" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="10.0" Param2="15.0" Param3="20.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
        &lt;/FuzzyVariable&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
    ............
&lt;/FuzzyController&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A special tag that can furthermore be used to define a fuzzy shape is &lt;code&gt;&lt;UserShape&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This tag is used to customize fuzzy shape (custom shape). The custom shape modeling is performed via a set of &lt;code&gt;&lt;Point&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags that lists the extreme points of geometric area defining the custom fuzzy shape. Obviously, the attributes used in &lt;code&gt;&lt;Point&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag are x and y coordinates. 
As for rule base component, FML allows to define a set of rule bases, each one of them describes a different behavior of system. The root of each rule base is modeled by &lt;code&gt;&lt;RuleBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag which defines a fuzzy rule set. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;RuleBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag uses five attributes: ''name'', ''type'', ''activationMethod'', ''andMethod'' and ''orMethod''. Obviously, the ''name'' attribute uniquely identifies the rule base. The ''type'' attribute permits to specify the kind of fuzzy controller (Mamdani or TSK) respect to the rule base at issue. The ''activationMethod'' attribute defines the method used to implication process; the ''andMethod'' and ''orMethod'' attribute define, respectively, the ''and'' and ''or'' algorithm to use by default.  In order to define the single rule the &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rule&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used. The attributes used by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rule&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag are: ''name'', ''connector'', ''operator'' and ''weight''. The ''name'' attribute permits to identify the rule; ''connector'' is used to define the logical operator used to connect the different clauses in antecedent part (and/or); ''operator'' defines the algorithm to use for chosen connector; ''weight'' defines the importance of rule during inference engine step. The definition of antecedent and consequent rule part is obtained by using &lt;code&gt;&lt;Antecedent&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;Consequent&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. &lt;code&gt;&lt;Clause&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to model the fuzzy clauses in antecedent and consequent part. This tag use the attribute ''modifier'' to describe a modification to term used in the clause. The possible values for this attribute are: ''above'', ''below'', ''extremely'', ''intensify'', ''more or less'', ''norm'', ''not'', ''plus'', ''slightly'', ''somewhat'', ''very'', ''none''. To complete the definition of fuzzy clause the nested &lt;code&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;&lt;Term&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags have to be used. A sequence of &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rule&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags realizes a fuzzy rule base.

As example, let us consider a Mamdani rule composed by ''(food is rancid) OR (service is very poor)'' as antecedent and ''tip is cheap'' as consequent. The antecedent part is formed by two clauses: ''(food is rancid)'' and ''(service is poor)''. The first antecedent clause uses ''food'' as variable and ''rancid'' as fuzzy term, whereas, the second antecedent clause uses ''service'' as a variable, ''poor'' as fuzzy term and ''very'' as modifier; the consequent clause uses ''tip'' as a fuzzy variable and ''cheap'' as a fuzzy term. The complete rule is:

'''IF''' ''(food is rancid)'' '''OR''' ''(service is very poor)'' '''THEN''' ''(tip is cheap)''.

Let us see how FML defines a rule base with this rule.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;RuleBase name="Rulebase1" activationMethod="MIN" andMethod="MIN" orMethod="MAX" type="mamdani"&gt;
      &lt;Rule name="reg1" connector="or" operator="MAX" weight="1.0"&gt;
           &lt;Antecedent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;food&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;rancid&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
                &lt;Clause modifier="very"&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;service&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;poor&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Antecedent&gt;
            &lt;Consequent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;tip&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;cheap&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Consequent&gt;
      &lt;/Rule&gt;
      ............
&lt;/RuleBase&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, let us see a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang system that regulates the same issue. The most important difference with Mamdani system is the definition of a different output variable ''tip''. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;TSKVariable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to define an output variable that can be used in a rule of a Tsk system. This tag has the same attributes of a Mamdani output variable except for the ''domainleft'' and ''domainright'' attribute because a variable of this kind (called tsk-variable) hasn’t a universe of discourse. The nested &lt;code&gt;&lt;TSKTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag represents a linear function and so it is completely different from &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;TSKValue&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to define the coefficients of linear function. The following crunch of FML code shows the definition of output variable ''tip'' in a Tsk system.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;FuzzyController name="newSystem" ip="127.0.0.1"&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
 	.......
        &lt;TSKVariable name="tip" scale="null" accumulation="MAX" defuzzifier="WA" type="output"&gt;
            &lt;TSKTerm name="average" order="0"&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.6&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
            &lt;/TSKTerm&gt;
            &lt;TSKTerm name="cheap" order="1"&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.9&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;5.6&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;6.0&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
            &lt;/TSKTerm&gt;
            &lt;TSKTerm name="generous" order="1"&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;0.6&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.3&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.0&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
            &lt;/TSKTerm&gt;
        &lt;/TSKVariable&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
    ..........
&lt;/FuzzyController&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The FML definition of rule base component in a Tsk system doesn’t change a lot. The only different thing is that the &lt;code&gt;&lt;Clause&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag doesn’t have the modifier attribute.

As example, let us consider a tsk rule composed by ''(food is rancid) OR (service is very poor)'' as antecedent and, as consequent, ''tip=1.9+5.6*food+6.0*service'' that can be written as ''tip is cheap'' in an implicitly way. So the rule can be written in this way:
	
'''IF''' ''(food is rancid)'' '''OR''' ''(service is very poor)'' '''THEN''' ''(tip is cheap)''.

Let us see how FML defines a rule base with this rule.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;RuleBase name="Rulebase1" activationMethod="MIN" andMethod="MIN" orMethod="MAX" type="tsk"&gt;
&lt;Rule name="reg1" connector="or" operator="MAX" weight="1.0"&gt;
            &lt;Antecedent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;food&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;rancid&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;service&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;poor&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Antecedent&gt;
            &lt;Consequent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;tip&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;cheap&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Consequent&gt;
        &lt;/Rule&gt;
	............
&lt;/RuleBase&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===FML Grammar===
The FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. However, in order to realize a well-formed XML-based language, an FML context-free grammar is necessary and described in the following. The FML context-free grammar is modeled by XML file in the form of a XML Schema Document (XSD) which expresses the set of rules to which a document must conform in order to be considered a ''valid'' FML document. Based on the previous definition, a portion of the FML XSD regarding the knowledge base definition is given below.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"&gt;

===FML Synthesis===
Since an FML program realizes only a static view of a fuzzy system, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator (XSLT) is provided to change this static view to a computable version. In particular, the XSLT technology is used convert a fuzzy controller description into a general-purpose computer language to be computed on several hardware platforms. Currently, a XSLT converting FML program in runnable Java code has been implemented. In this way, thanks to the transparency capabilities provided by Java virtual machines, it is possible to obtain a fuzzy controller modeled in high level way by means of FML and runnable on a plethora of hardware architectures through Java technologies. However, XSLT can be also used for converting FML programs in legacy languages related to a particular hardware or in other general purpose languages.

'''''Galileo's Middle Finger''''' is a 2015 book about the [[Medical ethics|ethics of medical research]] by [[Alice Dreger]], an American bioethicist and author.&lt;ref name="Northwestern"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |title=Alice Dreger Bio |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=Apr 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419201840/http://www.bioethics.northwestern.edu/faculty/profile.html?xid=17073 |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dreger explores the relationship between science and [[social justice]] by discussing a number of scientific controversies. These include the debates surrounding [[intersex]] genital surgery, [[autogynephilia]], and anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]]'s work.

==Synopsis==

The first part of ''Galileo's Middle Finger'' recounts Dreger's activism against surgical "correction" of [[intersex]] individuals' genitalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/barronlerner/2015/03/13/science-activism-and-truth-galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger/ | author = Lerner, Barron | date = March 13, 2015 | title = Science, Activism And Truth: 'Galileo's Middle Finger' by Alice Dreger | work = Forbes.com | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some surgeons called this "total urogenital mobilization" which is "...ripping out everything that didn't seem right to the doctor and rebuilding a girl's genitals from scratch using Frankenstein stitches..."&lt;ref name="gal47"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, her book discusses the [[intersex medical interventions]] that some intersex children in the United States undergo. Based on her interactions with the intersex community as well as her own research, she advocated that genital surgery for intersex children be postponed until the individual is old enough to make an informed decision, in the absence of any evidence that the benefits of such surgery outweighed its already reported risks.

The second section provides her analysis of the controversy surrounding ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'' (2003), by sex researcher and psychologist [[J. Michael Bailey]]. In that book, Bailey summarized research on [[Blanchard's transsexualism typology]] in a way that Dreger says is scientifically accurate, well-intended, and sympathetic, but insensitive to its political implications. Dreger writes that "Bailey made the mistake of thinking that openly accepting and promoting the truth about people's identities would be understood as the same as accepting them and helping them, as he felt he was".&lt;ref name="gal65"&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, many activists in the trans community objected to the contention that their transition was sexually motivated.

Bailey's book was based on the academic publications of psychologist [[Ray Blanchard]], which Bailey interpreted for a lay audience. The larger audience and potential to influence public beliefs about transgenderism led a prominent transgender activist, [[Lynn Conway]], to campaign against Bailey.  Dreger concludes that the accusations levied against Bailey by Conway and others did not hold up to scrutiny. "Conway developed what became an enormous Web site hosted by the University of Michigan for the purpose of taking down Bailey and his ideas [and] that largely enabled me to figure out what she had really done and how Bailey had essentially been set up in an effort to shut him up about [[autogynephilia]]".&lt;ref name="gal65" /&gt; Dreger wrote that some activists had turned their horror at Bailey's findings into a very public vendetta against him and his family, including thinly veiled allegations that he sexually abused his children.&lt;ref name="bartlett"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bartlett, Tom | date = March 10, 2015 | title = Reluctant Crusader: Why Alice Dreger’s writing on sex and science makes liberals so angry | work = [[Chronicle of Higher Education]] | url = http://chronicle.com/article/Reluctant-Crusader/228377/?cid=gn | accessdate = March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After researching the allegations against Bailey, she concluded that they were false.  Moreover, Dreger observed that "the most interesting mail, from my perspective, came from trans women who wrote to tell me that, though they weren't thrilled with Bailey's oversimplifications of their lives, they also had been harassed and intimidated by [[Andrea James]] for daring to speak anything other than the politically popular 'I was always just a woman trapped in a man's body' story. They thanked me for standing up to a bully."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dreger | first = Alice Domurat | title = Galileo's Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science | publisher = Penguin Press | location = New York | year = 2015 | isbn = 9781594206085 | page = 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dreger also investigates the controversy surrounding biologist [[Randy Thornhill]] and anthropologist Craig T. Palmer's ''[[A Natural History of Rape]]'' (2000) and accusations by Patrick Tierney in his book ''[[Darkness in El Dorado]]'' that anthropologist [[Napoleon Chagnon]] seriously abused the [[Yanomamo]]. She returns to the issue of intersex in an examination of geneticist [[Maria New]]'s research in prenatal [[dexamethasone]] use in cases of [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]].

==Reception==

''[[The New York Times]]'' described the book as "a rant, a manifesto, a treasury of evocative new terms ([[sissyphobia]], [[autogynephilia]], [[Phall-O-Meter|phall-o-meter]]) and an account of the author’s transformation" from activist to scientist and back again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/19/books/review/galileos-middle-finger-by-alice-dreger.html?_r=0 |title=‘Galileo’s Middle Finger,’ by Alice Dreger |last1=Dobbs |first1=David |date=April 17, 2015 |website= |publisher= [[The New York Times]] |access-date=2015-07-20 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' describes the book as "highly readable" with an important message: "Science and social justice require each other to be healthy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Miller, Laura | title = "Galileo’s Middle Finger": When scholars and activists clash over controversial research, we all lose.

The book was at first selected as 2016 finalist for a [[Lambda Literary Award]] in the LGBTQ nonfiction category, but the foundation rescinded this nomination on March 22, 2016, describing the book as "inconsistent with its mission of affirming LGBTQ lives."&lt;ref name="Lambda Literary award withdrawal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/jessesingal/status/712366965466206208|title=Lambda Literary award withdrawal|accessdate=Mar 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brynn Tannehill, writing for ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', compared arguments made in the book to the arguments made by anti-transgender groups like the [[Family Research Council]]. She wrote that the book promoted a theory that trans people are "just self-hating homosexual men who believe they could have guilt-free sex if they were female and heterosexual men with an out-of-control fetish (autogynephilia)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tannehill |first=Brynn |date=March 25, 2016 |title=Lambda Literary Foundation Snuffs Out Anti-Trans Scandal |url=http://www.advocate.com/commentary/2016/3/25/lambda-literary-foundation-snuffs-out-anti-trans-scandal |newspaper=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |access-date=April 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinnia Jones, a trans activist writer, criticised the book as providing an "incomplete and sensationalized" depiction of the subject which selectively covers claims made by proponents, ignoring those which might present it in a worse light. She also highlighted perceived methodological flaws with the research conducted by Blanchard and others, especially a willingness to ignore data points which are inconsistent with their hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Zinna|url=http://genderanalysis.net/2016/04/alice-dreger-autogynephilia-and-the-misrepresentation-of-trans-sexualities-book-review-galileos-middle-finger/|accessdate=2017-07-04|date=2016-04-01|title=Alice Dreger, autogynephilia, and the misrepresentation of trans sexualities (Book review: Galileo’s Middle Finger)|website=genderanalysis.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermann Joseph Muller''' (December 21, 1890 – April 5, 1967) was an American [[geneticist]], educator, and [[Nobel laureate]] best known for his work on the physiological and genetic effects of [[radiation]] ([[mutagenesis]]), as well as his outspoken political beliefs.&lt;ref name="carlson"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Elof Axel Carlson|Carlson, Elof Axel]] |title=Genes, radiation, and society: the life and work of H. J. Muller |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y |year=1981 |pages= |isbn=0-8014-1304-4 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muller frequently warned of long-term dangers of [[radioactive fallout]] from [[nuclear war]] and [[nuclear testing]], which resulted in greater public scrutiny of these practices.

==Early life==
Muller was born in [[New York City]], the son of Frances (Lyons) and Hermann Joseph Muller, Sr., an artisan who worked with metals. Muller was a third-generation American whose
father's ancestors were originally Catholic and came to the United States from [[Koblenz]].&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt; His mother's family was of mixed Jewish (descended from Spanish and Portuguese Jews) and Anglican background, and had come from Britain.&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1946/muller-bio.html?print=1 |title=Hermann J. Muller - Biographical |work=NobelPrice.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his first cousins are [[Herbert J. Muller]] and [[Alfred Kroeber]] whose daughter is [[Ursula Le Guin]].&lt;ref name="nas biography"/&gt; As an adolescent, he attended a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church and considered himself a [[pantheist]]; in high school, he became an [[atheist]]. He excelled in the public schools. At 16, he entered [[Columbia University|Columbia College]]. From his first semester, he was interested in biology; he became an early convert of the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian]]-[[chromosome]] theory of heredity — and the concept of genetic [[mutation]]s and [[natural selection]] as the basis for [[evolution]]. He formed a biology club and also became a proponent of [[eugenics]]; the connections between biology and society would be his perennial concern. Muller earned a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 17-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller remained at Columbia (the pre-eminent American zoology program at the time, due to [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E. B. Wilson]] and his students) for graduate school. He became interested in the ''[[Drosophila]]'' genetics work of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s fly lab after undergraduate bottle washers [[Alfred Sturtevant]] and [[Calvin Bridges]] joined his biology club. In 1911-1912, he studied metabolism at [[Cornell University]], but remained involved with Columbia. He followed the [[drosophilist]]s as the first genetic maps emerged from Morgan's experiments, and joined Morgan's group in 1912 (after two years of informal participation).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 37-69&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fly group, Muller's contributions were primarily theoretical - explanations for experimental results and ideas and predictions for new experiments. In the emerging collaborative culture of the drosophilists, however, credit was assigned based on results rather than ideas; Muller felt cheated when he was left out of major publications.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 70-90; for more on the culture and norms of the fly lab, see {{cite book |author=Kohler, Robert E. |title=Lords of the fly: Drosophila genetics and the experimental life |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1994 |pages= |isbn=0-226-45063-5 |oclc= |doi= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1914, [[Julian Huxley]] offered Muller a position at the recently founded William Marsh Rice Institute, now [[Rice University]]; he hurried to complete his [[Doctor of philosophy]] degree and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915-1916 academic year (his degree was issued in 1916). At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued ''Drosophila'' lab work. In 1918, he proposed an explanation for the dramatic discontinuous alterations in ''[[Oenothera larmarckiana]]'' that were the basis of [[Hugo de Vries]]'s
theory of [[mutationism]]: "balanced lethals" allowed the accumulation of recessive mutations, and rare [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]] events resulted in the sudden expression of these hidden traits. In other words, de Vries's experiments were explainable by the Mendelian-chromosome theory. Muller's work was increasingly focused on [[mutation rate]] and [[lethal mutation]]s. In 1918, Morgan, short-handed because many of his students and assistants were drafted for the U.S. entry into [[World War I]], convinced Muller to return to Columbia to teach and to expand his experimental program.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 91-108&lt;/ref&gt;

At Columbia, Muller and his collaborator and longtime friend [[Edgar Altenburg]] continued the investigation of lethal mutations. The primary method for detecting such mutations was to measure the sex ratios of the offspring of female flies. They predicted the ratio would vary from 1:1 due to recessive mutations on the X chromosome, which would be expressed only in males (which lacked the functional allele on a second X chromosome). Muller found a strong temperature dependence in mutation rate, leading him to believe that spontaneous mutation was the dominant mode (and to initially discount the role of external factors such as ionizing radiation or chemical agents). In 1920, Muller and Altenburg coauthored a seminal paper in ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' on "modifier genes" that determine the size of mutant ''Drosophila'' wings. In 1919, Muller made the important discovery of a mutant (later found to be a [[chromosomal inversion]]) that appeared to suppress crossing over, which opened up new avenues in mutation-rate studies. However, his appointment at Columbia was not continued; he accepted an offer from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] and left Columbia after the summer of 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 109-119&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller taught at the University of Texas from 1920 until 1932. Soon after returning to Texas, he married mathematics professor [[Jessie Marie Jacobs Muller Offermann|Jessie Marie Jacobs]], whom he had courted previously. In his early years at Texas, Muller's ''Drosophila'' work was slow going; the data from his mutation rate studies were difficult to interpret. In 1923, he began using [[radium]] and [[X-rays]],&lt;ref name="Hamilton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=Vivien|title=The Secrets of Life: Historian Luis Campos resurrects radium's role in early genetics research|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=44–45 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-secrets-of-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the relationship between radiation and mutation was difficult to measure because such radiation also sterilized the flies. In this period, he also became involved with eugenics and human genetics. He carried out a study of twins separated at birth that seemed to indicate a strong hereditary component to [[I.Q.]] Muller was critical of the new directions of the eugenics movement (such as anti-immigration), but was hopeful about the prospects for positive eugenics.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 120-140&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932, at the [[International Eugenics Conference| Third International Eugenics Congress]], Muller gave a speech and stated, "eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/eugenics-crusade/#part01 |title=The Eugenics Crusade What's Wrong with Perfect? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|date=October 16, 2018 |website= |publisher=PBS |access-date=November 4, 2018 |quote=There is no scientific basis for the conclusion that the socially lower class have genetically inferior intellectual equipment. Certain slum districts of our cities are factories for criminality among those who happen to be born in them.  Under these circumstances, it is society, not the individual, which is the real criminal and which stands to be judged.  Eugenics might yet perfect the human race, but only in a society consciously organized for the common good.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of X-ray mutagenesis===
In 1926, a series of major breakthroughs began. In November, Muller carried out two experiments with varied doses of X-rays, the second of which used the crossing over suppressor stock ("ClB") he had found in 1919. A clear, quantitative connection between radiation and lethal mutations quickly emerged. Muller's discovery created a media sensation after he delivered a paper entitled "The Problem of Genetic Modification" at the Fifth International Congress of Genetics in [[Berlin]]; it would make him one of the better-known public intellectuals of the early 20th century. By 1928, others had replicated his dramatic results, expanding them to other [[model organism]]s, such as [[wasp]]s and [[maize]]. In the following years, he began publicizing the likely dangers of radiation exposure in humans (such as physicians who frequently operate X-ray equipment).&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 141-164&lt;/ref&gt;

His lab grew quickly, but it shrank again following the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. Especially after the stock market crash, Muller was increasingly pessimistic about the prospects of [[capitalism]]. Some of his visiting lab members were from the [[USSR]], and he helped edit and distribute an illegal leftist student newspaper, ''The Spark''. It was a difficult period for Muller both scientifically and personally; his marriage was falling apart, and he was increasingly dissatisfied with his life in Texas. Meanwhile, the waning of the eugenics movement, ironically hastened by his own work pointing to the previously ignored connections between environment and genetics, meant that his ideas on the future of human evolution had reduced impact in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 165-183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in Europe===
In September 1932, Muller moved to Berlin to work with the Russian expatriate geneticist [[Nikolay Timofeeff-Ressovsky]]; a trip intended as a limited sabbatical stretched into an eight-year, five-country journey. In Berlin, he met two physicists who would later be significant to the biology community: [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Max Delbrück]]. The [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] movement was precipitating the rapid emigration of scientific talent from Germany, and Muller was particularly opposed to the politics of National Socialism. The FBI was investigating Muller because of his involvement with ''The Spark'', so he chose instead to go to the Soviet Union (an environment better suited to his political beliefs). In 1933, Muller and his wife reconciled, and their son [[David E. Muller]] and she moved with Hermann to [[Leningrad]]. There, at the Institute of Genetics, he imported the basic equipment for a ''Drosophila'' lab—including the flies—and set up shop. The Institute was moved to [[Moscow]] in 1934, and Muller and his wife were divorced in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 184-203&lt;/ref&gt;

In the USSR, Muller supervised a large and productive lab, and organized work on medical genetics. Most of his work involved further explorations of genetics and radiation. There he completed his eugenics book, ''Out of the Night'', the main ideas of which dated to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Muller, ''Out of the Night: A Biologist's View of the Future'' (New York: Vangard, 1935), p. v.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1936, however, [[Joseph Stalin]]'s repressive policies and the rise of [[Lysenkoism]] was making the USSR an increasingly problematic place to live and work. Muller and many of the Russian genetics community did what they could to oppose [[Trofim Lysenko]] and his [[Lamarckism|Larmarckian]] evolutionary theory, but Muller was soon forced to leave the Soviet Union after Stalin read a translation of his eugenics book and was "displeased by it, and...ordered an attack prepared against it."&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 204-234; quotation from p 233, correspondence from Muller to Julian Huxley, March 9, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

Muller, with about 250 strains of ''Drosophila'', moved to [[Edinburgh]] in September 1937, after  brief stays in [[Madrid]] and [[Paris]]. In 1938, with war on the horizon, he began looking for a permanent position back in the United States. He also began courting Dorothea "Thea" Kantorowicz, a German refugee; they were married in May 1939. The Seventh International Congress on Genetics was held in Edinburgh later that year; Muller wrote a "Geneticists' Manifesto"&lt;ref&gt;"The 'Geneticists Manifesto'," originally published in ''Journal of Heredity'', 1939, 30:371-73; reprinted in H. J. Muller, ''Studies in Genetics: The Selected Papers of H. J. Muller'' (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1962), pp. 545-548.&lt;/ref&gt; in response to the question: "How could the world's population be improved most effectively genetically?" He also engaged in a debate with the perennial genetics gadfly [[Richard Goldschmidt]] over the existence of the gene, for which  little direct physical evidence remained.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 235-273&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[File:First Street 1001, Muller House, Vinegar Hill HD.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Muller's house in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]]]

When Muller returned to the United States in 1940, he took an untenured research position at [[Amherst College]], in the department of [[Otto C. Glaser]]. After the U.S. entry into [[World War II]], his position was extended indefinitely and expanded to include teaching. His ''Drosophila'' work in this period focused on measuring the rate of spontaneous (as opposed to radiation-induced) mutations. Muller's publication rate decreased greatly in this period, from a combination of lack of lab workers and experimentally challenging projects. However, he also worked as an adviser in the [[Manhattan Project]] (though he did not know that was what it was), as well as a study of the mutational effects of [[radar]]. Muller's appointment was ended after the 1944–1945 academic year, and despite difficulties stemming from his socialist political activities, he found a position as professor of zoology at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 274–288&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, he lived in a [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] house in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]'s [[Vinegar Hill Historic District|Vinegar Hill]] neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. ''City of Bloomington Interim Report''. Bloomington: City of Bloomington, 2004-04, 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Muller was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], "for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X-rays". Genetics, and especially the physical and physiological nature of the gene, was becoming a central topic in biology, and X-ray mutagenesis was a key to many recent advances, among them [[George Beadle]] and [[Edward Tatum]]'s work on ''[[Neurospora]]'' that established in 1941 the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Carlson, pp 304-318"&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 304–318&lt;/ref&gt; In Muller's Nobel Prize lecture, he argued that no threshold dose of radiation existed that did not produce [[mutagenesis]], which led to the adoption of the [[linear no-threshold model]] of radiation on cancer risks.&lt;ref name="calabrese 2"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Calabrese, E. J.| title = Muller’s Nobel lecture on dose–response for ionizing radiation:ideology or science?| publisher = Springer| date = 30 June 2011| url =http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/freshman_seminar/Radiation/Calabrese-Muller-1-1.pdf| accessdate =30 December 2011| doi = 10.1007/s00204-011-0728-8| journal = Archives of Toxicology| volume = 85| issue = 4| pages = 1495–1498| pmid=21717110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nobel Prize, in the wake of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], focused public attention on a subject Muller had been publicizing for two decades - the dangers of radiation. In 1952, [[nuclear fallout]] became a public issue; since [[Operation Crossroads]], more and more evidence had been leaking out about [[radiation sickness]] and death caused by [[nuclear testing]]. Muller and many other scientists pursued an array of political activities to defuse the threat of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]]. With the [[Castle Bravo]] fallout controversy in 1954, the issue became even more urgent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In 1955, Muller was one of 11 prominent intellectuals to sign the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], the upshot of which was the first [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|1957 Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs]], which addressed the control of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="jf"&gt;John Bellamy Foster (2009). ''The Ecological Revolution: Making Peace with the Planet'', Monthly Review Press, New York, pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp. 336–379.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a signatory (with many other scientists) of the 1958 petition to the United Nations, calling for an end to nuclear weapons testing, which was initiated by the Nobel Prize-winning chemist [[Linus Pauling]].&lt;ref name="jf"/&gt;

Muller's opinions on the effect of radiation on mutagenesis, however, had been criticized by some scientists; geneticist [[James F. Crow]] called Muller's view "alarmist" and wrote that it created in the public "an irrational fear of low-level radiation relative to other risks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Muller, Dobzhansky, and Overdominance|author=James F.

Muller was awarded the [[Linnean Society of London]]'s [[Darwin-Wallace Medal]] in 1958 and the Kimber Genetics Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasonline.org/programs/awards/kimber-genetics-award.html |title=Kimber Genetics Award |work=National Academy of Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as president of the American Humanist Association from 1956 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://americanhumanist.org/about/past-aha-presidents/ |title=Past AHA Presidents |work=American Humanist Association }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Mathematical Society]] selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller, H.

H. J. Muller and science-fiction writer [[Ursula Le Guin]] were [[second cousins]]; his father (Hermann J. Muller Sr.) and her father's mother (Johanna Muller Kroeber) were siblings, the children of Nicholas Müller, who immigrated to the United States in 1848, and at that time dropped the umlaut from his name. Another cousin was [[Herbert J. Muller]], whose grandfather Otto was another son of Nicholas and a sibling of Hermann Sr. and Johanna.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, ''Genes, Radiation, and Society'', pp 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Muller is survived by his daughter, Helen J. Muller, now a professor emerita at the [[University of New Mexico]], who has a daughter, Mala Htun. His son, [[David E. Muller]], a professor emeritus of mathematics and computer science at the [[University of Illinois]] and at [[New Mexico State University]], died in 2008 in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. David's mother was Jessie Jacobs Muller Offermann, Hermann's first wife. Helen's mother was Dorothea Kantorowicz Muller, Hermann's second wife.&lt;ref name="nas biography"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/muller-hermann.pdf |title= Hermann Joseph Muller 1890—1967 | author=Elof Axel Carlson |work=National Academy of Sciences |date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12380">{{about|Hermetic poetry|Hermeticism (philosophical and religious beliefs)|Hermetic (disambiguation)}}

'''Hermeticism''' in poetry, or '''hermetic poetry''', is a form of obscure and difficult poetry, as of the [[Symbolist]] school, wherein the language and imagery are subjective, and where the suggestive power of the sound of words is as important as their meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. F. Ebeling, ''The secret history of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from ancient to modern times'' (Transl. D. Lorton), [[Cornell University Press]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The name alludes to the mythical [[Hermes Trismegistus]],  supposed author of mystic doctrines composed in the [[Neoplatonic]] tradition.

Hermeticism was influential in the [[Renaissance]], after the translation of these [[Neoplatonic]] texts by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. Within the [[Novecento Italiano]], Hermetic poetry became an [[Italy|Italian]] literary movement in the 1920s and 1930s, developing between the two world wars.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Major features of this movement were reduction to essentials, abolishment of [[punctuation]], and brief, synthetic compositions, at times resulting in short works of only two or three verses.

==Terminology==
The term '''''ermetismo''''' was coined in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[literary critic]] [[Francesco Flora]] (although with a very generic and superficial connotation) in 1936 and recalls a mystic conception of the poetic word because it makes reference to the legendary figure of [[Hermes Trismegistus]]  (''Thrice-Great Hermes'') going back to [[hellenistic]] times, with writings such as ''[[Asclepius]]'' and the ''[[Hermetica|Corpus Hermeticum]]'' attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;Hermes Trismegistus is described in the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] in a [[Euhemerus|Euhemerist]] fashion, as a man who became a god, or as a man who was the son of a god. During the [[Renaissance]] it was accepted that Hermes Trismegistus was a contemporary of [[Moses]], however after [[Isaac Casaubon|Casaubon’s]] dating of the Hermetic writings as no earlier than the second or third century CE, the whole of Renaissance Hermeticism collapsed. Cf. W. J. Haanegraaff, ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', Brill, Leiden, [[New York City]], 1996, p.390&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year (1936), [[Italian poetry|Italian poet]] [[Carlo Bo]] published an [[essay]] on the literary [[magazine]] ''[[Il Frontespizio]]'', by the title "Letteratura come vita (Literature as a way of life)", containing the theoretical-methodological fundamentals of hermetic poetry.
[[File:Salvatore Quasimodo 1959.jpg|thumb|Hermetic poet and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel laureate]] [[Salvatore Quasimodo]]]]
On the literary plane, the term ''Hermeticism'' thus highlights a type of poetry which has a ''close'' (i.e., ''[[hermetic seal|hermetic]]'', hidden, sealed)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Hermetic'' on [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hermetic Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; character, complex in its construction and usually achieved by a sequence of [[analogy|analogies]] difficult to interpret.

At the movement's core—which was modelled after the great [[France|French]] [[decadent movement|decadentist]] poets   [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]—was a group of Italian poets, called ''hermeticists'', who followed the style of [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] and [[Eugenio Montale]].

==Themes and styles==
Rejecting any direct social and political involvement, in order to detach themselves from the [[fascist]] culture, the hermetic group used a difficult and closed style in the analogic form, with a constant emotional introspection. Among these young intellectuals, some took strong [[anti-fascist]] stances, with [[Romano Bilenchi]], [[Elio Vittorini]], [[Alfonso Gatto]] and [[Vasco Pratolini]] being the main dissidents. "Tradition is Hermeticism's best ally".&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo Bo]], in his [[essay]] "Letteratura come vita (Literature as a way of life)", ''[[Frontespizio]]'' 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermetic poetry opposes verbal manipulation and the ease of mass communication, which began taking place during [[Europe]]'s dictatorial years, with the increasing brain-washing [[propaganda]] of the [[nazism|nazi]]-[[fascist]] regimes. Poetry therefore retreats into itself and assumes the task of returning sense to words, giving them back their [[semantics|semantic]] meaning, using them only when strictly necessary.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[Haiku]] poetry may possess similar features and functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hermetic poets pursue the ideal of a "pure poesy", an essential composition without educational aims. Their central theme is the desperate sense of loneliness modern man experiences, having lost the ancient values and [[myth]]s of the [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[positivism|positivistic]] [[society]], no longer retaining any certitudes to refer to. Man lives in an incomprehensible world, ravaged by wars and enslaved by dictatorships, therefore the poet has a disheartened vision of life, without illusions, and repudiates the word as an act of communication in order to give it an evocative sense only. So, hermetic poetry is poetry of moods, of interior reflection expressed by a subdued and pensive tone, through a refined and evocative language, concealing direct intimations to experience in a play of allusions.

To describe the fleeting course of human life, [[Salvatore Quasimodo|Quasimodo]] would compose this famous hermetic poem ''"Ed è subito sera"'':
:''Ognuno sta solo sul cuor della terra''
:''trafitto da un raggio di sole''
:''ed è subito sera''&lt;ref&gt;(Approx transl., ''Everyone stands alone on the heart of the earth / transfixed by a ray of sunshine / and it is suddenly night'') by [[Salvatore Quasimodo]], [[Nobel Prize]] 1959. Cf. an anthology of his [http://vagheggiando.blogspot.com/2006/05/uomo-del-mio-tempodi-salvatore.html poems].&lt;/ref&gt;

The hermetic poets took their inspiration from [[Ungaretti]]'s second book, ''[[Ungaretti#Published volumes|Sentimento del Tempo ("The Feeling of Time", 1933)]]'', with its complex analogies: one can thus consider [[Ungaretti]] as ''Hermeticism's'' first exponent.

In the field of hermetic literary critique, [[Carlo Bo]] was its main interpreter, with his discourse ''La letteratura come vita ("Literature as a way of life")'' dated 1938, where he wrote the actual  [[manifesto|hermetic manifesto]] by describing poetry as a moment of [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. Among the other critics and theoreticians, to be mentioned are [[Oreste Macrì]], [[Giansiro Ferrata]], [[Luciano Anceschi]] and [[Mario Luzi]].

During the second half of the 1930s, and important hermetic group arose in [[Florence]], around the Italian [[magazine]]s  ''Il Frontespizio'' and ''[[Solaria (magazine)|Solaria]]'' who were inspired by the works of [[Giuseppe Ungaretti]], [[Salvatore Quasimodo]] e [[Arturo Onofri]], and directly referred to [[Europe]]an [[symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], also approaching more recent movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[existentialism]].

[[File:Project SPIRE Inertial Navigation Control.jpg|thumb|300px|A 1950s inertial navigation control developed at MIT.]]

An '''inertial navigation system''' ('''INS''') is a [[navigation]] aid that uses a [[computer]], motion sensors ([[accelerometer]]s), rotation sensors ([[gyroscope]]s), and occasionally magnetic sensors ([[magnetometer]]s) to continuously calculate by [[dead reckoning]] the position, the orientation, and the [[velocity]] (direction and speed of movement) of a moving object without the need for external references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Principles of Inertial  Navigation Seminar on inertial navigation  systems.|url=http://www.aerostudents.com/courses/avionics/InertialNavigationSystems.pdf|website=AeroStudents.com|publisher=Tampere University of Technology, page 5|accessdate=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used on vehicles such as [[ship]]s, [[aircraft]], [[submarine]]s, [[guided missile]]s, and [[spacecraft]]. Other terms used to refer to inertial navigation systems or closely related devices include '''inertial guidance system''', '''inertial instrument''', [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) and many other variations. Older INS systems generally used an [[inertial platform]] as their mounting point to the vehicle and the terms are sometimes considered synonymous.

[[File:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|300px|thumb| Comparison of accuracy of various navigation systems. The radius of the circle indicates the accuracy. A smaller radius corresponds to a higher accuracy.]]

==Overview==
Inertial navigation is a self-contained navigation technique in which measurements provided by accelerometers and gyroscopes are used to track the position and orientation of an object relative to a known starting point, orientation and velocity. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) typically contain three orthogonal rate-gyroscopes and three orthogonal accelerometers, measuring angular velocity and linear acceleration respectively. By processing signals from these devices it is possible to track the position and orientation of a device.

Inertial navigation is used in a wide range of applications including the navigation of aircraft, tactical and strategic missiles, spacecraft, submarines and ships. Recent advances in the construction of [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) have made it possible to manufacture small and light inertial navigation systems. These advances have widened the range of possible applications to include areas such as human and animal [[motion capture]].

An inertial navigation system includes at least a computer and a platform or module containing [[accelerometer]]s, [[gyroscope]]s, or other motion-sensing devices. The INS is initially provided with its position and velocity from another source (a human operator, a GPS satellite receiver, etc.) accompanied with the initial orientation and thereafter computes its own updated position and velocity by integrating information received from the motion sensors. The advantage of an INS is that it requires no external references in order to determine its position, orientation, or velocity once it has been initialized.

An INS can detect a change in its geographic position (a move east or north, for example), a change in its velocity (speed and direction of movement) and a change in its orientation (rotation about an axis). It does this by measuring the linear acceleration and angular velocity applied to the system. Since it requires no external reference (after initialization), it is immune to [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming]] and deception.

Inertial navigation systems are used in many different moving objects. However, their cost and complexity place constraints on the environments in which they are practical for use.

Gyroscopes measure the [[angular velocity]] of the sensor frame with respect to the [[inertial reference frame]]. By using the original orientation of the system in the inertial reference frame as the [[initial condition]] and [[integral|integrating]] the angular velocity, the system's current orientation is known at all times. This can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel the car turn left and right or tilt up and down as the car ascends or descends hills. Based on this information alone, the passenger knows what direction the car is facing but not how fast or slow it is moving, or whether it is sliding sideways.

Accelerometers measure the linear acceleration of the moving vehicle in the sensor or body frame, but in directions that can only be measured relative to the moving system (since the accelerometers are fixed to the system and rotate with the system, but are not aware of their own orientation). This can be thought of as the ability of a blindfolded passenger in a car to feel himself pressed back into his seat as the vehicle accelerates forward or pulled forward as it slows down; and feel himself pressed down into his seat as the vehicle accelerates up a hill or rise up out of their seat as the car passes over the crest of a hill and begins to descend. Based on this information alone, he knows how the vehicle is accelerating relative to itself, that is, whether it is accelerating forward, backward, left, right, up (toward the car's ceiling), or down (toward the car's floor) measured relative to the car, but not the direction relative to the Earth, since he did not know what direction the car was facing relative to the Earth when they felt the accelerations.

However, by tracking both the current angular velocity of the system and the current linear acceleration of the system measured relative to the moving system, it is possible to determine the linear acceleration of the system in the inertial reference frame. Performing integration on the inertial accelerations (using the original velocity as the initial conditions) using the correct [[Kinematics#Fundamental equations|kinematic equations]] yields the inertial velocities of the system and integration again (using the original position as the initial condition) yields the inertial position. In our example, if the blindfolded passenger knew how the car was pointed and what its velocity was before he was blindfolded and if he is able to keep track of both how the car has turned and how it has accelerated and decelerated since, then he can accurately know the current orientation, position, and velocity of the car at any time.

==Error==
All inertial navigation systems suffer from integration drift: small errors in the measurement of acceleration and angular velocity are integrated into progressively larger errors in velocity, which are compounded into still greater errors in position.&lt;ref name="ShuklaTalpin2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sandeep Kumar Shukla|author2=Jean-Pierre Talpin|title=Synthesis of Embedded Software: Frameworks and Methodologies for Correctness by Construction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q_KcJHzND_8C&amp;pg=PA62|date=5 August 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-6400-7|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the new position is calculated from the previous calculated position and the measured acceleration and angular velocity, these errors accumulate roughly proportionally to the time since the initial position was input.  Therefore, the position must be periodically corrected by input from some other type of navigation system.

Accordingly, inertial navigation is usually used to supplement other navigation systems, providing a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with the use of any single system. For example, if, in terrestrial use, the inertially tracked velocity is intermittently updated to zero by stopping, the position will remain precise for a much longer time, a so-called ''zero velocity update''. In aerospace particularly, other measurement systems are used to determine INS inaccuracies, e.g. the Honeywell LaseRefV inertial navigation systems uses [[GPS]] and [[air data computer]] outputs to maintain [[required navigation performance]]. 
The navigation error rises with the lower sensitivity of the sensors used. Currently, devices combining different sensors are being developed, e.g. [[attitude and heading reference system]]. Because the navigation error is mainly influenced by the [[numerical integration]] of angular rates and accelerations, the [[Pressure Reference System]] was developed to use one numerical integration of the angular rate measurements.

[[Estimation theory]] in general and [[Kalman filtering]] in particular, provide a theoretical framework for combining information from various sensors. One of the most common alternative sensors is a [[satellite navigation]] radio such as [[GPS]], which can be used for all kinds of vehicles with direct sky visibility. Indoor applications can use [[pedometer]]s, distance measurement equipment, or other kinds of [[position sensor]]s. By properly combining the information from an INS and other systems ([[GPS/INS]]), the errors in position and velocity are [[numerical stability|stable]]. Furthermore, INS can be used as a short-term fallback while GPS signals are unavailable, for example when a vehicle passes through a tunnel.

In 2011, GPS jamming at the civilian level became a governmental concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gps.gov/spectrum/jamming/|title=GPS.gov: Information About GPS Jamming|website=www.gps.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative ease in ability to jam these systems has motivated the military to reduce navigation dependence on GPS technology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a560811.pdf|title=Position Estimation for Projectiles Using Low-cost Sensors and Flight Dynamics|last=Fairfax|first=Luisa|last2=Fresconi|first2=Frank|date=April 2012|website=|archive-url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a560811.pdf|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, inertial navigation sensors could not be jammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mil-embedded.com/articles/securing-military-gps-spoofing-jamming-vulnerabilities/|title=Securing military GPS from spoofing and jamming vulnerabilities - Military Embedded Systems|website=mil-embedded.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, researchers at the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] reported an inertial measurement unit consisting of micro-electromechanical system triaxial accelerometers and triaxial gyroscopes with an array size of 10 that had a [[Kalman filter]] algorithm to estimate sensor nuisance parameters (errors) and munition position and velocity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each array measures six data points and the system coordinates the data together to deliver a navigation solution. If one sensor consistently over or underestimates distance, the system can adjust, adjusting the corrupted sensor’s contributions to the final calculation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.army.mil/article/111566/new_guided_munition_sensors_are_greater_than_sum_of_their_parts|title=New guided munition sensors are greater than sum of their parts|work=www.army.mil|access-date=2018-07-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of the heuristic algorithm reduced a flight’s calculated distance error from 120m to 40m from the designated target.  The researchers coupled the algorithm with GPS or radar technology to initial and aid the navigation algorithm. At various points during the munition’s flight they would cut off tracking and estimate the accuracy of the munition’s landing. In a forty second flight, 10s and 20s availability of aiding demonstrated little difference in error as both were approximately 35m off target. No noticeable difference was observed when experimentation took place with 100 sensor arrays rather than ten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The researchers indicate this limited experimental data signifies an optimization of navigation technology and a potential reduction in cost of military systems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
{{Globalize/US|section|date=January 2015}}

Inertial navigation systems were originally developed for [[rocket]]s. American rocketry pioneer [[Robert Goddard (scientist)|Robert Goddard]] experimented with rudimentary [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] systems. Dr. Goddard's systems were of great interest to contemporary German pioneers including [[Wernher von Braun]]. The systems entered more widespread use with the advent of [[spacecraft]], [[guided missile]]s, and commercial [[airliner]]s.

Early German [[World War II]] [[V-2 rocket#Technical details|V2 guidance systems]] combined two gyroscopes and a lateral accelerometer with a simple [[analog computer]] to adjust the [[azimuth]] for the rocket in flight. Analog computer signals were used to drive four [[graphite]] rudders in the rocket exhaust for flight control. The GN&amp;C (Guidance, Navigation, and Control) system for the V2 provided many innovations as an integrated platform with closed loop guidance. At the end of the war von Braun engineered the surrender of 500 of his top rocket scientists, along with plans and test vehicles, to the Americans. They arrived at [[Fort Bliss, Texas]] in 1945 under the provisions of [[Operation Paperclip]] and were subsequently moved to [[Huntsville, Alabama]], in 1950&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/braun.html |title=Sputnik Biographies—Wernher von Braun (1912–1977) |website=history.nasa.gov |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328072202/https://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/braun.html |archivedate=2009-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they worked for U.S. Army rocket research programs.

In the early 1950s, the US government wanted to insulate itself against over dependency on the German team for military applications, including the development of a fully domestic missile guidance program. The MIT Instrumentation Laboratory (later to become the [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory]], Inc.) was chosen by the Air Force Western Development Division to provide a self-contained guidance system backup to Convair in [[San Diego]] for the new Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalspec.com/reference/36925/203279/Introduction |title=Introduction - Engineering360 |website=Globalspec.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620235849/http://www.globalspec.com/reference/36925/203279/introduction |archivedate=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 1982JGCD....5...97B | title=Space guidance evolution - A personal narrative | journal=Journal of Guidance Control Dynamics | volume=5 | issue=2 | page=97 | year=1982 | authors=Battin, R.

The technical monitor for the MIT task was a young engineer named Jim Fletcher who later served as the NASA Administrator. The Atlas guidance system was to be a combination of an on-board autonomous system and a ground-based tracking and command system. The self-contained system finally prevailed in ballistic missile applications for obvious reasons. In space exploration, a mixture of the two remains.

In the summer of 1952, Dr. Richard Battin and Dr. [[J. Halcombe Laning|J. Halcombe "Hal" Laning, Jr.]], researched computational based solutions to guidance and undertook the initial analytical work on the Atlas inertial guidance in 1954. Other key figures at Convair were Charlie Bossart, the Chief Engineer, and Walter Schweidetzky, head of the guidance group. Schweidetzky had worked with von Braun at [[Peenemuende|Peenemünde]] during World War II.

The initial Delta guidance system assessed the difference in position from a reference trajectory. A velocity to be gained (VGO) calculation is made to correct the current trajectory with the objective of driving VGO to zero. The mathematics of this approach were fundamentally valid, but dropped because of the challenges in accurate inertial guidance and analog computing power. The challenges faced by the Delta efforts were overcome by the Q system (see [[Q-guidance]]) of guidance. The Q system's revolution was to bind the challenges of missile guidance (and associated equations of motion) in the matrix Q. The Q matrix represents the partial derivatives of the velocity with respect to the position vector. A key feature of this approach allowed for the components of the vector cross product (v, xdv, /dt) to be used as the basic autopilot rate signals—a technique that became known as ''cross-product steering''. The Q-system was presented at the first Technical Symposium on Ballistic Missiles held at the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation in Los Angeles on June 21 and 22, 1956. The Q system was classified information through the 1960s. Derivations of this guidance are used for today's missiles.

==Guidance in human spaceflight==
In February 1961 NASA awarded MIT a contract for preliminary design study of a guidance and navigation system for Apollo. MIT and the Delco Electronics Div. of General Motors Corp. were awarded the joint contract for design and production of the Apollo Guidance and Navigation systems for the Command Module and the Lunar Module.  Delco produced the IMUs ([[Inertial Measurement Unit]]s) for these systems, Kollsman Instrument Corp. produced the Optical Systems,  and the  [[Apollo Guidance Computer]] was built by Raytheon under subcontract (see Apollo on-board guidance, navigation and control system, Dave Hoag, International Space Hall of Fame Dedication Conference in Alamogordo, N.M., October 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=C.

For the Space Shuttle, open loop (no feedback) guidance was used to guide the Shuttle from lift-off until Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) separation. After SRB separation the primary Space Shuttle guidance is named PEG (Powered Explicit Guidance).  PEG takes into account both the Q system and the predictor-corrector attributes of the original "Delta" System (PEG Guidance). Although many updates to the Shuttle's navigation system had taken place over the last 30 years (ex. GPS in the OI-22 build), the guidance core of the Shuttle GN&amp;C system had evolved little. Within a manned system, there is a human interface needed for the guidance system. As astronauts are the customer for the system, many new teams were formed that touch GN&amp;C as it is a primary interface to "fly" the vehicle.

==Aircraft inertial guidance==
One example of a popular INS for commercial aircraft was the [[Delco Carousel]], which provided partial automation of navigation in the days before complete [[flight management system]]s became commonplace. The Carousel allowed pilots to enter 9 waypoints at a time and then guided the aircraft from one waypoint to the next using an INS to determine aircraft position and velocity. Boeing Corporation subcontracted the Delco Electronics Div. of General Motors to design and build the first production Carousel systems for the early models (-100, -200 and -300) models of the 747 aircraft.  The 747 utilized three Carousel systems operating in concert for reliability purposes.  The Carousel system and derivatives thereof were subsequently adopted for use in many other commercial and military aircraft.  The USAF C-141 was the first military aircraft to utilize the Carousel in a dual system configuration, followed by the C-5A which utilized the triple INS configuration, similar to the 747.  The KC-135 fleet was fitted with a dual Carousel system that was aided by a Doppler radar.  ARINC Characteristic 704 defines the IRS used in commercial air transport.

INSs contain [[Inertial Measurement Unit]]s (IMUs) which have angular and linear accelerometers (for changes in position); some IMUs include a gyroscopic element (for maintaining an absolute angular reference).

Angular accelerometers measure how the vehicle is rotating in space. Generally, there is at least one sensor for each of the three axes: pitch (nose up and down), yaw (nose left and right) and roll (clockwise or counter-clockwise from the cockpit).

Linear accelerometers measure non-gravitational accelerations&lt;ref name=Eshbach&gt;Eshbach's Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals By Ovid W. Eshbach, Byron pg 9&lt;/ref&gt; of the vehicle. Since it can move in three axes (up &amp; down, left &amp; right, forward &amp; back), there is a linear accelerometer for each axis.

A computer continually calculates the vehicle's current position. First, for each of the six [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] (x,y,z and θ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, θ&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; and θ&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;), it integrates over time the sensed  acceleration, together with an estimate of gravity, to calculate the current velocity. Then it integrates the velocity to calculate the current position.

Inertial guidance is difficult without computers. The desire to use inertial guidance in the [[Minuteman missile]] and [[Project Apollo]] drove early attempts to miniaturize computers.

Inertial guidance systems are now usually combined with [[satellite navigation system]]s through a digital filtering system. The inertial system provides short term data, while the satellite system corrects accumulated errors of the inertial system.

An inertial guidance system that will operate near the surface
of the earth must incorporate [[Schuler tuning]] so that its
platform will continue pointing towards the center of the earth
as a vehicle moves from place to place.

==Basic schemes==

===Gimballed gyrostabilized platforms===
Some systems place the linear accelerometers on a gimballed gyrostabilized platform. The [[gimbal]]s are a set of three rings, each with a pair of bearings initially at right angles. They let the platform twist about any rotational axis (or, rather, they let the platform keep the same orientation while the vehicle rotates around it). There are two [[gyroscope]]s (usually) on the platform.

Two gyroscopes are used to cancel [[precession|gyroscopic precession]], the tendency of a gyroscope to twist at right angles  to an input torque. By mounting a pair of gyroscopes (of the same rotational inertia and spinning at the same speed in opposite directions) at right angles the precessions are cancelled and the platform will resist twisting. {{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

This system allows a vehicle's roll, pitch and yaw angles to be measured directly at the bearings of the gimbals. Relatively simple electronic circuits can be used to add up the linear accelerations, because the directions of the linear accelerometers do not change.

The big disadvantage of this scheme is that it uses many expensive precision mechanical parts. It also has [[moving parts]] that can wear out or jam and is vulnerable to [[gimbal lock]]. The [[Apollo PGNCS|primary guidance system]] of the [[Apollo spacecraft]] used a three-axis gyrostabilized platform, feeding data to the [[Apollo Guidance Computer]]. Maneuvers had to be carefully planned to avoid gimbal lock.

===Fluid-suspended gyrostabilized platforms===
Gimbal lock constrains maneuvering and it would be beneficial to eliminate the slip rings and bearings of the gimbals. Therefore, some systems use fluid bearings or a flotation chamber to mount a gyrostabilized platform. These systems can have very high precisions (e.g., [[Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere]]). Like all gyrostabilized platforms, this system runs well with relatively slow, low-power computers.

The fluid bearings are pads with holes through which pressurized inert gas (such as helium) or oil presses against the spherical shell of the platform. The fluid bearings are very slippery and the spherical platform can turn freely. There are usually four bearing pads, mounted in a tetrahedral arrangement to support the platform.

In premium systems, the angular sensors are usually specialized [[linear variable differential transformer|transformer]] coils made in a strip on a flexible [[printed circuit board]]. Several coil strips are mounted on [[great circle]]s around the spherical shell of the gyrostabilized platform. Electronics outside the platform uses similar strip-shaped transformers to read the varying magnetic fields produced by the transformers wrapped around the spherical platform. Whenever a magnetic field changes shape, or moves, it will cut the wires of the coils on the external transformer strips. The cutting generates an electric current in the external strip-shaped coils and electronics can measure that current to derive angles.

Cheap systems sometimes use [[bar code]]s to sense orientations and use [[solar cell]]s or a single transformer to power the platform. Some small missiles have powered the platform with light from a window or optic fibers to the motor. A research topic is to suspend the platform with pressure from exhaust gases. Data is returned to the outside world via the transformers, or sometimes [[LED]]s communicating with external [[photodiode]]s.

===Strapdown systems===
Lightweight digital computers permit the system to eliminate the gimbals, creating ''strapdown'' systems, so called because their sensors are simply strapped to the vehicle. This reduces the cost, eliminates [[gimbal lock]], removes the need for some calibrations and increases the reliability by eliminating some of the moving parts. Angular rate sensors called ''rate gyros'' measure the angular velocity of the vehicle.

A strapdown system has a dynamic measurement range several hundred times than required by a gimballed system. That is, it must integrate the vehicle's attitude changes in pitch, roll and yaw, as well as gross movements. Gimballed systems could usually do well with update rates of 50–60&amp;nbsp;Hz. However, strapdown systems normally update about 2000&amp;nbsp;Hz. The higher rate is needed to let the navigation system integrate the angular rate into an attitude accurately.

The data updating algorithms (''direction cosines'' or [[quaternion]]s) involved are too complex to be accurately performed except by digital electronics. However, [[digital computer]]s are now so inexpensive and fast that rate gyro systems can now be practically used and mass-produced. The Apollo [[lunar module]] used a strapdown system in its backup [[Apollo Abort Guidance System|Abort Guidance System]] (AGS).

Strapdown systems are nowadays commonly used in commercial and military applications (aircraft, ships, [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s, [[missile]]s, etc.). State-of-the-art strapdown systems are based upon [[Ring laser gyroscope|Ring Laser Gyroscopes]], [[Fibre optic gyroscope|Fibre Optic Gyrocopes]] or more recently on [[Hemispherical resonator gyroscope|Hemispherical Resonator Gyroscopes]]. They are using digital electronics and advanced digital filtering techniques such as [[Kalman filter]].

===Motion-based alignment===
The orientation of a gyroscope system can sometimes also be inferred simply from its position history (e.g., GPS). This is, in particular, the case with planes and cars, where the velocity vector usually implies the orientation of the vehicle body.

For example, [[Honeywell]]'s ''Align in Motion''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weed|first1=D.|last2=Broderick|first2=J.|last3=Love|first3=J.|last4=Ryno|first4=T.|title=GPS Align In Motion of civilian strapdown INS|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1308992/|website=PLANS 2004. Position Location and Navigation Symposium (IEEE Cat. No.04CH37556)|pages=184–192|doi=10.1109/PLANS.2004.1308992|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an initialization process where the initialization occurs while the aircraft is moving, in the air or on the ground. This is accomplished using [[GPS]] and an inertial reasonableness test, thereby allowing commercial data integrity requirements to be met. This process has been FAA certified to recover pure INS performance equivalent to stationary align procedures for civilian flight times up to 18 hours.
It avoids the need for gyroscope batteries on aircraft.

===Vibrating gyros===
{{Main|vibrating structure gyroscope}}
Less-expensive navigation systems, intended for use in automobiles, may use a [[vibrating structure gyroscope]] to detect changes in heading and the odometer pickup to measure distance covered along the vehicle's track. This type of system is much less accurate than a higher-end INS, but it is adequate for the typical automobile application where GPS is the primary navigation system and [[dead reckoning]] is only needed to fill gaps in GPS coverage when buildings or terrain block the satellite signals.

===Hemispherical resonator gyros (wine glass or mushroom gyros)===
{{Main|Hemispherical resonator gyroscope}}
If a standing wave is induced in a hemispheric resonant structure and then the resonant structure is rotated, the spherical harmonic standing wave rotates through an angle different from the quartz resonator structure due to the Coriolis force. The movement of the outer case with respect to the standing wave pattern is proportional to the total rotation angle and can be sensed by appropriate electronics. The system resonators are machined from [[fused quartz]] due to its excellent mechanical properties. The electrodes that drive and sense the standing waves are deposited directly onto separate quartz structures that surround the resonator. These gyros can operate in either a whole angle mode (which gives them nearly unlimited rate capability) or a force rebalance mode that holds the standing wave in a fixed orientation with respect to the gyro housing (which gives them much better accuracy).

This system has almost no moving parts and is very accurate. However it is still relatively expensive due to the cost of the precision ground and polished hollow quartz hemispheres. Northrop Grumman currently manufactures IMUs ([[inertial measurement unit]]s) for spacecraft that use HRGs. These IMUs have demonstrated extremely high reliability since their initial use in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/HRG/Documents/hrg.pdf |title=The Hemispherical Resonator Gyro: From Wineglass to the Planets, David M.

===Quartz rate sensors===
{{Update|section|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Gyro chip-Esky-Lama v3 model helicopter.jpg|right|thumb|The quartz rate sensor inside an [[E-Sky Lama model helicopters|E-Sky]] model helicopter]]

These products include 'tuning fork gyros'. Here, the gyro is designed as an electronically driven tuning fork, often fabricated out of a single piece of quartz or silicon. Such gyros operate in accordance with the dynamic theory that when an angle rate is applied to a translating body, a [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis force]] is generated.

This system is usually integrated on a silicon chip. It has two mass-balanced quartz tuning forks, arranged "handle-to-handle" so forces cancel. Aluminum electrodes evaporated onto the forks and the underlying chip both drive and sense the motion. The system is both manufacturable and inexpensive. Since quartz is dimensionally stable, the system can be accurate.

As the forks are twisted about the axis of the handle, the vibration of the tines tends to continue in the same plane of motion. This motion has to be resisted by electrostatic forces from the electrodes under the tines. By measuring the difference in capacitance between the two tines of a fork, the system can determine the rate of angular motion.

Current state-of-the-art non-military technology ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}) can build small solid-state sensors that can measure human body movements. These devices have no moving parts and weigh about {{convert|50|g|oz|abbr=off|sigfig=1}}.

Solid-state devices using the same physical principles are used for [[image stabilization]] in small cameras or camcorders. These can be extremely small, around {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=off|sigfig=2}} and are built with [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmems.com/epson-toyocom/epson-toyocom-quartz-gyro-sensors-how-they-work-and-whats-ahead |title=Epson Toyocom Quartz Gyro sensors – How they work and what’s ahead |website=Findmems.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116011636/http://www.findmems.com/epson-toyocom/epson-toyocom-quartz-gyro-sensors-how-they-work-and-whats-ahead |archivedate=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MHD sensor===
{{Main|MHD sensor}}
Sensors based on [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic principles]] can be used to measure angular velocities.

===MEMS gyroscope===

{{empty section|date=March 2015}}

===Ring Laser Gyros (RLG)===
{{main|Ring laser gyro}}
A [[ring laser gyro]] splits a beam of [[laser]] light into two beams in opposite directions through narrow tunnels in a closed circular optical path around the perimeter of a triangular block of temperature-stable [[Cervit]] glass with reflecting mirrors placed in each corner. When the gyro is rotating at some angular rate, the distance traveled by each beam becomes different—the shorter path being opposite to the rotation. The phase shift between the two beams can be measured by an interferometer and is proportional to the rate of rotation ([[Sagnac effect]]).

In practice, at low rotation rates the output frequency can drop to zero as the result of [[backscatter]]ing causing the beams to synchronise and lock together. This is known as a ''lock-in'', or ''laser-lock''. The result is that there is no change in the interference pattern and therefore no measurement change.

To unlock the counter-rotating light beams, laser gyros either have independent light paths for the two directions (usually in fiber optic gyros), or the laser gyro is mounted on a piezo-electric dither motor that rapidly vibrates the laser ring back and forth about its input axis through the lock-in region to decouple the light waves.

The shaker is the most accurate, because both light beams use exactly the same path. Thus laser gyros retain moving parts, but they do not move as far.

===Fiber optic gyros (FOG)===
{{main|Fiber optic gyroscope}}
A more recent variation on this, the [[fiber optic gyroscope]], uses an external laser and two beams going opposite directions (counter-propagating) in long spools (several kilometers) of fiber optic cable, with the phase difference of the two beams compared after their travel through the spools of fiber.

The basic mechanism, monochromatic laser light travelling in opposite paths and the [[Sagnac effect]], is the same in a FOG and a RLG, but the engineering details are substantially different compared to earlier laser gyros.

Precise winding of the fiber-optic coil is required to ensure the paths taken by the light in opposite directions are as similar as possible. The FOG requires more complex calibrations than a laser ring gyro making the development and manufacture of FOG's more technically challenging that for a RLG. However FOG's do not suffer from laser lock at low speeds and do not need to contain any moving parts, increasing the maximum potential accuracy and lifespan of a FOG over an equivalent RLG. On the other hand, RLG, thank to the monolithic design of their [[zerodur]] made sensitive laser cavity, are much more immune to performance degradation in severe environmental conditions.

===Pendular accelerometers===
[[File:Pendular accel.svg|thumb|right|Principle of open loop [[accelerometer]]. Acceleration in the upward direction causes the mass to deflect downward.]]
The basic, open-loop accelerometer consists of a mass attached to a spring. The mass is constrained to move only in line with the spring. Acceleration causes deflection of the mass and the offset distance is measured. The acceleration is derived from the values of deflection distance, mass and the spring constant. The system must also be damped to avoid oscillation.
A closed-loop accelerometer achieves higher performance by using a feedback loop to cancel the deflection, thus keeping the mass nearly stationary. Whenever the mass deflects, the feedback loop causes an electric coil to apply an equally negative force on the mass, canceling the motion. Acceleration is derived from the amount of negative force applied. Because the mass barely moves, the effects of non-linearities of the spring and damping system are greatly reduced. In addition, this accelerometer provides for increased bandwidth beyond the natural frequency of the sensing element.

Both types of accelerometers have been manufactured as integrated micro-machinery on silicon chips.

===TIMU (Timing &amp; Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors===
[[DARPA]]'s Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) department is working on a Micro-PNT (Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation and Timing) program to design Timing &amp; Inertial Measurement Unit (TIMU) chips that do absolute position tracking on a single chip without GPS-aided navigation.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.darpa.mil/program/micro-technology-for-positioning-navigation-and-timing |title=Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation and Timing (Micro-PNT) |website=darpa.mil |accessdate=9 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505134743/http://www.darpa.mil/program/micro-technology-for-positioning-navigation-and-timing |archivedate=5 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2013-04-10 Extreme Miniaturization: Seven Devices, One Chip to Navigate without GPS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307045716/http://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2013-04-10 |date=2017-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2012/09/20.aspx |title=Microfabrication methods to help navigate a day without GPS |website=darpa.mil |accessdate=9 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630051230/http://www.darpa.mil/NewsEvents/Releases/2012/09/20.aspx |archivedate=30 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A TIMU chip integrates 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer together with a highly accurate master timing clock, so that it can simultaneously measure the motion tracked and combine that with timing from the synchronized clock.&lt;ref name="darpa.mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Method ==
In one form, the navigational system of equations acquires linear and angular measurements from the inertial and body frame, respectively and calculates the final attitude and position in the [[North East Down|NED]] frame of reference.

The process of '''informational listening''' focuses on the ability of an individual to understand a speaker's [[message]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It is a huge part of everyday life, and failing to understand the concept of informational listening can be very detrimental to one's [[quality of life]] and to their contribution to society.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Much of the listening people engage in on a regular basis falls under the blanket of listening for information. In the office, people listen to their superiors for instructions about what they are to do. At school, students listen to teachers for information that they are expected to understand for  quizzes and tests. In all areas of life, informational listening plays a huge role in [[human communication]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Potential hindrances==
When listening to a person's message, it is common to overlook aspects of the conversation or make judgments before all of the information is presented.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This lack of effective [[Understanding|comprehension]] is detrimental to [[communication]] and is illustrated effectively by several specific obstacles. Chief among these obstacles are [[confirmation bias]]{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and the vividness effect,{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} both of which distort the speaker's message by severely affecting the perception of a particular topic.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Confirmation bias===
Confirmation bias is the tendency to pick out aspects of a conversation that support one's own beliefs and values. This psychological process proves to have a detrimental effect on communication for several reasons. 

First, confirmation bias tends to become involved in conversation before the speaker finishes his/her message.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} As a result, an opinion is formed without first obtaining all pertinent information.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This, in turn, leads to uneducated thinking and fallacious judgments that could later affect others.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} 

Second, confirmation bias detracts from a person's ability to be [[Open-mindedness|open-minded]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} For example, when listening to a statement, an individual may hear something at the beginning of the conversation that arouses a specific emotion. Whether this is anger or frustration or anything else, it could have a profound impact on that person's perception of the rest of the conversation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} If they were to become angry about a statement the speaker made early in the conversation, they would likely be averse to accepting arguments presented later in the [[discourse]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} 

To combat this bias and its consequences, an individual must be aware of it and its effects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With this knowledge, an individual can learn to critically judge both sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Vividness effect===
The vividness effect explains how vivid or highly graphic and dramatic events affect an individual's perception of a situation.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} This phenomenon has been amplified by the media in recent decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} With the use of media technology, graphic images can be used to portray an event. While this makes the process of receiving news easier and more enjoyable, it can also blow a situation out of proportion.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One year after the [[Columbine High School massacre]], about 60 percent of the people who responded to a survey by ''[[USA Weekend]]'' said that they felt a shooting was likely at their own school.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} The reality was much different; in fact, the likelihood of a [[school shooting]] is negligible{{clarify|date=November 2014}} across America.

The vividness effect was only amplified by the media.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} It existed long before the advent of television or radio. When observing an event in person, an individual is automatically drawn toward the sensational or vivid aspects.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Thus, a person becomes quick to believe that all aspects of an event are bad if they only remember the vivid parts that offended them.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} To counter this, an individual must be aware of and deal with the inclination to the dramatic and offensive, act accordingly.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} One must resist the temptation to jump to conclusions and instead weigh all facts before judging.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Effective listening==
In addition to avoiding the two major mistakes listed above, there are things one must do to be a competent informational listener.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Memory===

To understand what is said in the present, one must remember what has been said before; and for the message to have impact, one must remember at least parts of it at some point in the future. The most obvious memory aid is simply taking notes, but it is also helpful to create a mental outline of the message as it is being heard.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Identification===

Identify the main point that the speaker is trying to bring across. When the main point has been deduced, one can begin to sort out the rest of the information and decide where it belongs in the mental outline.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Before getting the big picture of a message, it can be difficult to focus on what the speaker is saying, because it is impossible to know where any particular piece of information fits.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Questions===

It is usually helpful to ask oneself questions about the speaker's message.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} If the listener is mentally asking questions about what is being said, it is a good sign that he/she is actively involved in effective informational listening.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

''Infrastructure for Peace'' is a new approach in [[peacebuilding]] which gained momentum after locally led and participatory peacebuilding practices tended to yield effective results in some countries beset by conflicts. It underpins the ideas of [[conflict transformation]] and stresses on under-girding the politically negotiated settlements at top level by peacebuilding efforts at the grassroots.

==Definition==
In 2010, governments, political parties, civil society and [[United Nations]] country representatives from 14 African countries in [[Kenya]] agreed upon a working definition of ''infrastructures for peace'' as a ‘dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and [[peacebuilding]] in a society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=JPD Editors|title=The Evolving Landscape of Infrastructures for Peace|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774793|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15423166.2013.774793#.VXvjcfmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

==Criticisms==
Critical studies on the ''infrastructure for peace'' mainly see this as a fuzzy concept because [[peacebuilding]] cannot be guaranteed only by local efforts. Such local infrastructures are prone to suffer from political upheavals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuma|first1=Aeneas|last2=Ojielo|first2=Ozonnia|title=Building a Standing National Capacity for Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Kenya|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–39|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774790}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still rely on external funding and cannot do well under strictly autocratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odendaal|first1=Andries|title=The Political Legitimacy of National Peace Committees|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=40–53|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.767601}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21647259.2016.1156813?journalCode=rpcb20 New research works], which conflate infrastructures for peace with [[security sector reform]] have also suggested such architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on security issues because (in)security has transnational connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghimire, Safal. 2016.

'''Irving Bieber''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|iː|b|ər}}; 1909–1991) was an [[United States|American]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]], best known for his study ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'' (1962), in which Bieber took the since discredited position that [[homosexuality]] is an illness.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"/&gt; 

==Life and career==
Irving Bieber was born in [[New York City]] and graduated from [[New York University Medical College]] in 1930. Bieber went on to work at [[Yale Medical College]], [[New York University]], and starting in 1953 at the [[New York Medical College]], where he taught a course in psychoanalysis.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D7153FF93BA1575BC0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies | date=August 28, 1991 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber was, along with [[Lionel Ovesey]] and [[Charles Socarides]], one of the most influential American psychoanalysts who attempted to convert gay men to heterosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=LeVay, Simon |title=Queer Science: The Use and Abuse of Research into Homosexuality |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=1996 |page=75 |isbn=0-262-12199-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bieber's 1962 book ''[[Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study of Male Homosexuals]]'' was a counter reaction to the 1948 [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey Report on male sexual behavior]]. It remained the leading study on [[homosexuality]] until homosexuality was removed from [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="James Baldwin Now"&gt;William J. Spurlin, 'Culture, Rhetoric, and Queer Identity', ''James Baldwin Now'', ed. Dwight A. McBride, New York University Press, 1999, pages 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Bieber attended a meeting of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in [[San Francisco]] that was protested by [[LGBT social movements|gay activists]]. According to Socarides, Bieber, who felt he had "been working all these years to help these people", "took this very hard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Socarides, Charles |title=Homosexuality: A Freedom Too Far |publisher=Adam Margrave Books |location=Phoenix |year=1995 |page=160 |isbn=0-9646642-5-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the same year the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders, Bieber told an interviewer that "a homosexual is a person whose heterosexual function is crippled, like the legs of a polio victim."&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies" /&gt; When [[Alan P. Bell]], [[Martin S. Weinberg]], and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith's study ''[[Sexual Preference (book)|Sexual Preference]]'' was published in 1981, Bieber declared that its findings were "totally disparate" with his experience from psychiatric consultation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brody, Jane E. | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/us/kinsey-study-finds-homosexuals-show-early-predisposition.html?pagewanted=all | title = KINSEY STUDY FINDS HOMOSEXUALS SHOW EARLY PREDISPOSITION | accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieber arranged a partial translation into English of a paper by the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] pediatrician S. Lindner, who had reported a systematic study of sucking. [[Sigmund Freud]] had used Lindner's observation that sensual sucking seems to absorb the attention completely and leads to either [[sleep]] or an [[orgasm]]-like response to develop his theory of infantile sexuality. Bieber pointed out what he saw as inaccuracies in Freud's use of this paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Macmillan, Malcolm |title=Freud Evaluated: The Completed Arc |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |page=311 |isbn=0-262-63171-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bieber died in [[Manhattan]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Irving Bieber, 80, a Psychoanalyst Who Studied Homosexuality, Dies"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9549">[[File:Jug from Lydian Treasure Usak.jpg|thumb|200px|Jug from Lydian Treasure found near Uşak]] 

'''Karun Treasure''' is the name given to a collection of 363 valuable [[Lydia]]n artifacts dating from the 7th century BC and originating from [[Uşak Province]] in western Turkey, which were the subject of a [[legal battle]] between [[Turkey]] and [[New York Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1987–1993 and which were returned to Turkey in 1993 after the Museum admitted it had known the objects were stolen when they had purchased them. The collection is alternatively known as the ''Lydian Hoard''. The items are exhibited in the [[Uşak Museum of Archaeology]].

The collection made sensational news once again in May 2006 when a key piece, a golden [[hippocamp]], on display in [[Uşak]] Museum along with the rest of the collection, was discovered to have been switched with a [[counterfeit|fake]], probably between March and August 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/5027074.stm | title = Croesus riches replaced by fakes|author=|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]]| accessdate=2006-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Yet another term used for the collection is "Croesus Treasure". Although the artifacts were closely contemporary to [[Croesus]], whether they should be directly associated with the legendary Lydian king or not remains debatable. Croesus' wealth had repercussions on a number of [[Asia]]n cultures in a vein similar to his fame in the western cultures, and is referred to either as ''Qarun'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]) or Karun ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]), or [[Korah]], with the mythical proportions of his fortune also echoed in various ways, parallel to the [[English language]] expression "as rich as Croesus".&lt;ref&gt;Qarun and reference to his wealth mentioned in the [[Koran]] (''[28:76] to [28:82]''). In [[Persian mythology]], to which the other citations could be connected, the ''Qârun Treasure'' is a treasure said to be in perpetual motion under the ground. The phrase ''harta karun'' (literally Croesus' Wealth) also worked into the Malay language as the word for ''treasure'' and is synonymous with the term ''buried treasure''. ''Ganj-e-Qarun'' (Croesus Treasure) was also an [[Iran]]ian movie made in 1965 by [[Siamak Yasami]] and widely regarded as one of the classics of [[Iranian cinema]]. The movie recounts the story of a very wealthy man who attempts suicide and then finds happiness in the simplicity of a pauper's home.&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why the term "Karun Treasure" took hold, and in any case, the king Croesus' Treasure consisted of more than 363 pieces and the tomb chamber [[tumulus]] where most artifacts were discovered (they originate from close but different sites) was that of a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|title=The rich kings of the thousand hills, Lydians|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.serfed.com|publisher=Turkish Ceramic Federation|author=Nezih Başgelen|accessdate=2005-07-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122153206/http://www.serfed.com/dergi/10/15-ANADOLU_UYGARLIKLARI.pdf|archivedate=January 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and smuggling==
The main and the most precious part of the treasure comes from a tomb chamber of a Lydian princess reached through illegal excavations carried out by three fortune-seekers from Uşak's depending Güre village, at the proximity of which the tomb was located, at the locality called Toptepe. After having dug for days and unable to break through the marble masonry of the chamber door, they had [[dynamite]]d the roof of the tomb in the night of 6 June 1966, to be the first to see the breathtaking sight of the buried Lydian noblewoman and her treasures after 2600 years. The treasure looted from this particular tomb was enriched by further finds by the same men in other [[tumuli]] of the locality during 1966-1967. The collection was smuggled outside Turkey in separate dispatches through [[İzmir]] and [[Amsterdam]], to be bought by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1967–1968, at an invoiced cost of $1.2 million for 200 of the pieces within the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tayproject.org/Haber.fm$Retrieve?ID=1267&amp;html=haber_detail_tu.html&amp;layout=web|title=Uşak-New York|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.tayproject.org|publisher=TAY Project|language=Turkish|author=|accessdate=2001-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal battle==

The efforts made by successive Turkish governments to retrieve the collection were incited since the very beginning and followed until conclusion by the journalist [[Özgen Acar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |title=We have to change the buyer's attitude |author=Michel Bessières |publisher=[[UNESCO]] Courrier |accessdate=2001-04-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010723161923/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_04/uk/doss27.htm |archivedate=2001-07-23 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acar had chanced upon some pieces of the collection for the first time in 1984 in a Met Museum [[Collection catalog|catalogue]] and had informed Turkey's [[Culture and Tourism Ministry of Turkey|Ministry of Culture]] of their clear provenance, while he also wrote several articles and pursued the bureaucratic channels within Turkey with insistence throughout the affair. He acted as a voluntary envoy of the Ministry within the frame of the judicial case launched in [[New York City]] in 1987 and brought to conclusion in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|title=The Art Theft Experts|author=Thomas Adcock|publisher=[[New York Law Journal]]|accessdate=2006-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031010110/http://www.herrick.com/Upload/Publication/Articles/ArticleHF_0208.pdf|archivedate=2006-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time as he was named [[consultant]] in the larger framework of the Turkey's participation in the work carried out by [[UNIDROIT]] regarding the protection of historic, cultural and religious heritage. Acar's name is also synonymous in Turkey for the retrieval of another set of smuggled archaeological goods, termed "Elmalı Treasure" in reference to their site of origin, the town of [[Elmalı]] in southwestern Turkey, and involving this time [[Lydia]]n coins and extremely rare [[drachma|decadrachms]] dating from the period of the [[Delian League]], with the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] as his opposite party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823041626/http://museum-security.org/reports/003199.html#8|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-23|title=Elmalı treasure|author=|publisher=Museum Security|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uşak Museum case==
The clear need for a museum worthy of the treasure was being voiced ever since the artifacts had returned to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.worldpress.org/Europe/1491.cfm | title = Croesus: The poverty of treasure|author=[[Özgen Acar]]|publisher=[[Cumhuriyet]]| accessdate=2003-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the seizure by the authorities of ten other illegally excavated artifacts in 1998, further archaeological discoveries and the known presence of eight gold pieces that had appeared in 2000 during an exhibition in a [[Paris]] private gallery for which attempts for retrieval were yet to be made, a handsome collection of base consisting of a total of 375 pieces was already accumulated. But the small museum in [[Uşak]] where the collection was placed, more focused on storage of [[Ushak carpet]]s and operating under conditions of budgetary and staff restraints,&lt;ref&gt;The number of experts working in Turkish museums halved from 1,500 to 750 in the last ten years. {{cite web|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|title=Croesus: Ten people charged in Croesus theft case|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Turkish Daily News]]|author=|accessdate=2003-07-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717031211/http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=48792|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; did not fully meet the requirements for the preservation of Karun Treasure. Doubts about the site's suitability were reinforced by the filing of currently unresolved legal action against museum staff regarding the 2007 theft. The museum's former director remains the only person to be still kept in [[police custody|custody]] among the ten initially accused in the frame of the case around the hippocamp's replacement with a fake.

==Curse of the treasure==
Some{{who|date=December 2013}} in Uşak and beyond associate the treasure with a [[curse]]. Legend has it that the seven men who took part in the illegal digs "died violent deaths or suffered great misfortune".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/25/king-croesus-treasure-returning-turkey|title= King Croesus's golden brooch to be returned to Turkey |work=The Guardian|author=Constanze Letsch|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lead sheet''' is a form of [[musical notation]] that specifies the essential elements of a [[song|popular song]]: the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[harmony]]. The melody is written in [[music notation#Modern notation|modern Western music notation]], the lyric is written as text below the [[musical staff|staff]] and the harmony is specified with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] above the staff.

The lead sheet does not describe the chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]], [[voice leading]], [[bass line]] or other aspects of the [[accompaniment]]. These are specified later by an [[arrangement|arranger]] or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] by the performers&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.76. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, and are considered aspects of the arrangement or performance of a song, rather than a part of the song itself. 

A lead sheet may also specify an instrumental part or theme, if this is considered essential to the song's identity. For example, the opening [[guitar riff]] from [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Smoke on the Water]]" is a part of the song; any performance of the song should include the guitar riff, and any imitation of that guitar riff is an imitation of the song. Thus the riff belongs on the lead sheet.

== Performance with lead sheets ==
A lead sheet is often the only form of written music used by a small [[jazz]] ensemble. One or more musicians will play the melody while the rest of the group improvises an appropriate accompaniment based on the [[chord progression]] given in the [[chord symbol]]s, followed by an improvised solo also based on the [[chord progression]]. Similarly, a sufficiently skilled [[jazz]] [[pianist]] should be able to accompany a singer and perform a song by her or himself using only a lead sheet.

Lead sheets are also called '''fake sheets''' and collections of lead sheets are called "[[fake book|fakebooks]]".

== Lead sheet as legal definition of a song ==
The melody, lyrics, and harmony define what a song is. In the [[music industry]] and [[entertainment law]], a lead sheet is the document used to describe a song for legal purposes. For example, a lead sheet is the form of a song to which [[copyright]] is applied—if a [[songwriter]] sues someone for copyright violation, the court will compare lead sheets to determine how much of the song has been copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Krasilovsky et al. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or if a song is considered for an [[Academy Award]] or a [[Grammy]], the song is submitted for consideration in the form of a lead sheet.

{{Atheism and Irreligion Sidebar}}
'''Metaphysical naturalism''' (also called '''ontological naturalism''', '''philosophical naturalism''', '''scientific materialism''' and '''antisupernaturalism''') is a philosophical worldview, which holds that there is nothing but [[natural]] elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]].  [[Methodological naturalism]] is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible [[ontology|ontological]] foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or [[spiritual naturalism]]. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].

==Definition==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], geologist and president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that: 1. Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]]; 2. Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; 3. Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism.{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

[[Carl Sagan]] put it succinctly: "The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur C. Danto]], naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the vagueness of the general term "naturalism", [[David Papineau]] traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]: "So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized—that is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}} Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a "positive" term, and "few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'", while noting that "philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'" and that despite an "inevitable" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of [[John McDowell]], [[David Chalmers]] and [[Jennifer Hornsby]], for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content "to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}}

Philosopher and theologian [[Alvin Plantinga]], a [[evolutionary argument against naturalism|well-known critic of naturalism]] in general, comments: "Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological naturalism===

Metaphysical naturalism is an approach to [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], which deals with existence ''per se''. It should not be confused with [[methodological naturalism]], which sees [[empiricism]] as the basis for the scientific method.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Regarding science and evolution, [[Eugenie C. Scott]], a notable opponent of teaching [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism:
{{quote|If it is important for Americans to learn about science and evolution, decoupling the two forms of naturalism is essential strategy. ... I suggest that scientists can defuse some of the opposition to evolution by first recognizing that the vast majority of Americans are believers, and that most Americans want to retain their faith. It is demonstrable that individuals can retain religious beliefs and still accept evolution as science. Scientists should avoid confusing the methodological naturalism of science with metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"/&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|"Creationism, Ideology, and Science"}}

===Lack of necessity for worship===

The historian [[Richard Carrier]], in his book ''Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism,'' describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy "wherein worship is replaced with curiosity, devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning". Carrier wrote that it is the naturalist’s duty "to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and naturalism==
{{main article|Uniformitarianism}}
Metaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000) "There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method — namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|A.Sergei|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Schafersman]], agrees that methodological naturalism is "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching [[Creationism]] or [[Intelligent Design]] in US public schools such as [[Eugenie Scott]], Schafersman asserts that "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} as well as the similarly controversial assertion: "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} On the other hand, Scott argues:
{{quote|that a clear distinction must be drawn between science as a way of knowing about the natural world and science as a foundation for philosophical views. One should be taught to our children in school, and the other can optionally be taught to our children at home. Once this view is explained, I have found far more support than disagreement among my university colleagues. Even someone who may disagree with my logic or understanding of philosophy of science often understands the strategic reasons for separating methodological from philosophical [[materialism]]—if we want more Americans to understand evolution.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=1996 |chapter="Creationism, Ideology, and Science" |title=The Flight From Science and Reason |publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences, |pages=519–520 |editors=Gross, Levitt, and Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=2008 |url=http://ncse.com/religion/science-religion-methodology-humanism |title=Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism |publisher=NCSE |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism}} However, there are other controversies, [[Arthur Newell Strahler]] embeds peculiar [[anthropic principle|anthropic]] distinctions in the name of naturalism: "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Strahler|1992|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variously known as [[background independence]], the [[cosmological principle]], the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or [[uniformitarianism]], there ''are'' important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around. You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the out crop of rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1987|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way "prove" the validity of induction—an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's "uniformity of process" are an assumption: "As such, it is another ''a priori'' assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1984|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to R. Hooykaas: "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts ... It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various associated beliefs==
Contemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism.  Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of [[materialism]] or [[physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Certainly most philosophical naturalists today are materialists[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undesigned universe===
Metaphysical naturalists argue that the scientific facts and theories that we have to explain the origins of the universe provide no evidence for supernatural beings or deities.&lt;ref name=sag&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard |last= Carrier |title= Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism |date= 2010-08-09 |publisher= AuthorHouse |location= Bloomington, Indiana |section= Free Preview |accessdate= 2013-12-25 |url=http://bookstore.authorhouse.com/Products/SKU-000406158/Sense-and-Goodness-Without-God.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Richard Carrier explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...no other worldview is directly and substantially supported by any scientific evidence, whereas all scientific evidence so far does support Metaphysical Naturalism, often directly, sometimes substantially. Though naturalism has not yet been proved, it is the best bet going.&lt;ref name=sag/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One might say that either it has always existed or it had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.

===Abiogenesis and evolution===
Since nature is all there is, and there was once no life, abiogenesis is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=166–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Carrier, [The Argument from Biogenesis: Probabilities Against a Natural Origin of Life],  ''Biology and Philosophy'' 19.5 (November 2004), pp. 739-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists reason about ''how'', not ''if'' evolution happened.  They maintain that humanity's existence is not by [[intelligent design]] but rather a natural process of [[emergence]].

===Ethics and meta-ethics===

Some embrace [[virtue ethics]] and many see no compelling argument against [[ethical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=168–176, 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2012}}  Some may advocate for a [[Science of morality]].  One example of an attempt to ground a naturalist meta-ethical system is [[Richard Carrier]]'s chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" which was peer reviewed by four philosophers.  It sets out to prove a [[Moral realism]] centered around human satisfaction.  [[Alexander Rosenberg]] has expressed a contrary position that naturalists, in general, have to accept [[moral nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Alexander |title=The Disenchanted Naturalist’s Guide to Reality |url=http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |work=On the Human Forum |publisher=National Humanities Center (United States) |authorlink=Alexander Rosenberg |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226150034/http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The mind is a natural phenomenon===

If any variety of metaphysical naturalism is true, any [[mental properties]] that exist are [[causality|caused]] by and [[ontology|ontologically]] dependent upon nature.

Metaphysical naturalists do not believe in a [[soul]] or [[spirit]], nor in [[ghost]]s, and when explaining what constitutes the [[mind]] they rarely appeal to [[substance dualism]]. If one's mind, or rather one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and existence as a [[person]], is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as [[idea]]s, [[theories]], [[emotions]], moral and personal [[values]], or [[aesthetic]] response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.&lt;ref name="stace3"&gt;Stace, W.T, Mysticism and Philosophy. N.Y.: Macmillan, 1960; reprinted, Los Angeles: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility of reason===
Metaphysical naturalists hold that [[reason]] is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of [[pure reason]] alone can securely discover logical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value of society===
Humans are [[social animals]], which is why humanity developed [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In terms of evolution, this means that differential reproductive success somehow depended on traits that permit the development and maintenance of a healthy and productive culture and civilization.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==History&lt;!--'History of metaphysical naturalism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{also|History of materialism|History of metaphysical realism}}
===Ancient and medieval philosophy===
Naturalism was the foundation of two ([[Vaisheshika]], [[Nyaya]]) of the six orthodox schools and one ([[Carvaka]]) heterodox school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Chatterjee (2012), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/naturalism-india/ Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass'', {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pp. 227–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (1999), ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Western metaphysical naturalism has originated in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The earliest [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, especially the [[Milesian school|Milesians]] ([[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]) and the [[atomists]] ([[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]]), were labeled by their peers and successors "the ''physikoi''" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φυσικός or ''physikos'', meaning "natural philosopher," borrowing on the word φύσις or ''[[physis]]'', meaning "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as [[Epicureanism]], which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a [[Void (philosophy)|void]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the rise and dominance of [[Christianity]] in the West and the later spread of [[Islam]], metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in [[medieval philosophy]]. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism.

===Modern philosophy===
It was not until the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern era of philosophy]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that naturalists like [[Benedict Spinoza]] (who put forward a theory of [[psychophysical parallelism]]), [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the proponents of [[French materialism]] (notably [[Denis Diderot]], [[Julien La Mettrie]], and [[Baron d'Holbach]]) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, [[materialism]], which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century.

[[Immanuel Kant]] rejected ([[reductionist]]) materialist positions in metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not hostile to naturalism. His [[transcendental philosophy]] is considered to be a form of [[liberal naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', a form of [[natural philosophy]], was developed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen after Hegel was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]],&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s [[dialectical materialism]], especially Engels's dialectical philosophy of nature (''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'').

Another notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was [[German materialism]]: members included [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Jacob Moleschott]], and [[Karl Vogt]].&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, ''The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: "During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner" and p. 173: "Frenchmen were surprised to see Büchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nineteenth Century and After]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-VXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q= Vol. 151], 1952, p. 227: "the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary philosophy===
In the early 20th century, [[matter]] was found to be a form of [[energy]] and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See [[History of physics]].) In [[contemporary philosophy]], renewed attention to the [[problem of universals]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], the development of [[mathematical logic]], and the post-[[logical positivism|positivist]] revival of [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]], initially by way of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] [[linguistic philosophy]], further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the [[philosophy of science]] brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, [[ethics]], the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], etc., the products of which include [[physicalism]] and [[eliminative materialism]], [[supervenience]], [[causal theory of reference|causal theories of reference]], [[anomalous monism]], [[naturalized epistemology]] (e.g. [[reliabilism]]), [[internalism and externalism]], [[ethical naturalism]], and [[property dualism]], for example.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Objectivism is an expression of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[ethical idealism]] within a naturalistic framework.

The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the middle of the twentieth century, the acceptance of the causal closure of the physical realm led to even stronger naturalist views. The [[causal closure]] thesis implies that any mental and biological causes must themselves be physically constituted, if they are to produce physical effects. It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 1950s onwards, philosophers began to formulate arguments for ontological physicalism. Some of these arguments appealed explicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal closure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that even in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Papineau |first=David |authorlink=David Papineau |year=2007 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/naturalism/#NatPhy |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N. Zalta |title=Naturalism |quote= It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Papineau|"Naturalism" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''}}

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], an advocacy group opposing [[creationism]] in public schools,&lt;ref name="Williams 2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The God curriculum  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/smcreate07.xml&amp;page=2 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |location=London |first=Sally |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its [[explanatory power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism did not exist as a philosophy before the nineteenth century, but only as an occasionally adopted and non-rigorous method among natural philosophers. It is a unique philosophy in that it is not ancient or prior to science, and that it developed largely due to the influence of science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism is almost unique in that it would not exist as a philosophy without the prior existence of science. It shares this status, in my view, with the philosophy of existentialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical naturalism==

In the context of creation and evolution debates, [[Internet Infidels]] co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls "the argument from bias", that ''a priori,'' the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes "there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an ''a priori'' assumption".&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"/&gt;

Richard Carrier argues in ''Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism'' that Metaphysical Naturalism is true. Topics covered include [[metaphilosophy]],  [[semantics]], [[epistemology]], the nature and [[origin of the universe]] (including a proposal that [[spacetime]] may be the [[ground of all being]] and [[brute fact|a rejection of the logical possibility for any ultimate answer]]),  free will [[compatibilism]], the nature of [[mind]], [[abstract objects]], [[Reductionism#Ontological reductionism|ontological reductionism]], the nature of [[emotions]], the [[meaning of life]], the nature of [[reason]], [[atheism]], [[aesthetics]], [[morality]] (including [[ethical naturalism]] and a recommendation for a [[science of morality]]), and [[politics]].

===Argument from physical minds===

Several Metaphysical Naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist.  For instance, Lowder says, "Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/minds.html |title=Argument from Physical Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain.&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/infidels/newsletter/1999/march.html#Naturalism |date=March 1999 |work=Internet Infidels Newsletter |title=The Empirical Case for Metaphysical Naturalism |first=Jeffery Jay |last=Lowder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological argument for naturalism===

{{quote|[Elegance] goes directly to the question of how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: Where did that creator come from? And where did his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it was always there, then why not say that the laws of nature were always there and save a step?&lt;ref name="Sagan2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Sagan |first2=T. |last2=Head |year=2006 |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |series=Literary Conversations Series |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=9781578067367 |lccn=2005048747 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PR14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Carl Sagan]]|''Conversations with Carl Sagan''}}

==Arguments against==

Arguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples.

===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}
[[Alvin Plantinga]] is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy at Calvin College. He is a [[Christian]], and a well-known critic of naturalism.  He argues, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism|reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God.  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title=Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104024641/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=11 April 2010 |quote=...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe. But of course it doesn't even begin to follow that I think the scientific theory of evolution is false. And I don't.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |title=Warrant and Proper Function |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507863-2 |at=Chap. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[supernormal stimuli]]).''

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[evil demon]] or [[brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.K. |last=Beilby |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction by Alvin Plantinga |title=Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series=Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8763-7 |lccn=2001006111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1–2, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities—no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another—and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;|Alvin Plantinga|"Introduction" in ''Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism''}}

Branden Fitelson of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that "at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true", and that defects such as [[cognitive bias]] are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's [[hyperbolic doubt]] is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: "[neither] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by [[philosophy of mind|philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] and historian [[Richard Carrier]] who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antinominalist argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Theory of Forms|Hylomorphism|Scholasticism}}
[[Edward Feser]], in his 2008 book ''The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism'', lays a plenary case against naturalism by re-examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the [[Plato]]nic&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 31-49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 2, pp. 53-72&lt;/ref&gt; answers to the [[problem of universals]]—that is, [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Feser also offers arguments against [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects [[eliminative materialism]]—and thus naturalism.

In the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas's]] arguments for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 90-119&lt;/ref&gt; These include arguments for an unmoved mover,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 91-102&lt;/ref&gt; first, uncaused cause &lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 102-110&lt;/ref&gt; and (supernatural) supreme intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-118&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability—as in the [[intelligent design]] view, particularly of [[irreducible complexity]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-114&lt;/ref&gt;—but as a necessary consequence of "obvious, though empirical, starting points".&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of noise-based logic and its name was created by [[Laszlo B. Kish]]. In its foundation paper&lt;ref name =first/&gt;  it is noted that the idea was inspired by the stochasticity of [[brain]] signals and by the unconventional noise-based communication schemes, such as the [[Laszlo_B._Kish|Kish]] cypher.

==The noise-based logic space and hyperspace==
The logic values are represented by [[multi-dimensional]] "[[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s" ([[orthogonal functions]]) and their [[Superposition principle|superposition]], where the [[orthogonality|orthogonal]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] are independent noises. By the proper combination (products or [[Intersection (set theory)|set-theoretical products]]) of basis-noises, which are called ''noise-bit'', a logic hyperspace can be constructed with  {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} number of [[dimension]]s, where ''N'' is the number of noise-bits. Thus ''N'' noise-bits in a single wire correspond to a system of {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} classical bits that can express {{nowrap| 2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;}} different logic values. Independent realizations of a stochastic process of zero mean have zero [[cross-correlation]] with each other and with other stochastic processes of zero mean. Thus the basis noise vectors are orthogonal not only to each other but they and all the noise-based logic states (superpositions) are orthogonal also to any background noises in the hardware. Therefore, the noise-based logic concept is robust against background noises, which is a property that can potentially offer a high energy-efficiency.

==The types of signals used in noise-based logic==
In the paper,&lt;ref name =first/&gt; where noise-based logic was first introduced, generic stochastic-processes with zero mean were proposed and a system of orthogonal sinusoidal signals were also proposed as a deterministic-signal version of the logic system. The mathematical analysis about statistical errors and signal energy was limited to the cases of [[Gaussian process|Gaussian noises]] and superpositions as logic signals in the basic logic space and their products and superpositions of their products in the logic hyperspace (see also.&lt;ref name =second/&gt; In the subsequent brain logic scheme,&lt;ref name =third/&gt; the logic signals were (similarly to neural signals) unipolar spike sequences generated by a [[Poisson process]], and set-theoretical unifications (superpositions) and intersections (products) of different spike sequences. Later, in the instantaneous noise-based logic schemes&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt;  and computation works,&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; random telegraph waves (periodic time, bipolar, with fixed absolute value of amplitude) were also utilized as one of the simplest stochastic processes available for NBL. With choosing unit amplitude and symmetric probabilities, the resulting random-telegraph wave has 0.5 probability to be in the +1 or in the -1 state which is held over the whole clock period.

==The noise-based logic gates==
Noise-based logic [[Logic gate|gates]] can be classified according to the method the input identifies the logic value at the input. The first gates&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =second/&gt; analyzed the statistical correlations between the input signal and the reference noises. The advantage of these is the robustness against background noise. The disadvantage is the slow speed and higher hardware complexity. The instantaneous logic gates&lt;ref name =third/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; are fast, they have low complexity but they are not robust against background noises. With either neural spike type signals or with [[Bipolar signal|bipolar]] random-telegraph waves of unity absolute amplitude, and randomness only in the sign of the amplitude offer very simple instantaneous logic gates. Then linear or analog devices unnecessary and the scheme can operate in the digital domain. However, whenever instantaneous logic must be interfaced with classical logic schemes, the interface must use [[Correlation function|correlator]]-based logic gates for an error-free signal.&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;

==Universality of noise-based logic==
All the noise-based logic schemes listed above have been proven universal.&lt;ref name =first/&gt;&lt;ref name =fourth/&gt;&lt;ref name =fifth/&gt; The papers typically produce the [[Inverter (logic gate)|NOT]] and the [[AND gate|AND]] gates to prove universality, because having both of them is a satisfactory condition for the universality of a [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean logic]].

==Computation by noise-based logic==
The string verification work&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; over a slow communication channel shows a powerful computing application where the methods is inherently based on calculating the [[hash function]]. The scheme is based on random telegraph waves and it is mentioned in the paper&lt;ref name =sixth/&gt; that the authors intuitively conclude that the ''[[intelligence]]'' of the brain is using similar operations to make a reasonably good decision based on a limited amount of information. The superposition of the first {{nowrap|''D''(''N'') {{=}} 2&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt;}} integer numbers can be produced with only 2''N'' operations, which the authors call "Achilles ankle operation" in the paper.&lt;ref name =second/&gt;

==Computer chip realization of noise-based logic==
Preliminary schemes have already been published&lt;ref name="sixth"/&gt; to utilize noise-based logic in practical computers. However, it is obvious from these papers that this young field has yet a long way to go before it will be seen in everyday applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1806">This group of standards, created by the [[OPC Foundation]], provides [[Component Object Model|COM]] specifications for communicating data from devices and applications that provide historical data, such as databases. The specifications provides for access to raw, [[interpolated]] and [[aggregate data]] (data with calculations).

OPC Historical Data Access, also known as OPC HDA, is used to exchange archived process data. This is in contrast to the [[OPC Data Access]] (OPC DA) specification that deals with real-time data. OPC technology is based on client / server architecture. Therefore, an OPC client, such as a trending application or spreadsheet, can retrieve data from an OPC compliant data source, such as a historian, using OPC HDA.

Similar to the [[OPC Data Access]] specification, OPC Historical Data Access also uses Microsoft's [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] to transport data. [[Distributed Component Object Model|DCOM]] also provides OPC HDA with full security features such as user authentication and authorization, as well as communication encryption services. OPC HDA Clients and Servers can reside on separate PCs, even if they are separated by a firewall. To do this, system integrators must configure DCOM properly as well as open ports in the firewall. If using the Windows firewall, users only need to open a single port.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16404">In [[macroecology]] and [[community (ecology)|community ecology]], an '''occupancy frequency distribution''' ('''OFD''') is the distribution of the numbers of species occupying different numbers of areas.&lt;ref name="Mcgeoch2002"/&gt; It was first reported in 1918 by the Danish botanist [[Christen C. Raunkiær]] in his study on plant communities. The OFD is also known as the species-range size distribution in literature.&lt;ref name="Gaston1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaston1998"/&gt;

== Bimodality ==

A typical form of OFD is a [[bimodal distribution]], indicating the [[species]] in a community is either rare or common, known as Raunkiaer's law of distribution of frequencies.&lt;ref name="Papp1997" /&gt; That is, with each species assigned to one of five 20%-wide occupancy classes, Raunkiaer's law predicts bimodal distributions within homogenous plant formations with [[mode (statistics)|modes]] in the first (0-20%) and last (81-100%) classes.&lt;ref name="Papp1997" /&gt; Although Raunkiaer's law has long been discounted as an index of plant community homogeneity,&lt;ref name="Mcintosh1962"/&gt; the method of using occupancy classes to construct OFDs is still commonly used for both plant and animal assemblages. [[Henry Gleason]] commented on this law in a 1929 ''[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]]'' article: "In conclusion we may say that Raunkiaer's law is merely an expression of the fact that in any association there are more species with few individuals than with many, that the law is most apparent when [[quadrat]]s are chosen of the most serviceable size to show frequency, and that it is obscured or lost if the quadrats are either too large or too small."&lt;ref name="Gleason1929" /&gt;  Evidently, there are different shapes of OFD found in literature. Tokeshi reported that approximately 46% of observations have a [[skewness|right-skewed]] [[unimodal distribution|unimodal shape]], 27% bimodal, and 27% [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]].&lt;ref name="Tokeshi1992"/&gt; A recent study reaffirms about 24% bimodal OFDs in among 289 real communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hui | first1 = C | year = 2012 | title = Scale effect and bimodality in the frequency distribution of species occupancy | url = | journal = Community Ecology | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 30–35 | doi = 10.1556/ComEc.13.2012.1.4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factors ==

As pointed out by Gleason,&lt;ref name="Gleason1929" /&gt; the variety shapes of OFD can be explained, to a large degree, by the size of the sampling interval. For instance, McGeoch and Gaston (2002)&lt;ref name="Mcgeoch2002"/&gt; show that the number of satellite (rare) species declines with the increase of sampling grains, but the number of core (common) species increases, showing a tendency from a bimodal OFD towards a right-skewed unimodal distribution. This is because [[species range]], measured as occupancy, is strongly affected by the spatial scale and its aggregation structure,&lt;ref name="Hui2010"/&gt; known often as the [[scaling pattern of occupancy]]. Such scale dependence of occupancy has a profound effect on other macroecological patterns, such as the [[occupancy-abundance relationship]].

Other factors that have been proposed to be able to affect the shape of OFD include the degree of habitat heterogeneity,&lt;ref name="Raunkiaer1934"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1984"/&gt; species specificity,&lt;ref name="Brown1995"/&gt; landscape productivity,&lt;ref name="Maurer1990"/&gt; position in the geographic range,&lt;ref name="Williams1988"/&gt; species dispersal ability&lt;ref name="Collins1997"/&gt; and the extinction–colonization dynamics.&lt;ref name="Hanski1982"/&gt;

== Mechanisms ==

Three basic models have been proposed to explain the bimodality found in occupancy frequency distributions.

===Sampling results===
Random sampling of individuals from either [[lognormal]] or [[log-series distrbution|log-series]] rank abundance distributions (where random choice of an individual from a given species was proportional to its frequency) may produce bimodal occupancy distributions.&lt;ref name="Papp1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nee1991"/&gt; This model is not particularly sensitive or informative as to the mechanisms generating bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions, because the mechanisms generating the lognormal species abundance distribution are still under heavy debate.

===Core-satellite hypothesis===
Bimodality may be generated by colonization-extinction metapopulation dynamics associated with a strong rescue effect.&lt;ref name="Hanski1982"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanski1993"/&gt; This model is appropriate to explain the range structure of a community that is influenced by metapopulation processes, such as dispersal and [[local extinction]].&lt;ref name="Storch2002"/&gt; However, it is not robust because the shape of the occupancy frequency distribution generated by this model is highly sensitive
to species immigration and extinction parameters.&lt;ref name="Tokeshi1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheiner1997"/&gt; The metapopulation model does also not explain scale dependence in the occupancy frequency distribution.

===Occupancy probability transition===
The third model that describes bimodality in the occupancy frequency distribution is based on the [[scaling pattern of occupancy]] under a [[Self-similarity|self-similar]] assumption of species distributions (called the occupancy probability transition [OPT] model).&lt;ref name="Hui2007a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hui2007b"/&gt; The OPT model is based on Harte et al.'s bisection scheme&lt;ref name="Harte1999"/&gt; (although not on their probability rule) and the recursion probability of occupancy at different scales. The OPT model has been shown to support two empirical observations:&lt;ref name="Hui2007a"/&gt;
#That bimodality is prevalent in interspecific occupancy frequency distributions.
#that the number of satellite species in the distribution increases towards finer scales.

The OPT model demonstrates that the sample grain of a study, sampling adequacy, and the distribution of species saturation coefficients (a measure of the fractal dimensionality of a species distribution) in a community are together largely able to explain the patterns commonly found in empirical occupancy distributions. [[Cang Hui|Hui]] and McGeoch (2007) further show that the self-similarity in species distributions breaks down according to a power relationship with spatial scales, and we therefore adopt a power-scaling assumption for modeling species occupancy distributions.&lt;ref name="Hui2007b"/&gt; The bimodality in occupancy frequency distributions that is common in species communities, is confirmed to a result for certain mathematical and statistical properties of the probability distribution of occupancy. The results thus demonstrate that the use of the bisection method in combination with a power-scaling assumption is more appropriate for modeling species distributions than the use of a self-similarity assumption, particularly at fine scales. This model further provokes the Harte-Maddux debate: Harte et al.&lt;ref name="Harte1999"/&gt; demonstrated that the [[power law]] form of the [[Species-area curve|species–area relationship]] may be derived from a bisected, self-similar landscape and a community-level probability rule.&lt;ref name="Ostling2004"/&gt; However, Maddux&lt;ref name="Maddux2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maddux1999"/&gt; showed that this self-similarity model generates biologically unrealistic predictions. [[Cang Hui|Hui]] and McGeoch (2008) resolve the Harte–Maddux debate by demonstrating that the problems identified by Maddux result from an assumption that the probability of occurrence of a species at one scale is independent of its probability of occurrence at the next, and further illustrate the importance of considering patterns of species co-occurrence, and the way in which species occupancy patterns change with scale, when modeling species distributions.&lt;ref name="Hui2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="751">'''One-compartment kinetics''' for a chemical compound specifies that the uptake in the compartment is proportional to the concentration outside the compartment, and the elimination is proportional to the concentration inside the compartment. Both the compartment and the environment outside the compartment are considered to be homogeneous (well mixed).The compartment typically represents some organism (e.g. a fish or a [[Daphnia|daphnid]]).

This model is used in the simplest versions of the [[DEBtox]] method for the quantification of effects of toxicants.

{{Science with neutrons}}
The '''Open-pool Australian lightwater reactor''' ('''OPAL''') is a 20&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]] (MW) [[Pool-type reactor|pool-type]] nuclear [[research reactor]]. Officially opened in April 2007, it replaced the [[High Flux Australian Reactor]] as Australia's only nuclear reactor, and is located at the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] (ANSTO) Research Establishment in [[Lucas Heights, New South Wales]], a suburb of [[Sydney]]. Both OPAL and its predecessor have been commonly known as simply the '''Lucas Heights reactor''', after their location.

==Functions==
The main reactor uses are:

* Irradiation of target materials to produce [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]] for medical and industrial applications
* Research in the fields of [[materials science]] and [[structural biology]] using neutron beams and its sophisticated suite of experimental equipment
* Analysis of minerals and samples using the [[Neutron activation analysis|neutron activation technique]] and the delay neutron activation technique
* Irradiation of [[Boule (crystal)|silicon ingots]] in order to dope them with phosphorus and produce the basic material used in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices

The reactor runs on an operation cycle of 30 days non-stop at full power, followed by a stop of 5 days to reshuffle the fuel.

During year 2014 OPAL ran a total of 290 days at power, and over 300 days in 2015, which represents a world-leading level of availability.

==History==
The [[Argentina|Argentine]] company [[INVAP]] was fully responsible through a [[turnkey]] contract, signed in June 2000, for the delivery of the reactor, performing the design, construction and commissioning. Local civil construction was performed by INVAP's partner, [[John Holland Group|John Holland]]-[[Evans Deakin]] Industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leighton.com.au/our-business/projects/completed-projects/ansto-replacement-research-reactor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318134231/http://www.leighton.com.au/our-business/projects/completed-projects/ansto-replacement-research-reactor |title=ANSTO Replacement Research Reactor |work=Leighton Holdings |archivedate=18 March 2015 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility features a large (20-litre) liquid-deuterium cold neutron source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/AboutANSTO/OPAL/Capabilities/ColdNeutronSource/ |title=Cold Neutron Source |author=Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation |work=ansto.gov.au |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[supermirror]] guides, and a 35&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;65&amp;nbsp;m guide hall.  The cold source was designed by the Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pnpi.spb.ru/ |title=Petersburg Nuclear Physics Institute. National Research Centre "Kurchatov Institute" |work=pnpi.spb.ru |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the cryogenic system designed and supplied by [[Air Liquide]] and the initial set of four supermirror guides supplied by Mirrotron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mirrotron.kfkipark.hu/ |title=Mirrotron Multilayer Laboratory |author=Szimandl Béla |work=kfkipark.hu |accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists occupied the Lucas Heights facility to protest the construction of OPAL. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower. Their protest highlighted the security and environmental risks of the production of nuclear materials and the shipment of radioactive waste from the facility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2001/12/18/443080.htm|title=Greenpeace raid on Australian nuclear reactor|date=2001-12-18|website=www.abc.net.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

OPAL was opened on 20 April 2007 by then [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |publisher=[[ANSTO]] |date=20 April 2007 |title=PM Opens Australia’s New Nuclear Reactor |url=http://www.ansto.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/9662/OPAL_opening_release.pdf |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the replacement for the [[HIFAR]] reactor.  ANSTO received an operating licence from the [[Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency]] (ARPANSA) in July 2006, allowing commencement of hot commissioning, where fuel is first loaded into the reactor core. OPAL went [[Critical mass|critical]] for the first time on the evening of 12 August 2006 and reached full power for the first time on the morning of 3 November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |publisher=[[INVAP]] |date=10 November 2006 |title=Sydney Opal reactor at full power |url=http://www.invap.net/news/novedades-e.php?id=20061110183244 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facility details==
[[File:OPAL reactorpools.jpg|right|thumb|The OPAL reactor pools. Made of stainless steel and 4.5&amp;nbsp;m wide, it contains demineralised water used for shielding and cooling.]]

The [[Nuclear reactor core|reactor core]] consists of 16 low-enriched plate-type [[Nuclear fuel|fuel assemblies]] and is located under 13 metres of water in an open pool. Light water (normal H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is used as the coolant and [[Neutron moderator|moderator]] while [[heavy water]] (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is used as the [[neutron]] reflector. The purpose of the neutron reflector is to improve neutron economy in the reactor, and hence to increase the maximum neutron flux.

OPAL is the centrepiece of the facilities at ANSTO, providing efficient and rapid [[Radiopharmacology|radiopharmaceutical]] and [[radioisotope]] production, [[irradiation]] services (including neutron [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] doping of silicon), [[neutron activation analysis]] and [[Particle beam|neutron beam]] research. OPAL is able to produce four times as many radioisotopes for [[nuclear medicine]] treatments as the old [[HIFAR]] reactor, and a wider array of radioisotopes for the treatment of disease. The modern design includes a [[Cold neutron|cold]] [[neutron source]] (CNS).

The OPAL reactor already has received seven awards in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |publisher=[[INVAP]] |date=14 November 2006 |title=The OPAL reactor already has received seven awards in Australia |url=http://www.invap.net/news/novedades-e.php?id=20061114194744 |accessdate=2009-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neutron scattering at OPAL==
The [[Bragg Institute]] at [[ANSTO]] hosts OPAL's [[neutron scattering]] facility. It is now running as a user facility serving the scientific community in Australia and around the world. New funding was received in 2009 in order to install further competitive instruments and beamlines. The actual facility comprises the following instruments:

===ECHIDNA===
[[File:ECHIDNA HRPD design.jpg|thumb|right|240|Engineering drawing of the ECHIDNA High-Resolution Powder Diffractometer (August 2003)]]
[[File:NeutronMonochromatorBNL.jpg|thumb|right|240|The Ge-115 monochromator has been acquired from the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].]]
'''ECHIDNA''' is the name of the high-resolution [[neutron diffraction|neutron]]  [[powder diffraction|powder diffractometer]]. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using [[neutron radiation]] analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the Australian [[monotreme]] ''[[echidna]]'', as the spiny peaks of the instrument looks like an echidna.

It operates with [[neutron temperature|thermal neutron]]s. One of the main features is the array of 128 collimators and position sensitive detectors for rapid data acquisition. ECHIDNA allows for structure determinations, texture measurements and reciprocal space mapping of single crystals in most different sample environments serving the physics, chemistry, materials, minerals and earth-science communities. ECHIDNA is part of the [[Bragg Institute]]'s park of [[neutron scattering]] instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liss |first=L. |last2=Hunter |first2=B. |last3=Hagen |first3=M. |last4=Noakes |first4=T. |last5=Kennedy |first5=S. |year=2006 |title=Echidna—the new high-resolution powder diffractometer being built at OPAL |url=http://liss.freeshell.org/KDL/papers/LissEchidnaICNS2005.pdf |journal=[[Physica B]] |volume=385-386 |issue= |pages=1010 |doi=10.1016/j.physb.2006.05.322 |bibcode=2006PhyB..385.1010L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Components====
* Neutron guide
*: The instrument is located on the TG1 [[neutron temperature|thermal neutron]] guide of the OPAL reactor. The distance from the reactor is 58&amp;nbsp;m. The position is the second on the guide after the [[WOMBAT - High Intensity Powder Diffractometer|WOMBAT]] instrument. The size of the guide is 300&amp;nbsp;mm high by 50&amp;nbsp;mm wide, and it is plated with [[neutron supermirror|supermirror]] coatings.
* Primary [[collimator]]
*: There are Söller [[collimator]]s prior to the monochromator in order to reduce the divergence of the beam and to increase the angular resolution of the instrument. Since this is an intensity compromise, two items of [[Minute of arc|5']] and [[Minute of arc|10']], respectively, can be interchanged or fully removed by an automated mechanism. The collimators cover the full size of the beam delivered by the neutron guide.
* [[Crystal monochromator|Monochromator]]
*: The monochromator is made by slabs of [[Miller index|&lt;nowiki&gt;[115]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] oriented Germanium crystals which are inclined towards each other in order to focus down the Bragg reflected beam. The device has been acquired from the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] in the USA after the shutdown of their neutron facility.
* Secondary collimator
*: Optionally a secondary collimator with [[Minute of arc|10']] angular acceptance and 200&amp;nbsp;mm &amp;times; 20&amp;nbsp;mm can be placed in the monochromatic beam between the monochromator and the sample, which again influences the resolution function of the instrument.
* Slit system
*: Two automated sets of horizontal and vertical pairs of absorbing plates allow to cut down the size of the monochromatic beam prior to the secondary collimator and sample size. They remove unwanted neutrons and reduce the background near the detector. In addition, they allow selection of the sample position to be studied.
* Beam monitor
*: A [[Uranium-235|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]] [[neutron detector|fission monitor]] measures the amount of neutrons incident to the sample. The efficiency is [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)|10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt;]] and most neutrons traverse the device undisturbed. The monitor counts are important to correct for beam flux variations due to changes in the reactor or at the upstream instrument.
* Sample stage
*:The sample is supported by a heavy load [[goniometer]] consisting of a 360° vertical omega rotation axis, x-y translation tables and a chi-phi cross tilt stage of ±20° range. It can hold a few hundred kilograms in order to support heavier sample environments, such as cryostats, furnaces, magnets, load frames, reaction chambers and others. A typical powder sample is filled into vanadium cans which give little unstructured background. The mentioned sample environment allows measurement of changes in the sample as a function of external parameters, like temperature, pressure, magnetic field, etc. The goniometer stage is redundant for most powder diffraction measurements, but will be important for single crystal and texture measurements, where the orientation of the sample plays a role.
* Detector [[collimator]]s
*:A set of 128 detectors each equipped which a 5' collimator in front are arranged in a 160° sector focusing to the sample. The collimators select the scattered radiation into the well defined ranges of 128 angular positions. The whole collimator and detector setup is mounted on a common table which is scanned in finer steps around the sample, to be combined further into a continuous diffraction pattern.
* Detector tubes
*:The 128 linear position-sensitive [[Helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]] gas detector tubes cover the full opening height of 300&amp;nbsp;mm behind the collimators. They determine the position of the neutron event by charge division over the resistive anode towards each end of the detector. Overall and local count rates lie in the several 10000&amp;nbsp;Hz range.

===PLATYPUS===
PLATYPUS is a [[time-of-flight]] [[Neutron reflectometry|reflectometer]] built on the [[neutron temperature|cold neutron]] source. The instrument serves to determine the structure of interfaces using highly collimated [[neutron radiation|neutron beams]]. These beams are shone on to the surface at low angles (typically less than 2 degrees) and the intensity of the reflected radiation is measured as a function of angle of incidence.

It operates using cold neutrons with a wavelength band of 0.2–2.0&amp;nbsp;nm.  Although up to three different angles of incidence are required for each reflectivity curve, the time-of-flight nature means that timescales of kinetic processes are accessible. By analysing the reflected signal one builds a picture of the chemical structure of the interface.  This instrument can be used for examining biomembranes, lipid bilayers, magnetism, adsorbed surfactant layers, etc.

it is named after [[Platypus|''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'']], the semi-aquatic mammal native to Australia.

===WOMBAT===
WOMBAT is a high-intensity [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] [[powder diffraction|powder diffractometer]]. The instrument serves to determine the crystalline structures of materials using neutron radiation analogous to X-ray techniques. It is named after the [[wombat]], a [[marsupial]] indigenous to Australia.

It will operate with [[thermal neutron]]s. It has been designed for highest flux and data acquisition speed in order to deliver time resolved diffraction patterns in a fraction of a second. Wombat will concentrate on ''in-situ'' studies and time critical investigations, such as structure determinations, texture measurements and reciprocal space mapping of single crystals in most different sample environments serving the physics, chemistry, materials, minerals and earth-science communities.

===KOWARI===
'''KOWARI''' is a [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] [[residual stress]] diffractometer. [[Strain (materials science)|Strain]] scanning using [[thermal neutron]]s is a [[powder diffraction]] technique in a polycrystalline block of material probing the change of atomic spacing due to internal or external [[Stress (physics)|stress]]. It is named after the [[kowari]], an Australian marsupial.

It provides a diagnostic non-destructive tool to optimise e.g. [[post weld heat treatment]] (PWHT, similar to [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]) of welded structures. Tensile stresses for example drive crack growth in engineering components and compressive stresses inhibit crack growth (for example cold-expanded holes subject to fatigue cycling). Life extension strategies have high economic impact and strain scanning provides the stresses needed to calculate remaining life as well as the means to monitor the condition of components since it is non-destructive. One of the main features is the sample table that will allow examination of large engineering components while orienting and positioning them very accurately.

During the initial testing and commissioning stages each equipment and system was tested isolated and then in an integrated manner. First tests were carried out without nuclear fuel loaded into the core, and then a careful plan was followed for loading nuclear fuel in the reactor core and reaching a nuclear chain for the first time. Successive increasing power steps were followed to get the reactor to run at full power. Once commissioning was completed, the Australian Nuclear regulatory Body (ARPANSA) issued a licence that authorize its operation at full power. During the first operation cycles a typical teething period of a [[first of a kind design]] followed.&lt;ref&gt;

The reactor has shown to be a reliable supplier of [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, as well as neutron to conduct material research activities using the several instruments.&lt;ref&gt;

Since commissioned the reactor has been running with a very high availability, during the term 2012-13 it operated 265 days at full power (including an extended routine maintenance period), during 2013-14 for 294 days at full power, and during 2014-15 it operated 307 days at full power.

As per Sept 2016 it has accumulated a total of 2200 equivalent Full Power Days. Each 30 days operating cycle more than 150 batches of Silicon are irradiated, Mo99 is produced on a regular basis for the nuclear medicine market. OPAL has delivered 4 million doses.  Regarding research with neutrons the world class Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering (formerly Bragg Institute) features more than 120 scientists and 13 neutron beam operational instruments, and has produced more than 600 scientific research papers using the neutrons coming from OPAL core.

In [[statistics]] The '''optimistic knowledge gradient'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/chen15a/chen15a.pdf] Statistical Decision Making for Optimal Budget Allocation in Crowd Labeling Xi Chen, Qihang Lin, Dengyong Zhou; 16(Jan):1−46, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is  a new approximation policy proposed by Xi Chen, Qihang Lin and Dengyong Zhou in 2013.  This policy is created to solve the challenge of computationally intractable of large size of [[optimal computing budget allocation]] problem in binary/multi-class crowd labeling where each label from the crowd has a certain cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~xichen/images/ICML_Crowd_Budget.pdf] Proceedings of the 30-th International Conference on Machine Learning, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013. JMLR:W&amp;CP volume 28.  Xi Chen, Qihang Lin, Dengyong Zhou&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
The [[optimal computing budget allocation]] problem is formulated as a Bayesian [[Markov decision process]]&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/Papers/Thesis.ps.gz Learning to Solve Markovian Decision Processes] by [http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~baveja/ Satinder P. Singh]&lt;/ref&gt;(MDP) and is solved by using the [[dynamic programming]] (DP) algorithm where the Optimistic knowledge gradient policy is used to solve the computationally intractable of the [[dynamic programming]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://20bits.com/articles/introduction-to-dynamic-programming/ An Introduction to Dynamic Programming]&lt;/ref&gt; (DP) algorithm.

Consider a budget allocation issue in [[crowdsourcing]]. The particular crowdsourcing problem we considering is crowd labeling. Crowd labeling is a large amount of [[labeling]] tasks which are hard to solve by machine, turn out to easy to solve by human beings, then we just outsourced to an unidentified group of random people in a distributed environment.

==Methodology==
We want to finish this labeling tasks rely on the power of the crowd hopefully. For example, suppose we want to identify a picture according to the people in a picture is adult or not, this is a [[Bernoulli distribution|Bernoulli]] labeling problem, and all of us can do in one or two seconds, this is an easy task for human being. However, if we have tens of thousands picture like this, then this is no longer the easy task any more. That's why we need to rely on [[crowdsourcing]] framework to make this fast. [[Crowdsourcing]] framework of this consists of two steps. Step one, we just dynamically acquire from the crowd for items. On the other sides, this is dynamic procedure. We don't just send out this picture to everyone and we focus every response, instead, we do this in quantity. We are going to decide which picture we send it in the next, and which worker we are going to hire in the crowd in the next. According to his or her historical labeling results. And each picture can be sent to multiple workers and every worker can also work on different pictures. Then after we collect enough number of labels for different picture, we go to the second steps where we want to infer true label of each picture based on the collected labels. So there are multiple ways we can do inference. For instance, the simplest we can do this is just majority vote. The problem is that no free lunch, we have to pays for worker for each label he or she provides and we only have a limited project budget. So the question is how to spend the limited budget in a smart way.

==Challenges==
Before showing the mathematic model, the paper mentions what kinds of challenges we are facing.

=== Challenge 1 ===
First of all, the items have a different level of difficulty to compute the label, in a previous example, some picture are easy to classify. In this case, you will usually see very consistent labels from the crowd. However, if some pictures are ambiguous, people may disagree with each other resulting in highly inconsistent labelling. So we may allocate more resources on this ambiguous task.

===Challenge 2===
And another difficulty we often have is that the worker are not perfect, sometimes this worker are not responsible, they just provide the [[random]] label, therefore, of course, we would not spend our budget on this no reliable workers. Now the problem is both the difficulty of the pictures and the reliability of the worker we completely unknown at the beginning. We can only estimate them during the procedure. Therefore, we are naturally facing to exploration and exploitation, and our goal is to give a reasonable good policy to spend money to the right way–maximize the overall accuracy of final inferred labels.

==Mathematical model==
For the mathematical model, we have the ''K'' items, &lt;math&gt;i = \{1,2,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;, and total budget is ''T'' and we assume each label cost 1 so we are going to have ''T'' labels eventually. We assume each items has true label &lt;math&gt;Z_i&lt;/math&gt;which positive or negative, this binomial cases and we can extended to multiple class, labeling cases, this a singular idea. And the positive set &lt;math&gt;H^*&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the set of items whose true label is positive. And &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; also defined a soft-label, &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; for each item which number between 0 and 1, and we define &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; as underlying probability of being labeled as positive by a member randomly picked from a group of perfect workers.

In this first case, we assume for every worker is perfect, it means they all reliable, but being perfect doesn’t means this worker gives the same answer or right answer. It just means they will try their best to figure out the best answer in their mind, and suppose everyone is perfect worker, just randomly picked one of them, and with &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; probability, we going to get a guy who believe this one is positive. That is how we explain &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;. So we are assume a label &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is drawn from Bernoulli(&lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; must be consistent with the true label, which means &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; is greater or equal to 0.5 if and only if this item is positive with a true positive label. So our goal is to learn H*, the set of positive items. In other word, we want to make an inferred positive set H based on collected labels to maximize:

: &lt;math&gt;
\sum_{i=1}^k (\textbf{1}_{(i\in H)}\textbf{1}_{(i\in H^\star)}+\textbf{1}_{(i\notin H)} \textbf{1}_{(i\notin H^\star)})
&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;|H\cap H^\star| + |H^c\cap H^{\star c}|&lt;/math&gt;

=== step1: Bayesian decision process===
Before show the Bayesian framework, the paper use an example to mention why we choose Bayesian instead of frequency approach, such that we can propose some posterior of prior distribution on the soft-label &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;. We assume each &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt; is drawn from a known Beta prior:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i \sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^o,b_i^o)&lt;/math&gt;

And the matrix:

: &lt;math&gt;s^o = \left \langle (a_i^o,b_i^o)\right \rangle_{i=1}^k \in \textbf{R}^{k\times2}&lt;/math&gt;

So we know that the Bernoulli conjugate of beta, so once we get a new label for item i, we going to update posterior distribution, the beta distribution by:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i \sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^t,b_i^t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y_i\mid \theta_i\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i\mid y_i = 1\sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^t+1,b_i^t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i\mid y_i = -1\sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^t+1,b_i^t)&lt;/math&gt;

Depending on the label is positive or negative.

Here is the whole procedure in the high level, we have T stage, &lt;math&gt;0\le t \le T-1&lt;/math&gt;. And in current stage we look at matrix S, which summarized the posterior distribution information for all the &lt;math&gt;\theta_i&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;s^t = \left \langle (a_i^t,b_i^t)\right \rangle_{i=1}^k \in \textbf{R}^{k\times2}&lt;/math&gt;

We are going to make a decision, choose the next item to label &lt;math&gt;i_t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i_t \in \{1,2,\ldots,k\}&lt;/math&gt;.

And depending what the label is positive or negative, we add a matrix to getting a label:

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i \sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^t,b_i^t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y_i\mid \theta_i\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i\mid y_i = 1\sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^t+1,b_i^t)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i\mid y_i = -1\sim \mathrm{Beta}(a_i^t+1,b_i^t)&lt;/math&gt;

Above all, this is the whole framework.

=== step2: Inference on positive set===
When the ''t'' labels are collected, we can make an inference about the positive set ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; based on posterior distribution given by ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
H_t &amp; = \operatorname{argmax}\limits_{H \subset\{1,2,\ldots,k\}} E \left( \sum_{i=1}^k (\textbf{1}(i\in H)\textbf{1}(i\in H^\star)+\textbf{1}(i\notin H) \textbf{1}{(i\notin H^{\star})})\mid S^\star\right) \\
&amp; =\operatorname{argmax}\limits_{H \subset\{1,2,\ldots,k\}} \sum_{i=1}^k (\textbf{1}(i\in H) \Pr(i\in H^\star\mid S^t) +\textbf{1}(i\notin H) \Pr(i\notin H^\star \mid S^t)) \\
&amp; =\{i:\Pr(i\in H^\star\mid S^t)\geq0.5\}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

So here become the Bernoulli selection problem, we just take to look at the probability of being positive or being negative conditional &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt; to see is greater than 0.5 or not, if it is greater than 0.5, then we prove this item into the current infer positive set &lt;math&gt;H_t&lt;/math&gt; so this is a cost form for current optimal solution &lt;math&gt;H_t&lt;/math&gt; based on the information in &lt;math&gt;S_t&lt;/math&gt;.

After know what is optimal solution, then the paper show what is the optimal value. Plug &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; in the optimal function,

: &lt;math&gt;h(x) = \max(x,1-x)&lt;/math&gt;

This function is just a single function which choose the larger one between the conditional probability of being positive and being negative. Once we get one more label for item i, we take a difference between this value, before and after we get a new label, we can see this conditional probability can actually simplify as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
R(s^t,i_t,y_{i_t}) &amp; = \sum_{i=1}^k h(\Pr{(i\in H^\star\mid s^{t+1})})-\sum_{i=1}^k h(\Pr(i\in H^\star\mid s^t)) \\
&amp; = \sum_{i=1}^k h(\Pr{(a_i^{t+1,b_i^{t+1}})})-\sum_{i=1}^k h(\Pr(a_i^t,b_i^t)).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The positive item being positive only depends on the beta posterior, therefore, if only the function of parameter of beta distribution function are ''a'' and ''b'', as

: &lt;math&gt;h(\Pr(a_{i_t}^{t+1},b_{i_t}^{t+1}))-h(\Pr(a_{i_t}^t,b_{i_t}^t))&lt;/math&gt;

One more label for this particular item, we double change the posterior function, so all of this items can be cancel except 1, so this is the change for whole accuracy and we defined as stage-wise reward: improvement the inference accuracy by one more sample. Of course this label have two positive value, we’ve get positive label or negative label, take average for this two, get expect reward. We just choose item to be label such that the expect reward is maximized using '''Knowledge Gradient''':

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
i_t &amp; = \operatorname{argmax}\limits_{i \in\{1,2,\ldots,k\}} E(R(s^t,i,y_i)\mid s^t) \\
&amp; = \operatorname{argmax}\limits_{i \in\{1,2,\ldots,k\}} \left(\frac{a_i^t}{a_i^t+b_i^t} R(s^t,i,1)+\frac{b_i^t}{a_i^t+b_i^t}R(s^t,i,-1)\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

They are multiple items, let us know how do we break the ties. If we break the tie deterministically, which means we choose the smallest index. We are going to have a problem because this is not consistent which means the positive stage &lt;math&gt;H_t&lt;/math&gt; does not converge to the true positive stage &lt;math&gt;H^*&lt;/math&gt;.

So we can also try to break the ties randomly, it works, however, we will see the performance is almost like uniform sampling, is the best reward. The writer’s policy is kinds of more greedy, instead of choosing the average in stage once reward, we can actually calculate the larger one, the max of the two stage possible reward, so '''Optimistic Knowledge Gradient''':

: &lt;math&gt;i_t = \operatorname{argmax}\limits_{i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}}(R^+(S^t,i)) = \max(R(S^t,i,1),R(S^t,i,-1))&lt;/math&gt;

And we know under optimistic knowledge gradient, the final inference accuracy converge to 100%. Above is based on every worker is perfect, however, in practice, workers are not always responsible. So if in imperfect workers, we assume K items, &lt;math&gt;1\leq i \leq k&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;\theta_i\in(0,1)\sim \mathrm{Bet}a(a_i^o,b_i^o)&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of item &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; being labeled as positive by a perfect worker.
M workers, &lt;math&gt;1\leq j \leq M&lt;/math&gt; , &lt;math&gt;\rho_j\in (0,1)\sim \mathrm{Beta}(c_j^o,d_j^o)&lt;/math&gt;
The probability of worker &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; giving the same label as a perfect worker. Distribution of the label &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; from worker &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; to item &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(Z_{ij}=1\mid \theta_i,\rho_j) = \Pr(Z_{ij}=1\mid Y_i =1) \Pr(Y_i=1)+\Pr(Z_{ij}=1\mid Y_i = -1)\Pr(Y_i = -1)=\rho_j\theta_i t (1-\rho_j)(1-\theta_i)&lt;/math&gt;

And the action space is that

: &lt;math&gt;
\Pr(Z_{ij}=1\mid \theta_i,\rho_j) = Pr(Z_{ij}=1\mid Y_i =1) \Pr(Y_i=1)+\Pr(Z_{ij}=1\mid Y_i = -1)\Pr(Y_i = -
1)=\rho_j\theta_i t (1-\rho_j)(1-\theta_i)=\rho_j\theta_i t (1-\rho_j)(1-\theta_i),
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\qquad\qquad (i,j)\in \{1,2,\ldots,k\}\times\{1,2,\ldots,M\}&lt;/math&gt;, label matrix: &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij}\in\{-1,1\}&lt;/math&gt;

It is difficult to calculate, so we can use [[Variational Bayesian methods]]&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/vbayes/ Variational-Bayes Repository] A repository of papers, software, and links related to the use of variational methods for approximate Bayesian learning 
&lt;/ref&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\Pr(i\in H^\star\mid S^t)&lt;/math&gt;

Organisms can live at [[high altitude]], either on land, in water, or while flying.  Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at such altitudes challenging, though many species have been successfully [[evolutionary adaptation|adapted]] via considerable [[physiology|physiological]] changes. As opposed to short-term [[Effects of high altitude on humans|acclimatisation]] (immediate physiological response to changing environment), high-altitude [[adaptation]] means irreversible, [[adaptive evolution|evolved physiological responses]] to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable [[ethology|behavioural]] and [[mutation|genetic changes]]. Among animals, only few mammals (such as [[yak]], [[ibex]], [[Tibetan gazelle]], [[vicuna]]s, [[llama]]s, [[mountain goat]]s, etc.) and certain [[bird]]s are known to have completely adapted to high-altitude environments.&lt;ref name=storz&gt;{{cite journal|author= Storz JF, Scott GR, Cheviron ZA|year=2007|title= Phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in vertebrates | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=21112992| journal= J Exp Biol|volume=213|issue=pt 24|pages= 4125–4136 |pmid= 21112992 |pmc= 2992463 |doi= 10.1242/jeb.048181|last2=Scott|last3=Cheviron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human populations such as some [[tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[South Americans]] and [[people of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] live in the otherwise uninhabitable high mountains of the [[Himalayas]], [[Andes]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands]] respectively. The adaptation of humans to high altitude is an example of [[natural selection]] in action.&lt;ref name=fris&gt;{{cite book|author=Frisancho AR|title=Human Adaptation and Accommodation|year=1993 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-K_SYHBo42MC&amp;pg|pages=175–301 |isbn =0472095110 |publisher=University of Michigan Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High-altitude adaptations provide examples of [[convergent evolution]], with adaptations occurring simultaneously on three continents. Tibetan humans and Tibetan domestic dogs share a genetic mutation in ''[[EPAS1]]'', but it has not been seen in Andean humans.&lt;ref name="genetic convergence in the adaptation of dogs and humans"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=G.D|last2=Fan |first2=R.X|last3=Zhai |first3=W|last4=Liu |first4=F |last5=Wang|first5=L|last6=Zhong |first6=L|last7=Wu|first7=H|title=Genetic convergence in the adaptation of dogs and humans to the high-altitude environment of the tibetan plateau|journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|date=2014|volume=6|pages=206–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stenobarc animals are those with lesser ability to endure a range of differences in altitude, such as [[rabbit]]s, [[mountain goat]]s, [[sheep]], and [[cat]]s. Among [[domesticated animals]], yaks are perhaps the highest dwelling animals.

{{main|Yak}}

Among [[domesticated animals]], yaks (''[[Bos grunniens]]'') are the highest dwelling animals of the world, living at {{convert|3000|-|5000|m|ft}}. The yak is the most important domesticated animal for Tibet highlanders in [[Qinghai Province]] of [[China]], as the primary source of [[milk]], [[meat]] and [[fertilizer]]. Unlike other yak or [[cattle]] species, which suffer from hypoxia in the Tibetan Plateau, the Tibetan domestic yaks thrive only at high altitude, and not in lowlands. Their physiology is well-adapted to high altitudes, with proportionately larger lungs and heart than other cattle, as well as greater capacity for transporting oxygen through their blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Wiener G, Jianlin H, Ruijun L | title= The Yak |edition= 2 |publisher= Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Bangkok, Thailand| url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/AD347E/ad347e08.htm | isbn= 9251049653}}&lt;/ref&gt; In yaks, [[hypoxia-inducible factor]] 1 (''HIF-1'') has high expression in the [[brain]], [[lung]] and [[kidney]], showing that it plays an important role in the adaptation to low oxygen environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=DP|last2=Li|first2=HG|last3=Li|first3=YJ|last4=Guo|first4=SC|last5=Yang|first5=J|last6=Qi|first6=DL|last7=Jin|first7=C|last8=Zhao|first8=XQ|display-authors=4|year=2012 |title=Hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha cDNA cloning and its mRNA and protein tissue specific expression in domestic yak (''Bos grunniens'') from Qinghai-Tibetan plateau| url= |journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun |volume=348 |issue=1 |pages=310–319 |pmid=16876112 |doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2006.07.064}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 July 2012 the complete genomic sequence and analyses of a female domestic yak was announced, providing important insights into understanding mammalian [[genetic divergence|divergence]] and adaptation at high altitude.

For example, they found three genes that may play important roles in regulating the bodyʼs response to hypoxia, and five genes that were related to the optimisation of the energy from the food scarcity in the extreme plateau.

'''Photometry''' is a technique of [[astronomy]] concerned with [[measurement|measuring]] the [[flux]], or intensity of an [[astronomical object]]'s [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref name=sterken_manfroid1992/&gt;&lt;ref name=cv14/&gt; When photometry is performed over broad [[wavelength]] bands of [[radiation]], where not only the amount of radiation but also its spectral distribution is measured, the term ''[[spectrophotometry]]'' is used.

The word is composed of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] affixes ''[[:wikt:photo-|photo-]]'' ("light") and ''[[:wikt:-metry|-metry]]'' ("measure").

==Methods==

The methods used to perform photometry depend on the wavelength regime under study. At its most basic, photometry is conducted by gathering light in a [[telescope]], sometimes passing it through [[Photometric system|specialized photometric optical bandpass filters]], and then capturing and recording the light energy with a photosensitive instrument. Standard sets of [[passband]]s (called a [[photometric system]]) are defined to allow accurate comparison of observations.&lt;ref&gt;Warner, Brian (2006). ''A Practical Guide to Lightcurve Photometry and Analysis'',  Springer, {{ISBN|0-3872-9365-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, photometry in the near-[[infrared]] through short-wavelength [[ultra-violet]] was done with a photoelectric photometer, an instrument that measured the light intensity of a single object by directing its light onto a photosensitive cell. These have largely been replaced with [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] cameras that can simultaneously image multiple objects, although photoelectric photometers are still used in special situations, such as where fine time resolution is required.

==CCD photometry==

A CCD camera is essentially a grid of photometers, simultaneously measuring and recording the photons coming from all the sources in the field of view.  Because each CCD image records the photometry of multiple objects at once, various forms of photometric extraction can be performed on the recorded data; typically relative, absolute, and differential. All three will require the extraction of the raw image [[magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] of the target object, and a known comparison object. 
The observed signal from an object will typically cover many [[pixel]]s according to the [[point spread function]] (PSF) of the system. This broadening is due to both the optics in the telescope and the [[astronomical seeing]]. When obtaining photometry from a [[point source]], the flux is measured by summing all the light recorded from the object and subtracting the light due to the sky. The simplest technique, known as aperture photometry, consists of summing the pixel counts within an aperture centered on the object and subtracting the product of the nearby average sky count per pixel and the number of pixels within the aperture.&lt;ref name=mighell1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=laher2012/&gt; This will result in the raw flux value of the target object.  When doing photometry in a very crowded field, such as a [[globular cluster]], where the profiles of stars overlap significantly, one must use de-blending techniques, such as PSF fitting to determine the individual flux values of the overlapping sources.&lt;ref name=stetson1987/&gt;

===Calibrations===
After determining the flux of an object in counts, the flux is normally converted into [[instrumental magnitude]]. Then, the measurement is calibrated in some way. Which calibrations are used will depend in part on what type of photometry is being done. Typically, observations are processed for relative or differential photometry.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbell, Gerald R. (2013). ''Scientific Astrophotography: How Amateurs Can Generate and Use Professional Imaging Data'': 264-266. Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-5173-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Relative photometry is the measurement of the apparent brightness of multiple objects relative to each other. Absolute photometry is the measurement of the apparent brightness of an object on a [[photometric system|standard photometric system]]; these measurements can be compared with other absolute photometric measurements obtained with different telescopes or instruments. Differential photometry is the measurement of the difference in brightness of two objects. In most cases, differential photometry can be done with the highest [[accuracy and precision|precision]], while absolute photometry is the most difficult to do with high precision. Also, accurate photometry is usually more difficult when the [[apparent brightness]] of the object is fainter.

===Absolute photometry===
To perform absolute photometry one must correct for differences between the effective passband through which an object is observed and the passband used to define the standard photometric system. This is often in addition to all of the other corrections discussed above. Typically this correction is done by observing the object(s) of interest through multiple filters and also observing a number of [[photometric standard stars]]. If the standard stars cannot be observed simultaneously with the target(s), this correction must be done under photometric conditions, when the sky is cloudless and the extinction is a simple function of the [[airmass]].

===Relative photometry===
To perform relative photometry, one compares the instrument magnitude of the object to a known comparison object, and then corrects the measurements for spatial variations in the sensitivity of the instrument and the atmospheric extinction. This is often in addition to correcting for their temporal variations, particularly when the objects being compared are too far apart on the sky to be observed simultaneously. When doing the calibration from an image that contains both the target and comparison objects in close proximity, and using a photometric filter that matches the catalog magnitude of the comparison object most of the measurement variations decrease to null.

===Differential photometry===
Differential photometry is the simplest of the calibrations and most useful for time series observations. When using CCD photometry, both the target and comparison objects are observed at the same time, with the same filters, using the same instrument, and viewed through the same optical path. Most of the observational variables drop out and the differential magnitude is simply the difference between the instrument magnitude of the target object and the comparison object (∆Mag = C Mag – T Mag). This is very useful when plotting the change in magnitude over time of a target object, and is usually compiled into a [[light curve]].

===Surface photometry===
For spatially extended objects such as [[galaxy|galaxies]], it is often of interest to measure the spatial distribution of brightness within the galaxy rather than simply measuring the galaxy's total brightness. An object's [[surface brightness]] is its brightness per unit [[solid angle]] as seen in projection on the sky, and measurement of surface brightness is known as surface photometry. A common application would be measurement of a galaxy's surface brightness profile, meaning its surface brightness as a function of distance from the galaxy's center. For small solid angles, a useful unit of solid angle is the square [[Minute and second of arc|arcsecond]], and surface brightness is often expressed in magnitudes per square arcsecond.

==Applications==

Photometric measurements can be combined with the [[inverse-square law]] to determine the [[luminosity]] of an object if its [[distance]] can be determined, or its distance if its luminosity is known. Other physical properties of an object, such as its [[temperature]] or chemical composition, may be determined via broad or narrow-band spectrophotometry. Typically photometric measurements of multiple objects obtained through two filters are plotted on a color-magnitude diagram, which for stars is the observed version of the [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]. Photometry is also used to study the light variations of objects such as [[variable star]]s,&lt;ref&gt;North, Gerald, (2004). ''Observing Variable Stars, Novae and Supernovae'', Cambridge, {{ISBN|0-521-82047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[minor planet]]s, [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] and [[supernova]]e, or to detect [[methods of detecting extrasolar planets|transiting extrasolar planets]]. Measurements of these variations can be used, for example, to determine the [[orbital period]] and the [[radius|radii]] of the members of an [[binary star|eclipsing binary star]] system, the [[rotation period]] of a minor planet or a star, or the total energy output of a supernova.

==Software==
A number of free computer programs are available for synthetic aperture photometry and PSF-fitting photometry.

SExtractor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor|title=SExtractor – Astromatic.net|website=www.astromatic.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
[[Aperture Photometry Tool]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aperturephotometry.org|title=Aperture Photometry Tool: Home|website=www.aperturephotometry.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; are popular examples for aperture photometry.  The former is geared towards reduction of large scale galaxy-survey data, and the latter has a graphical user interface (GUI) suitable for studying individual images.
DAOPHOT is recognized as the best software for PSF-fitting photometry.&lt;ref name=stetson1987/&gt;

== Organizations ==
There are a number of organizations, from professional to amateur, that gather and share photometric data and make it available on-line. Some sites gather the data primarily as a resource for other researchers (ex. AAVSO) and some solicit contributions of data for their own research (ex. CBA):
* American Association of Variable Star Observers ([[American Association of Variable Star Observers|AAVSO]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org|title=aavso.org|website=www.aavso.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1232">In Australian botany, a '''phrase name''' is an informal name given to a [[plant]] [[taxon]] that has not yet been given a formal scientific name. The term was adopted in 1992 by the Australian Herbarium Information Systems Committee. The species phrase name consists of four components — the generic name, "sp." (to indicate it is a species), an identifier (geographical or morphological) and a collector’s name and number representing a herbarium specimen vouchering the concept of the new species.

:For example, the phrase name "''Dryandra'' sp. 1 (A.S.George 16647)" refers to an unnamed ''Dryandra'' species to which belong the herbarium specimen numbered 16647 collected by [[Alex George]]. 
This is a fairly typical example except that the number 1 is often replaced by something more informative, such as a location or distinctive morphological characteristic.

A phrase name is used for an unnamed taxon, which may or may not have already been formally described, but only for as long as no scientific name has been chosen for it; afterwards it may be listed as a synonym,

{{Wiktionary|planetary object}}

A '''planetary body''' or '''planetary object''' is any [[secondary body]] in the Solar System{{dubious|date=August 2015}} that is geologically differentiated or in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] and thus has a planet-like geology: a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or the larger [[natural satellite|moon]]s and [[asteroid]]s.

In 2002, planetary scientists [[Alan Stern]] and [[Harold Levison]] proposed the following algorithm to determine whether an object in space satisfies the definition for a planetary body.&lt;ref name=Stern_Levison_2002/&gt; The body must:

# Be low enough in mass that at no time (past or present) can it generate energy in its interior due to any self-sustaining nuclear fusion chain reaction.
# Be large enough that its shape becomes determined primarily by gravity rather than mechanical strength or other factors (such as surface tension or rotation rate) in less than a [[Hubble's law#Hubble time|Hubble time]], so that the body would on this timescale or shorter reach a state of hydrostatic equilibrium in its interior.

This definition excludes [[brown dwarf]]s and [[star]]s, as well as small bodies such as [[planetesimal]]s.

The interdependencies of politicians and media are known as the [[politico-media complex]].

Of doubtful virtue, declining amounts of content and substance can easily be compensated by giving news stories a [[sensationalist]]ic twinge. Politainment thus ranges on the same level as [[edutainment|edu-]] and [[infotainment]].

Typical catchlines in politainment reports or media will at times bluntly argue ''[[ad hominem]]'' in a generalizing manner and try to emphasize virtues and [[charisma]] ("''xyz'' will [[Make America Great Again|make America great again]]") or vices and weaknesses (by [[denunciation]]: "''xyz'' will wreck this country"). The latter example is also known as [[fear appeal]]. More moderate forms make extensive use of [[ambiguity|imprecise]], [[metaphoric]] language ([[allegories]], [[metonymy]], [[periphrase]]s, [[kenning]]s etc.).

Politainment can be both a communication aspect of (1) [[politician]]s and [[spin doctor]]s to their and their party's own advantage and the political adversary's disadvantage or (2) a strategy for [[news]] [[publisher]]s, [[journalist]]s, etc., to promote their medium and journalistic work.

Politainment may be a factor in [[party identification]], mass-influencing [[voter]]'s choices, it has thus become an indispensable tool in [[political campaign]]s and [[election]]s.&lt;ref name=blackwell/&gt;&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;David Schultz, Politainment, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As such it can also be one of the—seemingly innocuous—ingredients of [[crowd manipulation]] up to [[political warfare|political]] [[psychological warfare]].

[[File:Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Bidston Hill - geograph.org.uk - 335675.jpg|thumb|right|A former home of POL, built at [[Bidston]], west of Liverpool, in 1975 and used until around 2004. Demolished 2013.]]
The former '''Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory''' (POL) is based in Brownlow Street, [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. In April 2010, POL merged with the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton (NOCS) to form the [[National Oceanography Centre]]. The Liverpool laboratory's scientific research focuses on [[oceanography]] encompassing global sea-levels and geodesy, numerical modelling of continental shelf seas and coastal sediment processes. This research alongside activities of surveying, monitoring, data management and forecasting provides strategic support for the wider mission of the Natural Environment Research Council.

A leading world centre in tidal prediction (with related interests in earth tides and storm surges) and a leading European centre in modelling and forecasting shelf sea dynamics, it is home to the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk Coastal Observatory] in Liverpool Bay, the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071118111344/http://www.pol.ac.uk/ntslf/ National Tidal and Sea Level Facility], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071024132938/http://www.pol.ac.uk/psmsl/ Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level] and the [http://www.bodc.ac.uk British Oceanographic Data Centre].

==History==
The story of tidal measurements taken at Liverpool starts with [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] (1619–1641). He was one of the great scientists of the 17th century, and a man even [[Isaac Newton]] held in high regard. He is most famous for predicting, and then observing, the transit of Venus in 1639 at [[Much Hoole]] near Preston. However, he also had a great interest in understanding ocean tides, and in particular in verifying that tidal changes were closely related to variations in the Moon's orbit. Horrocks was born and died at [[Toxteth]]. Shortly before his death, he is known to have made measurements of high waters (probably the times and perhaps also the heights of high tide) on the Mersey coast near his home for at least a month. Unfortunately, his tidal measurements (but not his astronomical records) were lost in the civil war or possibly in the Fire of London.

A second major figure is [[William Hutchinson (privateer)|William Hutchinson]] (1716–1801) who compiled the first extended set of sea level measurements in the UK, together with a comprehensive set of meteorological information. His measurements of the heights and times of every high water during 1764–1793 at the Liverpool Old Dock not only spanned many years but were of high quality and are still being used in scientific research today.

Hutchinson made many important contributions to Liverpool's history.  The first half of his life was spent as a mariner and privateer captain during the Seven Years' War. Only in the second half did he develop into becoming a dock master, entrepreneur, inventor, author, philanthropist and, what we would nowadays call, scientific researcher. To mark Liverpool 2007 and 2008, POL together with colleagues at Brock University, Canada will produce a CD containing copies of all Hutchinson's tidal and meteorological data sets and background information on his life.  Hutchinson's measurements of the tides during 1764–1767 were used by Richard and George Holden to derive the first reliable publicly accessible tide tables in the UK. They first appeared in 1770 and were published for over 200 years.

===19th century===
During the 19th century, the Mersey Docks &amp; Harbour Board (MDHB) established an impressive network of a dozen state-of-the-art sea level stations along the Mersey, Dee and neighbouring coasts. They were used to provide the best possible tidal information to what became one of the most important ports in the Empire, together with data for surveying and [[coastal engineering]]. The main Liverpool gauges were at George’s Pier (the present-day Pier Head), then Prince's Pier (next to the ocean liner landing stage) and now Gladstone Dock. Together these sites have provided data which make up the longest UK sea level record and one of the longest in the world. These data have been used to study long term changes in mean sea levels and in the sea level extreme levels which often result in flooding.

In 1845 the MDHB established the Liverpool Observatory at Waterloo Dock, to provide all the tidal, meteorological and astronomical information required by ship owners. The expanding port resulted in the Observatory being relocated in 1866 to [[Bidston Hill]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]], where Hutchinson had established [[Bidston Hill#Bidston Lighthouse|Bidston Lighthouse]] in 1771. Its work became more focused on scientific research, rather than port operations, in 1929 when the Liverpool Observatory was merged with the Liverpool University Tidal Institute. This combined institute (with a number of name changes and official owners) was to become a world-famous centre for sea level and tidal research with no less than three Fellows of the Royal Society among its Directors: [[Joseph Proudman]], [[Arthur Doodson]] and David Cartwright.

===20th century===
In recent decades the institute has concentrated on sea level monitoring and prediction around UK coasts, and indeed on understanding sea level changes worldwide: the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level having been established at Bidston by Proudman in 1933 and as important as ever today. Such understanding informs government departments on policies for coastal protection, and contributes to international scientific study groups such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Thanks to the work of Doodson and other scientists in Liverpool, the tide can be predicted at any location around the UK with several centimetre accuracy.  Superimposed upon the ‘astronomical tide’, which is caused by the gravitational attraction of the Moon and Sun, is the ‘storm surge’ caused by strong winds and low air pressures. The major flood at [[Sea Palling]] and other parts of the north Norfolk coast in 1953 resulted from a large storm surge occurring at high tide. This disaster led to the development of the UK National Tide Gauge Network and the UK Storm Tide Forecasting System.  POL led the development of computer models to predict UK storm surges several days ahead based on forecast weather information.  Routine surge forecasts are now produced by the Met Office and result in Flood Warnings issued by the Environment Agency.

The institute was renamed the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory in 1987, a name which survived its move from Bidston to the campus of Liverpool University in 2004. Sea Level Science now constitutes one of the three main areas of expertise of POL research, the other two closely related fields being shelf sea science and numerical modelling of ocean processes. Although Sea Level Science has come a long way since Horrocks' measurements at Toxteth, the scientific importance of the subject is as great as ever, and Liverpool remains one of its main worldwide centres of excellence and its ‘UK home’.

{{About|the liquid phenomenon}}
[[File:Begliktash puddle Бегликташ локва — копия.jpg|thumb|upright 1.35|{{center|[[Reflection (mathematics)|Reflection]]s in a puddle}}]]

A '''puddle''' is a small accumulation of liquid, usually water, on a surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/puddle&lt;/ref&gt; It can form either by pooling in a depression on the surface, or by [[surface tension]] upon a flat surface. 

A puddle is generally shallow enough to walk through, and too small to traverse with a [[boat]] or [[raft]]. Small wildlife may be attracted to puddles.

Puddles in [[natural landscape]]s and [[habitat]]s, when not resulting from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], can indicate the presence of a [[Seep (hydrology)|seep]] or [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]. Small seasonal [[riparian]] plants, [[grasses]], and [[wildflower]]s can germinate with the ephemeral "head start" of moisture provided by a puddle.

Small wildlife, such as birds and insects, can use puddles as a source of essential moisture or for bathing. Raised constructed puddles, [[bird bath]]s, are a part of domestic and [[wildlife garden]]s as a [[garden ornament]] and "micro-habitat" [[Restoration ecology|restoration]]. [[Swallow]]s use the damp [[loam]] which gathers in puddles as a form of [[cement]] to help to build their nests. Many [[butterfly]] species and some other insects, but particularly male butterflies, need puddles for [[nutrient]]s they can contain, such as [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and [[amino acid]]s. In a behaviour known as [[Mud-puddling|puddling]] they seek out the damp mud that can be found around the edge of the puddles.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, P.H. and Pearson, D.L. (1982) "Why do male butterflies visit mud puddles?". ''Canadian Journal of Zoology'', '''60''' (3): 322–325. {{doi|10.1139/z82-043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some smaller forms of life, such as [[tadpoles]] or [[mosquito]] larvae, a puddle can form an entire habitat. Puddles that do not evaporate quickly can become [[standing water]], which can become [[pollution|polluted]] by decaying organisms and are often home to breeding [[mosquito]]s, which can act as vectors for diseases such as [[malaria]] and, of more recent concern in certain areas of the world, [[West Nile Virus]].

==Puddles on roads==
Puddles commonly form during [[rain]], and can cause problems for transport.  Due to the angle of the road, puddles tend to be forced by gravity to gather on the edges of the road. This can cause [[splash (fluid mechanics)|splashing]] as cars drive through the puddles, which causes water to be sprayed onto [[pedestrian]]s on the pavement. Irresponsible drivers may do this deliberately, which, in some countries, can lead to prosecution for careless driving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/4392092.stm Driver fined over puddle splash] ''BBC News'', 31 October 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puddles commonly form in [[potholes]] in a dirt road, or in any other space with a shallow depression and dirt. In such cases, these are sometimes referred to as ''mud puddles'', because mud tends to form in the bottoms, resulting in dirtied wheels or boots when disturbed.

In order to deal with puddles, roads and pavements are often built with a [[Cant (road/rail)|camber]] (technically called 'crowning'), being slightly [[wikt:convex|convex]] in nature, to force puddles to drain into the gutter, which has [[storm drain]] grates to allow the water to drain into the sewers. In addition, some surfaces are made to be porous, allowing the water to drain  through the surface to the [[aquifer]] below.

==Physics==
Due to the action of [[surface tension]], small puddles can also form if a liquid is spilt on a level surface. Puddles like this are common on kitchen floors. Puddles tend to [[evaporation|evaporate]] quickly due to the high surface-area-to-volume ratio and tend to be short lived. In cold conditions puddles can form [[Black ice|patches of ice]] which are slippery and difficult to see and can be a hazard to road vehicles and pedestrians.

==Children==
Puddles are a source of recreation for children, who often like jumping in puddles as an "up-side" to rain.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

==Puddle thinking==
It has been fashionable for millennia, and continues to be fashionable in some circles, to believe the Universe is designed for humans. Some critics of this view reject it as [[hubris]] or [[anthropocentrism]] and argue instead that through the process of evolution it is humans that have adapted to or been shaped by the Universe.&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, Gerald and Shapiro,Robert (1993) "A Puddlian Fable" in Huchingson, ''Religion and the Natural Sciences'', pp. 220–221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/scienceshow/stories/2006/1572643.htm|title=The anthropic universe|last=Williams|first=Robyn|date=18 February 2006|work=The Science Show|publisher=ABC Radio National|accessdate=19 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/proofs-of-god-in-a-photon-1527306.html | title=Proofs of God in a photon | last=Redfern | first=Martin|date=24 December 1995 | work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', [[Douglas Adams]] satirizes the belief that the universe is designed for humans:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=2002 |title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDchCdg9K-8C&amp;q=imagine+a+puddle#v=snippet&amp;q=imagine%20a%20puddle&amp;f=false |publisher=Harmony Books |page=131 |isbn= |accessdate=January 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in, fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
When [[Walter Raleigh]] met [[Queen Elizabeth I]], Raleigh is reputed to have thrown his coat over a [[mud]]dy puddle to allow the Queen to cross without getting her feet wet as an act of [[chivalry]].

Medieval legend spoke of one man who was desperate to find building materials for his house, so he stole [[cobblestone]]s from the road surface. The remaining hole filled with water and a horseman who later walked through the 'puddle' actually found himself drowning.{{Citation Needed|date=December 2014}} A similar legend, of a young boy drowning in a puddle that formed in a [[Pothole]] in a major street in the early years of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], is told as part of the [[Seattle Underground#Seattle Underground Tour|Seattle Underground Tour]].

==Environmental monitoring==
[[Environmental monitoring]] is the measurement of external dose rates due to sources in the environment or of radionuclide concentrations in environmental media.

==Source monitoring==
Source monitoring is a specific term used in ionising radiation monitoring, and according to the IAEA, is the measurement of activity in radioactive material being released to the environment or of external dose rates due to sources within a facility or activity.

In this context a  source is anything that may cause radiation exposure — such as by emitting ionising radiation, or releasing radioactive substances. The phrase "standard source" is also used as a de facto term in the more specific context of being a calibration standard source in ionising radiation metrology.

The methodological and technical details of the design and operation of source and environmental radiation monitoring programmes and systems for different radionuclides, environmental media and types of facility are given in IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental and Source Monitoring for Purposes of Radiation Protection, IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8 |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn= |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1216_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in IAEA Safety Reports Series No.  64.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

==Radiation protection instruments==
Practical radiation measurement using calibrated radiation protection instruments is essential in evaluating the effectiveness of protection measures, and in assessing the radiation dose likely to be received by individuals. The measuring instruments for radiation protection are both "installed" (in a fixed position) and portable (hand-held or transportable).

===Installed instruments===
Installed instruments are fixed in positions which are known to be important in assessing the general radiation hazard in an area. Examples are installed "area" radiation monitors, Gamma interlock monitors, personnel exit monitors, and airborne particulate monitors.

The area radiation monitor will measure the ambient radiation, usually X-Ray, Gamma or neutrons; these are radiations which can have significant radiation levels over a range in excess of tens of metres from their source, and thereby cover a wide area.

Gamma radiation "interlock monitors" are used in applications to prevent inadvertent exposure of workers to an excess dose by preventing personnel access to an area when a high radiation level is present. These interlock the process access directly.

[[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring|Airborne contamination monitors]] measure the concentration of radioactive particles in the ambient air to guard against radioactive particles being ingested, or deposited in the lungs of personnel. These instruments will normally give a local alarm, but are often connected to an integrated safety system so that areas of plant can be evacuated and personnel are prevented from entering an air of high airborne contamination. 
    
'''Personnel exit monitors''' (PEM) are used to monitor workers who are exiting a "contamination controlled" or potentially contaminated area. These can be in the form of hand monitors, clothing frisk probes, or whole body monitors. These monitor the surface of the workers body and clothing to check if any [[radioactive contamination]] has been deposited. These generally measure alpha or beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

The UK [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] publishes a good practice guide through its Ionising Radiation Metrology Forum concerning the provision of such equipment and the methodology of calculating the alarm levels to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Operational Monitoring Good Practice Guide "The Selection of Alarm Levels for Personnel Exit Monitors" Dec 2009 - National Physical Laboratory, Teddington UK [http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/alarm_levels_personnel_exit_monitors.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portable instruments===
[[File:RTG radiation measurement.jpg|thumb|250px|Hand-held ion chamber survey meter in use]]
Portable instruments are hand-held or transportable.
The hand-held instrument is generally used as a [[survey meter]] to check an object or person in detail, or assess an area where no installed instrumentation exists. They can also be used for personnel exit monitoring or personnel contamination checks in the field. These generally measure alpha, beta or gamma, or combinations of these.

Transportable instruments are generally instruments that would have been permanently installed, but are temporarily placed in an area to provide continuous monitoring where it is likely there will be a hazard. Such instruments are often installed on trolleys to allow easy deployment, and are associated with temporary operational situations.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/irp7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide.

===Instrument types===
A number of commonly used detection instruments are listed below.

*[[Geiger counter]]s
*[[Semiconductor detector]]s

{{Desalination}}
A '''seawater greenhouse''' is a [[greenhouse]] structure that enables the growth of crops in [[arid]] regions, using  [[seawater]] and [[solar energy]]. The technique involves pumping seawater (or allowing it to gravitate if below sea level) to an arid location and then subjecting it to two processes: first, it is used to humidify and cool the air, and second, it is evaporated by solar heating and [[distilled]] to produce [[fresh water]]. Finally, the remaining humidified air is expelled from the greenhouse and used to improve growing conditions for outdoor plants. The technology was introduced by British inventor Charlie Paton in the early 1990s and is being developed by his [[UK]] company Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The more concentrated salt water may either be further evaporated for the production of salt and other elements, or discharged back to the sea. The seawater greenhouse is a response to the global [[water crisis]] and [[peak water]].

== History ==
The seawater greenhouse concept was first researched and developed in 1991 by Charlie Paton's company Light Works Ltd, now Seawater Greenhouse Ltd. The first pilot project commenced in 1992 with the search for a test site that was eventually found on the [[Canary Island]] of [[Tenerife]]. A prototype seawater greenhouse was assembled in the UK and constructed on the site in Tenerife. The results from this pilot project validated the concept and demonstrated the potential for other arid regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/0/wI6rFXzIVY0|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original pilot design evolved into a lower cost solution using a lighter steel structure, similar to a multi-span polytunnel. This structure was designed to be cost effective and suitable for local sourcing. The design was first tested and validated through a second seawater greenhouse that was constructed on [[Al-Aryam Island]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229315021_The_seawater_greenhouse_in_the_United_Arab_Emirates_Thermal_modelling_and_evaluation_of_design_options|title = The Seawater Greenhouse in the United Arab Emirates: thermal modelling and evaluation of design options|journal = Desalination|volume = 173|pages=103-111|date = 2005|publisher = Elsevier|accessdate = 2015-11-03|author1=P.

These projects have enabled the validation of a thermodynamic simulation model which, given appropriate meteorological data, accurately predict and quantify how the seawater greenhouse
will perform in other parts of the world.&lt;ref name=TechAwards&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/1/6NyDruLA3tY|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Seawater Greenhouse built a new commercial installation in [[Australia]]. The enterprise is now independently operating with an evolved set of technologies as [http://www.sundropfarms.com Sundrop Farms Pty Ltd]
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/2/yY53De4kQ-Y|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/SeawaterGreenhouse#p/u/5/gzeBca4kJs0|title=SeawaterGreenhouse|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process==
A seawater greenhouse uses the sun, the sea and the atmosphere to produce fresh water and
cool air. The process recreates the natural [[Water cycle|hydrological cycle]] within a controlled environment. The front wall of the building is a seawater evaporator. It consists of a [[honeycomb lattice]] and faces the prevailing wind. Fans control air movement. Seawater trickles down over the lattice, cooling and humidifying the air passing through into the planting area.
Sunlight is filtered through a specially constructed roof. The roof traps [[infrared]] heat, while allowing visible light through to promote photosynthesis. This creates optimum growing conditions – cool and humid with high light intensity. Seawater that has been heated in the roof passes through a second evaporator creating hot, saturated air which then flows through a condenser.
The condenser is cooled by incoming seawater. The temperature difference causes fresh water to condense out of the air stream. The volume of fresh water is determined by air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation and the airflow rate. These conditions can be modeled with appropriate meteorological data, enabling the design and process to be optimized for any suitable location.

|}
 
A seawater greenhouse evaporates much more water than it condenses back into freshwater. This humid air is `lost´ due to high rates of ventilation to keep the crops cool and supplied with CO2. The higher humidity exhaust air provides some benefit to the cultivation of more hardy crops downwind of the greenhouse.

This phenomenon could enable the cultivation of biofuel crops in the area surrounding the seawater greenhouse.

== Applicability ==
The technique is applicable to sites in arid regions near the sea. The distance and elevation from the sea must be evaluated considering the energy required to pump water to the site.  There are numerous suitable locations on the coasts; others are below sea level, such as the [[Dead Sea]] and the [[Qattara Depression]], where hydro schemes have been proposed to exploit the hydraulic pressure to generate power, e.g., [[Red Sea-Dead Sea canal|Red Sea–Dead Sea Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0a.htm|title=Managing water for peace in the Middle East|website=archive.unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/pipe-headloss-power-calculator-calculate-how-much-energy-to-pump-seawater-to-the-middle-of-the-sahara-or-gobi-desert-for-desalination-in-the-seawater-greenhouse-answer-not-a-lot.html|title=Pipe Headloss &amp; Power calculator - calculate how much energy to pump seawater to the middle of the Sahara or Gobi Desert for desalination in the SeaWater Greenhouse - answer not a lot. - Claverton Group|website=www.claverton-energy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sundrop Farms, Australia==
The seawater greenhouse technology was adopted and subsequently modified by [[Sundrop Farms]] in [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/australia.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050057/http://www.seawatergreenhouse.com/australia.html |archive-date=2014-02-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Sundrop Farms uses a more robust desalination technique in favour of the water vapour technique employed by Seawater Greenhouse, thus allowing them to construct larger scale facilities.  This has been a success, allowing Sundrop Farms to grow crops such as tomatoes in arid climates with only the use of salt water and sunlight, which they use to produce heat, water, and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/news/|title=Sundrop Farms - News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An expansion of 20 hectares was [[Project commissioning|commissioned]] in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ing.dk/galleri/fotos-danske-solanlaeg-laver-17000-tons-australske-tomater-187362#0 |title=FOTOS: Danske solanlæg laver 17.000 tons australske tomater |work=[[Ingeniøren]] |accessdate=7 October 2016 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundropfarms.com/facilities/|title=Facilities - Sundrop|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soweto township.jpg|thumb|Shanty town in [[Soweto]], South Africa, 2005]]

A '''shanty town''' or '''squatter area''' is a settlement of improvised housing which is known as shanties or [[shack]]s, made of [[plywood]], [[corrugated galvanised iron|corrugated metal]], sheets of plastic, and cardboard boxes. Such settlements are usually found on the periphery of cities, in public parks, or near railroad tracks, rivers, lagoons or city [[landfill|trash dump]] sites. Sometimes called a squatter, [[housing#Informal housing in developing countries|or spontaneous settlement]], a typical shanty town often lacks adequate infrastructure, including proper sanitation, safe water supply, electricity, hygienic streets, or other basic necessities to support human settlements.

Shanty towns are mostly found in [[Developing country|developing nations]], but also in some parts of developed nations.&lt;ref name=ta2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/6147072/Greek-immigration-crisis-spawns-shanty-towns-and-squats.html Greek immigration crisis spawns shanty towns and squats] Nick Squires and Paul Anast, The Telegraph, (September 7, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2012/04/27/150824559/showdown-looms-over-europes-largest-shantytown Showdown Looms Over Europe's Largest Shantytown] LAUREN FRAYER, National Public Radio (Washington DC), April 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
[[File:Müllgebiet Ezbet Al Nakhl.jpg|thumb|Shanty towns sometimes have an active [[informal economy]], such as garbage sorting, pottery making, textiles, and leather works. This allows the poor to earn an income. The above shanty town image is from Ezbet Al Nakhl, in [[Cairo]], Egypt, where garbage is sorted manually. Residential area is visible at the top of the image.]]
Since construction is informal and unguided by urban planning, there is typically no formal [[grid plan|street grid]], house numbers, or named streets. Such settlements also lack some or all basic public services such as a sewage network, [[electric power|electricity]], safe running water, rain water drainage, garbage removal, access to public transport, or insect and disease control services. Even if these resources are present, they are likely to be disorganized, unreliable, and poorly maintained. Shanty towns also tend to lack basic services present in more formally organized settlements, including policing, mail delivery, medical services, and fire fighting. Fires are a particular danger for shanty towns not only for the lack of fire fighting stations and the difficulty fire trucks have traversing the settlement in the absence of formal street grids,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/2009/07/04/ccs_art_solo-tres-unidades-d_1460015.shtml|title=Sólo tres unidades de bomberos atienden 2 mil barrios de Petare|author=Jorge Hernández|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also because of the high density of buildings and flammability of materials used in construction.&lt;ref&gt;See the report on shack fires in South Africa by Matt Birkinshaw [http://abahlali.org/files/Big_Devil_Politics_of_Shack_Fire.pdf] as well as the wider collection of articles in fires in shanty towns at [http://www.abahlali.org/taxonomy/term/841]&lt;/ref&gt; A sweeping fire on the hills of [[Shek Kip Mei]], Hong Kong, in late 1953 left 53,000 dwellers homeless, prompting the colonial government to institute a resettlement estate system.

Shanty towns have high rates of [[crime]], [[suicide]], [[recreational drug use|drug use]], and [[disease]]. However, Swiss journalist [[Georg Gerster]] has noted (with specific reference to the ''invasões'' of [[Brasilia]]) that "squatter settlements [as opposed to [[Slum|slums]]], despite their unattractive building materials, may also be places of hope, scenes of a counter-culture, with an encouraging potential for change and a strong upward impetus".&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Gerster]], ''Flights of Discovery: The Earth from Above'', 1978, London: Paddington, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stewart Brand]] has also written, more recently, that "squatter cities are [[environmentally friendly|Green]]. They have maximum density—a million people per square mile in Mumbai—and minimum energy and material use. People get around by foot, bicycle, rickshaw, or the universal [[shared taxi]] ... Not everything is efficient in the slums, though. In the Brazilian favelas where electricity is stolen and therefore free, Jan Chipchase from Nokia found that people leave their lights on all day. In most slums recycling is literally a way of life." (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Brand, "[http://newurbannetwork.com/article/stewart-brand-new-urbanism-and-squatter-communities-13243 Stewart Brand on New Urbanism and squatter communities]", ''The New Urban Network'', reprinted from ''Whole Earth Discipline'', Penguin,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developing countries===
Shanty towns are present in a number of countries. The largest shanty town in Asia is [[Orangi]] in [[Karachi]], Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/5-biggest-slums-world-381338 5 biggest slums in the world] Daniel Tovrov, IB Times (December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; In [[francophone]] countries, shanty towns are referred to as ''[[wikt:bidonville#French|bidonvilles]]'' (French for "can town" - can being a reference to tin metal); such countries include [[Tunisia]] and [[Haiti]]. Other countries with shanty towns include [[South Africa]] (where they are often called ''[[Township (South Africa)|Townships]]'') or Imijondolo, [[Kenya]] (including the [[Kibera]] and [[Mathare]] slums), the [[Philippines]] (often called ''squatter areas''), [[Venezuela]] (where they are known as [[barrio]]s), Brazil ([[favela]]s), [[Argentina]] ([[villas miseria]]), [[West Indies]] such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] (where they are known as shanty towns), and [[Peru]] (where they are known as [[pueblos jóvenes|"young towns"]]). There is also a major shanty town population in countries such as [[Bangladesh]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isuh.org/download/dhaka.pdf|title=ISUH home|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=1419&amp;section=insight Demolitions limit slum villages to city outskirts.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502012550/http://olympics.scmp.com/Article.aspx?id=1419&amp;section=insight |date=2009-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200509/09/eng20050909_207472.html|title=People's Daily Online -- "Slums" sting Chinese cities, hamper building of harmonious society|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article288 Jane Kelly, Review: Planet of Slums, by Mike Davis, Verso, 2006, £15.99.

===Developed countries===
Although shanty towns are less common in [[developed country|developed countries]], there are some cities that have them. While shanty towns are less common in Europe, the growing influx of immigrants have fueled shantytowns in cities commonly used as a point of entry into the EU, including [[Athens]] and [[Patras]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/6147072/Greek-immigration-crisis-spawns-shanty-towns-and-squats.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |first1=Nick |last1=Squires |first2=Paul |last2=Anast |title=Greek immigration crisis spawns shanty towns and squats |date=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Madrid]], Spain, a low-class neighborhood named [[Cañada Real]] (which is considered a shanty town) has no formal education system, professional nurseries or modern health clinics and is considered the largest slum in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/in-spains-heart-a-slum-to-shame-europe-6268652.html |location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alasdair |last=Fotheringham |title=In Spain's heart, a slum to shame Europe |date=November 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Portugal, shanty towns known as "barracas" or "bairros de lata" are made up of immigrants from former Portuguese African colonies and [[Romani People|Roma]] from Eastern Europe. Most of them are located in [[Lisbon Metropolitan Area]]. In the United States, some cities such as [[Newark, New Jersey#Poverty and lack of investment|Newark]] and [[Oakland#Demographics|Oakland]] have witnessed the creation of [[Tent city|tent cities]]. Other settlements in developed countries that are comparable to shanty towns include the [[Colonia (United States)|Colonias]] near the border with Mexico, and [[poverty in France#Bidonvilles|bidonvilles in France]], which may exist in the peripheries of some cities.

In some cases, shanty towns can persist in gentrified areas that local governments have yet to redevelop, or in regions of political dispute. Examples of this include [[Ras Khamis]] in Israel and the [[Kowloon Walled City]] in Hong Kong.

==Development==
[[File:Shanty housing in Hong Kong.jpeg|thumb|Shanty towns may be large or small settlements. Above shanty town is in [[Hong Kong]].]]
While most shanty towns begin as precarious establishments haphazardly thrown together without basic social and civil services, over time, some have undergone a certain amount of development. Often the residents themselves are responsible for the major improvements.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/16/some-young-towns-in-lima-not-so-young-anymore/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823044812/http://cohaforum.org/2011/08/16/some-young-towns-in-lima-not-so-young-anymore/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 August 2011|title=Some "Young Towns" in Lima Not So Young Anymore|publisher=COHA Staff|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Community organizations sometimes working alongside [[NGO]]s, private companies, and the government, set up connections to the municipal water supply, pave roads, and build local schools.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt; Some of these shanties have become middle class [[suburbs]]. One such extreme example is the [[Los Olivos District|Los Olivos]] Neighborhood of [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. Chameh is, one of Lima's largest, along with [[gated communities]], [[casino]]s, and even plastic surgery clinics, are just a few of many developments that have transformed what used to be a decrepit shanty.&lt;ref name="cohaforum.org"/&gt; A few Brazilian [[favelas]] have also seen improvements in recent years, enough so to attract tourists who flock to catch a glimpse of the colorful lifestyle perched atop [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s highlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/megacities/2011/05/16/favela-tourism-provides-entrepreneurial-opportunuties-in-rio/|title= Favela Tourism Provides Entrepreneurial Opportunities in Rio |work=Forbes |first=Felicity |last=Clarke |date=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development occurs over a long period of time and newer towns still lack basic services. Nevertheless, there has been a general trend whereby shanties undergo gradual improvements, rather than relocation to even more distant parts of a metropolis and replacement by [[gated communities]] constructed over their ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crassh.cam.ac.uk/events/1324/87|title=Informality: Re-Viewing Latin American Cities|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many shanty towns are starting to implement the use of [[composting toilets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/bill-gates-foundation-puts-money-on-solar-powered-toilet|title=Thomson Reuters Foundation|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416032241/http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/bill-gates-foundation-puts-money-on-solar-powered-toilet|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[solar panels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5172|title=Youth Bring Low-Cost Solar Panels to Kenyan Slum|publisher=|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the people living in slums may have access to cell phones and even the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/oct/17/itforschools.schools5 |location=London |work=The Guardian |title=IT for schools, Schools, Education, Technology, UK news, Online learning e-learning (Education) |date=May 8, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in spite of all this, inequality associated with shanty towns has only increased over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UN study says wealth gap in Latin America increases- A study by the United Nations suggests the gap between the rich and the poor in much of Latin America is widening.|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19339636|accessdate=6 January 2013 |work=BBC News|date=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Jakarta slumlife66.JPG|thumb|A shanty town in [[Jakarta]], Indonesia]]
Shanty is probably from Canadian French ''chantier'', a winter station established for the organization of lumberjacks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary Online]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible derivation is from the [[Irish language]] ''sean tí'' meaning ''old house''.

Hutment means an "encampment of huts". When the term is used by the military, it means "temporary living quarters specially built by the army for soldiers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/hutment |title=Hutment |publisher=Free Dictionary |accessdate=April 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also a synonym for shanty town, particularly in [[developing country|developing countries]].

[[File:Clare College, Cambridge, July 2010 (16).JPG|thumb|Clare College, University of Cambridge a regular venue for the Social Stratification Seminars.]]
The '''Social Stratification Research Seminar (UK)''' is an annual research colloquium for original, empirically informed [[Sociology|sociological]] presentations on [[social stratification]]. The Social Stratification Research Seminars have been running almost every autumn since 1968. The seminars have mainly been hosted at the [[University of Cambridge]] and were often organised by the [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/social-science-research-group Social Science Research Group (formerly the Sociological Research Group)]. The seminars have also been held at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff (]]2003-5), the [[University of Edinburgh]] (2014, 2017), the [[University of Milan]] (2015), the [[University of Stirling]] (2007, 2011) and [[Utrecht University]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/stratif/conf_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original movers and shakers behind the seminar were three distinguished British scholars working in the field of social stratification - [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/professor-robert-martin-bob-blackburn Professor Robert (Bob) Blackburn],  [https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/about/people/fellows-profiles/professor-ken-prandy Professor Ken Prandy,] and Professor Alexander (Sandy) Stewart. Since the early part of this [[Year 2000|millennium]] the seminar has been organised by [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/255764 Professor Paul Lambert], who is Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Stirling]] and a longstanding fan of [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion F.C]]. The annual call for papers is usually issued in the spring and the seminar is usually held on two consecutive days in the early September. Proposals for papers for presentations are invited from any area of research into social stratification and social inequality.  The organizers do not usually limit the number of delegates attending. There are no parallel sessions and therefore there is an upper limit on the number of paper presentations that can be accommodated.

A salient feature of the Social Stratification Research Seminars has been how to appropriately measure social stratification in contemporary societies. An approach that has been developed by researchers who are regular contributors to the seminars are Social Interaction and Stratification Scales.&lt;ref&gt;See Stewart, A., PRANDY, K. and Blackburn, R.M., 1973. Measuring the class structure. ''Nature'', ''245''(5426), p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is the foundation of the [http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/ CAMSIS Project] which is an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of social interaction and stratification across a number of countries.

A number of prominent research publications contain work that was developed and showcased at the seminars. These works include an edited volume entitled [https://www.routledge.com/Social-Stratification-Trends-and-Processes/Connelly-Gayle-Lambert/p/book/9781409430964 ''Social stratification:Trends and processes'']&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, P., Connelly, M.R., Blackburn, R.M. and Gayle, V. eds., 2013. ''Social stratification: Trends and processes''. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd..&lt;/ref&gt;'','' and special issues of the journal ''[https://rsa.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/11/2-3?nav=tocList Contemporary Social Science]'' and the [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/7%2F8 ''International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy''] [https://www.emeraldinsight.com/toc/ijssp/28/5%2F6].

Notable sociological scholars in the field of social stratification who have attended the Social Stratification Research Seminars include [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=-abxxmUAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate Professor Harry Ganzeboom], [https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=gscMj2wAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=sra Dr Wendy Bottero], [https://www.ncl.ac.uk/gps/staff/profile/geoffpayne.html#publications Professor Geoff Payne], [https://www.unibas.ch/en/University/Administration-Services/The-President-s-Office/Institutional-Development/Sustainability/Research/Social-Sciences.html Professor Max Bergman], and [http://www.lse.ac.uk/researchAndExpertise/Experts/profile.aspx?KeyValue=l.platt@lse.ac.uk Professor Lucinda Platt]. The meeting is also attended by early career researchers such as [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/266076 Jennifer Ferguson].

'''Soil salinity''' is the [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] content in the [[soil]]; the process of increasing the salt content is known as '''salinization'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europeandcis.undp.org/WaterWiki/index.php/Soil_salinity  from "Soil salinity" in WaterWiki, the on-line Knowledge and Collaboration Tool of the Community of Practice (CoP) on Water- and UNDP-related activities in Central and South-Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812161635/http://europeandcis.undp.org/WaterWiki/index.php/Soil_salinity |date=2007-08-12 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Salts occur naturally within soils and water. Salination can be caused by natural processes such as [[mineral weathering]] or by the gradual withdrawal of an ocean. It can also come about through artificial processes such as [[irrigation]].

==Natural occurrence==
[[Salt]]s are a natural component in soils and water.
The [[ion]]s responsible for salination are: Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
As the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (sodium) predominates, soils can become '''sodic'''.  [[Sodic soil]]s present particular challenges because they tend to have very poor structure which limits or prevents [[water infiltration]] and drainage.

Over long periods of time, as soil minerals [[weathering|weather]] and release salts, these salts are flushed or leached out of the soil by drainage water in areas with sufficient precipitation.  In addition to mineral weathering, salts are also deposited via dust and precipitation.  In dry regions salts may accumulate, leading to naturally saline soils.  This is the case, for example, in [[Salinity in Australia|large parts of Australia]]. Human practices can increase the salinity of soils by the addition of salts in irrigation water.  Proper irrigation management can prevent salt accumulation by providing adequate drainage water to leach added salts from the soil.  Disrupting drainage patterns that provide leaching can also result in salt accumulations.  An example of this occurred in [[Egypt]] in 1970 when the [[Aswan dam|Aswan High Dam]] was built. The change in the level of [[ground water]] before the construction had enabled [[soil erosion]], which led to high concentration of salts in the water table. After the construction, the continuous high level of the water table led to the salination of the [[arable land]].

==Dry land salinity==
[[dryland salinity|Salinity in drylands]] can occur when the water table is between two and three metres from the surface of the soil.  The salts from the groundwater are raised by capillary action to the surface of the soil. This occurs when groundwater is saline (which is true in many areas), and is favored by land use practices allowing more rainwater to enter the aquifer than it could accommodate. For example, the clearing of trees for agriculture is a major reason for dryland salinity in some areas, since deep rooting of trees has been replaced by shallow rooting of annual crops.

==Salinity due to irrigation==
[[Image:Salinity from irrigation.png|thumb|400px|Rain or irrigation, in the absence of leaching, can bring salts to the surface by capillary action]]
{{Main article|Environmental impacts of irrigation}}
Salinity from [[irrigation]] can occur over time wherever irrigation occurs, since almost all water (even natural rainfall) contains some dissolved salts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = ILRI | title = Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review  | series = In: Annual Report 1988 of the International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI) | year = 1989 | pages = 18–34 | location = Wageningen, The Netherlands | url = http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plants use the water, the salts are left behind in the soil and eventually begin to accumulate.  Since soil salinity makes it more difficult for plants to absorb soil moisture, these salts must be leached out of the plant root zone by applying additional water.  This water in excess of plant needs is called the [[Leaching model|leaching fraction]].  Salination from irrigation water is also greatly increased by poor [[drainage]] and [[Biosalinity|use of saline water]] for irrigating agricultural crops.

Salinity in urban areas often results from the combination of irrigation and groundwater processes. Irrigation is also now common in cities (gardens and recreation areas).

==Consequences of salinity==
The consequences of salinity are
* Detrimental effects on plant growth and yield
* Damage to infrastructure (roads, bricks, corrosion of pipes and cables)
* Reduction of water quality for users, sedimentation problems
* [[soil erosion]] ultimately, when crops are too strongly affected by the amounts of salts.

Salinity is an important [[land degradation]] problem. Soil salinity can be reduced by [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] soluble salts out of soil with excess irrigation water.  [[Soil salinity control]] involves [[watertable control]] and [[leaching model|flushing]] in combination with [[tile drainage]] or another form of [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Drainage Manual: A Guide to Integrating Plant, Soil, and Water Relationships for Drainage of Irrigated Lands  | year = 1993 | publisher =  Interior Dept., Bureau of Reclamation | isbn = 978-0-16-061623-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Waterlog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlog.info |title=Free articles and software on drainage of waterlogged land and soil salinity control |accessdate=2010-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive treatment of soil salinity is available from the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Salt-Affected Soils and their Management, FAO Soils Bulletin 39 (http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5871e/x5871e00.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salt tolerance of crops==
{{see|Maas–Hoffman model|Van Genuchten–Gupta model}}
High levels of soil salinity can be tolerated if salt-tolerant plants are grown.  Sensitive crops lose their vigor already in slightly saline soils, most crops are negatively affected by (moderately) saline soils, and only salinity-resistant crops thrive in severely saline soils. The University of Wyoming &lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan D. Blaylock, 1994, ''Soil Salinity and Salt tolerance of Horticultural and Landscape Plants.''

'''Stewart Russell''' (6 August 1955 – 17 September 2011) was a senior lecturer and interdisciplinary researcher in Science, Technology and Innovation Studies at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Innovative in his approach, Stewart believed that to achieve sustainable change it was necessary to address the interplay between science and technology and social and institutional factors. He worked with a diverse communities including trade unions, government and public institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary Stewart Russell|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=417803|publisher=Times Higher Education|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating in physical science from Pembroke College, Cambridge, UK, Stewart made a sharp turn towards social science and took a PhD in the Technology Policy Unit of [[Aston University]], UK. He dedicated the rest of his career to exploring the challenges of environmental sustainability across a range of technological fields.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Stewart Russell obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/oct/23/stewart-russell-obituary|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2012|location=London|first=Robin|last=Williams|date=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 he accepted a position as lecturer in Science, Technology and Society at the [[University of Wollongong]], in New South Wales, Australia. He returned to the United Kingdom in 2006 to join the University of Edinburgh as deputy director of the Research Centre for Social Sciences. In this role he helped build the interdisciplinary research programmes of the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]], and bring together the Research Centre for Social Studies and Science Studies Unit as the Science, Technology and Innovation Studies subject group. Collaborating with the [[National Museum of Scotland]] Stewart developed the innovative "Understanding Technology" public lecture series.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stewart Russell - About - Science, Technology and Innovation Studies |url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225145734/http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/archive/about/stewart_russell |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These lectures are continued and held to commemorate his contribution.

'''TESST College of Technology''' is a private for-profit technical college located in metropolitan [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. It is owned and operated by Education Corporation of America.

==History==
TESST College of Technology began offering instruction in electronics in 1957 as TESST Technology Institute. The campus was located in [[Hyattsville, Maryland]]. In December 1992, TESST expanded its reach in the Baltimore market by acquiring the Arundel Institute of Technology. In the summer of 1998, the Hyattsville and Baltimore campuses relocated to new buildings in [[Beltsville, Maryland|Beltsville]] and [[Towson, Maryland]].

In 1999, TESST acquired RETS Technical Training Center, which had been offering classes in Maryland since 1956. In June 2001, TESST Technology Institute received approval to offer associate of applied science degrees in network information systems and electronics, computer, and telecommunications technology.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} All campuses then became known as TESST College of Technology.

In May 2002, the College was acquired by Quest Education Corporation, a subsidiary of Kaplan, Inc.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-85932155.html|title=Acquisition by Kaplan, Inc.|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2002, Quest changed its name to Kaplan Higher Education Corporation. In March 2004, the campus expanded by adding a {{convert|6800|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility located at 3922 Vero Road, less than a mile from the campus.

In September 2015, TESST College of Technology was acquired by [[Education Corporation of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Corporation of America Completes Purchase of Kaplan Campuses|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/education-corporation-of-america-completes-purchase-of-kaplan-college-campuses-300137913.html|publisher=PR Newswire|accessdate=3 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
