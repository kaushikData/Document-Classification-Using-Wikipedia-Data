An '''architectural historian''' is a person who studies and writes about the [[history of architecture]], and is regarded as an [[authority]] on it.&lt;ref name=CB06&gt;{{citation |title=Careers for Historians: Architectural Historians | first=B| last=Crist| publisher=North Carolina Museum of History| url=http://ncmuseumofhistory.org/fko/careersforhistorians/cfh.architecturalhistorian.pdf| page=1| year=2006| accessdate=17 July 2011| quote=.| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604080751/http://www.ncmuseumofhistory.org/fko/careersforhistorians/cfh.architecturalhistorian.pdf| archivedate= 4 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional requirements==
As many architectural historians are employed at universities and other facilities for post-secondary education, in addition to bachelor's degree, it is normal for colleges and universities to require the PhD degree for new full-time hires and a master's degree for part-timers.

===United States===
According to [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]]'s Guidelines&lt;ref name=CW01&gt;{{cite web|title=ARCHEOLOGY AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION:Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines [As Amended and Annotated] | url=http://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/arch_stnds_9.htm|publisher=National Park Service |year=2011 |author=US Department of Interior | accessdate=2 August 2011| quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the minimum professional qualifications in architectural history are a [[graduate degree]] in [[architectural history]], [[art history]], [[historic preservation]], or closely related field, with coursework in American architectural history, or a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[architectural history]], [[art history]], [[historic preservation]] or closely related field plus one of the following:

* At least two years of full-time experience in research, writing, or teaching in American architectural history or restoration architecture with an academic institution, historical organization or agency, [[museum]], or other professional institution; or
* Substantial contribution through research and publication to the body of scholarly knowledge in the field of American architectural history.

==Profession==
Professional architectural historians typically work in colleges and universities, archival centers, government agencies, museums, and as freelance writers and consultants. In broad terms, they can be grouped into following two categories:

===Academic titles===
Common titles and job descriptions within  Universities and research organizations might be as follows:
* Research Coordinator
* Professor in Architectural History
* Senior Lecturer in Architectural History
* Lecturer in Architectural History
* Researcher in Architectural History
* Research Associate in Architectural History
* Research Assistant in Architectural History

===Non-academic titles===
Most non-academic positions in architectural history can be grouped into one of the following five categories&lt;ref name=CW03&gt;{{cite web|title=SURVEY OF PROFESSIONAL CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY | url=http://architecturalhistoryscad.wordpress.com/careers/|publisher=Blog of the Architectural History department |year=2011 |author=Savannah College of Art and Design | accessdate=3 August 2011| quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;...
* '''Preservation Planning and Administration'''
: This employment category is similar to Main Street management listed below and is interrelated with the following historical research and evaluation category. Professionals in the present field are primarily concerned with the planning and administration of preservation programs, providing technical support to the community and attending public meetings. Positions in this category are typically more office based and require more interpersonal skills than the following category.
: Principal employers are state and local government agencies, including historic preservation offices and nonprofit organizations.
* '''Historical Research and Evaluation'''
: This field is the counterpart to preservation planning and administration, above. It involves completing field surveys, conducting research and completing the reports reviewed by state and local government agencies. Compared to preservation planning and administration this field is less office oriented, requiring more on-site work and travel.
: Principal employers are architectural firms, cultural resource firms and government agencies.
* '''Historic Site Management and Curatorship'''
: This field is analogous with museum curatorship but often includes aspects of historical research and evaluation, above and/or historic foundation management and administration, below.
: Principal employers are local governments or private, nonprofit organizations.
* '''Historic Foundation Management and Administration'''
: Positions in this field are rarely entry level and generally require experience in nonprofit organization administration coupled with a background in architectural history. In many cases duties include those of historic site management as well.
: Principal employers are historic foundations.
* '''Main Street Management'''
: Professionals in this field implement and manage downtown revitalization and preservation programs known as Main Street programs. These programs are assisted by the National Trust for Historic Preservation, National Main Street Center. In addition to sharing many of the activities in the preservation planning and administration category, Main Street managers are also involved with marketing and fundraising.
: Principal employers are nonprofit organizations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26679">In recent years, the use of biologically inspired methods such as the [[evolutionary algorithm]] have been increasingly employed to solve and analyze complex computational problems. '''BELBIC''' (Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller) is one such [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] which is proposed by [[Caro Lucas]], Danial Shahmirzadi and Nima Sheikholeslami and adopts the network model developed by [[Jan Morén|Moren]] and [[Balkenius]] to mimic those parts of the brain which are known to produce emotion (namely, the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[thalamus]] and sensory input cortex).&lt;ref name="Lucas"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Lucas | first1 = C. | last2 = Shahmirzadi | first2 = D. | last3 = Sheikholeslami | first3 = N.| year = 2004 | title = Introducing BELBIC: Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller | journal = Intelligent Automation and Soft Computing | volume = 10| pages = 11–22 | doi=10.1080/10798587.2004.10642862}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotions and learning ==

Traditionally, the study of learning in biological systems was conducted at the expense of overlooking its lesser known counterparts: [[motivation]] and [[emotion]]. However these phenomena can not be separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = LeDoux | first = J. E. | editor = Gazzaniga, M. S | title = The Cognitive Neurosciences | year = 1995 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, NJ  | pages = 1049–1061 | chapter = In Search of an Emotional System in the Brain: Leaping from Fear to Emotion and Consciousness}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation is the drive that causes any system to do anything – without it, there is no reason to act. Emotions indicate how successful a course of actions have been and whether another set of actions should have been taken instead – they are a constant feedback to the learning system. Learning on the other hand, guarantees that motivation and emotional subsystems are able to adapt to constantly changing conditions.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux"&gt;{{Citation | author = LeDoux, J.E. | year = 1996 | title = The Emotional Brain| publisher = Simon and Schuster, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, in the study of biological organisms, emotions have arisen to prominence as an integral part of any biologically inspired system. But how does any living organism benefit from its emotions? It is crucial to answer this question as we attempt to increasingly employ biologically inspired methods in solving computational problems.

Every creature has innate abilities that accommodate its survival in the world. It can identify food, shelter, partners, and danger. But these "simple mappings between stimuli and reactions will not be enough to keep the organisms from encountering problems."&lt;ref name = "Moren"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Moren |first=Jan |title= Thesis: Emotion and Learning | publisher= Lund University |year= 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a given animal knows that its predator has qualities A, B and C, it will escape ''all'' creatures that have those qualities. And thus waste much of its energy and resources on non-existent danger.

We can not expect evolution to provide more advanced algorithms for assessing danger, because the predator is also evolving at the same speed. Thus, biological systems need to be equipped with the ability to learn. This learning and re-learning mechanism allows them to adapt to highly complex and advanced situations.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux" /&gt;

[[Image:LearningOrganism.JPG|frame|right|A Learning Organism]]To learn effectively, every learning organism needs an evaluation of the current situation and also feedback on how beneficial the results of learning were.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt; On the most part, these evaluation mechanisms are built-in. And so we encounter a new problem: whereas creatures take appropriate measures in real time based on their evaluations, these built-in evaluation procedures are developed in evolutionary time. But all creatures need to learn of new evaluation techniques in their lifetime just as they learn the proper reactions.

This is where the ability to condition emotional reactions comes into play. Biological organisms associate innate emotional stimuli with other stimuli they encounter in the world and thus give them an emotional significance when needed.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt; These evaluations can be monitored to operate at very specific times, specific places or when accompanied by other specific stimuli.

There is another reason why these observations are so significant and that is the creation of artificial systems. These systems do not evolve over time but are designed with certain abilities from the start. Thus, their adaptability must be built-in.

==Computational model==

[[Image:Brain limbicsystem.jpg|frame|right |The Brain Limbic System]]
[[Image:Amyg.png|frame|right |The Amygdala in the Human Brain]]

A [[Scientific modelling|model]] is a simplified description of a phenomenon. It brings to life some aspects of this phenomenon while overlooking others. What aspects are kept in the model and what are overlooked greatly depends on the topic of study. Thus, the nature of a model depends on the purpose the investigator plans to carry out. A computational model is one which can be mathematically analyzed, tested and simulated using computer systems.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt;

To construct a computational model of emotional learning in the brain requires a thorough analysis of the [[amygdala]]  and the [[orbitofrontal cortex]] and the interaction between them:&lt;ref name = "MB"&gt;{{Citation | first = J. | last = Moren | author2 = Balkenius, C. | title = A Computational Model of Emotional Learning in the Amygdala | conference = Proc. 6th International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, Cambridge, Mass. | publisher = MIT Press | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mammals, emotional responses are processed in a part of the brain called the [[limbic system]] which lies in the [[cerebral cortex]]. The main components of the limbic system are the [[amygdala]], [[orbitofrontal cortex]], [[thalamus]] and the sensory cortex.

The amygdala is an almond shaped area which is placed such that it can communicate with all other cortices within the limbic system. The primary affective conditioning of the system occurs within the amygdala. That is, the association between a stimulus and its emotional consequence takes place in this region.&lt;ref name = "Moren" /&gt;

It has been suggested that learning takes place in two fundamental steps.&lt;ref name = "Mower"&gt;{{Citation | last = Mower | first = O. H. | title = Learning Theory and Behavior | publisher = Wiley | origyear = 1960| year = 1973 | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, a particular stimulus is correlated with an emotional response. This stimulus can be an endless number of phenomena from observing a face, to detecting a scent, hearing a noise, etc. Second, this emotional consequence shapes an association between the stimulus and the response.&lt;ref name = "Mower" /&gt; This analysis is quite influential in part because it was one of the first to suggest that emotions play a key part in learning.&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt; In more recent studies, it has been shown that the association between a stimulus and its emotional consequence take place in the amygdala.&lt;ref name = "LeDoux" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rolls"&gt;{{Citation | last = Rolls | first = E. T. | editor = Gazzaniga, M. S. | title = The Cognitive Neurosciences | year = 1995 | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum | location = Hillsdale, NJ  | pages = 127–155 | chapter = A theory of Emotion and Consciousness, and its Application to Understanding the Neural Basis of Emotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In this region, highly analyzed stimulus representations in the cortex are associated with an emotional value. Therefore, emotions are properties of stimuli".&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt;

The task of the amygdala is thus to assign a primary emotional value to each stimulus that has been paired with a primary reinforcer&lt;ref name = "Rolls" /&gt; – the reinforcer is the reward and punishment that the mammal receives. This task is aided by the orbitofrontal complex. "In terms of learning theory, the amygdala appears to handle the presentation of primary reinforcement, while the orbitofrontal cortex is involved in the detection of omission of reinforcement."&lt;ref name = "MB" /&gt;

The first thing we notice in the computational model developed by [[Jan Morén|Moren]] and [[Balkenius]] is that quite a number of interacting learning systems exist in the brain that deal with emotional learning. The computational model is presented below where:

* '''''Th''''' : Thalamus
* '''''CX''''' : Sensory Cortex
* '''''A'''''  : Input structures in the amygdala
* '''''E'''''  : Output structures in the amygdala
* '''''O'''''  : Orbitofrontal Cortex
* '''''Rew/Pun''''' : External signals identifying the presentation of reward and punishment
* '''''CR/UR'''''   : conditioned response/unconditioned response
* '''''V'''''  : Associative strength from cortical representation to the amygdala that is changed by learning
* '''''W'''''  : Inhibitory connection from orbitofrontal cortex to the amygdala that is changed during learning

&lt;Center&gt;
[[Image:Computational Model of Emotional Learning2.JPG]]
&lt;/Center&gt;

This image shows that the sensory input enters through the thalamus '''''TH'''''. In biological systems, the thalamus takes on the task of initiating the process of a response to stimuli. It does so by passing the signal to the amygdala and the sensory cortex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kelly | first = J. P. | title = The Neural Basis of Perception and Movement, Principles of Neural Science | publisher =  Prentice Hall | year = 1991 | location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This signal is then analyzed in the cortical area – '''''CX'''''. In biological systems, the sensory cortex operates by distributing the incoming signals appropriately between the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;ref name = "Dan"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shahmirzadi, D. | title = Thesis: Computational Modeling of the Brain Limbic System and its Application in Control Engineering | publisher = Texas A &amp; M University | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sensory representation in '''''CX''''' is then sent to the amygdala '''''A''''', through the pathway '''''V'''''.

This is the main pathway for learning in this model. Reward and punishment enter the amygdala to strengthen the connection between the amygdala and the pathway. At a later stage if a similar representation is activated in the cortex, '''''E''''' becomes activated and produces an emotional response.

'''''O''''', the orbitofrontal cortex, operates based on the difference between the ''perceived'' (i.e. expected) reward/punishment and the actual ''received'' reward/punishment. This perceived reward/punishment is the one that has been developed in the brain over time using learning mechanisms and it reaches the orbitofrontal cortex via the sensory cortex and the amygdala. The received reward/punishment on the other hand, comes courtesy of the outside world and is the ''actual'' reward/punishment that the specie has just obtained. If these two are identical, the output is the same as always through '''''E'''''. If not, the orbitofronal cortex inhibits and restrains emotional response to make way for further learning. So the path '''''W''''' is only activated in such conditions.

== Controller ==

In most industrial processes that contain complex nonlinearities, control [[algorithms]] are used to create [[Linearization|linearized]] models.&lt;ref name = "Rouhani"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Rouhani | first1 = H. | last2 = Jalili | first2 = M. | last3 = Araabi | first3 = B. N. | last4 = Eppler | first4 = W. | last5 = Lucas | first5 = C. | year = 2006 | title = Brain Emotional Learning Based Intelligent Controller Applied to Neurofuzzy Model of Micro-Heat Exchanger | journal = Expert Systems with Applications | volume = 32 | pages = 911–918 | doi = 10.1016/j.eswa.2006.01.047 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason is that these linear models are developed using straightforward methods from process test data.

However, if the process is highly complex and nonlinear, subject to frequent disturbances, a nonlinear model will be required.&lt;ref name = "Rouhani" /&gt; Biologically motivated intelligent controllers have been increasingly employed in these situations. Amongst them, [[fuzzy logic]], [[neural networks]] and [[genetic algorithms]] are some of the most widely employed tools in control applications with highly complex, nonlinear settings.&lt;ref name = "Mehr"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = C. | year = 2007 | title = Intelligent Adaptive Control of Non-Linear Systems Based on Emotional Learning Approach | journal = International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–85 | doi = 10.1142/S0218213007003205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mehr2" /&gt;

BELBIC is one such nonlinear [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] – a [[neuromorphic]] controller based on the computational learning model shown [[:Image:Computational Model of Emotional Learning2.JPG|above]] to produce the control action. This model is employed much like an algorithm in these control engineering applications. In these new approaches, intelligence is not ''given'' to the system from the outside but is actually acquired by the system itself.&lt;ref name = "Lucas" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rouhani" /&gt;

This simple model has been employed as a [[feedback]] [[Controller (control theory)|controller]] to be applied to control design problems. One logic behind this use in control engineering is a belief held by many experts in the field that there has been too much focus on fully rational deliberative approaches, whereas in many real-world circumstances, we are only provided with a bounded rationality. Factors like computational complexity, multiplicity of objectives and prevalence of uncertainty lead to a desire to obtain more ad-hoc, rule-of-thumb approaches. Emotional decision making is highly capable of addressing these issues because it is neither fully cognitive nor fully behavioral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Mehrabian | first1 = A. R. | last2 = Lucas | first2 = C. | last3 = Roshanian | first3 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Aerospace Launch Vehicle Control: An Intelligent Adaptive Approach | journal = Aerospace Science and Technology | volume = 10 | pages = 149–155 | doi = 10.1016/j.ast.2005.11.002 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BELBIC, which is a model free controller, suffers from the same drawback of all intelligent model free controllers: it cannot be applied on unstable systems or systems with unstable equilibrium point. This is a natural result of the trial and error manner of the learning procedure, i.e. exploration for finding the appropriate control signals can lead to instability.&lt;ref name="Roshtkhari2010"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Javan Roshtkhari| first1 = M. | last2 = Arami | first2 = A. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = C. | year = 2010 | title = Imitative Learning Based Emotional Controller for Unknown Systems with Unstable Equilibrium | journal = International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics | volume = 2 | pages = 334–359 | url=http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~javan/Imitative%20learning%20based%20emotional%20controller%20for%20unknown%20systems%20with%20unstable%20equilibrium.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Roshtkhari2009"&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Javan Roshtkhari| first1 = M. | last2 = Arami | first2 = A. | last3 = Lucas | first3 = C. | year = 2009 | title = Emotional Control of Inverted Pendulum System, A soft switching from Imitative to emotional learning | conference= The 4th International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents (ICARA 09) | pages = 651–656}}&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating [[imitative learning]] and [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy inference systems]], BELBIC is generalized in order to be capable of controlling unstable systems.&lt;ref name = "Roshtkhari2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Roshtkhari2009" /&gt;

=== Applications ===

To date, BELBIC and its modified versions have been tested on the following applications:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= BELBIC and Its Industrial Applications: Towards Embedded Neuroemotional Control Codesign | last1 = Lucas | first1 = C. | year=2011 | journal= Integrated Systems, Design and Technology | pages= 203–214 | doi= 10.1007/978-3-642-17384-4_17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)|John Marshall High School]] and other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://home.lausd.net/apps/news/article/762576|title=Marshall High alumnus wins Nobel Prize in Physics|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in physics (1957) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in experimental high energy physics (1962) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].&lt;ref name="thesis-barish-1963"&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302101760/ |title=A study of the reaction negative pion plus proton going to negative pion plus neutral pion plus proton at 310 and 377 MEV |date=1963 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Barish |first=Barry Clark |via=[[ProQuest]] |subscription=yes |oclc=16727804}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in 1963 as part of a new experimental effort in particle physics using frontier particle accelerators at the national laboratories. In 1963–1966 he was a research fellow, in 1966–1991 an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor of Physics. In 1991–2005 he became Linde Professor of Physics, and after that Linde Professor of Physics, Emeritus.&lt;ref&gt;https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/~BCBAct/BCB_CV0316.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984–1996 he was the principal investigator of Caltech High Energy Physics Group.

==Research==
First Barish's experiments were performed at [[Fermilab]] using high-energy neutrino collisions to reveal the quark substructure of the nucleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CALTECH HEP NEWS
|url=http://www.hep.caltech.edu/hepnews/news.html#the-high-energy-physics-group-met-at-caltechs-athenaeum-with-former-hep-pi-and-2017-physics-nobel-laureate-barry-barish-to-honor-him-for-his-award-and-his-legacy-in-physics|publisher=Caltech|accessdate=13 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These experiments were among the first to observe the weak neutral current, a linchpin of the electroweak unification theories of Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, he directed [[Monopole, Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory|MACRO]], an experiment in a cave in [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso]], [[Italy]], that searched for exotic particles called [[magnetic monopole]]s and also studied penetrating [[cosmic rays]], including [[neutrino]] measurements that provided important confirmatory evidence that neutrinos have mass and oscillate.&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Adrian|date=2006-05-26|title=A Quiet Leader Unites Researchers in Drive for the Next Big Machine|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/312/5777/1128|journal=Science|language=en|volume=312|issue=5777|pages=1128–1129|doi=10.1126/science.312.5777.1128|issn=0036-8075|pmid=16728609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Barish was named the Maxine and Ronald Linde Professor of Physics at Caltech.

In the early 1990s, he spearheaded GEM (Gammas, Electrons, Muons), an experiment that would have run at the [[Superconducting Super Collider]] which was approved after the former project L* led by [[Samuel Ting]] (and Barish as chairman of collaboration board) was rejected by SSC director [[Roy Schwitters]].&lt;ref name=science /&gt;&lt;ref name="RiordanHoddeson2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Riordan|author2=Lillian Hoddeson|author3=Adrienne W. Kolb|title=Tunnel Visions: The Rise and Fall of the Superconducting Super Collider|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NspCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA157|date=20 November 2015|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-29479-7|pages=157–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barish was GEM spokesperson.

Barish became the principal investigator of the [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory]] (LIGO) in 1994 and director in 1997.  He led the effort through the approval of funding by the NSF National Science Board in 1994, the construction and commissioning of the LIGO interferometers in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA in 1997.  He created the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]], which now numbers more than 1000 collaborators worldwide to carry out the science.

The initial LIGO detectors reached design sensitivity and set many limits on astrophysical sources. The Advanced LIGO proposal was developed while Barish was director, and he has continued to play a leading role in LIGO and Advanced LIGO.  The [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection of the merger of two 30 solar mass black holes]] was made on September 14, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102#fulltext  Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger], PhysRevLett.116.061102.&lt;/ref&gt; This represented the first direct detection of gravitational waves since they were predicted by Einstein in 1916 and the first ever observation of the merger of a pair of black holes. Barish delivered the first presentation on this discovery to a scientific audience at CERN on Feb 11, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New results on the Search for Gravitational Waves|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2131411|publisher=CERN|accessdate=15 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously with the public announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2131411|title=New results on the Search for Gravitational Waves|date=11 February 2016|publisher=|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2002, Barish served as co-chair of the [[High Energy Physics Advisory Panel]] subpanel that developed a long-range plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subpanel on Long Range Planning for US HEP|url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/hep/pdf/files/pdfs/hepap_lrp_web.pdf|publisher=Office of Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; for U.S. high energy physics. He has chaired the Commission of Particles and Fields and the U.S. Liaison committee to the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP). In 2002 he chaired the NRC Board of Physics and Astronomy Neutrino Facilities Assessment Committee Report, "Neutrinos and Beyond".

In 2005-2013 Barry Barish was Director of the [Global Design Effort]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ILC Global Design Effort|url=http://www.linearcollider.org/GDE|publisher=LinearCollider.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the International Linear Collider ([[International Linear Collider|ILC]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry Barish to lead International Linear Collider design.|url=http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1018952|publisher=Interactions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILC is the highest priority future project for particle physics worldwide, as it promises to complement the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] in exploring the TeV energy scale.  This ambitious effort is being uniquely coordinated worldwide, representing a major step in international collaborations going from conception to design to implementation for large scale projects in physics.

==Honors and awards==
In 2002, he received the [[Klopsteg Memorial Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/klopsteg.cfm|title=Klopsteg Memorial Lecture Award|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|publisher=American Association of Physics Teachers|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the American Association of Physics Teachers.  Barish was honored by the [[University of Bologna]] (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Bologna|url=http://www.linearcollider.org/GDE/Director%27s-Corner/2006/12-October-2006---Pomp-and-Circumstance|publisher=ILC Newsline}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [https://web.archive.org/web/20151220201932/http://president.ufl.edu/office/honors-awards/honorary-degree-recipients/ University of Florida] ( 2007)  where he received honorary doctorates. In 2007, delivered the [http://www.physics.umn.edu/events/vanvleck/2007.html Van Vleck lectures]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Vleck Lectures|url=http://www.physics.umn.edu/events/vanvleck/2007.html|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Minnesota]]. The University of Glasgow honored  Barish with an honorary degree of science in 2013.

Barish was honored as a ''Titan of Physics'' in the [http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2016/08/on-the-shoulders-of-giants/ On the Shoulders of Giants]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the Shoulders of Giants|url=http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/2016/08/on-the-shoulders-of-giants/|publisher=World Science Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; series at the 2016 [[World Science Festival]].

In 2016, Barish received the [[Enrico Fermi Prize]] "for his fundamental contributions to the formation of the LIGO and LIGO-Virgo scientific collaborations and for his role in addressing challenging technological and scientific aspects whose solution led to the first detection of gravitational waves".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Enrico Fermi Prize|url=http://www.primapagina.sif.it/article/466/il-premio-fermi-2016-alle-onde-gravitazionali|website=Società Italiana di Fisica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berkeley Earth''' is a [[Berkeley, California]] based independent 501(c)(3) [[non-profit]] focused on land temperature data analysis for [[climate science]].  Berkeley Earth was founded in early 2010 (originally called the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project) with the goal of addressing the major concerns from outside the scientific community regarding [[global warming]] and the [[instrumental temperature record]]. The project's stated aim was a "transparent approach, based on data analysis."&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeleyearth.org/index.php |title=Berkeley Earth home page |accessdate=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821233330/http://berkeleyearth.org/index.php |archive-date=2013-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, Berkeley Earth became an independent non-profit.  In August 2013, Berkeley Earth was granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the US government. The primary product is air temperatures over land, but they also produce a global dataset resulting from a merge of their land data with HadSST.

Berkeley Earth founder [[Richard A. Muller]] told ''[[The Guardian]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we are bringing the spirit of science back to a subject that has become too argumentative and too contentious, ....we are an independent, non-political, non-partisan group. We will gather the data, do the analysis, present the results and make all of it available. There will be no spin, whatever we find. We are doing this because it is the most important project in the world today. Nothing else comes close.&lt;ref name=Sample&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/feb/27/can-these-scientists-end-climate-change-war |title=Can a group of scientists in California end the war on climate change? |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The team's preliminary findings, data sets and programs were published beginning in December 2012. The study addressed scientific concerns including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data [[selection bias]]. The Berkeley Earth group concluded that the warming trend is real, that over the past 50 years (between the decades of the 1950s and 2000s) the land surface warmed by 0.91±0.05&amp;nbsp;°C, and their results mirror those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]],  NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis, and the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]].  The study also found that the [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt;

==Initial results==
After completing the analysis of the full land temperature data set, consisting of more than 1.6 billion temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world, and originated from more than 39,000 temperature stations worldwide, the group submitted four papers for peer-review and publication in scientific journals. The Berkeley Earth study did not assess temperature changes in the oceans, nor try to assess how much of the observed warming is due to human action.&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt; The Berkeley Earth team also released the preliminary findings to the public on October 20, 2011 in order to promote additional scrutiny. The data sets and programs used to analyze the information, and the papers undergoing peer review were also made available to the public.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack&gt;{{Cite news|title=Global warming 'confirmed' by independent study |first=Richard |last=Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21533360 |title=Climate change: The heat is on |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111021144716.htm |title=Cooling the Warming Debate: Major New Analysis Confirms That Global Warming Is Real |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkeley Earth study addressed scientific concerns raised by skeptics including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The team's initial conclusions are the following:&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/global-warming-study-climate-sceptics |title=Global warming study finds no grounds for climate sceptics' concerns |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]] and [[NASA]]'s GISS Surface Temperature Analysis. The team found that the urban heat island effect is locally large and real, but does not contribute significantly to the average land temperature rise, as the planet's urban regions amount to less than 1% of the land area. The study also found that while stations considered "poor" might be less accurate, they recorded the same average warming trend.
*Global temperatures closely matched previous studies from NASA GISS, NOAA and the Hadley Centre, that have found global warming trends. The Berkeley Earth group estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911&amp;nbsp;°C, just 2% less than NOAA's estimate. The team scientific director stated that "...this confirms that these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions."&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;
*About 1/3 of temperature sites around the world with records of 70 years or longer reported cooling (including much of the United States and northern Europe). But 2/3 of the sites show warming. Individual temperature histories reported from a single location are frequently noisy and/or unreliable, and it is always necessary to compare and combine many records to understand the true pattern of global warming.
*The [[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation]] (AMO) has played a larger role than previously thought. The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is generally thought to be the main reason for inter-annual warming or cooling, but the Berkeley Earth team's analysis found that  the global temperature correlates more closely with the state of the Atlantic Multidecadal ''Oscillation'' index, which is a measure of sea surface temperature in the north Atlantic.

The Berkeley Earth analysis uses a new methodology and was tested against much of the same data as NOAA and NASA. The group uses an algorithm that attaches an automatic weighting to every data point, according to its consistency with comparable readings. The team claims this approach allows the inclusion of outlandish readings without distorting the result and standard statistical techniques were used to remove [[outlier]]s. The methodology also avoids traditional procedures that require long, continuous data segments, thus accommodating for short sequences, such as those provided by temporary weather stations. This innovation allowed the group to compile an earlier record than its predecessors, starting from 1800, but with a high degree of uncertainty because at the time there were only two weather stations in America, just a few in Europe and one in Asia.&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature1011/&gt;

===Reactions===
Given project leader Muller's well-publicised concerns regarding the quality of climate change research, other critics anticipated that the Berkeley Earth study would be a vindication of their stance. For example, when the study team was announced, [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]], a blogger who popularized several of the issues addressed by the Berkeley Earth group study, expressed full confidence in the team's methods:

{{quote|text=I'm prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong. ... [T]he method ''isn't'' the madness that we've seen from NOAA, NCDC, GISS, and CRU, and, there aren't any monetary strings attached to the result that I can tell. ... That lack of strings attached to funding, plus the broad mix of people involved especially those who have previous experience in handling large data sets gives me greater confidence in the result being closer to a bona fide ground truth than anything we've seen yet.|source=Anthony Watts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wattsupwiththat.com/2011/03/06/briggs-on-berkeleys-best-plus-my-thoughts-from-my-visit-there/ |last=Watts |first=Anthony |title=Briggs on Berkeley's forthcoming BEST surface temperature record, plus my thoughts from my visit there |date=March 6, 2011 |website=Watts Up With That? |accessdate=2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

When the initial results were released, and found to support the existing consensus, the study was widely decried by deniers. Watts spoke to ''The New York Times'', which wrote: "Mr. Watts ... contended that the study's methodology was flawed because it examined data over a 60-year period instead of the 30-year-one that was the basis for his research and some other peer-reviewed studies. He also noted that the report had not yet been peer-reviewed and cited spelling errors as proof of sloppiness."&lt;ref name=NYT1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/climate-study-does-not-placate-skeptics/?ref=earth |title=Climate Study Does Not Placate Skeptics |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/science/earth/21climate.html |title=Climate Skeptics Stay Unswayed |work=New York Times |date=October 21, 2011 |page=A25 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Mosher, a co-author of a book critical of climate scientists, also disapproved saying that the study still lacked transparency. He said: "I'm not happy until the code is released and released in a language that people can use freely."&lt;ref name=NYT1011/&gt; (The code and dataset were by then available from the Berkeley Earth Data page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111225024628/http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Berkeley Earth Data as updated 2011-10-21], [http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Berkeley Earth: Data Overview] (current)&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Stephen McIntyre]], editor of [[Climate Audit]], a climato-skeptics [[blog]], said that "the team deserves credit for going back to the primary data and doing the work" and even though he had not had an opportunity to read the papers in detail, he questioned the analyses of urban heating and weather station quality.&lt;ref name=Nature1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111020/full/news.2011.607.html |title=Different method, same result: global warming is real |first=Jeff |last=Tollefson |work=[[Nature News]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |doi=10.1038/news.2011.607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientist1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21074-sceptical-climate-scientists-concede-earth-has-warmed.html |title=Sceptical climate scientists concede Earth has warmed |first=Michael |last=Marshall |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the study was well received by Muller's peers in climate science research. [[James Hansen]], a leading climate scientist and head of [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] commented that he had not yet read the research papers but was glad Muller was looking at the issue. He said "It should help inform those who have honest scepticism about global warming."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] the director of the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]], said: "I look forward to reading the finalised paper once it has been reviewed and published. These initial findings are very encouraging and echo our own results and our conclusion that the impact of urban heat islands on the overall global temperature is minimal."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]], director of the Earth System Science Center at [[Pennsylvania State University]], commented that "...they get the same result that everyone else has gotten," and "that said, I think it's at least useful to see that even a critic like Muller, when he takes an honest look, finds that climate science is robust."&lt;ref name=Scientist1011/&gt; Peter Thorne, from the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative, said: "This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark. There is very substantial value in having multiple groups looking at the same problem in different ways." &lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; The ice core research scientist Eric Steig wrote at RealClimate.org that it was unsurprising that Berkeley Earth's results matched previous results so well: "Any of various simple statistical analyses of the freely available data ...show... that it was very very unlikely that the results would change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/10/berkeley-earthquake-called-off/ |first=Eric |last=Steig |title=Berkeley earthquake called off |publisher=RealClimate.org |date=6 December 2004 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded scope==
Since the publication of its papers in 2013, Berkeley Earth has broadened its scope. Berkeley Earth has three program areas of work: 1) further scientific investigations on the nature of climate change and extreme weather events, 2) an education and communications program, and 3) evaluation of mitigation efforts in developed and developing economies, with a focus on energy conservation and the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/science Berkeley Earth  Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications Berkeley Earth  Education &amp; Communications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204083539/http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation Berkeley Earth Mitigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080520/http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==July 2012 announcement==
In an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on 28 July 2012, Muller announced further findings from the project. He said their analysis showed that average global land temperatures had increased by {{convert|2.5|F-change|1}} in 250 years, with the increase in the last 50 years being {{convert|1.5|F-change|1}}, and it seemed likely that this increase was entirely due to human caused [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. His opening paragraph stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He said that their findings were stronger than those shown in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. Their analysis, set out in five scientific papers now being subjected to scrutiny by others, had used statistical methods which Robert Rohde had developed and had paid particular attention to overcoming issues that skeptics had questioned, including the [[urban heat island]] effect, poor station quality, data selection and data adjustment. In the fifth paper which they now made public, they fitted the shape of the record to various forcings including volcanoes, solar activity and sunspots. They found that the shape best matched the curve of the calculated greenhouse effect from human caused greenhouse gas emissions. Muller said he still found "that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn't changed."&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4218">The '''British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology''' ('''BSSSP''') was founded in 1913, "to advance a particularly radical agenda in the field of sex reform, based on the writings of gurus such as [[Edward Carpenter|[Edward] Carpenter]] and [[Havelock Ellis|[Havelock] Ellis]]."&lt;ref&gt;Lesley A. Hall, '"Disinterested Enthusiasm for Sexual Misconduct": The British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, 1913-47', ''Journal of Contemporary History'', Vol. 30, No. 4 (Oct. 1995),  pp.665-686&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931 the Society was renamed the '''British Sexological Society'''.&lt;ref name=Ives&gt;[http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00060.xml George Cecil Ives: An Inventory of His Papers] at the [[Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;
It seems to have continued until some point in the 1940s.

The society was particularly concerned with [[homosexuality]], aiming to combat legal discrimination against homosexuality with scientific understanding. Members included [[George Cecil Ives]],&lt;ref name=Ives/&gt; [[Edward Carpenter]], [[Montague Summers]], [[Stella Browne]],  [[Laurence Housman]], [[Havelock Ellis]], [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], and [[Ernest Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;David C. Weigle, 'Psychology and homosexuality: The British Sexological Society', ''Journal of the History of the Behavioural Sciences'' 31:2 (April 1995), p.137-148&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society published a series of pamphlets:

A '''Building Engineer''' is recognised as being expert in the use of [[technology]] in the [[design]], [[construction]], assessment and maintenance of the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition used by the CABE (Chartered Association of Building Engineer)&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial Building Engineers are concerned with the planning, design, construction, operation, renovation, and maintenance of buildings, as well as with their impacts on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Information available from the website of the Concordia University in Montreal, Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==
===Australia===
In [[Australia]] building engineers, also known as architectural engineers may work on new building projects, or renovations of existing structures. Areas of study include:
* [[architectural history]] and design of buildings
* [[air conditioning]], lighting and electrical power distribution
* water supply and distribution
* fire and life safety systems
* [[sustainable building]] systems design
* building structures and building construction technology
* construction planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.vu.edu.au/courses/bachelor-of-engineering-honours-architectural-engineering-nhea |title=Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) (Architectural Engineering) &amp;#124; Victoria University &amp;#124; Melbourne Australia |website=Vu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a multifaceted build environment professional, a building engineer can provide important leadership in the design and construction of the built environment, collaborating with architects, engineers, builders and other design professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu.au/pubs/handbooks/courses/E3009.html |title=Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) and Bachelor of Architectural Design |website=Monash.edu.au |date=2016-10-15 |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In [[Canada]], Building Engineers have to follow an interdisciplinary program that integrates pertinent knowledge from different disciplines.  The building engineer explores all phases of the life cycle of a building and develops an appreciation of the building as an advanced technological system. Problems are identified and appropriate solutions found to improve the performance of the building in areas such as:
* Energy efficiency, passive solar engineering, lighting and acoustics;
* Indoor air quality;
* [[Construction management]]
* [[HVAC]] and control systems
* Advanced [[building materials]], building envelope
* Earthquake resistance, wind effects on buildings, [[computer-aided design]].

A building engineer can be a licensed professional, and in some countries is synonymous with an [[architect]]. Building engineers are licensed to perform whole-building design with architect-engineer teams, or as practitioners in structural, mechanical, or electrical fields of [[building design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadian-universities.net/Universities/Programs/Building_Engineering.html |title=Canada Building Engineering University Programs |website=Canadian-universities.net |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Within the [[European Community]], building engineers are affiliated with the AEEBC (Association of European Experts in Building and Construction) one of the biggest pan-European bodies for construction professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeebc.org/members.html |title=AEEBC-Members &amp; Membership plus Affiliations |website=Aeebc.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The titles, tasks and duties of a building engineer may vary from one European State to another.

===Nigeria===
In [[Nigeria]] a building engineer is simply known as builder.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}
A builder is an academic trained specialist statutory registered professional responsible for Building Production, Management, Construction and Maintenance of Building for the use and protection of mankind. A builder must be a member of Nigeria institute of building(NIOB) and Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria(CORBON).{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The major consultancy services rendered by building engineers are listed below:
* Building production management
* Building maintenance management
* Project management
* Building surveying
* Feasibility and viability studies
* Facilities monitoring and evaluation
* Arbitration, meditation and expert witness.

Functions of building engineers in the building code before plan approval according to the National Building Code:
* Contract Drawing and specification prepared by registered architects anđ registered engineers;
* Priced bill of Quantities prepared by abregistered quantity surveyors;
* Construction programme, project quality management plan,project health and safety plan and Buildability and maintenance analysis prepared by a registered Builder;
* Conditions of contract.
* All-risk insurance for the building works, personnel and equipment.

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
In the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]], the title of "building engineer" is regulated by the [[Chartered Association of Building Engineers|CABE]] (Chartered Association of Building Engineers). The 'Chartered Association of Building Engineers' was founded as the 'Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors' (IAAS) in 1925 in London. The Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors became the 'Association of Building Engineers' (ABE) in 1993 and on obtaining its Royal Charter, became the 'Chartered Association of Building Engineers' (CABE) in 2014, its current name.

The CABE accredits university qualifications to use the title Chartered Building Engineer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbuilde.com/careers/accredited-universities/list-of-accredited-universities/ |title=List of Accredited Universities - Chartered Association of Building Engineers |website=Cbuilde.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the United Kingdom and Ireland, Chartered Building Engineers are involved within the design, planning, engineering, construction, legal compliance, fire safety, and maintenance of buildings. Their roles may vary from one practice to another. Building Engineers may offer specialised services within phases of the construction process or for different engineering aspects of the [[construction industry]], such as [[fire safety]], conservation, sustainability, planning or construction.

In England and Wales, 'Building Engineers' may also be state authorised "Approved Inspectors" (or are employed by a state authorised "Corporate Approved Inspector") and thus may provide UK "Building Regulations" compliance &amp; approval.

Many 'Building Engineers' are employed by Scottish, English and Welsh local authorities to enforce and apply the Building Regulations and other Building Act 1984 related functions, including public safety in respect of "Dangerous Structures", etc.

In the Republic of Ireland, where a semi-public building control system was implemented in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2014/si/9/made/en/print |title=S.I. No. 9/2014 - Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 |website=Irishstatutebook.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chartered Building Engineers may register as Building Surveyors in order to act as certifiers for compliance with building regulations at design and construction stage.

The tasks and duties of the building engineer are:
* Design and preparation of plans
* Preparation of [[planning applications]]
* Remedial works
* Dilapidation schedules / negotiations
* Site inspections and certification of works
* Repair and maintenance of buildings
* Energy auditing and [[energy performance]] certificates
* Measured survey of land and buildings
* Advice on energy-saving designs
* Access audits
* Rehabilitation of properties
* Conservation
* [[Construction management]]
* [[Quantity surveying]]
* Fire safety and [[health and safety]]
* Demolition
* Negotiating, obtaining and implementing claims and grants
* Building variations
* Building inspections and surveys
* Advice on building law/party wall issues
* Checking building designs for compliance with the 'Building Regulations' and related 'Building' &amp; 'Fire' Legislation.
* Enforcement of breaches of the 'Building Regulations' and related 'Building' &amp; 'Fire' Legislation, including 'law court' proceedings.

===United States of America===
In the [[United States of America]] building engineering, also known as [[Architectural engineering]] is the application of engineering principles and technology to building design and construction. Definitions of an architectural engineer may refer to:
* An engineer in the structural, mechanical, electrical, construction or other engineering fields of building design and construction.
* A licensed engineering professional in parts of the United States.
* Architectural engineers are those who work with other engineers and architects for the designing and construction of buildings.

The [[architectural engineer]] applies the knowledge and skills of broader [[engineering]] disciplines to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, and renovation of buildings and their component systems while paying careful attention to their effects on the surrounding environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asce.org/architectural-engineering/architectural-engineering-institute/|title=Architectural Engineering Institute – ASCE|website=Asce.org|accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the establishment of a specific "Architectural Engineering" [[NCEES]] [[Professional Engineer]]ing registration examination in the 1990s, and first offering in April 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncees.org|title=Welcome to NCEES|website=Ncees.org|accessdate=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural Engineering is now recognized as a distinct engineering discipline in the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41653">The '''coloniality of gender''' is a  concept developed by feminist philosopher [[Maria Lugones|María Lugones]], which she defines as "the analysis of [[racialized]], [[capitalist]], gender oppression", while the process of potentially overcoming this practice can be defined as "decolonial feminism".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"&gt;Lugones, María. Toward a Decolonial Feminism. Hypatia vol. 25, no. 4 (Fall 2010). Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|747}} Central to these terms is the definition and recognition of [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] social structures and their relation to land, and the articulation of how these [[Epistemology|epistemologies]] occupy an oppositional consciousness&lt;ref&gt;[[Chela Sandoval|Sandoval, Chela]]. US Third World Feminism: the Theory and Method of Oppositional Consciousness in the Postmodern World. pp. 1-24. Genders, no. 10, 1991. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; to colonial systems of social, sexual, ecological, spatial, and temporal hierarchy. María Lugones describes this difference as the 'oppressing ←→ resisting' relationship.

Colonialism of gender has altered the indigenous sense of self, identity and to the larger extent their cosmology and gender relationships. With the colonization of indigenous groups, it allowed European to implement their idea of gender and sex. This covered up the preexisting conception of  sex and gender in the indigenous group during the pre-colonialism times. This is evident with the lack of representation or awareness in Western society for the indigenous concept of being "Two Spirited"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://transhealth.phsa.ca/trans-101/two-spirit|title=Two-Spirit - Transgender Health Information Program|work=Transgender Health Information Program|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of gender itself was believed to be introduced by Western colonizers as a way to distinct two dualistic social categories which are men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalsocialtheory.org/topics/coloniality-of-gender/|title=Coloniality of Gender – GLOBAL SOCIAL THEORY|website=globalsocialtheory.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colonizers had introduced the idea of gender itself into Indigenous groups as this was originally a colonial concept which was made to organize production, territory and behavior. The desire for the colonizer to put forth the idea of gender onto an Indigenous group was to have control over their labor, authority, influence their subjectivity and ideas of sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca/stable/pdf/4640051.pdf|title=Heterosexualism and the Colonial / Modern Gender System|last=Lugones|first=María|date=December 12, 2017|website=www.jstor.org.proxy.library.carleton.ca|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to race, land, and sovereignty ==

According to [[Glen Sean Coulthard]] in his essay ''For the Land: the Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination'', Indigenous resistances against "capitalist imperialism" can be understood as struggles surrounding the question of land and knowledge-based practices encompassing the "relation to one another and our surroundings in a respectful, nondominating and nonexploitative way".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"&gt;Coulthard, Glen Sean. "For the Land: The Dene Nation's Struggle for Self-Determination." Red Skin White Masks: Rejecting the Colonial Politics of Recognition. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2014. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|60}} Coulthard defines this system of relationality as "grounded normativity"&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} stating, "the late Lakota philosopher [[Vine Deloria Jr.]] argues that one of the most significant differences that exist between Indigenous and Western [[metaphysics]] revolves around the central importance of land to Indigenous modes of being, thought, and ethics".&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|60}} Further to this, Coulthard argues that Indigenous "philosophies of nonoppression" are defined through spatial as well as temporal relationships.&lt;ref name="Coulthard2014"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Lugones refers to these Western-versus-Indigenous epistemologies as 'cosmologies'&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|754, 749}} in her essay ''Toward a Decolonial Feminism'', where she analyzes these structures in relation to the colonial imposition of [[gender binary|gender binaries]] on Indigenous communities.

According to Lugones, colonial modernity is positioned as "the dichotomous hierarchy between the human and the non-human",&lt;ref name=Foot01/&gt; summarized by Lugones' use of the term "colonial difference".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones states that within the context of colonization in the Americas and the Caribbean, this hierarchy was employed as a tactic of subordination of the colonized to "Western man".&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} Lugones argues that related hierarchies were constructed by colonizers to create a binary division between men and women, describing this distinction as "a mark of the human and a mark of civilization. Only the civilized are men or women," which excluded Indigenous peoples and Africans as being non-human animals, while upholding the status of "bourgeois European women" as passive reproductive servants of "white bourgeois" male colonizers.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|743}} According to Lugones, colonial relations of power constructed through such binaries constitute the "colonial difference", a term with open-ended origins that Lugones attributes to Walter Mignolo's book ''Local Histories/Global Designs''.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|751}}

Logones has stated that colonial notions of [[femininity]] as inversions of [[masculinity]] did not grant human status, but rather established a [[gender dimorphism]] of [[hypersexuality]] and sexual passivity that rendered colonized "men" and "women" as non-human gendered entities.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Through the performance of colonial [[anthropocentrism]] and the disruption of Indigenous [[cosmologies]] of grounded normativity, extreme acts of sexualized violence could be justified towards gendered and dehumanized colonized subjects, as stated by Lugones.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} Lugones writes that through murder and rape,&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|744}} control of colonized bodies institutionalized the internalization of colonial systems. Religious indoctrination, with divisions between good and evil equating colonized females with Satan, arguably established not only a colonization of bodies, but of memory.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}} Systematic replications of these ideologies, according to Lugones, facilitated the erasure of Indigenous cosmologies of reciprocal relations to place, psychologically clearing the way for the re-appropriation of land toward the implementation of capitalist projects.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|745}}

Within Lugones' analysis of Mignolo's usage of the colonial difference is her assertion that the colonial difference (and the coloniality of gender) is "not an affair of the past";&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752}} as such, as a contemporary phenomenon, Lugones argues that seeking parity with the colonizer by erasing colonial difference does not eliminate oppression.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|752–753}} [[Rey Chow]] terms the act of seeking parity with the colonizer as "the ascendancy of whiteness",&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"&gt;Arvin, Maile; Tuck, Eve; and Morrill, Angie. Decolonizing Feminism: Challenging Connections between Settler Colonialism and [[Heteropatriarchy]]. Feminist Formations, vol. 25 No. 1 (Spring 2013). pp. 8-34. Print. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; which Arvin, Tuck and Morrill further elaborate as taking part in the colonial "settling process" to dispossess "'other-ed' peoples globally".&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt; Instead, Lugones proposes a "feminist border thinking" that positions learning from subalternity at the colonial difference as central to a decolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|753}} This concept embraces movements toward coalitional social relations between feminists of color, which Lugones describes as "the oppositional consciousness of a social erotics."&lt;ref name="Lugones2010"/&gt;{{rp|755}}

In this context, according to Arvin, Tuck, and Morrill, "Indigenous communities' concerns are often not about achieving formal equality or civil rights within a nation-state, but instead achieving substantial independence from a Western nation-state—independence decided on their own terms."&lt;ref name="Arvin, Maile 2013 pp. 8-34"/&gt;

== Colonialism of gender in Canada ==
Some researchers believe that contact with patriarchal, European colonial contact reduced the value of Indigenous women in Canadian society.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hanson|first=Cindy|last2=Regina|first2=University of|date=2016|title=Gender, Justice, and the Indian Residential School Claims Process|url=http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/iipj/vol7/iss1/3/|journal=International Indigenous Policy Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.18584/iipj.2016.7.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, colonialism greatly shifted the role of women in Indigenous communities through patriarchal laws and regulations placed on marriage and other sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men, to whom the Indigenous people were viewed as inferior.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Trafficking of Aboriginal Women and Girls|last=Boyer|first=Yvonne|last2=Kampouris, Peggy|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=978-1-100-23756-5|location=Canada|pages=5–7 &amp; 31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal impositions on sexual relations between Indigenous women and European men resulted in such relations to have underlying monetary agendas, a commodification of women that caused many Indigenous women to involve themselves in prostitution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this Indigenous people as a whole were encouraged to adopt what  European Canadians and the Canadian government considered to be "[[Culture of Canada|Canadian culture]]", eschewing their native culture and traditions in favor of assimilation.&lt;ref name="RoyalCom-sg3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|title=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Stage Three: Displacement and Assimilation|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada.|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071124124236/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgm6_e.html|archive-date=November 24, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|title=Report-Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples-Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|date=February 8, 2006|work=Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 6 of the ''Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples''|publisher=Government of Canada Web Archive-websites archived by Library and Archives Canada [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada]]|archive-url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071115053257/http://www.ainc-inac.gc.ca/ch/rcap/sg/sgmm_e.html|archive-date=November 15, 2007|dead-url=yes|accessdate=October 3, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of the [[Canadian Indian residential school system]] in 1847 contributed to the [[systemic racism]], violence, and sexual mistreatment of Indigenous people, which led to the normalization and repeated occurrence of this abuse.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cindy Hanson feels that this has contributed to a lingering sense of trauma among Indigenous women and girls that has caused them to become further victimized and [[Disfranchisement|disenfranchised]], as well as impact how they interact with their families and communities.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The issue of [[Missing and murdered Indigenous women|Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls]] has been cited by researchers such as Robyn Bourgeois as an example of how colonial exploitation has led to systemic racism, causing Indigenous women to be stereotyped or discriminated against as dirty, sexually indiscriminate bodies that can be violated and thrown away.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourgeois|first=Robyn|date=2015|title=Colonial exploitation: The Canadian state and the trafficking of Indigenous women and girls in Canada.|url=|journal=UCLA Law Review|volume=62 |issue=6|pages=1426–1463|via=Hein Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination towards Indigenous ==
The impact of colonialism of gender is evidently seen in Canada with Indigenous women as they often migrate to urban areas due to a lack of education and opportunities in general. While there is a lack of survey regarding the migration of indigenous people from rural to urban the 1991 Aboriginal People's Survey suggests that  61% of Aboriginal people have moved at some point in their life indicating their strong desire to seek out better career and livelihood.&lt;ref name="Trovato"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-demography/|title=Demography of Indigenous People|last=Trovato|first=Frank|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970 and 1980, the ''Indian Act'' created by Canadian government dictating Indigenous women as the act controlled their status, land, resources...etc. This act made it so if an indigenous women marries an individual without the same status, the women will lose their status.&lt;ref name="Trovato"/&gt; Since making this act obsolete. the number of registered Indians doubled as many were reinstated. This is seen in 1985 there were approximately 360,000 registered and 778.000 in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/native-womens-issues/|title=Indigenous Women's Issues|last=McNab|first=Miriam|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Indigenous women are seen to be most affected by Colonialism of Gender as there are many missing reports or homicides among Aboriginal females. A study shows that between 1980 and 2012, a total of 1,017 Aboriginal female were homicide victims and 164 women currently missing with additional 225  unsolved cases. As of November 4, 2013, 11.3% (1,455 total) female were considered missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/missing-and-murdered-aboriginal-women-national-operational-overview#sec3|title=Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women: A National Operational Overview {{!}} Royal Canadian Mounted Police|last=Police|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted|website=www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pre-colonial Indigenous idea of gender ==
Not only has the idea of gender and sexuality changed due to colonialism, but power distribution and family structure as well. In the pre-colonial times, Indigenous families were not organized through an authoritative figure but rather it was more communal. Some pre-colonial Indigenous communities were matrilineal and gave women very powerful roles within the society.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}

This drastically changed once they became colonized, European values and structures were enforced onto this community thus covering their pre-existing idea of gender and family. European societies were placed power onto the men and families were patrilinal rather than matrilineal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/patrilineal-vs-matrilineal-succession-3529192|title=Patrilineal vs. Matrilineal Succession|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In colonized societies, men often are the head of the family which allows them to make important decisions while the women are often seen more submissive and plays a supportive role for the men. This contrasted with the Indigenous way of life as Cree women were believed to be the center of life and Iroquois women were given spiritual roles and control over food for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Darcy|date=2009-04-01|title=Colonialism, Gender and the Family in North America: For a Gendered Analysis of Indigenous Struggles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x/abstract|journal=Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=70–88|doi=10.1111/j.1754-9469.2009.01029.x|issn=1754-9469}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German philosopher Immanuel Kant comments on the different gender power the Indigenous communities has compared to those who are colonized, as he says "'Among all savages there are none by whom the feminine sex is held in greater actual regard than by those of Canada. They assemble and deliberate upon the most important regulations of the nation'".(Kant, 1997)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=z9w4CKjHXlgC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=kant+%E2%80%99Among+all+savages+there+are+none+by+whom+the+feminine+sex+is+held+in+greater+actual+regard+than+by+those+of+Canada.+They+assemble+and+deliberate+upon+the+most+important+regulations+of+the+nation%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R-eqz_8RX-&amp;sig=bgbeGmQW-g32l3B6t_6E5xpwSxw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMhZT47OHXAhVDw4MKHXGpDnEQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kant%20%E2%80%99Among%20all%20savages%20there%20are%20none%20by%20whom%20the%20feminine%20sex%20is%20held%20in%20greater%20actual%20regard%20than%20by%20those%20of%20Canada.%20They%20assemble%20and%20deliberate&amp;f=false|title=Defamiliarizing the Aboriginal: Cultural Practices and Decolonization in Canada|last=Emberley|first=Julia|date=2007|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9780802091512|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colonialism of Gender in Asian ==
===Indonesia===

==== Westernised roles of women ====
Prior to the 1945 independence, the role of women only revolved around the household. To be a good woman is to be a good wife that provide support for the family. It was not until 1941 that women were allowed access to education as it would increase the possibility for Indonesia to gain independence. After the independence in 1945, the role of women in society has expanded beyond the domestic sphere and the National Women’s Congress keep in touch with women’s organizations abroad. For example, the government allowed women to be involved in activities such as police work training and other national defense related institutions, which would be considered out of the ordinary before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=WOMEN IN INDONESIA: Gender, Equity and Development.|last=Robinson &amp; Bessell|first=|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|year=2002|isbn=|location=Singapore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Employment =====
According to the 2014 World Development Indicators, labour participation rate of Indonesian women from the age of fifteen is 51.4%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is considered low by international standards. Although the gender pay gap is 5.3 %, Indonesian women are relatively paid more than men. It is because gender pay gap also included underemployment rate. For instance, the number of women working in higher position are lacking compared to male.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Megawati Soekarnopoetri, the daughter of the first president of Republic of Indonesia, was elected as the first female ruler of the country in 2001 after her predecessor was impeached. She served as president until 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Muslim women of power gender, politics, and culture in Islam|last=Bennett|first=C|publisher=Continuun|year=2010|isbn=|location=New York|pages=Chapter 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; . Currently, Indonesia has eight female ministers that are in office&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.tempo.co/read/news/2018/03/19/055916784/President-Jokowi-Takes-Pride-in-His-Female-Ministers|title=President Jokowi Takes Pride in His Female Ministers|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which seven of them has received international recognition such as Best Minister in the World Award at the World Government Summit 2018 that was given to Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idntimes.com/life/women/ismet-maulana/7-menteri-wanita-di-era-jokowi-yang-terima-penghargaan-internasional-c1c2/full|title=7 Menteri Wanita di Era Jokowi yang Terima Penghargaan Internasional|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Education =====
According to the data collected by the World Economic Forum in 2013, women in Indonesia has equal or nearly equal education participation rate to men. The female-to-male ratio in secondary education is one, meaning that the number enrolled is equal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2013/#section=list-of-countries&amp;ol=info|title=The Global Gender Report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A figure that started the fight for women’s right to education is Kartini. During the colonial period, she opened up the first school for native girls in Indonesia with the help of her sisters. At that time, girls do not have the opportunity to get education. Her legacy continued with the founding of Kartini School in Batavia, three years after she passed away&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters of a Javanese princess|last=Kartini and Symmers|first=Raden Ajeng and A.L.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===== Economy =====
Women’s participation in entrepreneurship is still low, with ‘only 23% of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises are owned by women’. Although 45% of manufacturing business owners are women, they mostly relied on unpaid female workers while businesses owned by male have more paid workers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.monash.edu/business/cdes/research/publications/publications2/Womens-economic-participation-in-Indonesia-June-2017.pdf|title=Women’s Economic Participation in Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

===== Community =====
There are many women’s organizations in Indonesia that are based on various interest of its members. One of the well-known organizations is Dharma Wanita Persatuan (DWP), composed of the wives of government employees&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liputan6.com/regional/read/3392512/kegiatan-dharma-wanita-jangan-hanya-lomba-masak-dan-kecantikan|title=Kegiatan Dharma Wanita Jangan Hanya Lomba Masak dan Kecantikan.|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The younger generation are more focused on gender equality, preventing sexual assault and empowerment. A few organisations include National Commission on Violence Against Women, Hollaback! Jakarta, Community Legal Aid Institute. The organisations mentioned, along with several others, participate in the ‘Women’s March’ in 2018, a rally to voice out their opinion regarding gender-based violence in Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jakartaglobe.id/features/women-behind-womens-march-jakarta/|title=The Women Behind Women’s March Jakarta|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Westernised roles of women ====

===== During Colonisation =====
In the year 1893-1907, the French had colonized Laos along with Vietnam and Cambodia incorporating into French Cochin China&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|date=1995|title=The French in Laos, 1887-1945|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/312913?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=29|pages=111-139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During the colonisation, the country is popular among French colonials by the interest of accommodating by Lao women or Annamite mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stuart-Fox|first=Martin|date=1995|title=The French in Laos, 1887-1945|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/312913?seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=29|pages=111-139|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The French did not want to live in traditional Lao way and look at Lao women as temporary wives, they expect Lao women to adapted to European style and European architectural.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30006843/logan-landofthe-2007.pdf|title=Land of the lotus-eaters: Vientiane under the French|last=Logan and William|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, most women and girls are serve as servant or mistress. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30006843/logan-landofthe-2007.pdf|title=Land of the lotus-eaters: Vientiane under the French|last=Logan and William|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== After colonisation =====
Lao colonisation last for several years until the World War II, Japanese had occupy Laos. ( Japanese occupation of Laos) &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30006843/logan-landofthe-2007.pdf|title=Land of the lotus-eaters: Vientiane under the French|last=Logan and William|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since the 1957, women are formally equal in the eye of state however, gender is how the social practices are organised besides age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diversicare.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Profile_LaoSML.pdf|title=Laos Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in 1975 Lao women’s concerns were first formally addressed by national government. The Lao People Revolutionary Party, the new communist establishment had guarantee on equality between women and men in all fields, economic, cultural, social and political, also the neglect toward women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=Thomson|first=Sheila|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s role in the public sphere ====

===== Politics =====
Despite women contribution in the developing of Lao, the gender data on health education and political show that women still absence to political power and basis services. However, Lao women still related to national level through the Lao Women Union (LWU)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only female minister is the president of the LWU.

===== Education =====
Education status of women in Laos has improve significantly since 1975, the percentage of female students in school increase from 37,6% to 45,3% in 1980. In regards of salary, educated women tend to face inequalities5. However, the overall average education level of Lao women still lower than men. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/sites/bridge.ids.ac.uk/files/reports/re9c.pdf|title=Women and Development in Laos|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s role in the private sphere ====

===== Community =====
Women and men are equal in regards of legal right. Many families take part in agriculture, farming. Also, work is divide by gender role, women are often take care of their child, cooking maintaining the household and household finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/lao-culture/family-edd122c0-5b12-4cd9-8e34-22029325a9aa|title=Lao culture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;women who live in urbanised area work in companies and civil service position. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://culturalatlas.sbs.com.au/lao-culture/family-edd122c0-5b12-4cd9-8e34-22029325a9aa|title=Lao culture|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men mostly is the head of family and decision maker.

===== Conclusion =====
The gender inequality and gender issues tend to conflict with urban areas and rural areas, but overall women are still mainly seen as a home maker or care taker. However, they are still opportunities for women to hold positions in many industries and work area. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edmund Hodgson|first=Yates|date=1865|title=French Cochin China.|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy.library.uq.edu.au/docview/6506789?rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo|journal=Temple bar : a London magazine for town and country readers, Dec. 1860-Dec. 1881; London|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, China is a male-dominated society while women had a relatively subordinate familial role which they were assumed to be taking care of housework and children. While for Hong Kong, due to the emergence of western culture during the british colonial period, westernization leads to a mix of traditional chinese thoughts and western culture and a significant different women roles in Hong Kong were found. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Sangwha|date=1999|title=The Patriarchy in China: An Investigation of Public and Private Spheres.|url=|journal=Asian Journal of Women's Studies|volume=5(1)|pages=9-49|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

===== Employment =====
The labour force participation rate for women increased gradually from 48.7% in 2004 to 50.7% in 2014. On the other hand, the labour force participation rate of men decreased from 71.6% in 2004 to 68.7% in 2014. 2 In 2017, there are 45.8% female and 54.2% males recorded in the employment rate, this indicated the equal and fair workplaces between male and female. There are different rights for the employed women including maternity protection and sick leave, however, there are different difficulties women facing for example some companies required a male supervisor instead of a female one.

===== Economy =====
According to the Women and Men Hong Kong Key Statistics 2018 Edition, there is 331 thousand female employed person, excluding foreign domestic helper, earned more than 30,000per month. 542.4 thousand male employed person earned more than 30,000 per month. contribution towards economic development by women is relatively lower than male these days. Although more Hong Kong women than men are attaining tertiary education, but are earning less than men across all professions. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.gov.hk/download/research/HK_Women2015_e.pdf|title=Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
According to data collected in the Hong Kong Women in Figures 2015, the ratio of male and female in the Executive council is 23:6. Although the number of women who participated in the executive council is low, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (CE) 2017 is known as Carrie Lam who is the first female CE in the history. This allocated the rise of women participation in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youth.gov.hk/en/info-centre/education/education-policy.htm|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Education =====
In the past, under the traditional chinese patriarchy structure, for those family who are not affordable to send all children to school, they are prioritising their son to attend school. However, after the british control, people realise the education system should have changed and discovered the importance of being educated. The education opportunities in Hong Kong are comparatively fair since the Hong Kong government is providing a 12-year free education including 6 years primary school and 6 year secondary school education. Parents are compulsory to send their children to school or stay-home study for special needs, thus all teenagers in Hong Kong can be well-educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkfw.org/chi/index.php|title=Hong Kong Federation of Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
For both gender in Hong Kong, they are getting married later in their life since women are getting more independent and bare a higher responsibility in their work forces. Traditional marriage values are less important and women are less relying on men in nowadays society. People agreed that the household income should be contributed from both husband and wife, thus, women are getting their own job as well instead of being a housewife only.

===== Community =====
There are several common communities protecting Hong Kong women’s rights. The Hong Kong Federation of women founded by 11 prominent ladies was established on 28 June 1993.  Members of the federation came from various levels, occupations, races, and districts in Hong Kong. Amongst members are business women, professionals, workers and housewives as well as those who are fervent in women development and advancement.Their goal is to unite women from all walks of life, to encourage them taking an active interest in Hong Kong affairs, to improve and protect the lawful rights of women and to liaise with women organizations all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanpowered.com/japan-culture/gender-roles-women-modern-japan|title=Gender Roles of Women in Modern Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Japan===

==== Westernised Roles of Women ====
Through modernisation and western influence, women status and role are changed. In the past, women were very much seen as second class citizens. They had no rights or possessions and were subservient to their husbands. Women are expected to marry, produce heirs, and take care of the household. Marriage was often arranged and it is a contract between families. However, after western influence, women are making strides toward equality in Japan. Equality benefits men as much as it does women for example becoming more acceptable to want a career. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/643486/japan-female-employment-rate/|title=Female employment rate in Japan from 2007 to 2016|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Women’s Role in the Public Sphere ====

==== Employment ====
The government takes credit for adding about 1m women to the workforce since 2012. At 66%, the female participation rate is now among the highest in the world. That is largely the result, say critics, of Japan’s drum-tight labour market rather than of innovative policies. Mindful that most of these jobs are far down the corporate totem pole, the government has also revived a decade-old target of having women occupy 30% of “leadership positions” by 2020. But it admits that this goal is nowhere near being met. In 2016, the female employment rate reach 48.9%, being one of the leading countries regarding economic key factors, showing a very low unemployment rate compared to other major industrial and emerging countries. In order to encourage women get their job, there is in-house babysitting service for the employee essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fewjapan.com/|title=FEW: For Empowering Women in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Economy ====
Women participation in the labour force in the early development process indicates that they had a much larger role to play in the development process of Japan, which brought about such high economic growth in a short period of time. In the context of the broader debate over whether economic development expands or restricts women's economic opportunities and status, Japan  illustrates that the employment patterns of married women and the degree of gender equality is not similar to that of the industrialised west. The association between women's higher education attainment and labour market participation after marriage, which can be observed in the US and most other industrialised societies, is weak for Japan largely due to the cultural and institutional factors.  The export-oriented economic growth of Japan, which depended largely on the female reserve labour available at a low cost and used as a buffer to cyclical fluctuations, actually discouraged a large proportion of female workers from job seeking and they retired from the labour market.

===== Capitalism and Politics =====
Japanese women have been participants in a long history of social activism. But their participation in politics and political parties, is a more recent phenomenon. NGOs and other grassroots organisations have provided training, information and assisted with fund-raising to equip women to participate in the leadership positions in politics, especially at the local government levels. However, most political parties still continue to provide only limited leadership opportunities for women. Tokyo’s first female governor Koike Yuriko’s political background is in national politics. Before working the office of Tokyo governor, she was a member of the long-ruling government party, the Liberal Democratic Party, and had a seat in the national legislative assembly. She was influential in the preparation of policies to better utilise women’s labour largely as a strategy of improving the economy, so her commitment to “women’s empowerment” is unquestionable. She is interested in encouraging women to participate more in the workforce and take an active part in the capitalist economy.

===== Education =====
In the past, during the early stage of building modern education system, educational opportunities for girls were considerably disadvantaged. The attendance rate of girls were particularly low in the compulsory elementary school. Limited opportunities for girls to access secondary school was provided while higher education for women was not even supposed. Japanese government has developed policies and efforts for promoting education for girls and young females and encourage them to study with males. Conditions for women’s education have been gradually improved. As a result, in elementary education, gender gap in schooling was dissolved until the first decade of the 20th century. There is no gender gap in the opportunity for education in Japan recently, difference of enrollment ratios between male and female students in the upper secondary education and higher education levels is scarcely present. Enrollment of female students  in the secondary vocational schools had been increasing gradually.

==== Women’s Role in the Private Sphere ====

===== Family =====
In the past, the head of the household was responsible for finding a marriage partner for the family’s heir. Married women were expected to produce an heir. Traditionally, women are expected to submit to male authority in three ways. When young, she submits to her father; When married, she submits to her husband; When old, she submits to her sons. Motherhood is considered the defining characteristic of a woman. Besides, housework, child care, and elder care each day are daily household taken up by women at home
Thus, a lot of young Japanese women struggle to form their own sense of identity apart from this cultural expectation.

===== Community =====
There are differenet association founded in Japan. For Empowering Women (FEW), Founded in 1981 as an organization for “Foreign Executive Women”, has long been a stable source of support and learning for international women in both the Tokyo and Kansai areas. It is an exceptionally active and ever-growing Tokyo-based nonprofit business and social networking organization whose mission is to “enable internationally-minded women in Japan to achieve their full professional and personal potential.”  FEW organise exciting line-up of personal and professional development workshops and opportunities to support women’s empowerment annually.

Web: http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism&lt;/ref&gt; Egalitarianism is a trend of thought in political philosophy. According to the ''[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]'', the term has two distinct definitions in modern English:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/egalitarianism Egalitarianism – Definition – Merriam-Webster Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; either as a political [[doctrine]] that all people should be treated as equals and have the same [[Political freedom|political]], [[Economic freedom|economic]], [[Social justice|social]] and [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/egalitarianism |title=egalitarianism |author=The American Heritage Dictionary |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a social philosophy advocating the [[Redistribution of income and wealth|removal of economic inequalities among people]], [[economic egalitarianism]], or the [[Decentralization|decentralization of power]]. Some sources define egalitarianism as the point of view that equality reflects the natural state of humanity.&lt;ref name=gawdy&gt;{{cite book|title=Limited Wants, Unlimited Means: A reader on Hunter-Gatherer Economics and the Environment|author=John Gowdy|year=1998|publisher=Island Press|location=St Louis|isbn=1-55963-555-X|page=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dahlberg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dahlberg, Frances.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eTPULzP1MZAC&amp;pg=PA120|title=Woman the Gatherer|location=London|publisher=Yale university press|year=1975|isbn=0-300-02989-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, D. &amp; Whiten, A. (1996) "Egalitarianism and Machiavellian Intelligence in Human Evolution" in Mellars, P. &amp; Gibson, K. (eds) Modeling the Early Human Mind. Cambridge MacDonald Monograph Series.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forms ==
Some specifically focused egalitarian concerns include [[communism]], [[Equality before the law|legal egalitarianism]], [[luck egalitarianism]], [[political egalitarianism]], [[Gender equality|gender egalitarianism]], [[racial equality]], [[equality of outcome]] and [[Christian egalitarianism]]. Common forms of egalitarianism include political and philosophical.

=== Legal egalitarianism ===
{{details|equality before the law}}
One argument is that [[liberalism]] provides democratic societies with the means to carry out civic reform by providing a framework for developing public policy and thus providing the right conditions for individuals to achieve civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Rosales, José María. "Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy." 20th World Contress on Philosophy: Political Philosophy. Web: 12 March 2010. [http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Poli/PoliRosa.htm Liberalism, Civic Reformism and Democracy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Equality of person ====
The [[Bill of Rights 1689|English Bill of Rights of 1689]] and the [[United States Constitution]] use only the term "person" in operative language involving fundamental rights and responsibilities, except for (a) a reference to "men" in the English Bill of Rights regarding men on trial for treason; and (b) a rule of  proportional Congressional representation in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]].

As the rest of the Constitution, in its operative language the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] uses the term "person" stating, for example, that "[...] nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".

==== Equality of men and women in rights and responsibilities ====
An example of this form is the [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014]] which provides that "men and women shall be equal in their rights and duties".

==== Gender equality ====
The motto "''[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]''" was used during the [[French Revolution]] and is still used as an official motto of the French government. The 1789 [[Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] French Constitution is framed also with this basis in equal rights of mankind.

The [[Declaration of Independence of the United States]] is an example of an assertion of equality of men, the wording of "men" and "man" is a reference to both men and women i.e. "mankind" [[all men are created equal]]". [[John Locke]] is sometimes considered the founder of this form.

Many state constitutions in the United States also use "rights of man" language rather than "rights of person" since the noun "man" has always been a reference to and an inclusion of both men and women.{{citation needed|reason= sources needed both for the "always" bit and that it is the reason state constutions chose to say man rather than persons|date=June 2018}}

It is generally accepted by egalitarians that feminism falls under egalitarianism and that some feminists identify themselves as egalitarian which under the correct definition of the word is equality for both men and women.

=== Social egalitarianism ===
At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[social anarchism]], [[libertarian socialism]], [[left-libertarianism]], and [[progressivism]], some of which propound [[economic egalitarianism]]. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among [[intellectualism|intellectuals]] and in the general populations of many countries. However, whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice remains a controversial question. Anti-egalitarianism&lt;ref&gt;Sidanius, Jim, et al. "Social dominance orientation, anti‐egalitarianism and the political psychology of gender: an extension and cross‐cultural replication." European Journal of Social Psychology 30.1 (2000): 41-67.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[elitism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://englishthesaurus.net/antonym/egalitarian/ |title=Antonyms for egalitarian |last= |first= |date= |website=English Thesaurus |publisher= |access-date=28 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is opposition to egalitarianism.

{{anchor|Finance|Financial|Economics|Economic egalitarianism}}

==== Economic ====
A very early example of equality of what might be described as outcome economic egalitarianism is the Chinese philosophy of [[agriculturalism]], which held that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian self sufficiency.&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last=Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011|page=38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[socialism]], [[social ownership]] of [[means of production]] is sometimes considered to be a form of economic egalitarianism because in an economy characterized by social ownership, the [[surplus product]] generated by industry would accrue to the population as a whole as opposed to a class of private owners, thereby granting each individual increased autonomy and greater equality in their relationships with one another. Although the economist [[Karl Marx]] is sometimes mistaken to be an egalitarian, Marx eschewed normative theorizing on moral principles altogether. However, Marx did have a theory of the evolution of moral principles in relation to specific [[economic system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/egalitarianism/#KarMarEquRig|title=Egalitarianism|author=|date=16 August 2002|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American economist [[John Roemer]] has put forth a new perspective of equality and its relationship to socialism. Roemer attempts to reformulate Marxist analysis to accommodate normative principles of [[distributive justice]], shifting the argument for socialism away from purely technical and materialist reasons to one of distributive justice. Roemer argues that according to the principle of distributive justice, the traditional definition of socialism based on the principle that individual compensation be [[To each according to his contribution|proportional to the value of the labour one expends in production]] is inadequate. Roemer concludes that egalitarians must reject socialism as it is classically defined in order for equality to be realized.&lt;ref name="Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions, 2008"&gt;''Socialism vs Social Democracy as Income-Equalizing Institutions'', by Roemer, John. 2008. Eastern Economic Journal, vol. 34, issue 1, pp. 14–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egalitarianism and non-human animals ===
Many philosophers, including Ingmar Persson,&lt;ref&gt;Persson, I. (1993) “A basis for (interspecies) equality”, in Cavalieri, P. &amp; Singer, P. (eds.) The Great Ape Project, New York: St. Martin’s Press, pp. 183-193.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Vallentyne]],&lt;ref&gt;Vallentyne, P. (2005) “Of mice and men: Equality and animals”, Journal of Ethics, 9, pp. 403-433.&lt;/ref&gt; Nils Holtug,&lt;ref&gt;Holtug, N. (2007) “Equality for animals,” in Ryberg, J.; Petersen, T. S. &amp; Wolf, C. (eds.) New waves in applied ethics, Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Gompertz]]&lt;ref&gt;Gompertz, L. (1997 [1824]) Moral inquiries on the situation of man and of brutes, London: Open Gate.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that egalitarianism implies that the interests of non-human animals must be taken into account as well. Philosopher Oscar Horta has further argued that "Egalitarianism implies rejecting [[speciesism]], and in practice it prescribes ceasing to exploit nonhuman animals" and that we should aid [[wild animal suffering|animals suffering in nature]].&lt;ref name="Horta2014"&gt;Horta, Oscar (2014) "Egalitarianism and Animals," Between the Species: Vol. 19: Iss. 1, Article 5.
Available at: http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/bts/vol19/iss1/5&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Horta argues that "because [nonhuman animals] are worse off in comparison to humans, egalitarianism prescribes giving priority to the interests of nonhuman animals."&lt;ref name="Horta2014" /&gt;

=== Religious and spiritual egalitarianism ===
==== Sikhism ====
The [[Sikhism|Sikh]] faith was founded upon egalitarian principles, reaffirming the notion of equality not only based upon race, but also between the genders. This equality led to denunciation of [[Sati (practice)|sati]], the practice of widows sacrificing themselves on the [[Pyre|funeral pyres]] of deceased husband, but which actually occurred due to the wives of warriors preferring to commit self-immolation over becoming the bounty of war for the Central Asians that were waging wars in India and Afghanistan during the early Ghazni wars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} The scriptural injunction is often ascribed as providing women in the Sikh faith equal rights to practice their faith and be regarded as created equal in the eyes of God. Whilst the noble premise to strive for egalitarianism, many Sikhs still practice strong tribal casteism, with greater rigidity than the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] archetype from which the practice was inherited.&lt;ref name="Darshan, S. T 2013"&gt;Darshan, S. T. "7 Sikhism and development: a perfect match?." Handbook of Research on Development and Religion (2013): 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the rhetoric of equality, scholars have "found contradictions in the Sikh rhetoric of equality and widespread discrimination against Sikh's of low castes".&lt;ref name="Darshan, S. T 2013"/&gt; Furthermore, despite many Sikh scholars decreeing the egalitarian tenets of Sikhism, denouncing sexism, female infanticide, dowry, sati or the condemning of widows to a life of solitude and isolation—the reality is these practices have remained prevalent whilst they have long fallen out of favour with the other ethnocultural religious groups in the Indian continent, like [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Jainism|Jains]].&lt;ref&gt;Singh, I. J. "What sikhism says about gender and sex." International Sikh Conferences. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Christianity ====
{{Main|Christian egalitarianism|Christian communism|Christian universalism}}
The [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarian]] view holds that the [[Bible]] teaches the fundamental equality of people of all racial and ethnic mixes, all economic classes and all age groups, but within the teachings and example of [[Jesus Christ]], [[God in Christianity|God]] and the overarching principles of scripture.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. {{ISBN|0-664-24195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the wide range of [[Christianity]] there are dissenting views to this from opposing groups, some of which are [[Complementarianism|complementarians]]. There are many{{who|date=June 2018}} that say that the Bible encourages equality and also encourages law and order and social structure (for example, parents having authority over their children and husbands authority over their wives). These ideas are considered by some{{who|date=June 2018}} to be contrary to the ideals of egalitarianism.

==== Judaism ====
[[Judaism]] is a [[Universalism|universalist]] religion due to the belief that one God created the entire universe. A further distinction has to be made however. Judaism teaches that [[Jews]] (defined as either the biological descendants of [[Jacob]] "Israel", the son of Isaac and grandson of [[Abraham]] or someone who converted) have a specific covenant with [[God in Judaism|God]] as a [[chosen people]] ([[Deutoronomy]] 7:6 "chosen as God's [[Jews as the chosen people|treasured people]]") to serve as an example of [[Divine light|God's light]] to the rest of the world. The oral Torah and [[Rabbinic literature]] codified in the [[Talmud]] makes key distinctions in religious and legal contexts between Jews and the [[gentile]]s (literally, "the nations"). However, Judaism teaches that all people are the creations of God and are commanded in the seven universal moral laws known as the [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. In this aspect, Judaism is universalist in its divine message, but not in its religious obligations. In [[Reform Judaism|reform]] and [[conservative Judaism]], egalitarian refers to nullification of religious gender separations. [[Synagogue]]s that identify as egalitarian allow mixed seating (i.e. no [[mechitza]]) and allow women to lead [[Jewish prayer|services]] with men in attendance as well as read publicly from the [[Torah]].

==== Islam ====
The [[Islam]]ic stance on equality stresses that all humans are equal in the eyes of God, regardless of gender, class and race. The [[Quran]] states: "O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted".  Louise Marlow's ''Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought'' compares the egalitarianism of early Islam to current practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/4311272?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104297963707 |title=Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought by Louise Marlow |last1=Poonawala |first1=Ismail K. |date=Summer 1999 |website=www.jstor.org |publisher=Iranian Studies Vol. 32, No. 3 (Summer, 1999), pp. 405–407|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern egalitarianism theory ===
Modern egalitarianism is a theory that rejects the classic definition of egalitarianism as a possible achievement economically, politically and socially. Modern egalitarianism theory (or&amp;nbsp; "new egalitarianism") outlines that if everyone had the same opportunity cost, then there would be no comparative advances and no one would gain from trading with each other. In essence, the immense gains people receive from trading with each other arise because they are unequal in characteristics and talents—these differences may be innate or developed so that people can gain from trading with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.millenium.itesm.mx/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=8&amp;sid=f2c02b96-fed4-4085-a57d-9fef664ae057%40sessionmgr101|title=Egalitarianism:Fair and Equal? New Thinking on Egalitarianism|last=Whaples|first=Robert M.|date=2017|website=The Independent Review|archive-url=http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_22_1_01_whaples.pdf|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception {{anchor|criticisms}} ==
The [[cultural theory of risk]] holds egalitarianism as defined by (1) a negative attitude towards rules and principles; and (2) a positive attitude towards group decision-making, with [[fatalism]] termed as its opposite.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"/&gt; The theory distinguishes between [[hierarchy|hierarchists]], who are positive towards both rules and groups; and egalitarianists, who are positive towards groups, but negative towards rules.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"&gt;Thompson et al., ''Cultural Theory'' (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; This is by definition a form of "anarchist equality" as referred to by [[Alexander Berkman|Berkman]]. The fabric of an "egalitarianist society" is thus held together by cooperation and implicit [[peer pressure]] rather than by explicit rules and punishment. However, Thompson et al. theorise that any society consisting of only one perspective, be it egalitarianist, hierarchist, [[Individualism|individualist]], [[fatalist]] or [[Autonomism|autonomist]], will be inherently unstable: the claim is that an interplay between all these perspectives are required if each perspective is to be fulfilling. For instance, although an individualist according to cultural theory is aversive towards both principles and groups, individualism is not fulfilling if individual brilliance cannot be recognised by groups, or if individual brilliance cannot be made permanent in the form of principles.&lt;ref name="Thompson 1990"/&gt; Accordingly, egalitarianists have no power except through their presence, unless they (by definition, reluctantly) embrace principles which enable them to cooperate with fatalists and hierarchists. They will also have no individual sense of direction in the absence of a group. This could be mitigated by following individuals outside their group: autonomists or individualists.

[[Alexander Berkman]] suggests that "equality does not mean an equal amount but equal opportunity [...] Do not make the mistake of identifying equality in liberty with the forced equality of the convict camp. True anarchist equality implies freedom, not quantity. It does not mean that every one must eat, drink, or wear the same things, do the same work, or live in the same manner. Far from it: the very reverse in fact [...] Individual needs and tastes differ, as appetites differ. It is equal opportunity to satisfy them that constitutes true equality [...] Far from levelling, such equality opens the door for the greatest possible variety of activity and development. For human character is diverse".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berkman ''What is Anarchism?'' pp. 164–165.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marxism ===
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] believed that a revolution would bring about a [[Socialism|socialist]] society which would then eventually give way to a [[Communism|communist]] stage of social development, which would be a classless, stateless, humane society erected on common ownership and the principle of "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs".

However, [[Marxism]] rejected egalitarianism in the sense of greater equality between classes, clearly distinguishing it from the socialist notion of the abolition of classes based on the division between workers and owners of productive property. Marx's view of classlessness was not the subordination of society to a universal interest (such as a universal notion of "equality"), but was about the creation of the conditions that would enable individuals to pursue their true interests and desires—thus Marx's notion of [[communist society]] is radically individualistic.&lt;ref name="Karl Marx on Equality"&gt;''Karl Marx on Equality'', by Woods, Allen. http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/19808/Allen-Wood-Marx-on-Equality.pdf: "Marx thinks the idea of equality is actually a vehicle for bourgeois class oppression, and something quite different from the communist goal of the abolition of classes&amp;nbsp;... A society that has transcended class antagonisms, therefore, would not be one in which some truly universal interest at last reigns, to which individual interests must be sacrificed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx was a proponent of two principles, the first applied to socialism and the second to an advanced communist society: "[[To each according to his contribution]]" and "[[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|From each according to their ability, to each according to their needs]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;". Although Marx's position is often confused or conflated with distributive egalitarianism in which only the goods and services resulting from production are distributed according to a notional equality, in reality Marx eschewed the entire concept of equality as abstract and bourgeois in nature, preferring to focus on more concrete principles such as opposition to exploitation on materialist grounds and economic logic.&lt;ref name="Rejecting Egalitarianism, 1987"&gt;''Rejecting Egalitarianism'', by Nielsen, Kai. 1987. Political Theory, Vol. 15, No. 3 (Aug., 1987), pp. 411–423.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Float glass''' is a sheet of [[glass]] made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, typically [[tin]], although [[lead]] and various low [[melting point]] alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Step-by-step Manufacturing of Float Glass|url=http://www.pilkington.com/pilkington-information/about+pilkington/education/float+process/step+by+step.htm|publisher=Pilkington|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Modern [[window]]s are made from float glass. Most float glass is [[soda-lime glass]], but relatively minor quantities of specialty [[borosilicate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.schott.com/hometech/english/products/borofloat/index.html|title=Borosilikatglas BOROFLOAT® {{!}} SCHOTT AG|website=www.schott.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[flat panel display]] glass are also produced using the float glass process.&lt;ref&gt;Not all flat panel display glass is produced by the float glass process. The company [[Corning Incorporated|Corning]] is using the [[Overflow downdraw method|overflow downdraw technique]], while [[Schott Glass|Schott]] uses the float glass technique (see [http://www.schott.com/fpd/english/lcd_glass/index.html Schott website]).&lt;/ref&gt; The float glass process is also known as the '''Pilkington process''', named after the British glass manufacturer [[Pilkington]], which pioneered the technique (invented by Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]]) in the 1950s at their production site in [[St Helens, Merseyside]].

== History ==
[[File:windowfloatnofloat.jpg|thumb|right|Old [[window]] containing a single sheet of float glass in the upper left section, [[Jena]], [[Germany]]. The remaining sections are possibly not float glass as indicated by the distorted reflections of a tree.]]
Until the 16th century, window glass or [[flat glass]] was generally cut from large discs (or rondels) of [[crown glass (window)|crown glass]]. Larger sheets of glass were made by [[glassblowing|blowing]] large [[Cylinder blown sheet|cylinders]] which were cut open and flattened, then cut into panes. Most window glass in the early 19th century was made using the [[cylinder method]]. The 'cylinders' were {{convert|6|to|8|ft|cm}} long and {{convert|10|to|14|in|cm}} in diameter, limiting the width that panes of glass could be cut, and resulting in windows divided by transoms into rectangular panels.

The first advances in automating glass manufacturing were patented in 1848 by [[Henry Bessemer]], an [[England|English]] [[engineer]].&lt;ref&gt;Bessemer, Henry ; British patent no. 12,101 (issued: Sept. 22, 1848).&lt;/ref&gt; His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing. If the glass could be set on a perfectly smooth, flat body, like the surface of an open pan of calm liquid, this would reduce costs considerably. Attempts were made to form flat glass on a bath of molten tin—one of the few liquids denser than glass that would be calm at the high temperatures needed to make glass—most notably in the US. Several patents were granted,&lt;ref&gt;See:

Hitchcock, [http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=00789911&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect2%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526d%3DPALL%2526S1%3D0789911.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F789911%2526RS%3DPN%2F789911&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page "Apparatus for manufacturing glass sheets or plates,"] U.S. patent no. 789,911 (filed:  July 30, 1902; issued:  May 16, 1905).&lt;/ref&gt; but this process was unworkable at the time.

Before the development of float glass, larger sheets of plate glass were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an [[iron]] surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of plate glass was passed through a lengthy series of inline grinders and polishers, reducing glass losses and cost.

Glass of lower quality, drawn glass, was made by drawing upwards from a pool of molten glass a thin sheet, held at the edges by rollers. As it cooled the rising sheet stiffened and could then be cut. The two surfaces were of lower quality i.e. not as smooth or uniform as those of float glass. This process continued in use for many years after the development of float glass.

Between 1953 and 1957, Sir [[Alastair Pilkington]] and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten [[tin]] bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rspa.1969.0212 | title = Review Lecture.

In 1964, CH3 Tank, the first purpose-built float line in the world, was built after the conversion of CH4 Tank. CH1 Tank closed down in 1977 as CH2 Float Line started up. The Pilkington's production line at Cowley Hill, St Helens, the birthplace of float glass, is no longer in operation as of 2014 although Pilkington continue to operate other float glass facilities within the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Pilkington boss on Cowley Hill : 'Float glass production losing tens of millions' |url=http://www.sthelensstar.co.uk/news/10794410.Pilks_boss___Float_glass_production_losing_tens_of_millions_/?ref=rl |newspaper=St Helens Star |location=St Helens |date=7 November 2013 |access-date=8 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==
[[File:Floatglasanlage.jpg|thumb|Float glas line]]
Float glass uses common glass-making [[Glass#Glass ingredients|raw materials]], typically consisting of [[sand]], soda ash ([[sodium carbonate]]), [[dolomite]], [[limestone]], and salt cake ([[sodium sulfate]]) etc. Other materials may be used as colourants, [[refining (glass)|refining]] agents or to adjust the physical and chemical properties of the glass. The raw materials are mixed in a [[glass batch|batch]] process, then fed together with suitable [[cullet]] (waste glass), in a controlled ratio, into a furnace where it is heated to approximately 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. Common flat glass furnaces are 9&amp;nbsp;m wide, 45&amp;nbsp;m long, and contain more than 1200&amp;nbsp;tons of glass. Once molten, the temperature of the glass is stabilised to approximately 1200&amp;nbsp;°C to ensure a homogeneous [[specific gravity]].

The molten glass is fed into a "tin bath", a bath of molten [[tin]] (about 3–4&amp;nbsp;m wide, 50&amp;nbsp;m long, 6&amp;nbsp;cm deep), from a delivery canal and is poured into the tin bath by a ceramic lip known as the spout lip.&lt;ref name=ullmann&gt;B. H. W. S. de Jong, "Glass"; in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''; 5th edition, vol. A12, VCH Publishers, Weinheim, Germany, 1989, {{ISBN|3-527-20112-2}}, pp. 365–432.&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of glass allowed to pour onto the molten tin is controlled by a gate called a ''tweel''.

Tin is suitable for the float glass process because it has a high specific gravity, is cohesive, and is [[immiscible]] with molten glass. Tin, however, [[Redox|oxidises]] in a natural atmosphere to form [[tin dioxide]] (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the tin bath is provided with a [[positive pressure]] protective atmosphere of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]].

The glass flows onto the tin surface forming a floating ribbon with perfectly smooth surfaces on both sides and of even thickness. As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100&amp;nbsp;°C until at approximately 600&amp;nbsp;°C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.

Once off the bath, the glass sheet passes through a [[lehr (glassmaking)|lehr kiln]] for approximately 100&amp;nbsp;m, where it is cooled gradually so that it [[Annealing (glass)|anneals]] without strain and does not crack from the temperature change. On exiting the "cold end" of the kiln, the glass is cut by machines.

==Uses==
[[File:Green color of float glass.jpg|thumb|A float glass light fitting. Ordinary float glass is green in thicker sheets due to [[Fe2+]] impurities.]]
Today, float glass is the most widely used form of glass in consumer products. Due to both its high quality with no additional polishing required and its structural flexibility during production, it can easily be shaped and bent into a variety of forms while in a heated, syrupy state. This makes it ideal for a variety of applications such as

* Automobile glass (e.g. windshields, windows, mirrors)
* Mirrors
* Furniture (e.g. in tables and shelves)
* Insulated glass
* Windows and doors

Most forms of specialized glass such as [[toughened glass]], [[frosted glass]], laminated safety glass and soundproof glass consist of standard float glass that has been further processed.

==Market==
As of 2009, the world float glass market, not including China and Russia, is dominated by the four companies: [[Asahi Glass]], [[Nippon Sheet Glass|NSG]]/[[Pilkington]], [[Saint-Gobain]], and [[Guardian Industries]]. Other companies include Sise Cam AS, [[PPG Industries|PPG]], Central Glass, Hankuk (HanGlas), Zeledyne, and Cardinal Glass Industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructiondigital.com/Flat-glass-market-be-39-million-tons-2010_811 "Flat glass market to be 39 million tons by 2010"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fresh water''' (or '''freshwater''') is  any naturally occurring [[water]] except seawater and [[brackish water]]. Fresh water includes water in [[ice sheet]]s, [[ice cap]]s, [[glacier]]s, [[iceberg]]s, [[bog]]s, [[pond]]s, [[lake]]s, [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, and even underground water called [[groundwater]]. Fresh water is generally characterized by having low [[concentration]]s of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] and other [[total dissolved solids]]. Though the term specifically excludes [[seawater]] and [[brackish water]], it does include mineral-rich waters such as [[chalybeate]] springs. 

Fresh water is not the same as [[drinking water|potable water]] (or drinking water). Much of the earth's fresh water (on the surface and groundwater) is unsuitable for drinking without some treatment. Fresh water can easily become [[Water pollution|polluted by human activities]] or due to naturally occurring processes, such as erosion.

Water is critical to the survival of all living organisms. Some organisms can thrive on salt water, but the great majority of higher plants and most [[mammal]]s need fresh water to live. 

==Definitions==
=== Numerical definition ===
Fresh water can be defined as water with less than 500 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of dissolved [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.groundwater.org/gi/gwglossary.html#F | title=Groundwater Glossary | date=27 March 2006 | accessdate=14 May 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428102341/http://www.groundwater.org/gi/gwglossary.html#F | archivedate=28 April 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fresh water habitats are classified as either [[lake ecosystem|lentic systems]], which are the still-waters including [[pond]]s, lakes, [[swamp]]s and [[Bog|mire]]s ; [[lotic]] which are running-water systems; or [[groundwater]]s which flow in rocks and [[aquifer]]s. There is, in addition, a zone which bridges between groundwater and lotic systems, which is the [[hyporheic zone]], which underlies many larger rivers and can contain substantially more water than is seen in the open channel. It may also be in direct contact with the underlying underground water. 

The majority of fresh water on Earth is in [[ice cap]]s.

== Sources ==
The source of almost all fresh water is [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] from the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], in the form of [[mist]], [[rain]] and [[snow]]. Fresh water falling as mist, rain or snow contains materials dissolved from the [[atmosphere]] and material from the sea and land over which the rain bearing clouds have traveled.  In [[industry|industrialized]] areas rain is typically [[acidic]] because of dissolved oxides of [[sulfur]] and [[nitrogen]] formed from burning of fossil fuels in cars, factories, trains and aircraft and from the atmospheric emissions of industry. In some cases this [[acid rain]] results in [[pollution]] of lakes and rivers.

In coastal areas fresh water may contain significant concentrations of salts derived from the sea if windy conditions have lifted drops of seawater into the rain-bearing clouds. This can give rise to elevated concentrations of [[sodium]], [[chloride]], [[magnesium]] and [[sulfate]] as well as many other compounds in smaller concentrations.

In [[desert]] areas, or areas with impoverished or dusty soils, rain-bearing winds can pick up [[sand]] and [[dust]] and this can be deposited elsewhere in precipitation and causing the freshwater flow to be measurably contaminated both by insoluble solids but also by the soluble components of those soils. Significant quantities of [[iron]] may be transported in this way including the well-documented transfer of iron-rich rainfall falling in Brazil derived from sand-storms in the [[Sahara]] in [[north Africa]].

== Water distribution ==
{{main article|Water distribution on Earth}}

Out of all the water on [[Earth]], saline water in [[ocean]]s, [[sea]]s and saline [[groundwater]] make up about 97% of it. Only 2.5–2.75% is fresh water, including 1.75–2% frozen in [[glacier]]s, [[ice]] and [[snow]], 0.5–0.75% as fresh [[groundwater]] and [[soil]] moisture, and less than 0.01% of it as [[surface water]] in [[lake]]s, [[swamp]]s and [[river]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html Where is Earth's water?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214091601/http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/earthwherewater.html |date=14 December 2013 }}, [[United States Geological Survey]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8b.html Physicalgeography.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126072955/http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8b.html |date=26 January 2016 }}. Physicalgeography.net. Retrieved on 29 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Freshwater lakes contain about 87% of this fresh surface water, including 29% in the [[African Great Lakes]], 22% in [[Lake Baikal]] in Russia, 21% in the [[North American Great Lakes]], and 14% in other lakes. [[Swamp]]s have most of the balance with only a small amount in rivers, most notably the [[Amazon River]]. The atmosphere contains 0.04% water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Gleick |first= Peter |authorlink=Peter Gleick|editor= Stephen H. Schneider |title= Encyclopedia of Climate and Weather|publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 1996|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas with no fresh water on the ground surface, fresh water derived from [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] may, because of its lower density, overlie saline ground water in lenses or layers. Most of the world's fresh water is frozen in [[ice sheet]]s. Many areas suffer from lack of distribution of fresh water, such as deserts.

== Aquatic organisms ==
{{Further|Aquatic animal}}
Water is a critical issue for the survival of all living organisms. Some can use salt water but many organisms including the great majority of higher plants and most [[mammal]]s must have access to fresh water to live. Some terrestrial mammals, especially desert [[rodent]]s appear to survive without drinking but they do generate water through the [[metabolism]] of [[cereal]] seeds and they also have mechanisms to conserve water to the maximum degree.

Fresh water creates a [[Hypotonicity|hypotonic]] environment for aquatic organisms. This is problematic for some organisms with pervious skins or with [[gill]] membranes, whose cell membranes may burst if excess water is not excreted. Some [[protist]]s accomplish this using [[contractile vacuole]]s, while [[freshwater fish]] excrete excess water via the [[kidney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/V/VertebrateKidneys.html | title=Vertebrate Kidneys | date=3 November 2002 | accessdate=14 May 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060429045409/http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/V/VertebrateKidneys.html | archivedate=29 April 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most aquatic organisms have a limited ability to regulate their [[osmotic]] balance and therefore can only live within a narrow range of salinity, [[diadromous]] [[fish]] have the ability to [[Fish migration|migrate]] between fresh water and [[seawater|saline]] water bodies. During these migrations they undergo changes to adapt to the surroundings of the changed salinities; these processes are hormonally controlled. The [[eel]] (''[[Anguilla anguilla]]'') uses the [[hormone]] [[prolactin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalujnaia|first=S.|author2=et. al.|year=2007|title=Salinity adaptation and gene profiling analysis in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) using microarray technology|journal= Gen Comp Endocrinol.|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information|issue=2007|pages=274–80|pmid=17324422|doi=10.1016/j.ygcen.2006.12.025|volume=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[salmon]] (''Salmo salar'') the hormone [[cortisol]] plays a key role during this process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bisal|first=G.A.|author2=Specker, J.L.|date=24 January 2006|title=Cortisol stimulates hypo-osmoregulatory ability in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L|journal=Journal of Fish Biology |publisher=Wiley|volume=39|issue=3|pages=421–432|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1991.tb04373.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[sea bird]]s have special glands at the base of the bill through which excess salt is excreted. Similarly the [[marine iguana]]s on the [[Galápagos Islands]] excrete excess salt through a nasal gland and they sneeze out a very salty excretion.

[[Freshwater mollusc]]s include [[freshwater snails]] and [[freshwater bivalve]]s. Freshwater crustaceans include [[freshwater crab]]s and [[crayfish]].

==Problems==

=== Limited resource ===
{{Main|Water scarcity}}

Fresh water is a renewable and variable, but finite natural resource.  Fresh water can only be replenished through the process of the water cycle,in which water from seas, lakes, forests, land, rivers, and [[reservoirs]] evaporates, forms clouds, and returns as precipitation. Locally however, if more fresh water is consumed through human activities than is naturally restored, this may result in reduced fresh water availability from surface and underground sources and can cause serious damage to surrounding and associated environments.

Fresh and unpolluted water accounts for 0.003% of total water available globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Water is not an infinite resource and the world is thirsty|first=Gianfranco|last=Nitti|date=May 2011|newspaper=The Italian Insider|page=8|location=Rome}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in the world population and the increase in per capita water use puts increasing strains on the finite resources availability of clean fresh water. The World Bank adds that the response by freshwater ecosystems to a changing climate can be described in terms of three interrelated components: water quality, water quantity or volume, and water timing. A change in one often leads to shifts in the others as well.&lt;ref&gt;The World Bank, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi |title=Water and Climate Change: Understanding the Risks and Making Climate-Smart Investment Decisions |pages=19–22 |accessdate=24 October 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407105752/http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/water-and-climate-change-understanding-risks-and-making-climate-smart-investment-decisi/ |archivedate=7 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water pollution]] and subsequent [[eutrophication]]  also reduces the availability of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/indicators/nutrients-in-freshwater/nutrients-in-freshwater-assessment-published-6 "Nutrients in fresh water"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many areas of the world are already experiencing stress on water availability (or water scarcity). Due to the accelerated pace of population growth and an increase in the amount of water a single person uses, it is expected that this situation will continue to get worse. A shortage of water in the future would be detrimental to the [[human population]] as it would affect everything from sanitation, to overall health and the production of grain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/water_cities.shtml "Fresh Water in the Future"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230010235/http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/water_cities.shtml |date=30 December 2016 }}.

===Minimum streamflow===
An important concern for hydrological ecosystems is securing minimum [[streamflow]], especially preserving and restoring [[Instream use|instream water allocations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The world's water, 2006–2007: the biennial report on freshwater resources |author1=Peter Gleick |authorlink1=Peter Gleick|author2=Heather Cooley |author3=David Katz  |year=2006 |publisher=Island Press |isbn= 1-59726-106-8|pages=29–31 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Lttb1qPh4Z8C|accessdate=12 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fresh water is an important natural resource necessary for the survival of all [[ecosystem]]s.  The use of water by humans for activities such as irrigation and industrial applications can have adverse impacts on down-stream ecosystems.  

Fresh water withdrawal is the quantity of water removed from available sources for use in any purpose, excluding evaporation losses.
Water drawn off is not necessarily entirely consumed and some portion may be returned for further use downstream.

===Water pollution===
{{Main|Water pollution}}
[[Water pollution|Pollution]] from human activity, including oil spills and also presents a problem for freshwater resources.  The largest [[petroleum]] spill that has ever occurred in fresh water was caused by a [[Royal Dutch Shell]] tank ship in Magdalena, [[Argentina]], on 15 January 1999, polluting the environment, drinkable water, plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.petroleomagdalena.com Petroleomagdalena.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514095121/http://www.petroleomagdalena.com/ |date=14 May 2010 }}. Petroleomagdalena.com (15 January 1999). Retrieved on 29 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical contamination of fresh water can also seriously damage eco-systems.

== Human uses ==

=== Agriculture ===
Water used for agriculture is called ''agricultural water'' or ''[[farm water]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = USDA Economic Research Service - Irrigation &amp; Water Use|url = http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use.aspx|website = www.ers.usda.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151115155026/http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use.aspx|archive-date = 2015-11-15|dead-url = no|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing landscape for the use of agriculture has a great effect on the flow of fresh water. Changes in landscape by the removal of trees and [[soil]]s changes the flow of fresh water in the local environment and also affects the cycle of fresh water. As a result, more fresh water is stored in the soil which benefits agriculture. However, since agriculture is the [[human]] activity that consumes the most fresh water,&lt;ref name="Gordon"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gordon L., D. M. |year=2003|title= Land cover change and water vapour flows: learning from Australia|volume= 358 |issue=1440|pages= 1973–1984|doi=10.1098/rstb.2003.1381 |jstor=3558315|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |pmid=14728792 |pmc=1693281}}&lt;/ref&gt; this can put a severe strain on local freshwater resources resulting in the destruction of local ecosystems. 

In Australia,  over-abstraction of fresh water for intensive [[irrigation]] activities has caused 33% of the land area to be at risk of salination.&lt;ref name="Gordon" /&gt; With regards to agriculture, the [[World Bank]] targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that will foster debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options |title=Reengaging in Agricultural Water Management: Challenges and Options |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=30 October 2011 |pages=4–5 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105012930/http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options/ |archivedate=5 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Functional assessment''' is an ongoing process collecting information to understand the reason under a problem or target behavior. The function of the assessment is to prove and aid the effectiveness of the interventions or [[Therapy|treatments]] used to help eliminate the problem behavior. Through functional assessments we have learned that there are complex [[patterns]] to people's seemingly unproductive behaviors. It is important to not only pay attention to consequences that follow the behavior but also the antecedent that [[evokes]] the behavior. More work needs to be done in the future with functional assessment including balancing precision and [[efficiency]], being more specific with variables involved and a more smooth transition from assessment to intervention.&lt;ref name= "JABA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=Robert H|title=Functional Assessment: Contributions and Future Directions|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|issue=2|pages=401–404|pmc=1297816|pmid=16795831|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Functional assessment is a method developed by [[applied behavior analysis]] to identify the [[variable (research)|variable]]s that maintain a [[problem]] [[behavior]]. Behavior is [[lawful]]. Whether it is desirable or undesirable, behavior is controlled by environmental variables. Behavior is a function of the [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] and [[Operant conditioning|consequences]] that make up the three-term contingency. Functional assessment is the process of gathering information about the antecedent [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] and consequences functional to the problem behavior. It attempts to provide an explanation to why the problem behavior may be occurring. The information about the antecedent stimuli may include the [[time]] and place, the presence of others and the [[frequency]]. The information collected helps identify which of the antecedent and consequences are maintaining the behavior. The information collected from functional assessment can also help develop appropriate treatments for the target behavior. Stimulus that may have been found to be [[reinforcing]] for the original behavior could be transferred to reinforce a more appropriate behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harris|first=Sandra L|title=Functional Assessment|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=April 2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=233|doi=10.1023/a:1022968200344}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 July 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MMPP"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miltenberger|first=Raymond G|title=Behavior Modification Principles &amp; Procedures|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=United States|isbn=978-1-111-30611-3|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions of problem behavior==
The purpose of conducting a functional assessment is to identify the function of the target behavior. There are four main classes of functions of problem behavior.&lt;ref name= "Siebert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siebert|first=Carol|title=Functional Assessment: Process and Product|journal=Home Health Care Management &amp; Practice|date=December 2006|volume=19|issue=1|pages=51–57|url=http://query.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/search/q?kw=functional+assessment&amp;facet[0]=addFacetValueFilters(ContentType,Journal+Article)|accessdate=5 August 2012|doi=10.1177/1084822306292516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social positive reinforcement===
Social positive reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[positive reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. This is include the giving of [[attention]], fun activities or goods and services provided by the person. An example of social positive reinforcement would be Max's mother ([[social]]) dropping what she is doing and provide attention (positive reinforcement) to her son when he engages in head banging on the wall (problem behavior).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Social negative reinforcement===
Social negative reinforcement is when another person delivers a [[negative reinforcement]] after the problem behavior occurs. The person may terminate an aversive stimuli (interaction, task or activity) and the behavior is more likely to be maintained. An example of social negative reinforcement would be Max complains (problem behavior) to his parents (social) when he is asked to do chores, as a result, his parents allows him to escape the task (negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic positive reinforcement===
Automatic positive reinforcement is when a positive reinforcement occurs [[Automation|automatically]] and is not mediated by another person. The behavior is strengthened by an automatic reinforcing consequence. An example of automatic positive reinforcement would be an [[autistic]] child waving his hands in front of his face (problem behavior) because the [[sensory perception|sensory]] stimulation (automatic positive reinforcement) produced is reinforcing for the child.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Automatic negative reinforcement===
Automatic negative reinforcement is when a negative reinforcement occurs automatically reducing or eliminating an aversive stimulus as a reinforcing consequence of the behavior. A popular example of automatic negative reinforcement would be [[binge eating]]. Binge eating (problem behavior) had been found to temporarily reduce any unpleasant emotions the person may be experiencing before the binge (automatic negative reinforcement).&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Assessment methods==
There are various different methods used to conduct functional assessment, all of which falls into three distinct categories.&lt;ref name= "Furniss"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furniss|first=Frederick|title=Assessment Methods|journal=Applied Behavior Analysis for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders|year=2009|volume=10|pages=33–36|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0088-3_3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indirect methods===
Indirect functional assessment methods use behavior interviews or surveys to gather information about the person exhibiting the behavior from themselves others who know this person well. The main advantage of indirect methods is they are easy and cheap to conduct and do not take much time. The main disadvantage of indirect methods is that the people involved are relying on their memories, thus some information may be lost or inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barribeau|first=Paul|title=Advantages and Disadvantages of the Survey Method|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/guides/research/survey/com2d1.cfm|work=Survey Research. Writing@CSU.|publisher=Colorado State University Department of English.|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of their convenience, indirect methods are used most commonly. It is essential assessment to be clear and objective  as this will produce the most accurate answers without interpretation. The goal of the indirect assessment method is to generate information on the antecedent, behavior and consequence that can help generate a hypothesis about the variables that maintains the behavior.

Indirect methods can help develop a [[correlation]] [[hypothesis]] but not a [[functional relationship]].

===Direct observation methods===
Direct observation methods involve is present to [[observe]] and record the problem behavior as it occurs. The goal of direct observation is to record the immediate antecedent and consequences that functions with the problem behavior within a [[natural environment]]. The main advantage of direct observation is that the antecedents and consequences are recorded as it happens instead of recollection of memory. Therefore, the information recorded is generally more accurate. The main disadvantage of direct observation is it requires a considerable amount of time and effort to implement. Another thing about direct observation is, like indirect methods, it can only demonstrate a correlation but not a functional relationship.&lt;ref name= "Furniss" /&gt;

The observer of the direct observation method should be present in the natural environment when the problem behavior is most likely to occur. The observer should also be trained to record the problem behavior and its functional antecedent and consequences immediately, correctly and objectively.

Direct observation can also be can ABC observation. Together with indirect methods, direct and indirect assessments are categorized as descriptive assessment because the antecedent and consequences are described from with memory of events. The information collected aids the development of a hypothesis, but to demonstrate a functional relationship, one must use the experimental method.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

===Experimental methods===
Experimental methods involve manipulating either the antecedent or consequent variables to determine their influence on the problem behavior. This is the only method that can demonstrate a functional relationship between the antecedent stimulus or the reinforcing consequence and the problem behavior. The main advantage of the experimental method is the demonstration of a functional relationship. The main disadvantage of the experimental method is the extensive use of time and effort to create an experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Gregory P|author2=Brian A Iwata |author3=Brandon E McCord |title=Functional analysis of problem behavior: a review.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=Summer 2003|volume=36|issue=2|pages=146–185|pmc=1284431|pmid=12858983|doi=10.1901/jaba.2003.36-147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horner|first=RH|author2=EG Carr |author3=J Halle |author4=G McGee |author5=S Odom |title=The use of single-subject research to identify evidence-based practice in special education|journal=Exceptional children|year=2005|volume=71|issue=2|pages=165|url=http://www.freewebs.com/lowvisionstuff/Single_Subject.pdf|accessdate=8 August 2012 |doi=10.1177/001440290507100203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental methods can also be called experimental analysis or functional analysis.

==Conducting a functional assessment==
A functional assessment should always be conducted before treating a problem behavior. To develop appropriate treatment, one must have the correct information about the antecedents and consequences controlling the behavior because treatment involves manipulating these environmental events to evoke a change in the problem behavior. Here is the proper procedure to correctly implement a functional assessment.&lt;ref name= "JABA" /&gt;

# The first step should start with a '''behavioral interview''' with the client or someone who knows him/her well.
# The interview from the first step should help '''develop a hypothesis''' about which antecedent would produce the behavior and which reinforcing consequence would maintain it.
# Once a hypothesis has been formed, the next step is to '''conduct a direct observation assessment''' in the natural environment. If the data collected from the interview is [[consistent]] with the observation, the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the hypothesis is strengthened.
# With the information from both sources being consistent, '''confirm your initial hypothesis''' to develop appropriate treatment plans for the identified antecedent and consequence.
# If the data collected from the behavioral interview and the information observed from the direct observation is inconsistent, '''conduct further assessments''' such as another interview or continued observation to clear up any of the inconsistencies.
# If after review and extra interviews and further observations, the information collected are still inconsistent, it is time to '''conduct a functional analysis'''. A functional analysis is also need if the information is consistent but can not lead to a conclusive, firm hypothesis about the [[predictably]] of the antecedent and consequence.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

==Functional interventions==
After a function assessment has been conducted with success, the information collected is used to develop appropriate treatments and interventions. Interventions are designed to manipulate the antecedent or/and the consequence of the problem behavior to decrease its occurrence rate and increase the rate of occurrence for more desirable behaviors.&lt;ref name= "Siebert" /&gt;

Functional interventions include [[extinction]], [[differential reinforcement]] and antecedent manipulations. These intervention are functional because they deal with the environmental events that are functional to the problem behavior. They are also nonaversive as punishment is not involved.&lt;ref name= "MMPP" /&gt;

More aversive interventions can be used as  latter resort if previous nonaversive intervention have been tried and shown ineffective. Punishment such as [[time-out (parenting)|time-out]] and response cost are considered [[negative punishment]], which although is still controversial, is more widely accepted than [[positive punishment]] such as overcorrection, contingent exercise, guided compliance and [[physical restraint]]. As mentioned punishment should only be used as a last resort when other methods have already been considered.

==Research==
A lot of [[research]] being done with functional assessment deals with self injurious behaviors of [[mentally challenged]] children or adults and [[autistic]] children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matson|first=Johnny L.|author2=Megan Sipes |author3=Max Horovitz |author4=Julie A. Worley |author5=Mary E. Shoemaker |author6=Alison M. Kozlowski |title=Behaviors and corresponding functions addressed via functional assessment|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|date=January 2011|volume=32|issue=2|pages=625–629|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089142221000301X|accessdate=5 August 2012 |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2010.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr, Newsom and Binkoff conducted an experimental method of functional assessment on the two boys with [[intellectual disabilities]] exhibiting [[aggressive]] behaviors. They hypothesized that their aggressive behaviors were maintained by escape from academic tasks. To test their hypothesis, they set two different experimental conditions; 1. Academic demands were put on the boys, 2. Academic demands were not put on the children. If their hypothesis is true, then the problem behavior should occur much more often in the first condition than the second. Results show that their hypothesis was indeed true as the aggressive behavior occurred at a much higher frequency in the first condition. The researchers concluded that the boy's problem behavior was indeed maintained by the antecedent of academic demands and the consequence of escape from the demands.

Another functional assessment research was done by Iwata in 1982 worked with children with [[developmental disabilities]] showing self injurious behaviors. The research could not conclude what was maintaining their behavior but believed it either adult attention, escape from demands or [[Sensory system|sensory]] stimulation from the injuries. For each of the hypothesis, they created a condition that would fit into the category. For adult attention hypothesis, they created an environment where an adult is in the room with the child but pays no attention to him/her until after the behavior occurs. For the escape from demands hypothesis, they had an adult make a normal demand towards the child, but terminate it if the self injurious behavior occurs. For the sensory stimulation hypothesis, the child is left alone without the presence of anyone or any stimulating activities. Iwata compared the levels of self injurious behaviors across the three conditions and demonstrated that the function of the problem behavior for each child was different. Some wanted attention, others escape while some were maintained by automatic reinforcement. As shown here, it is very important to conduct a functional assessment to determine what exactly is maintaining the behavior before any function interventions are taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iwata|first=Brian A|author2=Michael F.

'''Generalized Environmental Modeling System for Surfacewaters''' or '''GEMSS''' is a [[public domain software]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gemss.com/gemss.html GEMSS] on gmmss.com ''"The model is in the public domain, available on request, and has been used worldwide."''&lt;/ref&gt; application published by ERM. It has been used for hydrological studies throughout the world.&lt;ref name="bortone p24"&gt;Bortone, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
GEMSS has been used for ultimate heat sink analyses at [[Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant]], and [[Arkansas Nuclear One]]. In [[Pennsylvania]] it has been applied at [[PPL Corporation | PPL Corporation's]] [[Brunner Island Steam Electric Station]] on the lower [[Susquehanna River]], [[Exelon | Exelon’s]] Cromby and [[Limerick Generating Station|Limerick]] Generating Stations on the [[Schuylkill River]], and at several other electric power facilities. River applications for electric power facilities have been made on the Susquehanna (Brunner Island), the [[Missouri River|Missouri]](Labadie Power Station), the Delaware (Mercer and Gilbert Generating Station), the Connecticut ([[Connecticut Yankee Nuclear Power Plant]]), and others.

Applications of GEMSS and its individual component modules have been accepted by regulatory agencies in the U.S. and Canada.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} It is the sole hydrodynamic model listed in the model selection tool database{{which|date=March 2016}} for hydrodynamic and chemical fate models that can perform 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D time-variable modeling for most waterbody types, consider all state variables and include the near- and far-fields. GEMSS can also provide GUI’s, grid generation, and GIS linkage tools and has strong documentation.&lt;ref name="water quality models fitzpatrick"&gt;Fitzpatrick, J., et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
GEMSS includes a grid generator and editor, control file generator, 2-D and 3-D post processing viewers, and an animation tool. It uses a [[database]] approach to store and access model results. The database approach is also used for field data; as a result, the GEMSS viewers can be used to display model results, field data or both, a capability useful for understanding the behavior of the prototype as well as for calibrating the model. The field data analysis features can be used independently using GEMSS modeling capability.

===Modeling techniques===
A GEMSS application requires two types of data: (1) spatial data (primarily the waterbody shoreline and [[bathymetry]], but also locations, elevations, and configurations of man-made structures) and (2) temporal data (time-varying [[boundary value|boundary condition]] data defining tidal elevation, inflow rate and temperature, inflow constituent concentration, outflow rate, and meteorological data.&lt;ref name="bortone p24"/&gt; All [[deterministic model]]s, including GEMSS, require uninterrupted time-varying boundary condition data. There can be no long gaps in the datasets and all required datasets must be available during the span of the proposed simulation period.

For input to the model, the spatial data is encoded primarily in two input files: the control and bathymetry files. These files are [[georeferencing|geo-referenced]]. The temporal data is encoded in many files, each file representing a set of time-varying boundary conditions, for example, meteorological data for surface heat exchange and [[wind shear]], or inflow rates for a [[tributary]] stream. Each record in the boundary condition files is stamped with a year-month-day-hour-minute address. The data can be subjected to [[quality assurance]] procedures by using GEMSS to plot, then to visually inspect individual data points, trends and outliers. The set of input files and the GEMSS executable constitute the model application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8457">[[File:Salicornia europaea MS 0802.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''[[Salicornia]] europaea'' (common  glasswort).]]

The '''glassworts''' are various succulent, annual [[halophytes]] plants, that is, plants that thrive in [[saline water|saline]] environments, such as seacoasts and [[salt marshes]]. The original English glasswort plants belong to the [[genus]] ''[[Salicornia]]'', but today the glassworts include halophyte plants from several genera, some of which are native to continents unknown to the medieval English, and growing in ecosystems, such as [[mangrove]] swamps, never envisioned when the term glasswort was coined.

The common name "glasswort" came into use in the 16th century to describe plants growing in England whose ashes could be used for making [[soda ash|soda-based]] (as opposed to [[potash]]-based) [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of ''glasswort''," ''Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition'' (Oxford University Press, 1989). Definition retrieved from [http://www.oed.com online edition] (subscription required) July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Turner, William (1995). ''A New Herball: Parts II and III'', edited by George T. L. Chapman, Frank McCombie, and Anne U. Wesencraft (Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-44549-8}}). This book contains a facsimile of Turner's original 1562 and 1568 volumes, along with an edited transcript. The transcript of Turner's article on Kali (p. 673) includes the sentence "Kali, as I do remember, hath no name in English, and although it be very plenteous in England, yet I never could meet with any man that knew it. But lest this herb should be without a name, it may be called Saltwurt, because it is salt in taste, and Salalkali is made thereof. It may also be called Glas Wede, because the ashes of it serve to make glass."&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Industrial uses==
The ashes of glasswort plants, and also of their Mediterranean counterpart [[saltwort]] plants, yield [[soda ash]], which is an important ingredient for [[glassmaking]] and [[soapmaking]]. Soda ash is an [[alkali]] whose active ingredient is now known to be [[sodium carbonate]]. 
Glasswort and saltwort plants sequester the sodium they absorb from salt water into their tissues (see ''[[Salsola soda]]''). Ashing of the plants converts some of this sodium into [[sodium carbonate]] (or "soda," in one of the old uses of the term).

In the medieval and early post-medieval centuries, various glasswort plants were collected at tidal marshes and other saline places in the Mediterranean region. The collected plants were burned. The resulting ashes were mixed with water. Sodium carbonate is soluble in water. Non-soluble components of the ashes sank to the bottom of the water container. The water with the sodium carbonate dissolved in it was then transferred to another container, and then the water was evaporated off, leaving behind the sodium carbonate. Another major component of the ashes that is soluble in water is potassium carbonate, a.k.a. potash. The resulting product consisted mainly of a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. This product was called "soda ash" (was also called "alkali"). It contained 20% to 30% sodium carbonate. For glassmaking, it was superior to a potash product obtained by the same procedure from the ashes of non-salty plants. If plant ashes were not washed as just described, they were still usable in glassmaking but the results were not as good.

The appearance of the word ''glasswort'' in English is reasonably contemporaneous with a 16th-century resurgence in English glassmaking, which had suffered a long decline after Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Anita (1977). ''Readings in Glass History: No. 8'' (Phoenix Press, Jerusalem,  ASIN B0007BPWYG). Quoted in
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3103401 review] by Haden, H. J. (1973). ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 19, No. 3 pp. 548&amp;ndash;550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurinsky, Samuel (1991).

See also the [http://www.hebrewhistory.info/factpapers.htm web version], retrieved July 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This resurgence was led by glassmakers who emigrated to England from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and from [[Venice]]. The Lorraine glassmakers brought with them the technology of [[forest glass]], the greenish glass that used [[potash]] from wood ashes as a flux. The [[Venetian glass]]makers brought with them the technology of [[cristallo]], the immaculately clear glass that used [[soda ash]] as a flux. These glassmakers would have recognized ''[[Salicornia europaea]]'' growing in England as a source for soda ash. Prior to their arrival, it was said that the plant "hath no name in English."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

By the 18th century, [[Spain]] had an enormous industry producing soda ash from saltworts; the soda ash from this source was known as ''[[barilla|barrilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joaquín Fernández (1998). [https://www.webcitation.org/5W0IroD9s?url=http://www.ucm.es/info/antilia/revista/vol4-en/ant4-1-en.htm "From the barrilla to the Solvay factory in Torrelavega: The Manufacture of Saltwort in Spain,"] ''Antilia: The Spanish Journal of History of Natural Sciences and Technology,'' Vol. IV, Art. 1. {{ISSN|1136-2049}}. Archived at WebCite from [http://www.ucm.es/info/antilia/revista/vol4-en/ant4-1-en.htm this original URL] on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland]] had a large 18th-century industry producing soda ash from seaweed. The source of this ash was [[kelp]]. This industry was so lucrative that it led to overpopulation in the [[Western Isles]] of Scotland, and one estimate is that 100,000 people were occupied with "kelping" during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, soda ash (''la soude de Narbonne'') was produced in quantity from glasswort proper around [[Narbonne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, Jonathan (1842). ''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira indicates that ''soude de Narbonne'' was obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and had an alkali content of 14-15%. Online version at https://books.google.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fremy, Edmond (1883). ''Encyclopédie Chimique: Tome V, Application de Chimique Inorganique'' (Dunod, Paris), p. 548. [https://books.google.com/books?id=saQAAAAAMAAJ Online version] retrieved July 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The commercialization of the [[Leblanc process]] for synthesizing sodium carbonate (from salt, [[limestone]], and [[sulfuric acid]]) brought an end to the era of farming for soda ash in the first half of the 19th century.

A '''gonioreflectometer''' is a device for measuring a [[bidirectional reflectance distribution function]] (BRDF).

The device consists of a light source illuminating the material to be measured and a [[sensor]] that captures light reflected from that material. The light source should be able to [[lighting|illuminate]] and the sensor should be able to capture data from a [[Sphere|hemisphere]] around the target. The hemispherical rotation [[dimension]]s of the sensor and light source are the four dimensions of the BRDF. The 'gonio' part of the word refers to the device's ability to measure at different angles.

Several similar devices have been built and used to capture data for similar functions. Most of these devices use a [[camera]] instead of the light intensity-measuring sensor to capture a two-dimensional sample of the target. Examples include:
*a spatial gonioreflectometer for capturing the [[SBRDF]]{{What|date=April 2011}} (McAllister,2002).
*a camera gantry for capturing the [[light field]] (Levoy and Hanrahan, 1996).
*an unnamed device for capturing the [[bidirectional texture function]] (Dana, et al. 1999).

'''Industrial Toxicology Research Centre''' (ITRC) is now named as '''Indian Institute of Toxicology Research''' ('''IITR'''), Lucknow, India. The institute is engaged in the field of [[Toxicology]] having its main campus in [[Lucknow]] city and the other Gheru campus, is located near village 'Gheru' at [[List of National Highways in India|Lucknow-Kanpur highway]].

It is one of the constituent laboratory of [[CSIR India]], which was established in 1965 with the motto of "Safety to Environment &amp; Health and Service to Industry". The founder Director (1965–78) of the institute was '''Prof. Sibte Hasan Zaidi''' who died on 5 April 2008 at New York. He was the recipient of Padmashri and prestigious Sir Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar award for scientific excellence. IITR conducts Dr. S.H. Zaidi Oration in his honour every year during its foundation day celebrations on 4 November.

The institute is dedicated towards research in Fundamental and Applied Toxicology. Major thrust areas include Environmental toxicology, Ground and surface water pollution, Safety assessment of food &amp; additives, Toxicity evaluation of substances for human use, Microbial contaminations, Bioremediation, Hazard identification and Toxicogenomics.

The institute attracts students from all over India to pursue research. IITR offers Ph.D. programme in various areas, few to name are ''In vivo'' &amp; ''In vitro'' Toxicology, Environmental Toxicology, Genetic Toxicology, Immunotoxicology, Neurotoxicology, Food Toxicology, Environmental Microbiology and Carcinogenesis.

The institute also offers services for Toxicological and Analytical evaluation of chemicals / finished products to public and private sectors as per OECD, USEPA, BIS, ISO guidelines.

IITR became a reality in 1965 as Industrial Toxicology Research Centre (ITRC) located in Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow. The founder Director, Prof. Sibte Hasan Zaidi, could foresee the need to address health related to work environment of the industrial workers in post independence era of rapid industrialization in our country. It was advocated that the adverse effects of chemicals on health and environment will make an adverse impact on overall development of the country. Hence, studies were needed to develop strategies for sustainable industrial development. ITRC gained national importance by addressing the health problems of our industrial work force in a growing economy. Pioneering studies carried out during the formative years were directly linked to miners' health especially to respiratory ailments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">'''Interactive machine translation''' ('''IMT'''), is a specific sub-field of [[computer-aided translation]]. Under this [[translation]] paradigm, the [[computer software]] that assists the human translator attempts to predict the text the user is going to input by taking into account all the information it has available. Whenever such prediction is wrong and the user provides [[feedback]] to the system, a new prediction is performed considering the new information available. Such process is repeated until the translation provided matches the  user's expectations.

Interactive machine translation is specially interesting when [[translation|translating]] texts in domains where it is not admissible to output a translation containing errors, hence requiring a human user to amend the translations provided by the system.  In such cases, interactive machine translation has been proved to provide benefit to potential users.&lt;ref name="Casacuberta 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are few [[commercial software]] that implements interactive machine translation and work done in the field is mostly restrained to [[academic research]].

== History ==

Historically, interactive machine translation is born as an evolution of the [[computer-aided translation]] paradigm, where the human translator and the machine translation system were intended to work as a [[tandem]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=George |last2=Isabelle |first2=Pierre |last3=Plamondon |first3=Pierre
               |year=1997 |title=Target-text mediated interactive machine translation
               |journal=Machine Translation |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=175–194
               |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xu9r6752215w9275/fulltext.pdf |doi=10.1023/a:1007999327580}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This first work was extended within the TransType research project, funded by the Canadian government. In this project, the [[Human–computer interaction|human interaction]] was aimed towards producing the target text for the first time by embedding data-driven [[machine translation]] techniques within the interactive translation environment with the goal of achieving the best of both actors: the efficiency of the automatic system and the reliability of human translators.

Later, a larger-scale research project, TransType2,&lt;ref name="Casacuberta 2009" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Barrachina 2009" /&gt; funded by the [[European Commission]] extended such work by analyzing the incorporation of a complete  [[machine translation system]] into the process, with the goal of producing a complete translation hypothesis, which the human user is allowed to amend or accept. If the user decides to amend the hypothesis, the system then attempts to make the best use of such [[feedback]] in order to produce a new translation hypothesis that takes into account the modifications introduced by the user.

More recently, CASMACAT,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; also funded by the [[European Commission]], aimed at developing novel types of assistance to human translators and integrated them into a new workbench, consisting of an editor, a server, and analysis and visualisation tools. The workbench was designed in a modular fashion and can be combined with existing computer aided translation tools. Furthermore, the CASMACAT workbench can learn from the interaction with the human translator by updating and adapting its models instantly based on the translation choices of the user.&lt;ref&gt;

Recent work on involving an extensive evaluation with human users&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N10/N10-1078.pdf
      |title=Enabling Monolingual Translators: Post-Editing vs. Options

&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the fact that interactive machine translation may even be used by users that do not speak the source language in order to achieve near professional translation quality. Moreover, it also elucidated the fact that an interactive scenario is more beneficial than a classic post-edition scenario.

The previously described approaches rely on a tightly coupled underlying corpus-based machine translation system (usually, a [[Statistical machine translation]] system) that is used as a [[White_box_(software_engineering)|glass box]], therefore inheriting the [[Statistical machine translation#Shortcomings|shortcomings of the translation systems]] and limiting the usage of interactive machine translation for some scenarios. For this reason, an approach that uses any kind of bilingual resource (not limited to machine translation) as a [[black-box]] to provide interactive machine translation was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-0309

      |booktitle=Proceedings of the EACL 2014 Workshop on Humans and Computer-assisted Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is not able to extract as much information from the bilingual resources used, due to the black-box nature of the interaction, but can use any resource available to the user. Forecat is a black-box interactive machine translation implementation that is available both as a web application (that includes a webpage and a web services interface) and as a plugin for [[OmegaT]] (Forecat-OmegaT).

== Process ==

The interactive machine translation process starts with the system suggesting a
translation hypothesis to the user. Then, the user may accept the complete
sentence as correct, or may modify it if he considers there is some error.
Typically, when modifying a given word, it is assumed that the prefix until
that word is correct, leading to a left-to-right interaction scheme. Once the
user has changed the word considered incorrect, the system then proposes a new
suffix, i.e. the remainder of the sentence. Such process continues until the
translation provided satisfies the user.

Although explained at the word level, the previous process may also be implemented at the character level, and hence the system provides a suffix whenever the human translator types in a single character. In addition, there is ongoing effort towards changing the typical left-to-right interaction scheme in order to make [[human-machine interaction]] easier.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar approach is used in the [[Caitra]] translation tool.

== Evaluation ==

Evaluation is a difficult issue in interactive machine translation. Ideally,
evaluation should take place in experiments involving human users. However,
given the high monetary cost this would imply, this is seldom the case.
Moreover, even when considering human translators in order to perform a true
evaluation of interactive machine translation techniques, it is not clear what
should be measured in such experiments, since there are many different
variables that should be taken into account and cannot be controlled, as is 
for instance the time the user takes in order to get used to the process.
In the CASMACAT project, some field trials have been carried out to study some of these variables.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For quick evaluations in laboratory conditions, interactive machine translation is measured by using the ''key stroke ratio'' or the ''word stroke ratio''. Such criteria attempt to measure how many key-strokes  or words did the user need to introduce before producing the final translated  document.&lt;ref name="Barrachina 2009" /&gt;

== Differences with classical computer-aided translation ==
Although interactive machine translation is a sub-field of [[computer-aided translation]], the main attractive of the former with respect to the latter is the interactivity. In classical computer-aided translation, the translation system may suggest one translation hypothesis in the best case, and then the user is required to [[postediting|post-edit]] such hypothesis. In contrast, in interactive machine translation the system produces a new translation hypothesis each time the user interacts with the system, i.e. after each word (or letter) has been introduced.

The '''International Society for Computational Biology Student Council''' (ISCB-SC) is a dedicated section of the [[International Society for Computational Biology]] created in 2004. It is composed by students from all levels ([[Undergraduate degree|undergraduates]], [[Postgraduate education|postgraduates]], and [[postdoctoral researcher]]s) in the fields of [[bioinformatics]] and [[computational biology]]. The organisation promotes the development of the students' community worldwide by organizing different events including [[Academic conference|symposia]], [[workshop]]s, [[webinar]]s, [[internship]] coordination and [[hackathon]]s. A special focus is made on the development of [[soft skills]] in order to develop potential in bioinformatics and computational biology students around the world.

The ISCB-SC is composed of Regional Student Groups (RSGs) which are located in various regions across the [[globe]]. Since its foundation, the ISCB-SC has gained representation in most continents through over thirty RSGs which collectively represent more than 1,000 students and researchers around the world.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== History ==
The ISCB Student Council was officially established in 2004 by a vote from the ISCB Board of Directors at the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology|ISMB]]/[[European Conference on Computational Biology|ECCB]] meeting. The concept of the student council was first proposed by [[Manuel Corpas (Scientist)|Manuel Corpas]] in late 2003. The establishment of the student council was the first move of the ISCB to include the new generation of computational biologists into the, then newly emerging, field.&lt;ref name="ISCBHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the ISCB|url=http://www.iscb.org/iscb-history|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="first-exec-cmte"&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCB Newsletter 7-3|url=https://www.iscb.org/images/stories/newsletter/newsletter7-3/council.html|website=www.iscb.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first meeting had about 30 students and eight members of the ISCB leadership at the [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB) 2005 in Detroit, Michigan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Corpas|first1=Manuel|title=Graduate students band together to foster communication|journal=Nature|date=24 August 2005|volume=436|issue=1204|doi=10.1038/nj7054-1204b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first official Student Council Symposium (SCS) was held later that year at the [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB) meeting in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. The first SCS had approximately 100 attendees and was the beginning of a long-running series of meetings organized and highlighting students.&lt;ref name="ISCBHistory" /&gt; Other than the first instance of SCS, all later editions have as a satellite meeting of ISMB. In 2012, the SC started a second set of symposia that takes place at ECCB when it is not co-located with ISMB; the European Student Council Symposium (ESCS) regularly has more attendees than SCS when both events are held in the same year. Recently, the SC symposia have also been held along with other ISCB conferences like the case for the Latin American Student Council Symposium (LA-SCS) which is held every two years along with the Latin American ISCB Conference since 2014 &lt;ref name=Parra2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parra RG, Simonetti FL, Hasenahuer MA, Olguin-Orellana G, Shanmugam AK | title=Highlights from the 1st ISCB Latin American Student Council Symposium 2014. | pmc=4423572 |journal= BMC Bioinformatics |year=2015 |pmid=25955751 |volume=16 Suppl 8 |page=A1 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-16-s8-a1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the ISCB Student Council Symposium in Africa (SCS-Africa) which is held along the ISCB Africa ASBCB conference since 2015.&lt;ref name=Souilmi2015&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Souilmi Y, Allali I, Badad O, Dwibedi CK | title= Highlights of the first ISCB Student Council Symposium in Africa 2015 | url= https://f1000research.com/articles/4-569/v1 |journal= F1000Res. |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional student groups==
In 2006, the student council created the Regional Student Group (RSG) initiative to tailor the efforts of the council for the local community.&lt;ref name="rsg_page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsg.iscbsc.org|title=ISCB-SC RSGs|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macintyre|first=Geoff|year=2013|title=The Regional Student Group Program of the ISCB Student Council: Stories from the Road|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=|pages=|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003241}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSGs are locally managed groups established at various regions. Each RSG operates either under the aegis of a [[higher education]] institution or as an independent organisation sub-affiliated to local computational biology or bioinformatics organisation. RSGs are provided support from both the student council and other local groups in their region and often organize multi-RSG events such as BeNeLuxFra. {{As of|2017}}, the global network of the student council includes over 25 active RSGs operating across five continents.

The RSG committee was set up in 2008 to oversee and coordinates the activities of RSGs across the world. The team comprises an RSG-Chair, a co-chair and five vice-chairs corresponding to geographical regions (Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa, Latin America and USA-Canada). The RSG chair is required to have previous experience as a president or secretary of an RSG. Currently, around 2,000 students and researchers are active members of RSG-related events.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The ISCB-SC continuously looks for PhD students or postdocs who may be interested in starting a new RSG in a region where the student council has no presence yet. The student council also supports existing RSGs by advising them on how to grow, in terms of the events and projects they face as well as economically. There are 3 funding calls every year where RSGs can submit proposals containing different types of events which will be evaluated by the continental RSG chairs and the Executive Committee. Since the creation of the Student Council ''[[Faculty of 1000|F1000Research]]'' channel&lt;ref name="f1000res-sc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles from channel ISCB Student Council - F1000Research|url=https://f1000research.com/channels/studentcouncil|website=f1000research.com|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016, achievements by RSGs throughout each year are discussed in editorial articles.&lt;ref name=Shome2016&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shome Sayane |author2=Meysman Pieter |author3=Parra R.

The ISCB-SC runs an internship program in which researchers throughout the world can offer a place for a student from a developing nation to join his/her group for a period of time. This program aims to give students from developing nations the opportunity to have an experience in a working environment from first class research groups and interact with expert Principal Investigators around the world.&lt;ref name="intern"&gt;{{cite web|title=Internship Program {{!}} ISCB Student Council|url=http://www.iscbsc.org/content/internships-0|website=www.iscbsc.org|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Press ==
As a worldwide organization, the SC organizes symposia, workshops and different events across the globe. After more than ten years of existence, many new experiences have been gained on how to deal with different obstacles that arise when trying to tackle complex objectives. Learning experiences are published as articles that aim to help new RSGs, as well as other student organizations, including bioinformatics communities, to organize their own events and strengthen their growth.

=== Student Council Outreach Publications ===
Since its conception, the ISCB Student Council has not only advocated for the students in the [[ISCB]] and beyond&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISCB-SC Stands with all Scientists|url=http://iscbsc.org/iscbsc_stands_with_scientists|date=Feb 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, also, the SC has made lots of efforts to help educate new students.

In 2014, the ISCB Student Council began publishing a collection of articles in the ''[[PLOS]]'' journals that covers details about the development of the SC and how to advance in the field.&lt;ref name="PLoS_Articles"&gt;{{cite web|title=PLoS Collections|url=http://collections.plos.org/iscb-student-council}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a collective effort because of reaching a decade of story, different Student Council leaders from different regions in the world, came together and published 12 articles as part of the "Stories from the road: ISCB Student Council Collection" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stories from the road: SCB Student Council Collection|url=http://collections.plos.org/iscb-student-council}}&lt;/ref&gt; that summarize the experience and lessons that were learned through those years. These articles range in topic from starting and expanding your scientific network,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Breaking the Ice and Forging Links: The Importance of Socializing in Research|first1=Miranda|last1=Stobbe|first2=et|last2=al.|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003355|date=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Establishing and Managing a Global Student Network|first1=Avinash|last1=Shanmugam|first2=Geoff|last2=Macintyre|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003920|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; dealing with the frustration of failure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title= The Upside of Failure: How Regional Student Groups Learn from Their Mistakes|first1=Tarum|last1=Mishra|first2=R. Gonzalo|last2=Parra | first3=Thomas|last3=Abeel|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003768|date=August 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to disseminating science to the public. In particular, the article "Explain Bioinformatics to Your Grandmother!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Explain Bioinformatics to Your Grandmother!|first1=Virginie|last1=Bernard|first2=Magali|last2=Michaut|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003305|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that aims to simplify the answer to the question "What is bioinformatics?" to non-scientists, has accumulated more than 17,000 views (as of 2017) and constitutes one of the most read articles in ''[[PLOS Computational Biology]]''.

The Student Council also has its own article channel on ''F1000Research'' which features publications highlighting the activities of the council.&lt;ref name="f1000res-sc" /&gt;

In addition to the collections in F1000 and PLOS, the Student Council has publications that have appeared in ''[[BMC Bioinformatics]]'' and other journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Publications|url=http://iscbsc.org/content/publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==
The student council organizes several symposia each year to coincide with the major [[ISCB]] Conferences&lt;ref&gt;[http://iscbsc.org/scs-previous-symposiums Previous ISCB-SC Symposia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Student Council Symposium (SCS) is held each year directly preceding ISMB (or ISMB/ECCB). The symposium has been organised each year since 2005.
* The European Student Council Symposium (ESCS) is a biennial symposium that takes place preceding the ECCB (when ECCB is not co-located with ISMB). It has been held since 2010.
* The Latin American Student Council Symposium (LA-SCS) is held in even-numbered years directly preceding [[ISCB-LA]]. The LA-SCS has been held every other year since 2014.
* The African Student Council Symposium (SCS Africa) is held preceding the [[ISCB Africa ASBCB Conference on Bioinformatics]] since 2015.

In addition to the main ISCB-SC events that accompany the main ISCB conference(s), RSGs also hold events on a regular basis;&lt;ref name="rsg-events"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Regional Student Groups in 2016 {{!}} ISCB Student Council|url=http://iscbsc.org/node/196|website=iscbsc.org|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; these include annual events in Argentina,&lt;ref name="Parra2016" /&gt; Germany&lt;ref name="germany-symp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ibn-Salem|first1=Jonas|last2=Meiers|first2=Sascha|last3=Eigenbrod|first3=Ole|last4=Sehlke|first4=Robert|last5=Talyan|first5=Sweta|last6=Schwahn|first6=Kevin|last7=Otto|first7=Raik|last8=Pataskar|first8=Abhijeet|last9=Metge|first9=Franziska|last10=Angerer|first10=Philipp|title=Highlights of the 1st Student Symposium on Computational Genomics|url=https://genomicscomputbiol.org/ojs/index.php/GCB/article/view/59|website=Genomics and Computational Biology|accessdate=21 May 2017|pages=59|language=en|doi=10.18547/gcb.2016.vol2.iss1.e59|date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahman|first=Farzana|last2=Farmer|first2=Rohit|last3=Das|first3=Sayoni|last4=Vayani|first4=Fatima|last5=Hassan|first5=Mehedi|date=2015-06-16|title=Highlights of the 1st Student Symposium of the ISCB RSG UK|url=http://f1000research.com/articles/4-154/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=4|doi=10.12688/f1000research.6616.1|pmc=4786907|pmid=26998223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=White|first=Benjamen|last2=Fatima|first2=Vayani|last3=Fatima|first3=Nazeefa|last4=Das|first4=Sayoni|last5=Rahman|first5=Farzana|last6=Hassan|first6=Mehedi|date=2016-05-17|title=Highlights of the 2nd Bioinformatics Student Symposium by ISCB RSG-UK|url=http://f1000research.com/articles/5-902/v1|journal=F1000Research|volume=5|doi=10.12688/f1000research.8445.1|pmc=4870987|pmid=27239284|page=902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committees ==
Every year, ISCB and SC members elect new leadership positions. The positions are filled by students and/or postdoctoral members of the SC. The key mission of the SC's Executive Team is to lead the sustainable development of the organisation and its RSGs, and managing the coordination of all activities.

In addition, the SC aims to coordinate and integrate efforts of all members and volunteers who contribute their time. For the purpose of better organizational structure, the SC has established several committees that are chaired by SC members and managed by the executive team. Below is the list of the SC's committee's with description of each committee's responsibilities:

{{Fiqh |sexual}}

'''Islamic sexual jurisprudence''' concerns the Islamic laws of [[sexuality]] in [[Islam]], as largely predicated on the [[Quran|Qur'an]], the sayings of [[Muhammad]] (''[[hadith]]'') and the rulings of religious leaders' (''[[fatwa]]'') confining [[sexual activity]] to [[marriage|marital]] relationships [[Heterosexuality|between men and women]]. While most traditions discourage [[celibacy]], all encourage strict [[chastity]], [[modesty]] and [[privacy]] with regard to any relationships between [[gender]]s, holding forth that their [[intimate relationship|intimacy]] as perceived within Islam{{spaced ndash}}encompassing a swath of life broader than sexual activity{{spaced ndash}}is largely reserved for marriage. This sensitivity to gender difference and modesty outside of marriage can be seen in current prominent aspects of Islam, such as interpretations of [[list of types of sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] and degrees of [[sex segregation and Islam|gender segregation]].

While prohibitions against [[extramarital sex]] are strong, sexual activity itself is not a taboo subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islam-usa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=289&amp;Itemid=301 | title=Sex education, teenage pregnancy, sex in Islam and marriage | publisher=/www.islam-usa.com | accessdate=13 June 2015 | author=Dr. Shahid Athar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|title=Sunnah of the Wedding Night|date=15 March 2008|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317145545/http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permissible sexual relationships are described in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] as great wells of love and closeness. Even after marriage, there are limitations: a man should not have intercourse during his wife's menstruation and afterbirth periods. He is also considered to be sinning when [[anal sex|penetrating anally]]. Islam itself is a [[natalist]] religion, therefore it encourages increasing procreation through marital sexual relationships. Actions and behaviours such as [[abortion]] (other than for medical risk to the pregnant woman) {{additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} and [[homosexuality]] are also [[Haram|strictly forbidden]]; temporary [[contraceptive]] use is permitted for [[birth control]].

==Sex education==
===Adult===
Muslim men and women asked Muhammad about issues concerning sexual behavior, so as to know the teachings and rulings of their religion. Muslims could pose their questions either to Muhammad directly or to his wives.&lt;ref name=ii&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |website=www.islamicity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ii2&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Education in Islam |url=https://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/education.html |website=islamawareness.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] attributed to Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] states that the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] women in particular were not shy about asking questions regarding sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Book 3, Number 0649&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829)&lt;/ref&gt; and that responsibility includes protecting them from anything that may corrupt their morals. Early sex education for children is not recommended by Islamic scholars, as the knowledge contained in such curricula may be a negative influence on a young child's mind.&lt;ref name=iqa&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/138101 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He studies in a mixed school in a foreign country and is asking about attending "sex education" classes |website=islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/113970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]], young children should instead be taught Islamic rules involving covering the [[Intimate parts in Islam|‘awrah]], controlling one's gaze, and asking permission before entering private spaces.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

Munajjid also suggested to separate the bed of children at the age of ten according to hadith:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;
{{quote|It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds.”| Abu Dawood (495)}}

Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-‘Azeemabaadi said:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

{{quote|Al-Mannaawi said in Fath al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Sagheer: That is, separate your children in the beds in which they sleep when they reach the age of ten, as a precaution against provocation of desire, even in the case of sisters. At-Teebi said: Allah mentioned together the ideas of instructing them to pray and separating them in their beds in childhood, so as to discipline them and obey all the commands of Allah, and to teach them, to show them proper etiquette with people, and to teach them not to put themselves in suspicious situations and to keep away from sin.|Awn al-Ma‘bood (2/115)}}

Munajjid stated, this ''advice and guidance'' from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the ‘awrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

When puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on wudoo’ and ghusl, paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age – around the age of three years – that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

# The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sister’s clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brother’s actions and characteristics.

# Teaching children that the ‘awrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;  
 
Finally he stated, “With regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and ‘awrahs. It should be noted that what is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam."&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

==Circumcision==
{{See also|Khitan (circumcision)|Khafd}}
''Khitan'' or ''Khatna'' ({{lang-ar|ختان}}, {{lang-ar|ختنة}}) is the term for male [[circumcision]] carried out as a [[Islamic culture|cultural rite]] by Muslims and is considered a sign of belonging to the wider [[Islam]]ic community.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Circumcision of boys |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Religion &amp; ethics&amp;mdash;Islam |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305204605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not it should be carried out after [[converting to Islam]] is debated among Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |title=Male circumcision - the Islamic View |publisher=www.convertingtoislam.com |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214054917/http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |archivedate=2013-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227151507/http://islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archivedate=2010-12-27 |title=Is Circumcision obligatory after conversion? |publisher=Islamicinvitationcentre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |title=Considering Converting: Is it necessary to be circumcised? |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716152023/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |title=Circumcision for Converts |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180532/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, {{quote|"Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" |(reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]).}} 
So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith - Book of Dress - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916095339/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted, {{quote|"The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018144335/http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|archivedate=2013-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not. According to some traditions Muhammad was born without a [[foreskin]] ([[Aposthia|aposthetic]]), while others maintain that his grandfather [[Abdul-Muttalib]] circumcised him when he was seven days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629074142/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din. Alsirah al-halabiyyah. Vol.1 Beirut: Al-maktabah al-islamiyyah.

[[Imam]]s [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''—not obligatory but highly recommended. The [[Shafi`i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools see it as binding on all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090925/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Medical Ethics of Male Circumcision |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |title=Circumcision |publisher=Islamicvoice.com |date=2000-03-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626223309/http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |archivedate=2012-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

== Puberty ==
{{See also|Islamic theological jurisprudence|Islam and children}}

''Bāligh'' or ''bulūgh'' ({{lang-ar|بالغ or بُلوغ}}) refers to a person who has reached [[adulthood|maturity]] or [[puberty]], and has full responsibility under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

For example, in issues pertaining to [[Marriage in Islam|marriage]], ''baligh'' is related to the [[Arabic]] legal expression, ''hatta tutiqa'l-rijal'', which means that a wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in [[sexual intercourse]]. In comparison, ''baligh'' or ''balaghat'' concerns the reaching of [[sexual maturity]] which becomes manifest by the [[menses]]. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called ''rushd'', or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her [[bridewealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Masud, ''Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas'', [[Harvard University]] Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

A boy may reach maturity from the age of 10 lunar years (nine years, eight months and twenty days) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a boy include: wet dreams and ejaculation. A girl may reach maturity from the age of 9 lunar years (approximately eight years and eight months) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a girl: menstruation, wet dream or pregnancy.

==Conservatism==
{{see also|Awrah|Mahram|Islam and clothing}}
Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of conservatism, decency and [[modesty]]; besides the lawful sexuality, priority is given to modesty and chastity both inside and outside the marital relationships. In the [[hadith|hadith literature]], modesty has been described as "a part of faith.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | title=Hadith 20 :: Modesty is from Faith | publisher=40hadithnawawi.com | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150729011802/http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | archivedate=29 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) passed by an Ansari (man) who was admonishing to his brother regarding Haya'. On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Leave him as Haya'(self-respect, modesty, bashfulness) is a part of faith."|Sahih Bukhari: 24}}

Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. [[Islam and clothing|Dress-code]] is part of that overall teaching.&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | title=Marital privacy in Islam | accessdate=1 December 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208211244/http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | accessdate=27 November 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044332/http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quran, the subjects deal with modesty and privacy of men and women has been mostly described in [[An-Nur]]. For example, it has been mentioned,

{{quotation|"Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is Aware of what they do. And say to the believing women that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not display their adornment except what appears thereof. -- And let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms. And they should not display their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their -- right hands possess, or guileless male servants, or the children who know not women's nakedness. And let them not strike their feet so that the adornment that they hide may be known. And turn to Allah all, O believers, so that you may be successful. And marry those among you who are single, and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves. If they are needy, Allah will make them free from want out of His grace. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste, until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace."|[[An-Nur]] 24:30-33}}

{{quotation|"O you who believe, let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times: Before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. These are three times of privacy for you; besides these it is no sin for you nor for them -- some of you go round about (waiting) upon others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And when the children among you attain to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And (as for) women past childbearing, who hope not for marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their adornment. And if they are modest, it is better for them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. There is no blame on the blind man, nor any blame on the lame, nor blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses; or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or (houses) whereof you possess the keys, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet your people with a salutation from Allah, blessed (and) goodly. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages that you may understand."|[[An-Nur]] 24:58-61}}

Hadith also describes the laws of modesty. Along with Quran it has also emphasized marriage as a requirement for modesty and chastity. For example,

{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Masud, the prophet said, "O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, as it lower the eyesight and guard his modesty and whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for that will be a shield for him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|7|62|4}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|4778}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1400}}}}

It has been mentioned in [[Hadith]] ranging about men's and women's [[Intimate parts in Islam|private parts]] that,
Regarding women follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma’, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands." Abu Dawud&lt;ref&gt;http://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After Muhammad issued the command (Quran 24:31) for women to cover themselves, the women responded by tearing up sheets [or outer garments] to cover their faces." Sahih Bukhari (60:282)&lt;ref name="sahih-bukhari.com"&gt;https://www.sahih-bukhari.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding men follows:
{{quotation|Narrated by Muawiah ibn Haydah, " I said : Apostle of Allah, from whom should we conceal our private parts and to whom can we show? He replied : conceal your private parts except from your wife and from whom your right hand possesses (concubines). I then asked: Apostle of Allah, (what should we do), if the people are assembled together? He replied: If it is within your power then no one will look at it, then you should try that no one can look it. I then asked: Apostle of Allah, if one of us is alone? He replied: Allah is more entitled than people that bashfulness should be shown to him (feel shy more to Allah than to people)."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4006}}}}

{{quotation|The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do not uncover you thigh, and do not look at the thigh of the living and the dead.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4004}}}}

It is forbidden for both spouses to spread the secrets of what happens between them in their private marital life; indeed, this is one of the most evil things. Quran says,&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"/&gt;

In another [[hadith]] it has been mentioned,
{{quotation|The Messenger of Allah said: "Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds."|Narrated by Abu Dawood (495)}}

There is also prescription of modesty and privacy in case of unlawful sexual acts. It is mentioned in the hadith below from [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]:

{{quotation|Malik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man confessed to fornication in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for a whip, and he was brought a broken whip. He said, "Above this," and he was brought a new whip whose knots had not been cut yet. He said, "Below this," and he was brought a whip which had been used and made flexible. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the order and he was flogged. Then he said, "People! The time has come for you to observe the limits of Allah. Whoever has had any of these ugly things befall him should cover them up with the veil of Allah. Whoever reveals to us his wrong action, we perform what is in the Book of Allah against him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muwatta|41|2|12}}}}

Some hadith warn against immodesty including as follows,
{{quotation|"The Messenger of Allah said: ‘ ... There are five things with which you will be tested, and I seek refuge with Allah lest you live to see them: Promiscuity (sexual immorality) never appears among a people to such an extent that they commit it openly, but plagues and diseases that were never known among the predecessors will spread among them. ..."| [http://www.sunnah.com/urn/1291190 Sunan Ibn Majah - 4,019]}}

==Marriage==
{{main|Marriage in Islam}}

Marriage (Nikah) is a contract between Muslim men and his wife. Marriage has been described in tradition (hadith) as half of the religion with the regards of preserving chastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marriage half of faith? |url=https://eshaykh.com/hadith/general-2/ |website=eshaykh.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is marriage half of religion? - islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/11586 |website=isamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex within marriage ==
{{further|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}

In Islamic law, marriage legalizes sexual intercourse between the husband and wife. Marriage is not restricted to a platonic relationship nor is it only for procreation. Marriage is greatly encouraged in Islam, partially because it provides a lawful institution in which to fulfill one's sexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | title=Etiquette of intimate relations | publisher=islamqa.info | work=Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204418/http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | title=Sex &amp; Marriage in Islam | publisher=zawaj.com | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710223229/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | archivedate=10 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | title=Importance of Marriage in Islam | publisher=Al-Islam.org | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205547/http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does provide extensive rules regarding sex; however, within the conditional institution of marriage, there are sources in both the Qur'an and hadith, which promote the well being of humans and their natural sexual instincts. In the Surah Baqarah, sex in married life is openly recommended: {{quote|"When they [i.e. wives] have cleansed themselves [after menstruation], you go into them as Allah has commanded."|(2:222)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |title=Importance of Marriage in Islam |url=http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504205154/http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also said: {{quote|"Those who guard their chastity (ie. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame."|[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-6]}} Additionally, sources of hadith illustrate similar promotion of fulfilling sexual urges in lawful ways within a marriage. The Wasaelush Shia quotes Muhammad as encouraging his followers to marry, saying: {{quote|"O, you young men! I recommend marriage to you."|The Wasaelush Shia (vol. 14, p.&amp;nbsp;25)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |last=S.H. Rizvi |first=Syed Athar Husain |title=Islamic Marriage |url=http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |publisher=World Islamic Network |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504205154/http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophet Muhammad also declared marital sex as charity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Having intercourse (with one's wife) is a charity. |url=https://salaficentre.com/2014/05/having-intercourse-with-ones-wife-is-a-charity/ |website=The Salafi Centre of Manchester |accessdate=19 June 2018|date=2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"When one of you have sex with your wife, it is a rewarded act of charity." The Companions were surprised and said, "But we do it purely out of our desire. How can it be counted as charity?" The Prophet replied, "If you had done it with a forbidden woman, it would have been counted as a sin, but if you do it in legitimacy, it is counted as charity.”|Muslim. Number 1674}}

=== Sexual techniques ===

One of the areas of Islamic sexual jurisprudence in which there are not many restrictions is the discussion of sexual techniques. Almost all of what is practiced under Islamic law concerning sexual techniques and the act of sexual intercourse come from 'hadith'', which are not restrictive in nature, but followed by a mutual etiquette known as foreplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning Sex Into Sadaqa An excerpt from 'The Muslim Marriage Guide.' |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2001/04/turning-sex-into-sadaqa.aspx |website=beliefnet.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kissing and Foreplay |url=https://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/kissf.htm |website=central-mosque.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE RULES OF NIKAH: BEDROOM ETIQUETTES IN ISLAM |url=http://www.authentictauheed.com/2011/07/112-bedroom-etiquettes-in-islam.html |website=authentictauheed.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the hadith follows:

{{quote|Imam al-Daylami records a narration on the authority of Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) is reported to have said:  "Not one of you should fulfil one’s (sexual) need from/fall upon his wife like an animal; but let there first be a messenger between you." "And what is that messenger?" they asked, and he replied: "Kisses and words".”|Musnad al-Firdaws Of al-Daylami, 2/55}}

{{quote|Imam Ibn al-Qayyim reports from Jabir ibn Abd Allah in his famous “Tibb al-Nabawi” that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) forbade from engaging in sexual intercourse before foreplay.|al-Tibb al-Nabawi, 183}}
The main tendency within these ''hadith'' are saying for Muslims to follow in the bedroom, saying which "clearly show that the husband and the wife should feel completely free when they are engaged in mutual stimulation which is known as foreplay. These sayings recommend [[foreplay]] and put no real restrictions on the type of techniques used during foreplay or during intercourse.&lt;ref name="foreplay 1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic bedroom fiqh|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|work=Hanafi fiqh|publisher=themodernreligion.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Sidi Faraz Rabbani|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819080707/http://www.themodernreligion.com/misc/sex/sex-basic-fiqh.html|archivedate=19 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kiss 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing and Foreplay in Islam|url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|work=Sex in Islam|publisher=Zawaj.com|accessdate=8 July 2012|author=Muhammad ibn Adam al-Kawthari|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624135953/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/kissing-and-foreplay.html|archivedate=24 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/826 | title=Masturbation between husband and wife | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708043554/http://islamqa.info/en/826 | archivedate=8 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allah says in the Qur'an: {{quote|Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your own selves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).|{{cite quran|2|223|s=ns}}}}

In the foregoing verse the word harth (tilth) indicates that any kind of vaginal sex is permissible in Islam, because it is from this place children are produced; and it is also regardless any of sexual positions, because although top to bottom position has been encouraged most, but none of the vaginal sexual positions has been mentioned as prohibited in scripture and tradition.&lt;ref name=alis&gt;{{cite web |title=1.What are the positions and ways of having sex are legal in islam? |url=http://www.islamhelpline.net/node/3692 |website=islamhelpline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Techniques |url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-handbook-syed-athar-husayn-sh-rizvi/sexual-techniques |website=www.al-islam.org |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen lodged in the womb from which offspring comes is likened to the seeds that are planted in the ground, bringing vegetation. Both of them are substances from which something else is produced. Hence, conversely, one area of sexual techniques that is generally prohibited is [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=alis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=There is nothing in Islam to say that anal intercourse is permissible |url=https://islamqa.info/en/91968 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Ruling on Anal Sex |url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=669 |website=islamonline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Muslim jurists agree that anal sex is haram (prohibited), based on the hadith of Muhammad: {{quote|Do not have anal sex with women.|Reported by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah}}

{{quote|Muhammad also said, "Cursed he. ..who has sex with a woman through her back passage."|Ahmad}}

{{quote|Khuzaymah Ibn Thabit also reported that the Messenger of Allah said: "Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: Do not have sex with your wives in the anus."|Reported by Ahmad, 5/213}}

{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated: "The Messenger of Allah said: "Allah will not look at a man who has anal sex with his wife."|Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; At-Tirmidhi classified it as an authentic hadith, 1165}}

Further, it is reported that Muhammad referred to such an act as "minor sodomy". (Reported by Ahmad and An-Nasa'i)

{{quote|It is reported that `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab came one day to Muhammad and said, "O Messenger of Allah, I am ruined!" "What has ruined you?" asked the Prophet. He replied, "Last night I turned my wife over," meaning that he had had vaginal intercourse with her from the back. The Prophet did not say anything to him until the verse cited above was revealed. Then he told him, "[Make love with your wife] from the front or the back, but avoid the anus and intercourse during menstruation." (Reported by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | title=Sex Technique | publisher=islamawareness.net | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721002113/http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | archivedate=21 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sexual obligations ===
In Islam, the husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her, so long as that does not harm him physically or keep him from earning a living. The husband is obliged to treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Part of that kind and reasonable treatment is intercourse, which he has to do. The majority of scholars set the time limit beyond which it is not permissible for the husband to forego intercourse at four months, but according to some scholars, the view is that there is no time limit.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qudaamah, Malik, [[Al-Mughni]], 7/30, Al-Jassaas, Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 1/374, Shaykh al-Islam, Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the scholars have said that, It is obligatory on women alike not to refuse their husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed.&lt;ref&gt;al-Fataawa al-Islamiyyah, 3/145, 146, Kashf al-Qinaa’, 5/189, [[Al-Muhalla]], 10/40, Kashf al-Qinaa’, 5/189&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said: "If a man calls his wife to his bed, and she refuses to come, the angels curse her until morning comes."|al-Bukhari, 3065; Muslim, 1436.}}

But it is not permissible for a husband to force his wife to do more than she is able to bear of intercourse. If she has an excuse such as being sick or unable to bear it, then she is not sinning if she refuses to have intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | title=Her husband has strong desire; what should she do? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811224131/http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | archivedate=11 August 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procreation===
In Islamic jurisprudence, the primary purpose of sex between marriage is [[procreation]].&lt;ref name=jawaz2/&gt; Islam recognizes the strong sexual urge and desire for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Shahid Athar |title=Sex Education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. M.A. Rauf from his book 'Marriage in Islam'. In this excerpt, he discusses in great detail the advantages and possible disadvantages of marriage. Among the advantages that he discusses are procreation, fulfilment of the natural urge, companionship, comfort and relief to the soul, and so on. He also discusses the disadvantages and the types of burdens and risks involved with marriage. All of the advantages or benefits are in effect meant to be regarded as the secondary purpose of marriage which supplement its major aim or purpose, namely procreation. To beget children. This is the main purpose for marriage. The aim is to engender and preserve the human race. Four objectives are accomplished through procreation: - (i) to increase mankind (ii) Islam is propagated by increasing the number of followers of the prophet Muhammad (iii)parents will hope to leave behind children who will pray for them (iv) and According to Islamic belief, if a child dies before the parents, the prayers of the child in paradise will be very beneficial for the parents.&lt;ref name=jawaz2&gt;{{cite web |author1=Syed Mumtaz Ali &amp; Rabia Mills |title=Sex in Islam: Its Role and Purpose |url=https://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_mumtaz.html |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children born of the matrimonial union become legitimate and mutual rights of inheritance are established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |authorlink1=Marriage and Family in Islam" by Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |title=Purpose and obligation of marriage life |url=https://www.soundvision.com/article/purpose-and-obligation-of-marriage-life |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam also supposts a [[natalism|pro-natalist]] view of procreation through many hadith.

{{quote| Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.|Abu Dawood (2050)}}

This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet Muhammad will feel proud of his [[Ummah|followers]] before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children.&lt;ref name="IQA2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Fiqh of the family. arur 13492: Encouragement to have a lot of children |url=https://islamqa.info/en/13492 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=5 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Messenger and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract (2) and recited to us: -- 'O you who believe ! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.' (5.87) Narrated Abu Huraira: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry." He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated or not."|Bukhari, 4705}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah said: "Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me. Get married, for I will boast of your great numbers before the nations. Whoever has the means, let him get married, and whoever does not, then he should fast for it will diminish his desire."|Ibn Majah 1846}}

{{quote|"The Messenger of Allah disapproved of Uthman bin Mazun's desire to remain celibate; if he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated."|Ibn Majah, 1848}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah forbade celibacy. Zaid bin Akhzam added: "And Qatadah recited: 'And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad ), and made for them wives and offspring.|Ibn Majah 1849}}

== Fornication and adultery ==
{{main|Zina}}

Just as Islamic law fosters sexual actions within a marriage or lawful concubinage with wholly owned female slaves, there is also judicial opinion concerning sexual relations outside of these institutions. These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an.
{{quote|Fornicatoress and fornicator flog each one of them one hundred lashes; and do not take pity on them in the application of God's law if you believe in God and last day; and their punishment should be witnesses by a party of believers. Fornicator does not marry except a fornicatoress or polytheist women; and fornicatoress no one marry her except fornicator or polytheist man;and it is prohibited to believers. And those who accuse chaste women and then never bring four witness flog them eighty lashes; and do not accept their testimony for ever; they themselves are disobedient. Except those who repent after this and become good then God is forgiving and merciful. And those who accuse their wives and do not have witness except themselves then witness of each of them are four witnesses by God that he is of truthfuls. And fifth that curse of God be on him if he is of lier. And it can save her from punishment that she witnesses by God four times that he is of liers. And fifth time that wrath of God be on her if he is of truthfuls. (al-Qur'an 24:2-9)}}

Verse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and [[concubinage]], Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as ''zina'' [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="Suad 2007 531"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, one practice outside marriage that does exist within Islamic law is legal sexual relations between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns. [[Malik ibn Anas]] cites a report in which "Umar b. al-Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an ''umm walad'' (mother of a child, concubine)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal sex (fornication) ===

Similar to laws that prohibit extramarital sexual relations, the Qur'an also stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, [[wet nurse]]s, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married.

Additionally, Verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation. Muhammad specifically restricts the injunction "to segregate the women" and "not go near them" in 2:222 to a prohibition against sexual relations with menstruating women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Pornography is considered haram and a clear sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|title=10 Reasons The Muslim Should Quit Watching Pornography|date=28 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104315/http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/166123|title=Her husband watches porn with the excuse of stress at work|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830004408/https://islamqa.info/en/166123|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states:

==Prostitution==
[[Prostitution]] is banned in Islam.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/5707|title=The difference between slaves and prostitutes|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510161236/https://islamqa.info/en/5707|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quran states,

{{quote|And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life. And whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful..|{{cite quran|24|33|s=ns}}}}

Prostitution (trading sex for money) is haraam. If any does this then he shall be stoned to death. It was practiced by some Arabs during the 6th century. In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden on all grounds.

{{quote|Jabir reported that 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slave-girl:
Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution . It was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful" (xxiv. 33).|{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7180}},{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7181}},{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2304}}}}

Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
{{quote|The Prophet said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.|{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2257}}}}

In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with the saying: {{quote|"Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer".|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}}}

Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:
{{quote|'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet told him that there were four types of marriage during Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance. One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. "Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him." Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, "You (all) know what you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that. But when Muhammad was sent with the Truth, he abolished all the types of marriages observed in pre-Islamic period of Ignorance except the type of marriage the people recognize today.|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|62|58}}}}

However, [[sexual slavery]] as concubinage was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archivedate=21 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]] – muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]] — which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

By contrast, in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Mut'ah marriage is classed as forbidden because [[Ali bin Abu Talib]] said that he heard Muhammad say that it is forbidden. 
As narrated by 'Ali bin Abu Talib: 
{{quote|"On the day of khaibar, Allah's Apostle forbade the Mut'a (i.e. temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey-meat."|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|527}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|86|91}}}}

Zaidi Shia texts also state that Ali said Mut'ah marriage was forbidden and for this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practise Mut'ah marriage.

==Gender non-conforming people==
{{main|LGBT in Islam|Mukhannathun}}
[[Mukhannathun]] (مخنثون "effeminate ones", "men who resemble women", singular mukhannath) were men who acted in ways interpreted as feminine. As time went on, the ''mukhannathun'' were forced to be castrated. There has been significant mention of "mukhannathun" in ahadith and by scholars of Islam. The word refers to a person who behaves like a woman in gentleness, speech, appearance, movements and so on. The mukhannath or effeminate man is one who is obviously male, unlike the khuntha (intersex). Effeminate people are of two types.
(i)Those who are created that way (intersex); there is no sin on them.
(ii)Those who were not created that way; rather they choose to imitate women in their movements and speech. This is the type which is cursed in the [[hadith]]s.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage/&gt;
The following tradition speaks to the their behavior:
{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet cursed effeminate men; those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners of women) and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, "Turn them out of your houses." The Prophet turned out such-and-such man, and 'Umar turned out such-and-such woman.|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|774}}}}
[[Sex change operation]] means that healthy males or females suffering from no deformity, who are able to marry and [[reproduce]], choose to undergo elective surgery to transform themselves into the appearance of the opposite sex. This kind of surgery is prohibited by [[Islamic Law]] because it is altering Allah’s creation needlessly and in vanity. Allah relates that [[Satan]] says:{{quotation| “And I shall order them and they will alter Allah’s creation.” |[Sûrah al-Nisâ’:119]}} 
Muhammad also said regarding people "imitating" (i.e. transgender) the opposite sex:&lt;ref name=islamtoday/&gt;
{{quote|“Allah curses men who imitate women and women who imitate men.”|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|773}}}}

==Intersex==
{{see|Intersex people and religion#Islam}}
An [[intersex]] person may have [[sex characteristics]] or [[sex organ|organs]] that are not typically male or female. This person is called a ''Khunthaa'' in the books of Fiqh.&lt;ref name=Khuntha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|title=View on Transgender - IslamQA|date=9 May 2015|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507020847/http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|archivedate=7 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of Khunthaa:

1. A person has aspects of both organs, and urinates from the male organ. This person will be included among the males and the laws regarding males will fall on him.

2. The person urinates from the female organ so will be included among the females. The laws related to females will fall on this person. This applies before the person reaches maturity. After maturity, the person will be rechecked. If he experiences wet dreams like a male then he will be counted as a male. On the other hand, if the person develops breasts and other signs of being feminine the she will be included among the females.

3. When both masculine and feminine signs are equal and it cannot be determined whether the person is more male or more female then such a person is termed Khunthaa Mushkil. There are different laws regarding such a person, a few examples: It is not permissible for a Khunthaa Mushkil to wear silk and jewellery. Both these are permissible for females. But because this person’s condition cannot be ascertained, so precaution demands that such a person not wear silk and jewellery, because of the possibility that the person may be more male. Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum. If a Ghayr Mahram is rendering the Tayammum then the person has to wear a cloth over the hands. A Mahram does not have to wear a cloth over the hands.&lt;ref name=Khuntha/&gt;

With regard to marriage of one who is intersex, if it is an unambiguous case, then according to how he or she is classified, he or she may marry someone of the opposite gender. If it is an ambiguous case, then the marriage of such a person cannot be valid, the reason being that he may be male, in which case how can he marry another male, or may be female, in which case she can't marry another female like her. If this individual is sexually attracted to females and claims to be a man, this is a sign that he is most likely male, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/114670|title=Ruling on marrying a man who is intersex or impotent, and the difference between them|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203522/https://islamqa.info/en/114670|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex medical interventions]] are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a person’s exterior, [[chromosomal]] make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allah’s creation or imitation of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=islamtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107021853/http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-07|title=Sex change operation - IslamToday - English|website=en.islamtoday.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concubinage ==
{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}
{{See also|Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse}}

Concubinage was a relationship between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns; the term refers to the status of the female. If she gives birth to a child by her master, the slave becomes ''umm walad'' ("mother of child", "concubine"). The [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudama]] explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her. [[Ibn al-Humam]] adds that the slave-owner must acknowledge the kinship of the child.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

"Concubine" (''surriyya'') refers to the female slave (''jāriya''), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word "''surriyya''" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression "[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}} Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people  to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | title=Al-Adab Al-Mufrad / Book-9 / Hadith-48 | publisher=quranx.com | accessdate=7 June 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062833/http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | archivedate=17 February 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Islamic jurisprudence sets limits on the master's right to sexual intercourse with his female slave. A man's ownership of his unmarried slave-girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her that he could not sell to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice [[coitus interruptus]]. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of ''umm al-walad'' ("mother of the child"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Surah [[Al-Muminun]] (23:6) and Surah [[Al-Maarij]] (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess" (female slaves), saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name="Brunschvig"&gt;Brunschvig.

One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sikainga, Ahmad A. | title=Slaves Into Workers: Emancipation and Labor in Colonial Sudan | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-292-77694-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bloom, Jonathan |author2=Blair, Sheila | title=Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2002| isbn=0-300-09422-1}} p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"/&gt;

== Rape ==
{{main|Zina#Rape and zina|Rape in Islamic law}}
Rape is considered a serious sexual crime in Islam, and can be defined in Islamic law as: "Forcible illegal sexual intercourse by a man with a woman who is not legally married to him, without her free will and consent".&lt;ref name="Noor"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Noor|first1=Azman Mohd|title=Rape: A Problem of Crime Classification in Islamic Law|journal=Arab Law Quarterly|date=1 January 2010|volume=24|issue=4|pages=417–438|doi=10.1163/157302510X526724}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Islamic law, it is classified as ''[[hirabah]]'', i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an as ''[[fasad]]'' (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Some other branches of Islamic law consider it to be part of ''[[zina]]'', as a crime called "forced fornication" (''zina-bil-jabr''). In Sharia, rape is punishable by [[stoning]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [http://sunnah.com/ tirmidhi/17 17:37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020025409/http://www.sunnah.com/ |date=2015-10-20 }}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|

Under Islam, sexual intercourse is regarded as a loving act within marriage and should only be by mutual consent.{{additional citation| date=January 2017}} There is, however, no explicit concept of rape within marriage in Sharia; a wife is deemed to have accepted conjugal relations as part of the marriage contract. She can only refuse on grounds which are specified as prohibited for sexual intercourse such as when she is fasting, menstruating, undergoing [[Postpartum period|post-natal puerperal discharge]], or whilst on [[Hajj]] or [[Umrah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Classical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called "rape" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (''zināʾ'').&lt;ref name="Kassam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |title= The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Law |last=Kassam |first=Zayn |date= |website= |publisher= Oxford Islamic Studies Online |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113724/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |archive-date= 2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |accessdate= 3 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic definition of rape as "coercive ''zināʾ''" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to ''zināʾ''{{spaced ndash}}its definition, punishment and establishment through evidence{{spaced ndash}}were also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of ''zināʾ'' was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; Sane adult male and female convicted of ''zināʾ'' were to receive a fixed corporal punishment (''ḥadd''):

* One hundred lashes and exile for one year for unmarried free persons;
* Stoning to death for married or previously married free persons;

''Zināʾ'' was established, according to classical law, through confession by one or both parties as well as proof. A second type of evidence{{spaced ndash}}pregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman{{spaced ndash}} was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zināʾ punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the ḥadd punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya).&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

What distinguished a prototypical act of zināʾ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being "coercive" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of "coercion" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zināʾ'' should receive the ''ḥadd'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the ḥadd punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zināʾ'' due to their reduced capacity.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

According to the Mālikī, Ḥanbalī, and Shāfiʾī schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a "right of God" (''ḥaqq Allāh''), provoking the ''ḥadd'' punishment; and a violation against a "human" (interpersonal) right (''ḥaqq ādamī''), requiring a monetary compensation. {{additional citation|date=January 2017}} These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''buḍʾ''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave. For them, in the same way that the slave owner was entitled to compensation for sexual misappropriation, the free woman was also entitled to compensation. The amount of this compensation, they reasoned, should be the amount that any man would normally pay for sexual access to the woman in question {{spaced ndash}}that is, the amount of her dower (''ṣadāq'' or ''mahr''){{additional citation needed|date=January 2018}}.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; As far as abortion in the context of rape, most jurist do not consider rape to be a valid reason: the sanctity of the new life takes precedence over the autonomy of the pregnant women.&lt;ref name="Moosa"/&gt;

However, some women{{which|date=February 2018}}in the middle east were arrested after they went to the police to report rapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38013351 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-09-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921194207/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38013351 |archivedate=2017-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual intercourse is prohibited:
* during menstruation;
* for forty days after childbirth ([[puerperium]]);
* during the daylight hours of the month of [[Ramadan]] (i.e. while fasting);
* on pilgrimage; while in the sanctuary (in Ahram) at Mecca, pilgrims are not allowed to have intercourse.

== Sodomy ==
{{main|Islamic view of anal sex}}

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a contemporary [[Sunni]] [[List of modern-day Muslim scholars|Muslim scholar]], states that [[sodomy]] is [[Haraam|prohibited]].  As the act is forbidden in the [[Islamic marriage contract]], a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it and may seek divorce if her husband persists or tries to force it on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |title=When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - ارشيف اسلام اونلاين |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054059/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act in itself, however, does not [[:wikt:nullify|nullify]] the marriage and the wife must seek divorce if she is to leave her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |title=Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - ارشيف اسلام اونلاين |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054251/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim scholars justify the prohibition on the basis of the Qur'anic verse 2:223, saying that it commands intercourse only in the vagina (i.e. potentially procreational intercourse). The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side.

There are also several ''hadith'' which prohibit sodomy.

Islamic law establishes two categories of legal, sexual relationships: between husband and wife, and between a man and his concubine. All other sexual relationships are considered ''zināʾ'' (fornication), including adultery and homosexuality, according to Islamic law and exegesis of the Qur'an. From the story of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Sodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as ''liwat'' (literally, "joining") while female-female intercourse is referred to as ''sihaq'' (literally, "rubbing"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define ''zināʾ'' exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of ''zināʾ'' and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;
Religious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an "abomination" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (''hadith'') reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offense; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behavior for both sexes, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.&lt;ref name="Rowson"/&gt;

Currently, sodomy is punishable by death in a number of Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as in Nigeria's Sharia courts.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;

After partaking in sexual activity where penetration or ejaculation occurs, both men and women are required to complete a full-body ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] known as ''[[ghusl]]'' in order to re-establish ritual purity before prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghusl'' requires clean, odorless water that has not been used for a previous ritual and begins with the declaration of the intention of purity and worship.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153249/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Muslim performing complete ablution then washes every part of his or her body.&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

Verse 2:222 in the Qur'an implies that sexual relations during menstruation are prohibited.

==Nocturnal emission==
{{main|Nocturnal emission#Islamic view}}
Nocturnal emission is not a sin in Islam. Moreover, whereas a person fasting (in [[Ramadan]] or otherwise) would normally be considered to have broken their fast by ejaculating on purpose (during either masturbation or intercourse), nocturnal emission is not such a cause. They are still required to bathe prior to undergoing some rituals in the religion. Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as [[junub]]; meaning that a [[Muslim]] who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a ''[[ghusl]]'', before they can read the [[Qur'an]] or perform the formal prayer known as [[salat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9208|title=Coping with wet dreams|publisher=www.islampqa.info|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104301/https://islamqa.info/en/9208|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an has been cited as being ambiguous on the issue of masturbation. The hadith regarding masturbation are, too, not considered to take a definitive stance on the subject. As such, positions on masturbation vary widely.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Omar |first=Sara |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153420/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to alDin Tarbiyyah, it is permissible if done out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gender, and Social Change - Page 28, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, John L. Esposito - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He also permitted masturbation as a means whereby soldiers, far away from their wives on a tour of duty may remain chaste. The four [[Sunni]] schools of [[jurisprudence]] (known as Madhaahib - the ''Hanafi'', ''Shafi'i'', ''Maliki'' and ''Hanbali'' schools of ''Fiqh'') have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the [[Hanafi]] and [[Hanbali]] Mazhabs, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmed ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for men and women who have difficulty in finding a lawful spouse.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is prohibited all the time according to the [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi`i]] Mazhabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp Marriage in Islam - Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127060711/http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp |date=2010-11-27 }} by Hussein Khalid Al-Hussein, Ph.D. Refer to: Section Al-`Alaqat Al-Mubahah (Allowed Relationships)&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[haram]] in [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name= "Shia"/&gt; There has always been a view to permit masturbation as the lesser of two evils (so as to ward of falling into fornication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Inhorn |first=Marcia |title=Masturbation, Semen Collection and Men's IVF Experiences: Anxieties in |journal=Body &amp; Society |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is categorically incorrect to state that all Islamic scholars of the early Islamic age have unanimously agreed upon its complete prohibition. Jurists distinguish between those who masturbate out of necessity and those who have these means yet still masturbate to gratify their lust.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

== Contraception ==

The Qur'an does not contain explicit text regarding contraception. Muslims refer to the hadith on the question of contraception. According to Muslim scolars, birth control is permitted, when it is temporary and for a valid reason.&lt;ref name="amjaonline"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Hatem al-Haj |title=Fatwa-76792 -  Getting my tubes tied: female sterilization |url=http://www.amjaonline.org/fatwa-76792/info |website=www.amjaonline.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companions of Muhammad are cited when addressing this issue. For example, Jabir, one of Muhammad's companions, relates a hadith in which a man came to Muhammad and said {{Quote|"I have a slave girl, and we need her as a servant and around the palm groves. I have had sex with her, but I am afraid of her becoming pregnant." The Prophet responded, ″Practice [[coitus interruptus]] with her if you so wish, for she will receive what has been predestined for her.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |jstor=2133308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As such, the withdrawal method of contraception is allowed according to the hadith. Muslim jurists concur with its permissibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use analogical deduction to approve other forms of contraception (e.g. [[condom]] usage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230901/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[Sunnah]] include:

{{Quote|A man said: "Apostle of Allah, I have a slave-girl and I withdraw from her (while having intercourse), and I dislike that she becomes pregnant. I intend (by intercourse) what the men intend by it. The Jews say that withdrawal method (Al-azl) is like burying the living girls on a small scale." He (the Prophet) said: "The Jews told a lie. If Allah intends to create it, you cannot turn it away."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}}}

{{Quote|"O Allah's Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?" The Prophet said, "Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}}}
===Sterilization===
It is not permitted to carry out operations on men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens ([[vasectomy]]) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb ([[hysterectomy]] or [[Tubal ligation|ligation]]) in women. Irreversible methods of contraception and birth control called [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] are not allowed for both male and female, except in the case of the wife who becomes terminally ill and perpetually incapable of having babies.&lt;ref name="Iqainfo-sterility"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on surgery that causes sterility |url=https://islamqa.info/en/2160 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=13 September 2018 |date=1998-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if the sterilization is irreversible and cannot be undone, it will not be permissible unless the woman is terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Yusuf Laher |title=Are Muslim women allowed to have sterilization? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/44911 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=IQS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal circumstances, sterilization is considered to be absolutely and decidedly prohibited in Shari’ah. The irreversible nature associated with both the male and female sterilizations clearly contradicts one of the primary purposes of marriage which is to have children, as mentioned by [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]] in his [[Ihya’ Ulum al-Din]]. 
Furthermore, sterilization is a form of mutilation of one’s body (muthla), which has been clearly forbidden in the Shari’ah. Allah Most High mentions in [[An-Nisa]] the words of [[Satan]], when he said:

{{Quote|“I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.”|[[An-Nisa]]:119}}

However, in cases of absolute necessity, sterilization does become permitted. The well-known principle of Islamic jurisprudence based on the guidelines of the Qur’an and Hadith states: {{Quote|“Necessities make prohibitions lawful.”| (Ibn Nujaym, Al-Ashbah wa al-Naza’ir 85)}}&lt;ref name="DI"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Muhammad ibn Adam |title=Permanent Contraception (Female Sterlisation) - Does Intention affect Permissibility? |url=http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5114?txt_QuestionID |website=[[Darul Ifta]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=02-08-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: 
# – It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother’s life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. 
# – When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allaah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allaah bestows upon His creation. And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;It says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faa’iq (1/383).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Islamic Fiqh Council]] stated the following: 

{{Quote|It is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by sharee’ah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar’i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to sharee’ah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy.|Islamic Fiqh Council, report no. 39 (1/5)}}

Based on this, if preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then there is nothing to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then sterilizing is prohibited.&lt;ref name="IQA3"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=She had injections to make her infertile – what is the ruling on that? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/47196 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2004-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iqs"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on having one’s tubes tied or having a hysterectomy because pregnancy exhausts her and temporary methods of contraception do not work for h |url=https://islamqa.info/en/258382 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castration==
[[Castration]] is removal of the testicles. The Arabic word translated here as castration may also refer to removal of the testicles and penis. Some scholars differentiated between the two and said: If his testicles only are cut off, then he is a eunuch; if his penis is cut off, then he is emasculated. 
It is prohibited for a person to do that deliberately to himself or to someone else. Castration of the human is prohibited in Islam, whether he is a child or an adult, because of the prohibition on hadith on that.&lt;ref name="IQA.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Castration Permissible? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/mahmoodiyah/53845 |website=Islamqa.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=20 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said:
{{quote|it is prohibited, therefore it is haraam, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that in the case of the sons of Adam (i.e., humans).}} 
Among the reports that confirm this prohibition is the following prophet Muhammad's era, when some followers wanted to be castrated in abstance of their wives, but the prophet forbade it and permitted three days [[Nikah mut'ah|temporary marriage]] for them for a certain period, but after the period he declered it permanently forbidden: 

{{quote|Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported: We were on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had no women with us. We said: Should we not have ourselves castrated? He (the Holy Prophet) forbade us to do so He then granted us permission that we should contract temporary marriage for a stipulated period giving her a garment, and 'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87).|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 11, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1404}}}}

{{quote|Sabra al-Juhanni reported on the authority of his father that while he was with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon hm) he said: 0 people, I had permitted you to contract temporary marriage with women, but Allah has forbidden it (now) until the Day of Resurrection. So he who has any (woman with this type of marriage contract) he should let her off, and do not take back anything you have given to then (as dower).|[[Sahih Muslim]]: Book 008, Number 3255}}

{{quote|According to the hadeeth of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon to be celibate. If he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated.|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 12, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1402}}}}

{{quote|It was narrated from Salamah bin Rawh bin Zinba', that : his grandfather came to the Prophet and he had castrated a slave of his. The Prophet manumitted the slave in compensation for having been mutilated.|[https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/21 Ibn Majah, Vol. 3, Book 21, Hadith 2679]}}

{{quote|Narrated Qatadah: Samurah reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: Whoever kills his slave we shall kill him, and whoever cuts the nose of his slave we shall cut off his nose. If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him.|[https://sunnah.com/abudawud/41 Sunan Abi Dawud 4516], [[Bulugh Al-Maram]]: [https://sunnah.com/bulugh/9Book 9, Hadith 120]}}

[[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said, commenting on these hadiths: 

The reason behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of struggle against the [[Kafir|disbelievers]]. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of non-muslims would have increased, and that is contrary to the religious purpose.&lt;ref name="IQAC"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=126987: The ruling on castration |url=https://islamqa.info/en/126987 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vitro fertilization==
Regarding the response to [[In Vitro Fertilization]] (IVF) of [[Islam]], the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa include that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | last = Inhorn | first = MC | title = Making Muslim babies: IVF and gamete donation in Sunni versus Shi'a Islam | journal = Cult Med Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–50 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17051430 | pmc = 1705533 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-006-9027-x | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624121701/http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | archivedate = 2009-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
*Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].

== Abortion ==
{{main|Islam and abortion}}

Islamic schools of law have differing opinions on abortion, though it is prohibited or discouraged by most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, abortion is allowed under certain circumstances, such as if the mother's health is [seriously] threatened. If the abortion is necessary to save the woman's life, Muslims universally agree that her life takes precedence over the life of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donna Lee |last=Bowen |chapter=Contemporary Muslim Ethics of Abortion |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim jurists allow abortion in this context based on the principle that what is considered the greater evil{{spaced ndash}}the woman's death{{spaced ndash}}should be warded off by accepting the lesser evil of abortion. In these cases, the physician is considered a better judge than the scholar. Abortions of pregnancies that are merely unplanned or unwanted are generally ''haram'' (forbidden). The Qur'an forbids the abortion of a fetus for fear of poverty:

{{quote|...kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them|{{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}}}
{{quote|Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you: verily the killing of them is a great sin.|{{cite quran|17|31|s=ns}}}}

Muslim views on abortion are also shaped by the [[Hadith]] as well as by the opinions of legal and religious scholars and commentators. In Islam, the fetus is believed to become a living soul after four months of gestation,&lt;ref&gt;"''(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things...then the soul is breathed into him''"&lt;br&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion after that point is generally viewed as impermissible. Many Islamic thinkers recognize exceptions to this rule for certain circumstances; indeed, [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] notes that "the majority of Muslim scholars permit abortion, although they differ on the stage of fetal development beyond which it becomes prohibited."&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Where does God stand on abortion? |first=Tom |last=Ehrich |date=August 13, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627035106/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sherman Jackson]], "while abortion, even during the first trimester, is forbidden according to a minority of jurists, it is not held to be an offense for which there are criminal or even civil sanctions," so Muslims should not support legal restrictions on abortion rights unsupported by Islamic law, as opposed to solely moral activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sherman A. |last=Jackson |chapter=Blackamerica, Immigrant Islam, and the Dominant Culture |title=Islam and the Blackamerican&lt;!-- Sic --&gt;: Looking Toward the Third Resurrection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |page=151 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426033404/https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= |isbn=9780195343571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslim scholars hold that the child of rape is a legitimate human being and therefore subject to the same laws of abortion (i.e. its abortion is permitted only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | title=Her foetus died after 66 days gestation and was miscarried after 100 days.

Some scholars disagree with this position. Some Muslim scholars{{who|date=October 2016}} also argue that abortion is permitted if the newborn might be sick in some way that would make its care exceptionally difficult for the parents (e.g. deformities, mental retardation, etc.).&lt;ref name="VRC"&gt;{{cite book |first=Vardit |last=Rispler-Chaim |chapter=The Right Not To Be Born: Abortion of the Disadvantaged Fetus in Contemporary Fatwas |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |pages=87–88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2016}}{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

'''Juhani Uolevi Pallasmaa''' (born 14 September 1936 in [[Hämeenlinna]], Finland) is a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] architect and former professor of architecture and dean at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. Among the many academic and civic positions he has held are those of Director of the Museum of Finnish Architecture 1978-1983, and head of the Institute of Industrial Arts, [[Helsinki]]. He established his own architect's office – Arkkitehtitoimisto Juhani Pallasmaa KY – in 1983 in Helsinki. From 2001 to 2003, he was  Raymond E. Maritz Visiting Professor of Architecture at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and in 2013 he received an honorary doctorate from that university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/news/8941 Honorary WUSTL Degrees for 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010-2011, Pallasmaa served as Plym Distinguished Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/juhani-pallasmaa-plym-distinguished-professor-in-architecture-2010-2011/oclc/810280328 WorldCat record for "Juhani Pallasmaa: Plym distinguished professor in architecture 2010-2011"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012-2013 he was scholar in residence at [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Frank Lloyd Wright's]] [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taliesin.edu/faculty.html Taliesin Faculty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101071306/http://www.taliesin.edu/faculty.html |date= 1 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pallasmaa has also lectured widely in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia.

His exhibitions of Finnish architecture, planning and visual arts have been displayed in more than thirty countries and he has written numerous articles on cultural philosophy, [[environmental psychology]] and theories of architecture and the arts. Many of his articles are first featured in ''ARK'' (''The Finnish Architectural Review'').

Among Pallasmaa's many books on architectural theory is ''The Eyes of the Skin – Architecture and the Senses'', a book that has become a classic of architectural theory and is required reading on courses in many schools of architecture around the world.

A selection of essays written by Pallasmaa, from the early years to more recent ones, has been translated into English and collated together in the book ''Encounters – Architectural Essays'' (Helsinki, 2005), edited by Peter MacKeith. The book was shortlisted for the [[RIBA]] 2005 International Book Award.

In 2006 Pallasmaa turned 70, and the occasion was marked by the publication of the book ''Archipelago. Essays on Architecture'', edited by Peter MacKeith. The collection contains essays by 23 authors, all with some connection to Pallasmaa or MacKeith. They include: Karsten Harries, [[Daniel Hoffman|Dan Hoffman]], [[Steven Holl]], [[Colin St. John Wilson]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

Pallasmaa is a member of the [[Finnish Association of Architects]], and an honorary [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects|Fellow]] of the [[American Institute of Architects]].  During the spring of 2010, Pallasmaa, along with American playwright Leigh Fondakowski, was an Imagine Fund Distinguished Visiting Chair at the [[Institute for Advanced Study at University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121210122720/http://ias.umn.edu/2010/04/05/imagine-fund-chairs-april-2010/ Imagine Fund Chairs]&lt;/ref&gt; Pallasmaa was jury member for the 2014 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/jury-bios Pritzker Architecture Prize 2014 Jury Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural career==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moduli 225, model industrial summer house, 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|200px|Moduli 225 industrially-produced summer house (with Kristian Gullichsen), 1969-71.]] --&gt;
In terms of architectural production, the work Juhani Pallasmaa has undergone a shift during his career. His early career is characterised by concerns with rationalism, standardization and prefabrication. This was partly due to the influence of his mentor Professor Aulis Blomstedt, who was very much concerned with proportional systems and standardization. Pallasmaa's first key work demonstrating these principles was the Moduli 225 (with [[Kristian Gullichsen]]), an industrial-produced summer house, 1969-1971, of which around six were built in Finland. However, the key models for this type of architecture were both Japanese architecture and the refined abstractions of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. In Finland this type of architecture is referred to as "constructivism" - with only a family resemblance to the avant-gardist [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivism]] - and at that time, the late 1950s and 1960s, stood in opposition to the work of [[Alvar Aalto]], who was increasingly seen in his home country as an idiosyncratic individualist. But the interest in Japan also contained the seeds for Pallasmaa's later concerns; materiality and a phenomenology of experience. It was after returning from teaching in Africa that Pallasmaa turned away from pure constructivism, and took up his concerns with psychology, culture, and [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]]. His concern for details and small works such as exhibition design has sometimes earned him the label "jewel-box architect". 2006 saw the completion of his largest ever work, the [[Kamppi Center]], incorporating the main  bus station, a shopping centre and housing in central Helsinki, though the work was split up into different sections involving various architects, and overall design was under the control of architects Helin &amp; Co.

Data is from the 18th edition of [[Ethnologue|''Ethnologue: Languages of the World'']].]]

'''Linguistic diversity index''' ('''LDI''') may refer to either [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg’s]] (language) Diversity Index&lt;ref name="greenberg1956"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=410659 | title=The Measurement of Linguistic Diversity | journal=Language | year=1956 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=109–115 | last=Greenberg | first=Joseph H. | doi=10.2307/410659}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the related Index of Linguistic Diversity (ILD) from [[Terralingua]], which measures changes in the underlying LDI over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=97–151 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenberg's Diversity Index (LDI) is the probability that two people selected from the population at random will have different mother tongues; it therefore ranges from 0 (everyone has the same mother tongue) to 1 (no two people have the same mother tongue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=country |title=Summary by country |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILD measures how the LDI has changed over time; a global ILD of 0.8 indicates a 20% loss of diversity since 1970, but ratios above 1 are possible, and have appeared in regional indexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=106–107 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computation of the diversity index is based on the population of each language as a proportion of the total population.  The index cannot fully account for the vitality of languages.  Also, the distinction between a language and a [[dialect]] is fluid and often political. A great number of languages are considered to be dialects of another language by some experts and separate languages by others.  The index does not consider how different the languages are from each other, nor does it account for second language usage; it considers only the total number of distinct languages, and their relative frequency as mother tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/overview/ |title=overview of Linguistic Diversity |publisher=terralingua.org |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shapiro holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the [[University of Scranton]]. Shapiro is an on-line lecturer for Torah in Motion, for which he also leads Jewish history tours to Europe and Morocco. He often writes for the Seforim Blog.

Shapiro has been a resident of [[West Orange, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginsberg, Johanna. [http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/060106/njLocalScholarOrganizes.html "Local scholar organizes conference on history of Modern Orthodoxy"], ''[[New Jersey Jewish News]]'', June 1, 2006. Accessed June 28, 2018. "A West Orange scholar is the co-organizer of the first-ever conference in America on the history of Modern Orthodoxy, to be held June 13–15 in Scranton, Pa. Marc B. Shapiro, who holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Jewish Studies at the University of Scranton, said the conference will take a historical view of the movement in order to explore its meaning for today."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
Shapiro's writings often challenge the bounds of the conventional Orthodox understanding of Judaism using academic methodology while adhering to Modern Orthodox sensibilities. His book, ''Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy,'' a biography of [[Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg]], was a National Jewish Book Award finalist. His second book, ''The Limits of Orthodox Theology'', also a National Jewish Book Award finalist, argued against the conventional Orthodox belief that [[Maimonides]] Thirteen Principles of Faith are unquestionable dogma.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/news/6488/author-challenges-rambam-s-principles/|title=Author Challenges Rambam's Principles|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gidon Rothstein, writing in the Association for Jewish Studies Review, called the book's collection of sources "remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rothstein|first=Gidon|date=2005-04-01|title=Marc B. Shapiro. The Limits of Orthodox Theology: Maimonides' Thirteen Principles Reappraised. The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization.

The book was criticized by some Hareidi Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Zev Leff]], an American [[Haredi Judaism|Hareidi]] rabbi, wrote that "I cannot recommend it to the general public, who can be easily misled by some of the questionable theses in this book."&lt;ref name="Leff"&gt;http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/pdf/ja/5767/summer67/76_79.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, his book ''Changing the Immutable: How Orthodox Judaism Rewrites Its History'' was released. The book documents the phenomenon of internal censorship in Orthodoxy. [[Adam Ferziger]] said the book "is the outstanding product of a master of rabbinic literature and an extraordinarily sharp-eyed and meticulous scholar."&lt;ref&gt;http://marginalia.lareviewofbooks.org/the-sagacious-scholar-and-the-censor-by-adam-ferziger/&lt;/ref&gt; Yair Hoffman, writing in the Hareidi online website [[Yeshiva World News]], criticized the book, saying that "there is a plethora of material that simply should not have been included in the book because it does not back up his thesis."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/313895/book-review-of-changing-the-immutble.html|title=Book Review: Marc Shapiro's "Changing the Immutable"|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ezra Glinter, writing in [[The Forward]], praised Shapiro's "evenhanded, evidence-heavy approach" and that he was not a "polemicist," but said "his argument could also have benefited from a more critical thrust."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://forward.com/culture/311651/orthodoxys-inconvenient-truths/|title=Orthodoxy's Inconvenient Truths|last=Glinter|first=Ezra|date=2015-07-13|work=The Forward|access-date=2017-03-05|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1003">The '''Master of Science in Organizational Leadership''' (MSOL) is a multidisciplinary [[master's degree]] in [[leadership studies]].

It is an alternative to, not a substitute for, the traditional [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA) degree. The MSOL degree is multidisciplinary and focuses more on people and [[organizational design|organization issues]], and relatively less on business topics such as finance, accounting and marketing. (For example, the MSOL will offer courses in psychology and philosophy as well as courses in business and management.) Also, The MSOL degree is intended for those who are already established in a career, while, in contrast, those who are preparing to enter the world of work or change careers often seek an MBA degree. 

The MSOL degree is similar to the [[Master of Science in Leadership]] (MSL) degree and the Masters of Organizational Leadership (MAOL).

A '''neutrino detector''' is a physics apparatus which is designed to study [[neutrino]]s. Because neutrinos only [[Weak interaction|weakly interact]] with other particles of matter, neutrino detectors must be very large to detect a significant number of neutrinos. Neutrino detectors are often built underground, to isolate the detector from [[cosmic ray]]s and other background radiation.&lt;ref name=twsP16/&gt; The field of  [[neutrino astronomy]] is still very much in its infancy &amp;ndash; the only confirmed extraterrestrial sources so far as of 2018 are the [[Sun]], the [[SN 1987A|supernova 1987A]] in the nearby [[Large Magellenic Cloud]], and the [[blazar]] [[TXS 0506+056]] about 3.7 billion light years away. Neutrino observatories will "give astronomers fresh eyes with which to study the universe."&lt;ref name=twsP14/&gt;

Various detection methods have been used. [[Super Kamiokande]] is a large volume of water surrounded by [[phototube]]s that watch for the [[Cherenkov radiation]] emitted when an incoming neutrino creates an [[electron]] or [[muon]] in the water. The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] is similar, but uses [[heavy water]] as the detecting medium. Other detectors have consisted of large volumes of [[chlorine]] or [[gallium]] which are periodically checked for excesses of [[argon]] or [[germanium]], respectively, which are created by neutrinos interacting with the original substance. [[MINOS]] uses a solid plastic [[scintillator]] watched by [[phototube]]s; [[Borexino]] uses a liquid [[pseudocumene]] [[scintillator]] also watched by [[phototube]]s; and the [[NOνA]] detector uses a liquid scintillator watched by [[avalanche photodiode]]s.

The proposed acoustic detection of neutrinos via the [[thermoacoustics|thermoacoustic]] effect is the subject of dedicated studies done by the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]], [[IceCube]], and [[KM3NeT]] collaborations.

Despite how common they are, neutrinos are extremely "difficult to detect" due to their low mass and lack of electric charge. Unlike other particles, neutrinos only interact via gravity and the [[neutral current]] (involving the exchange of a [[W and Z bosons|Z boson]]) or charged current (involving the exchange of a [[W and Z bosons|W boson]]) [[weak interaction]]s. As they have only a "smidgen of rest mass" according to the laws of physics, perhaps less than a "millionth as much as an electron,"&lt;ref name="twsP16" /&gt; the gravitational force caused by neutrinos has proven too weak to detect, leaving the weak interaction as the main method for detection: 

*In a neutral current interaction, the neutrino enters and then leaves the detector after having transferred some of its energy and momentum to a target particle. If the target particle is charged and sufficiently light (e.g. an electron), it may be accelerated to a relativistic speed and consequently emit [[Cherenkov radiation]], which can be observed directly. All three neutrino flavors can participate regardless of the neutrino energy. However, no neutrino flavor information is left behind.
*In a charged current interaction, a high-energy neutrino transforms into its partner lepton (electron, muon, or tau).&lt;ref name=twsP15/&gt; However, if the neutrino does not have sufficient energy to create its heavier partner's mass, the charged current interaction is unavailable to it. Neutrinos from the sun and from nuclear reactors have enough energy to create electrons. Most accelerator-based neutrino beams can also create muons, and a few can create taus. A detector which can distinguish among these leptons can reveal the flavor of the incident neutrino in a charged current interaction. Because the interaction involves the exchange of a charged boson, the target particle also changes character (e.g., neutron → proton).

==Detection techniques==

===Scintillators===
[[Antineutrino]]s were first detected near the [[Savannah River Site|Savannah River nuclear reactor]] by the [[Cowan–Reines neutrino experiment]] in 1956. [[Frederick Reines]] and [[Clyde Cowan]] used two targets containing a solution of cadmium chloride in water. Two [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] detectors were placed next to the cadmium targets. Antineutrinos with an energy above the [[threshold energy|threshold]] of 1.8 [[electronvolt|MeV]] caused charged current "inverse beta-decay" interactions with the protons in the water, producing positrons and neutrons. The resulting positron annihilations with electrons created pairs of coincident photons with an energy of about 0.5 MeV each, which could be detected by the two scintillation detectors above and below the target. The neutrons were captured by cadmium nuclei resulting in delayed gamma rays of about 8 MeV that were detected a few microseconds after the photons from a positron annihilation event.

This experiment was designed by Cowan and Reines to give a unique signature for antineutrinos, to prove the existence of these particles. It was not the experimental goal to measure the total antineutrino [[flux]]. The detected antineutrinos thus all carried an energy greater 1.8 MeV, which is the threshold for the reaction channel used (1.8 MeV is the energy needed to create a positron and a neutron from a proton). Only about 3% of the antineutrinos from a nuclear reactor carry enough energy for the reaction to occur.

A more recently built and much larger [[Kamioka Liquid Scintillator Antineutrino Detector|KamLAND]] detector used similar techniques to study [[neutrino oscillation|oscillations]] of antineutrinos from 53 Japanese nuclear power plants. A smaller, but more radiopure [[Borexino]] detector was able to measure the most important components of the neutrino spectrum from the Sun, as well as antineutrinos from Earth and nuclear reactors.

===Radiochemical methods===
Chlorine detectors, based on the method suggested by [[Bruno Pontecorvo]], consist of a tank filled with a chlorine containing fluid such as [[tetrachloroethylene]]. A neutrino converts a [[chlorine]]-37 atom into one of [[argon]]-37 via the charged current interaction. The threshold neutrino energy for this reaction is 0.814 MeV. The fluid is periodically purged with [[helium]] gas which would remove the argon. The helium is then cooled to separate out the argon, and the argon atoms are counted based on their [[electron capture]] radioactive decays. A chlorine detector in the former [[Homestake Mine (South Dakota)|Homestake Mine]] near [[Lead, South Dakota]], containing 520 [[short ton]]s (470 [[metric ton]]s) of fluid, was the first to detect the solar neutrinos, and made the first measurement of the deficit of electron neutrinos from the sun (see [[Solar neutrino problem]]).

A similar detector design, with a much lower detection threshold of 0.233 MeV, uses a [[gallium]] → [[germanium]] transformation which is sensitive to lower-energy neutrinos. A neutrino is able to react with an atom of gallium-71, converting it into an atom of the unstable isotope [[germanium]]-71. The germanium was then chemically extracted and concentrated. Neutrinos were thus detected by measuring the radioactive decay of germanium. This latter method is nicknamed the "[[Alsace-Lorraine]]" technique because of the reaction sequence (gallium-germanium-gallium) involved. Gallium and germanium are named after France and Germany, respectively, and ownership of the Alsace-Lorraine territory has historically been a point of contention between France and Germany, thus the nickname of the technique. These radiochemical detection methods are useful only for counting neutrinos; no neutrino direction or energy information is available. The [[SAGE (Soviet–American Gallium Experiment)|SAGE]] experiment in Russia used about 50 tons, and the [[GALLEX]]/[[Gallium Neutrino Observatory|GNO]] experiments in Italy about 30 tons, of [[gallium]] as reaction mass. This experiment is difficult to scale up due to the prohibitive cost of gallium. Larger experiments have therefore turned to a cheaper reaction mass.

===Cherenkov detectors===
"Ring-imaging" Cherenkov detectors take advantage of a phenomenon called [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]]. Cherenkov radiation is produced whenever charged particles such as electrons or muons are moving through a given detector medium somewhat faster than the [[speed of light#In a medium|speed of light in that medium]]. In a Cherenkov detector, a large volume of clear material such as water or ice is surrounded by light-sensitive [[photomultiplier]] tubes. A charged lepton produced with sufficient energy and moving through such a detector does travel somewhat faster than the speed of light in the detector medium (although somewhat slower than the speed of light in a [[vacuum]]). The charged lepton generates a visible "optical shockwave" of [[Cherenkov radiation]]. This radiation is detected by the photomultiplier tubes and shows up as a characteristic ring-like pattern of activity in the array of photomultiplier tubes. As neutrinos can interact with atomic nuclei to produce charged leptons which emit Cherenkov radiation, this pattern can be used to infer direction, energy, and (sometimes) flavor information about incident neutrinos.

Two water-filled detectors of this type (Kamiokande and [[Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (detector)|IMB]]) recorded a neutrino burst from supernova [[SN 1987A]].&lt;ref name=twsP11&gt;{{cite news

The largest such detector is the water-filled [[Super-Kamiokande]]. This detector uses 50,000 tons of pure water surrounded by 11,000 photomultiplier tubes buried 1&amp;nbsp;km underground.

The [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) uses 1,000 tonnes of [[ultrapure water|ultrapure]] [[heavy water]] contained in a 12-metre-diameter vessel made of acrylic plastic surrounded by a cylinder of ultrapure ordinary water 22 metres in diameter and 34 metres high.&lt;ref name=twsP15&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the neutrino interactions visible in a regular water detector, a neutrino can break up the deuterium in heavy water. The resulting free neutron is subsequently captured, releasing a burst of gamma rays that can be detected. All three neutrino flavors participate equally in this dissociation reaction.

The [[MiniBooNE]] detector employs pure [[mineral oil]] as its detection medium. Mineral oil is a natural [[scintillator]], so charged particles without sufficient energy to produce Cherenkov light still produce scintillation light. Low-energy muons and protons, invisible in water, can be detected.
[[File:Antares Neutrinoteleskop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An illustration of the Antares neutrino detector deployed under water.]]
Located at a depth of about 2.5&amp;nbsp;km in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the [[ANTARES (telescope)|ANTARES]] ('''''A'''stronomy with a '''N'''eutrino '''T'''elescope and '''A'''byss environmental '''RES'''earch'') is fully operational since May 30, 2008. Consisting of an array of twelve separate 350-[[meter]]-long vertical detector strings 70 meters apart, each with 75 [[photomultiplier]] optical modules, this detector uses the surrounding sea water as the detector medium. The next generation deep sea neutrino telescope [[KM3NeT]] will have a total instrumented volume of about 5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The detector will be distributed over three installation sites in the Mediterranean. Implementation of the first phase of the telescope was started in 2013.

The [[Antarctic Muon And Neutrino Detector Array]] (AMANDA) operated from 1996 to 2004. This detector used photomultiplier tubes mounted in strings buried deep (1.5–2&amp;nbsp;km) inside [[Antarctic]] glacial ice near the [[South Pole]]. The ice itself is the detector medium. The direction of incident neutrinos is determined by recording the arrival time of individual [[photon]]s using a three-dimensional array of detector modules each containing one photomultiplier tube. This method allows detection of neutrinos above [[electronvolt|50 GeV]] with a spatial resolution of approximately 2 [[degree (angle)|degrees]]. AMANDA was used to generate neutrino maps of the northern sky to search for extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to search for [[dark matter]]. AMANDA has been upgraded to the [[IceCube]] observatory, eventually increasing the volume of the detector array to one cubic kilometer.&lt;ref name=twsP13&gt;{{cite news

===Radio detectors===
The [[Radio Ice Cherenkov Experiment]] uses antennas to detect Cherenkov radiation from high-energy neutrinos in Antarctica. The [[Antarctic Impulse Transient Antenna]] (ANITA) is a balloon-borne device flying over Antarctica and detecting [[Askaryan effect|Askaryan radiation]] produced by ultra-high-energy neutrinos interacting with the ice below.

===Tracking calorimeters===
Tracking calorimeters such as the [[MINOS]] detectors use alternating planes of absorber material and detector material. The absorber planes provide detector mass while the detector planes provide the tracking information. Steel is a popular absorber choice, being relatively dense and inexpensive and having the advantage that it can be magnetised. The [[NOνA]] proposal suggests eliminating the absorber planes in favor of using a very large active detector volume. The active detector is often liquid or plastic scintillator, read out with photomultiplier tubes, although various kinds of ionisation chambers have also been used.

Tracking calorimeters are only useful for high-energy (GeV range) neutrinos. At these energies, neutral current interactions appear as a shower of hadronic debris and charged current interactions are identified by the presence of the charged lepton's track (possibly alongside some form of hadronic debris.) A muon produced in a charged current interaction leaves a long penetrating track and is easy to spot. The length of this muon track and its curvature in the magnetic field provide energy and charge ({{SubatomicParticle|Muon}} versus {{SubatomicParticle|Antimuon}}) information. An electron in the detector produces an electromagnetic shower which can be distinguished from hadronic showers if the granularity of the active detector is small compared to the physical extent of the shower. Tau leptons decay essentially immediately to either pions or another charged lepton and cannot be observed directly in this kind of detector. (To directly observe taus, one typically looks for a kink in tracks in photographic emulsion.)

===Coherent Recoil Detector===
At low energies, a neutrino can scatter from the entire nucleus of an atom, rather than the individual nucleons, in a process known as "Coherent Neutral Current Neutrino-Nucleus Elastic Scattering".&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Lindley (Oct. 18, 2012).

==Background suppression==
Most neutrino experiments must address the flux of [[cosmic ray]]s that bombard the Earth's surface.

The higher-energy (&gt;50 MeV or so) neutrino experiments often cover or surround the primary detector with a "veto" detector which reveals when a cosmic ray passes into the primary detector, allowing the corresponding activity in the primary detector to be ignored ("vetoed").

For lower-energy experiments, the cosmic rays are not directly the problem. Instead, the [[spallation]] neutrons and radioisotopes produced by the cosmic rays may mimic the desired signals. For these experiments, the solution is to place the detector deep underground so that the earth above can reduce the cosmic ray rate to acceptable levels.

==Telescopes==
Neutrino detectors can be aimed at astrophysics observations, many astrophysics events being believed to emit neutrinos.

'''Processor design''' is the [[design engineer]]ing task of creating a [[processor (computing)|processor]], a component of [[computer hardware]]. It is a subfield of [[computer engineering]] (design, development and implementation) and [[electronics engineering]] (fabrication). The design process involves choosing an [[instruction set]] and a certain execution paradigm (e.g. [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] or [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]]) and results in a [[microarchitecture]], which might be described in e.g. [[VHDL]] or [[Verilog]]. For [[microprocessor]] design, this description is then manufactured employing some of the various [[semiconductor device fabrication]] processes, resulting in a [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] which is bonded onto a [[chip carrier]]. This chip carrier is then soldered onto, or inserted into a [[CPU socket|socket]] on, a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB).

The mode of operation of any processor is the execution of lists of instructions. Instructions typically include those to compute or manipulate data values using [[Processor register|registers]], change or retrieve values in read/write memory, perform relational tests between data values and to control program flow.

== Details ==
{{Prose|section|date=May 2011}}

=== Basics ===
CPU design is divided into design of the following components:

# [[datapath]]s (such as [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]s and [[Pipeline (computing)|pipelines]])
# [[control unit]]: logic which controls the datapaths
# [[Memory (computing)|Memory]] components such as [[register file]]s, [[cache memory|cache]]s
# [[Clock signal|Clock]] circuitry such as clock drivers, [[Phase-locked loop|PLLs]], [[clock distribution network]]s
# Pad transceiver circuitry
# [[Logic gate]] cell [[Library (electronics)|library]] which is used to implement the logic

CPUs designed for high-performance markets might require custom (optimized or application specific (see below)) designs for each of these items to achieve frequency, [[power consumption|power-dissipation]], and chip-area goals whereas CPUs designed for lower performance markets might lessen the implementation burden by acquiring some of these items by purchasing them as [[intellectual property]]. Control logic implementation techniques ([[logic synthesis]] using CAD tools) can be used to implement datapaths, register files, and clocks. Common logic styles used in CPU design include unstructured random logic, [[finite-state machine]]s, [[microprogramming]] (common from 1965 to 1985), and [[Programmable logic array]]s (common in the 1980s, no longer common).

=== Implementation logic ===
Device types used to implement the logic include:
* [[Transistor-transistor logic]] [[Small Scale Integration]] logic chips - no longer used for CPUs
* [[Programmable Array Logic]] and [[Programmable logic device]]s - no longer used for CPUs
* [[Emitter-coupled logic]] (ECL) [[gate array]]s - no longer common

*[[CMOS]] [[gate array]]s - no longer used for CPUs

*[[CMOS]] [[Integrated circuit|mass-produced IC]]s - the vast majority of CPUs by volume
*[[CMOS]] [[Application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]]s - only for a minority of special applications due to expense
*[[Field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGA) - common for [[soft microprocessor]]s, and more or less required for [[reconfigurable computing]]

A CPU design project generally has these major tasks:
* Programmer-visible [[instruction set architecture]], which can be implemented by a variety of [[microarchitecture]]s
* Architectural study and performance modeling in [[ANSI C]]/[[C++]] or [[SystemC]]{{clarify|date=January 2013}}
* [[High-level synthesis]] (HLS) or [[register transfer level]] (RTL, e.g. logic) implementation
* RTL verification
* [[Circuit design]] of speed critical components (caches, registers, ALUs)
* [[Logic synthesis]] or logic-gate-level design
* [[Static timing analysis|Timing analysis]] to confirm that all logic and circuits will run at the specified operating frequency
* Physical design including [[Floorplan (microelectronics)#Floorplanning|floorplanning]], [[place and route]] of logic gates
* Checking that RTL, gate-level, transistor-level and physical-level representations are equivalent
* Checks for [[signal integrity]], [[design rule checking|chip manufacturability]]

Re-designing a CPU core to a smaller die-area helps to shrink everything (a "[[photomask]] shrink"), resulting in the same number of transistors on a smaller die. It improves performance (smaller transistors switch faster), reduces power (smaller wires have less [[parasitic capacitance]]) and reduces cost (more CPUs fit on the same wafer of silicon). Releasing a CPU on the same size die, but with a smaller CPU core, keeps the cost about the same but allows higher levels of integration within one [[very-large-scale integration]] chip (additional cache, multiple CPUs or other components), improving performance and reducing overall system cost.

As with most complex electronic designs, the [[functional verification|logic verification]] effort (proving that the design does
not have bugs) now dominates the project schedule of a CPU.

Key CPU architectural innovations include [[index register]], [[CPU cache|cache]], [[virtual memory]], [[instruction pipelining]], [[superscalar]], [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]], [[Reduced instruction set computer|RISC]], [[virtual machine]], [[emulator]]s, [[microprogram]], and [[Stack (data structure)|stack]].

=== Micro-architectural concepts ===
{{Main|Microarchitecture}}

=== Research topics ===
&lt;!-- [[virtual memory]] moved to [[Computer architecture]] --&gt;
{{Main|History of general-purpose CPUs#1990 to today: looking forward}}

A variety of [[History of general-purpose CPUs#1990 to today: looking forward|new CPU design ideas]] have been proposed,
including [[reconfigurable logic]], [[clockless CPU]]s, [[computational RAM]], and [[optical computing]].

===Performance analysis and benchmarking===
{{Main| Computer performance}}
[[benchmark (computing)|Benchmarking]] is a way of testing CPU speed. Examples include SPECint and [[SPECfp]], developed by [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]], and [[ConsumerMark]] developed by the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium [[EEMBC]].

Some of the commonly used metrics include:
* [[Instructions per second]] - Most consumers pick a computer architecture (normally [[Intel]] [[IA32]] architecture) to be able to run a large base of pre-existing pre-compiled software.  Being relatively uninformed on computer benchmarks,  some of them pick a particular CPU based on operating frequency (see [[Megahertz Myth]]).
* [[FLOPS]] - The number of floating point operations per second is often important in selecting computers for scientific computations.
* [[Performance per watt]] - System designers building [[parallel computing|parallel computers]], such as [[Google search technology#Current hardware|Google]], pick CPUs based on their speed per watt of power, because the cost of powering the CPU outweighs the cost of the CPU itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/consumer.asp?HTYPE=SIM|title=EEMBC ConsumerMark|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050327005323/http://www.eembc.org/benchmark/consumer.asp?HTYPE=SIM |archivedate=March 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/power-could-cost-more-than-servers-google-warns/|title=Power could cost more than servers, Google warns|author=Stephen Shankland|date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some system designers building parallel computers pick CPUs based on the speed per dollar.
* System designers building [[real-time computing]] systems want to guarantee worst-case response. That is easier to do when the CPU has low [[interrupt latency]] and when it has deterministic response. ([[Digital signal processor|DSP]])
* Computer programmers who program directly in assembly language want a CPU to support a full featured [[instruction set]].
* Low power - For systems with limited power sources (e.g. solar, batteries, human power).
* Small size or low weight - for portable embedded systems, systems for spacecraft.
* Environmental impact - Minimizing environmental impact of computers during manufacturing and recycling as well during use.  Reducing waste, reducing hazardous materials.  (see [[Green computing]]).  &lt;!-- ... Are there other measures of "goodness", "figures of merit", that I'm missing here? --&gt;

There may be tradeoffs in optimizing some of these metrics.  In particular, many design techniques that make a CPU run faster make the "performance per watt", "performance per dollar", and "deterministic response" much worse, and vice versa.

==Markets==
There are several different markets in which CPUs are used. Since each of these markets differ in their requirements for CPUs, the devices designed for one market are in most cases inappropriate for the other markets.

===General purpose computing===
The vast majority of revenues generated from CPU sales is for general purpose computing{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, that is, desktop, laptop, and server computers commonly used in businesses and homes. In this market, the Intel [[IA-32]] and the 64-bit version [[x86-64]] architecture dominate the market, with its rivals [[PowerPC]] and [[SPARC]] maintaining much smaller customer bases. Yearly, hundreds of millions of IA-32 architecture CPUs are used by this market.  A growing percentage of these processors are for mobile implementations such as netbooks and laptops.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, Justin. [http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/amd_loses_market_share_mobile_cpu_sales_outsell_desktop_first_time "AMD Loses Market Share as Mobile CPU Sales Outsell Desktop for the First Time."]  Maximum PC.  Published 2010-10-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since these devices are used to run countless different types of programs, these CPU designs are not specifically targeted at one type of application or one function. The demands of being able to run a wide range of programs efficiently has made these CPU designs among the more advanced technically, along with some disadvantages of being relatively costly, and having high power consumption.

====High-end processor economics====
In 1984, most high-performance CPUs required four to five years to develop.&lt;ref&gt;
"New system manages hundreds of transactions per second" article
by Robert Horst and Sandra Metz, of Tandem Computers Inc.,
"Electronics" magazine, 1984 April 19:
"While most high-performance CPUs require four to five years to develop,
The [[NonStop]] TXP processor took just 2+1/2 years --
six months to develop a complete written specification,
one year to construct a working prototype,
and another year to reach volume production."
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific computing===
{{Main|Supercomputer}}
Scientific computing is a much smaller niche market (in revenue and units shipped).  It is used in government research labs and universities. Before 1990, CPU design was often done for this market, but mass market CPUs organized into large clusters have proven to be more affordable. The main remaining area of active hardware design and research for scientific computing is for high-speed data transmission systems to connect mass market CPUs.

=== Embedded design ===
{{Main|Embedded system}}
As measured by units shipped, most CPUs are embedded in other machinery, such as telephones, clocks, appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure. Embedded processors sell in the volume of many billions of units per year, however, mostly at much lower price points than that of the general purpose processors.

These single-function devices differ from the more familiar general-purpose CPUs in several ways:
* Low cost is of high importance.
* It is important to maintain a low power dissipation as embedded devices often have a limited battery life and it is often impractical to include cooling fans.&lt;ref&gt;S. Mittal, "[https://www.academia.edu/4186102/A_survey_of_techniques_for_improving_energy_efficiency_in_embedded_computing_systems A survey of techniques for improving energy efficiency in embedded computing systems]", IJCAET, 6(4), 440–459, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* To give lower system cost, peripherals are integrated with the processor on the same silicon chip.
* Keeping peripherals on-chip also reduces power consumption as external GPIO ports typically require buffering so that they can source or sink the relatively high current loads that are required to maintain a strong signal outside of the chip.
** Many embedded applications have a limited amount of physical space for circuitry; keeping peripherals on-chip will reduce the space required for the circuit board.
** The program and data memories are often integrated on the same chip. When the only allowed program memory is [[Read-only memory|ROM]], the device is known as a [[microcontroller]].
* For many embedded applications, interrupt latency will be more critical than in some general-purpose processors.

====Embedded processor economics====
The embedded CPU family with the largest number of total units shipped is the [[8051]], averaging nearly a billion units per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://people.wallawalla.edu/~curt.nelson/engr355/lecture/8051_overview.pdf |title=8051 Overview |author=Curtis A. Nelson |accessdate=2011-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009101426/http://people.wallawalla.edu/~curt.nelson/engr355/lecture/8051_overview.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 8051 is widely used because it is very inexpensive.  The design time is now roughly zero, because it is widely available as commercial intellectual property.  It is now often embedded as a small part of a larger system on a chip.  The silicon cost of an 8051 is now as low as US$0.001, because some implementations use as few as 2,200 logic gates and take 0.0127 square millimeters of silicon.&lt;ref&gt;

As of 2009, more CPUs are produced using the [[ARM architecture]] instruction set than any other 32-bit instruction set.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The ARM architecture and the first ARM chip were designed in about one and a half years and 5 human years of work time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090606152116/http://atterer.net/acorn/arm.html "ARM's way"] 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The 32-bit [[Parallax Propeller]] microcontroller architecture and the first chip were designed by two people in about 10 human years of work time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallax.com/Portals/0/Downloads/docs/article/WhythePropellerWorks.pdf "Why the Propeller Works"] by [[Chip Gracey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 8-bit [[Atmel AVR|AVR architecture]] and first AVR microcontroller was conceived and designed by two students at the Norwegian Institute of Technology.

The 8-bit 6502 architecture and the first [[MOS Technology 6502]] chip were designed in 13 months by a group of about 9 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://silicongenesis.stanford.edu/transcripts/mensch.htm "Interview with William Mensch"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Research and educational CPU design ====

The 32 bit [[Berkeley RISC]] I and RISC II architecture and the first chips were mostly designed by a series of students as part of a four quarter sequence of graduate courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/1982/CSD-82-106.pdf|title=Design and Implementation of RISC I|author1=C.H. Séquin|authorlink1=Carlo H. Sequin|author2=D.A. Patterson|authorlink2=David A. Patterson (scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This design became the basis of the commercial [[SPARC]] processor design.

For about a decade, every student taking the 6.004 class at MIT was part of a team—each team had one semester to design and build a simple 8 bit CPU out of [[7400 series]] [[integrated circuit]]s.
One team of 4 students designed and built a simple 32 bit CPU during that semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sub-zero.mit.edu/fbyte/hacks/vhs/|title=the VHS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227055013/http://sub-zero.mit.edu/fbyte/hacks/vhs/|archive-date=2010-02-27}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some undergraduate courses require a team of 2 to 5 students to design, implement, and test a simple CPU in a FPGA in a single 15-week semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fpgacpu.org/teaching.html|title=Teaching Computer Design with FPGAs|author=Jan Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MultiTitan CPU was designed with 2.5 man years of effort, which was considered "relatively little design effort" at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Norman P. Jouppi|author2=Jeffrey Y. F. Tang|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.85.988&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=A 20-MIPS Sustained 32-bit CMOS Microprocessor with High Ratio of Sustained to Peak Performance|year=1989|page=i|citeseerx=10.1.1.85.988}}&lt;/ref&gt;
24 people contributed to the 3.5 year MultiTitan research project, which included designing and building a prototype CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/WRL-87-8.pdf|title=MultiTitan: Four Architecture Papers|year=1988|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Soft microprocessor cores ====
{{Main|Soft microprocessor}}
For embedded systems, the highest performance levels are often not needed or desired due to the power consumption requirements. This allows for the use of processors which can be totally implemented by [[logic synthesis]] techniques. These synthesized processors can be implemented in a much shorter amount of time, giving quicker time-to-market.

A '''recommender system''' or a '''recommendation system''' (sometimes replacing "system" with a synonym such as platform or engine) is a subclass of [[information filtering system]] that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference"  a user would give to an item.&lt;ref name="handbook" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1992403,00.html|title=Facebook, Pandora Lead Rise of Recommendation Engines - TIME|date=27 May 2010|work=TIME.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general. There are also recommender systems for experts,&lt;ref name="expertseer"&gt;H. Chen, A. G. Ororbia II, C. L.

== Overview ==

Recommender systems typically produce a list of recommendations in one of two ways – through [[collaborative filtering]] or through [[content-based filtering]] (also known as the personality-based approach).&lt;ref&gt;Hosein Jafarkarimi; A.T.H. Sim and R. Saadatdoost [http://www.ijiet.org/show-31-222-1.html A Naïve Recommendation Model for Large Databases], International Journal of Information and Education Technology, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Collaborative filtering]] approaches build a model from a user's past behaviour (items previously purchased or selected and/or numerical ratings given to those items) as well as similar decisions made by other users. This model is then used to predict items (or ratings for items) that the user may have an interest in.&lt;ref name="Recommender2010"&gt;Prem Melville and Vikas Sindhwani, [http://www.prem-melville.com/publications/recommender-systems-eml2010.pdf Recommender Systems], Encyclopedia of Machine Learning, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Content-based filtering]] approaches utilize a series of discrete characteristics of an item in order to recommend additional items with similar properties.&lt;ref name="mooney99"&gt;
{{cite conference |author1=R. J. Mooney  |author2=L. Roy  |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1999 |title = Content-based book recommendation using learning for text categorization |conference = In Workshop Recom. Sys.: Algo. and Evaluation }}
&lt;/ref&gt; These approaches are often combined (see [[Recommender system#Hybrid recommender systems|Hybrid Recommender Systems]]).

The differences between collaborative and content-based filtering can be demonstrated by comparing two popular music recommender systems – [[Last.fm]] and [[Pandora Radio]].
* Last.fm creates a "station" of recommended songs by observing what bands and individual tracks the user has listened to on a regular basis and comparing those against the listening behavior of other users. Last.fm will play tracks that do not appear in the user's library, but are often played by other users with similar interests. As this approach leverages the behavior of users, it is an example of a collaborative filtering technique.
* Pandora uses the properties of a song or artist (a subset of the 400 attributes provided by the [[Music Genome Project]]) to seed a "station" that plays music with similar properties. User feedback is used to refine the station's results, deemphasizing certain attributes when a user "dislikes" a particular song and emphasizing other attributes when a user "likes" a song. This is an example of a content-based approach.

Each type of system has its strengths and weaknesses. In the above example, Last.fm requires a large amount of information about a user to make accurate recommendations. This is an example of the [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]] problem, and is common in collaborative filtering systems.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Pandora needs very little information to start, it is far more limited in scope (for example, it can only make recommendations that are similar to the original seed).

Recommender systems are a useful alternative to [[search algorithm]]s since they help users discover items they might not have found otherwise. Of note, recommender systems are often implemented using search engines indexing non-traditional data.

Recommender systems were first mentioned in a technical report as a "digital bookshelf" in 1990 by [[Jussi Karlgren]] at Columbia University,&lt;ref&gt;Karlgren, Jussi. 1990. "An Algebra for Recommendations." Syslab Working Paper 179 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented at scale and worked through in technical reports and publications from 1994 onwards by Jussi Karlgren, then at SICS,&lt;ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

=== Collaborative filtering ===
{{Main article|Collaborative filtering}}

One approach to the design of recommender systems that has  wide use is [[collaborative filtering]].&lt;ref name="Breese98"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=John S. Breese |author2=David Heckerman |author3=Carl Kadie  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 1998 |title = Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative filtering |conference =  In Proceedings of the Fourteenth conference on Uncertainty in artificial intelligence (UAI'98) }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborative filtering methods are based on collecting and analyzing a large amount of information on users’ behaviors, activities or preferences and predicting what users will like based on their similarity to other users. A key advantage of the collaborative filtering approach is that it does not rely on machine analyzable content and therefore it is capable of accurately recommending complex items such as movies without requiring an "understanding" of the item itself. Many algorithms have been used in measuring user similarity or item similarity in recommender systems. For example, the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|k-nearest neighbor]] (k-NN) approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Sarwar |first = B. |last2 = Karypis |first2 = G. |last3 = Konstan |first3 = J. |last4 = Riedl |first4 = J. |year = 2000 |url = http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/node/122 |title = Application of Dimensionality Reduction in Recommender System A Case Study |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }},&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Pearson correlation|Pearson Correlation]] as first implemented by Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Allen | first = R.B. | date=1990 | title=User Models: Theory, Method, Practice| publisher = International J. Man-Machine Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that people who agreed in the past will agree in the future, and that they will like similar kinds of items as they liked in the past.

When building a model from a user's behavior, a distinction is often made between explicit and [[implicit data collection|implicit]] forms of [[data collection]].

Examples of explicit data collection include the following:
* Asking a user to rate an item on a sliding scale.
* Asking a user to search.
* Asking a user to rank a collection of items from favorite to least favorite.
* Presenting two items to a user and asking him/her to choose the better one of them.
* Asking a user to create a list of items that he/she likes.

Examples of [[implicit data collection]] include the following:
* Observing the items that a user views in an online store.
* Analyzing item/user viewing times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Parsons |first = J. |last2 = Ralph |first2 = P. |last3 = Gallagher |first3 = K. |date = July 2004 |title = Using viewing time to infer user preference in recommender systems |publisher = AAAI Workshop in Semantic Web Personalization, San Jose, California |postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keeping a record of the items that a user purchases online.
* Obtaining a list of items that a user has listened to or watched on his/her computer.
* Analyzing the user's social network and discovering similar likes and dislikes.

The recommender system compares the collected data to similar and dissimilar data collected from others and calculates a list of recommended items for the user. Several commercial and non-commercial examples are listed in the article on [[collaborative filtering|collaborative filtering systems]].

One of the most famous examples of collaborative filtering is item-to-item collaborative filtering (people who buy x also buy y), an algorithm popularized by [[Amazon.com]]'s recommender system.&lt;ref name="patft.uspto.gov"&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6,266,649.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6,266,649&amp;RS=PN/6,266,649 Collaborative Recommendations Using Item-to-Item Similarity Mappings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316185024/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=6%2C266%2C649.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649&amp;RS=PN%2F6%2C266%2C649 |date=2015-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include:
* As previously detailed, [[Last.fm]] recommends music based on a comparison of the listening habits of similar users, while [[Readgeek]] compares books ratings for recommendations.
* [[Facebook]], [[MySpace]], [[LinkedIn]], and other social networks use collaborative filtering to recommend new friends, groups, and other social connections (by examining the network of connections between a user and their friends).&lt;ref name="handbook"&gt;Francesco Ricci and Lior Rokach and Bracha Shapira, [http://www.inf.unibz.it/~ricci/papers/intro-rec-sys-handbook.pdf Introduction to Recommender Systems Handbook], Recommender Systems Handbook, Springer, 2011, pp. 1-35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twitter]] uses many signals and in-memory computations for recommending to its users whom they should "follow."&lt;ref name="twitterwtf" /&gt;
Collaborative filtering approaches often suffer from three problems: [[Cold start (computing)|cold start]], scalability, and sparsity.&lt;ref name="Lee2007"&gt;Sanghack Lee and Jihoon Yang and Sung-Yong Park, [https://books.google.com/books?id=u4qzlZAEjegC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=sparsity+problem+content-based&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZEI50fmXTh&amp;sig=jcwEba0LykRiLnYVbLYUwdrHYEo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-W7CTvboCIeHsgKf9NHDBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sparsity%20problem%20content-based&amp;f=false Discovery of Hidden Similarity on Collaborative Filtering to Overcome Sparsity Problem], Discovery Science, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cold start: These systems often require a large amount of existing data on a user in order to make accurate recommendations.&lt;ref name="rubens2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elahi2016"/&gt;
* Scalability: In many of the environments in which these systems make recommendations, there are millions of users and products. Thus, a large amount of computation power is often necessary to calculate recommendations.
* Sparsity: The number of items sold on major e-commerce sites is extremely large. The most active users will only have rated a small subset of the overall database. Thus, even the most popular items have very few ratings.

A particular type of collaborative filtering algorithm uses [[matrix factorization (recommender systems)|matrix factorization]], a [[low rank approximation|low-rank matrix approximation]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;I.

Collaborative filtering methods are classified as memory-based and model based collaborative filtering. A well-known example of memory-based approaches is user-based algorithm&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author1=Breese, John S.|author2=Heckerman, David|author3=Kadie, Carl|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/69656/tr-98-12.pdf|title=Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms for Collaborative Filtering|year=1998|publisher=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that of model-based approaches is Kernel-Mapping Recommender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025512002587|title=Kernel-Mapping Recommender system algorithms|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015|doi=10.1016/j.ins.2012.04.012|volume=208|journal=Information Sciences|pages=81–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Content-based filtering ===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}

Another common approach when designing recommender systems is '''content-based filtering'''. Content-based filtering methods are based on a description of the item and a profile of the user’s preferences.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal16Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aggarwal|first1=Charu C.|title=Recommender Systems: The Textbook|date=2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319296579}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Peter Brusilovsky]]|title=The Adaptive Web|year=2007|isbn=978-3-540-72078-2|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a content-based recommender system, keywords are used to describe the items and a user profile is built to indicate the type of item this user likes. In other words, these algorithms try to recommend items that are similar to those that a user liked in the past (or is examining in the present). In particular, various candidate items are compared with items previously rated by the user and the best-matching items are recommended. This approach has its roots in [[information retrieval]] and [[information filtering]] research.

To abstract the features of the items in the system, an item presentation algorithm is applied. A widely used algorithm is the 
[[tf–idf]] representation (also called vector space representation).

To create a user profile, the system mostly focuses on two types of information:

1. A model of the user's preference.

2. A history of the user's interaction with the recommender system.

Basically, these methods use an item profile (i.e., a set of discrete attributes and features) characterizing the item within the system. The system creates a content-based profile of users based on a weighted vector of item features. The weights denote the importance of each feature to the user and can be computed from individually rated content vectors using a variety of techniques. Simple approaches use the average values of the rated item vector while other sophisticated methods use machine learning techniques such as [[Naive Bayes classifier|Bayesian Classifiers]], [[cluster analysis]], [[decision trees]], and [[artificial neural networks]] in order to estimate the probability that the user is going to like the item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Online Recommender Systems – How Does a Website Know What I Want?|url=http://blogs.ams.org/mathgradblog/2015/05/25/online-recommender-systems-website-want/|last=Blanda, Stephanie|work=American Mathematical Society|date=May 25, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct feedback from a user, usually in the form of a [[like button|like or dislike button]], can be used to assign higher or lower weights on the importance of certain attributes (using [[Rocchio algorithm|Rocchio classification]] or other similar techniques).

A key issue with content-based filtering is whether the system is able to learn user preferences from users' actions regarding one content source and use them across other content types. When the system is limited to recommending content of the same type as the user is already using, the value from the recommendation system is significantly less than when other content types from other services can be recommended. For example, recommending news articles based on browsing of news is useful, but would be much more useful when music, videos, products, discussions etc. from different services can be recommended based on news browsing.

Pandora Radio is an example of a content-based recommender system that plays music with similar characteristics to that of a song provided by the user as an initial seed. There are also a large number of content-based recommender systems aimed at providing movie recommendations, a few such examples include [[Rotten Tomatoes]], [[Internet Movie Database]], [[Jinni (search engine)|Jinni]], [[Rovi Corporation]], and [[Jaman]]. Document related recommender systems aim at providing document recommendations to knowledge workers. Public health professionals have been studying recommender systems to personalize health education and preventative strategies.&lt;ref name="pmid27318270"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Macedo AA, Pollettini JT, Baranauskas JA, Chaves JC| title=A Health Surveillance Software Framework to deliver information on preventive healthcare strategies. | journal=J Biomed Inform | year= 2016 | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages= 159–70 | pmid=27318270 | doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2016.06.002 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=27318270  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19745443"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fernandez-Luque L, Karlsen R, Vognild LK| title=Challenges and opportunities of using recommender systems for personalized health education. | journal=Stud Health Technol Inform | year= 2009 | volume= 150 | issue=  | pages= 903–7 | pmid=19745443 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19745443  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hybrid recommender systems ===

Recent research has demonstrated that a hybrid approach, combining [[collaborative filtering]] and content-based filtering could be more effective in some cases. Hybrid approaches can be implemented in several ways: by making content-based and collaborative-based predictions separately and then combining them; by adding content-based capabilities to a collaborative-based approach (and vice versa); or by unifying the approaches into one model (see&lt;ref name="Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems" /&gt; for a complete review of recommender systems). Several studies empirically compare the performance of the hybrid with the pure collaborative and content-based methods and demonstrate that the hybrid methods can provide more accurate
recommendations than pure approaches. These methods can also be used to overcome some of the common problems in recommender systems such as cold start and the sparsity problem.

[[Netflix]] is a good example of the use of hybrid recommender systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gomez-Uribe|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Hunt|first2=Neil|title=The Netflix Recommender System|journal=ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems|date=28 December 2015|volume=6|issue=4|pages=1–19|doi=10.1145/2843948}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website makes recommendations by comparing the watching and searching habits of similar users (i.e., collaborative filtering) as well as by offering movies that share characteristics with films that a user has rated highly (content-based filtering).

A variety of techniques have been proposed as the basis for recommender systems: collaborative, content-based, knowledge-based, and demographic techniques. Each of these techniques has known shortcomings, such as the well known [[Cold start (computing)|cold-start]] problem for collaborative and content-based systems (what to do with new users with few ratings) and the knowledge engineering bottleneck&lt;ref&gt;Rinke Hoekstra, [http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj32.pdf The Knowledge Reengineering Bottleneck], Semantic Web – Interoperability, Usability, Applicability 1 (2010) 1, IOS Press&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Knowledge base|knowledge-based]] approaches. A hybrid recommender system is one that combines multiple techniques together to achieve some synergy between them.

*[[Collaborative filtering|Collaborative]]: The system generates recommendations using only information about rating profiles for different users or items. Collaborative systems locate peer users/items with a rating history similar to the current user or item and generate recommendations using this neighborhood. The user-based and the item based nearest neighbor algorithms can be combined to deal with the cold start problem and improve recommendation results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Recommender Systems:An Introduction |author1 = Dietmar Jannach |author2 = Markus Zanker |author3 = Alexander Felfernig |author4 = Gerhard Friedrich |year = 2010 |url = http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150831032309/http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521493369 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = 2015-08-31 |publisher = CUP |isbn = 978-0-521-49336-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Content-based: The system generates recommendations from two sources: the features associated with products and the ratings that a user has given them. Content-based recommenders treat recommendation as a user-specific classification problem and learn a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on product features.
*Demographic: A demographic recommender provides recommendations based on a demographic profile of the user. Recommended products can be produced for different demographic niches, by combining the ratings of users in those niches.
*[[Knowledge base|Knowledge-based]]: A [[knowledge-based recommender system|knowledge-based recommender]] suggests products based on inferences about a user’s needs and preferences. This knowledge will sometimes contain explicit functional knowledge about how certain product features meet user needs.&lt;ref name=hybrids&gt;Robin Burke, [http://www.dcs.warwick.ac.uk/~acristea/courses/CS411/2010/Book%20-%20The%20Adaptive%20Web/HybridWebRecommenderSystems.pdf Hybrid Web Recommender Systems], pp. 377-408, The Adaptive Web, Peter Brusilovsky, Alfred Kobsa, Wolfgang Nejdl (Ed.), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol. 4321, May 2007, 978-3-540-72078-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="constraintbased"&gt;Alexander Felfernig and Robin Burke. [http://www.ist.tugraz.at/felfernig/images/constraint_based_recommendation.pdf Constraint-based Recommender Systems: Technologies and Research Issues], Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Electronic Commerce (ICEC'08), Innsbruck, Austria, Aug. 19-22, pp. 17-26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term hybrid recommender system is used here to describe any recommender system that combines multiple recommendation techniques together to produce its output. There is no reason why several different techniques of the same type could not be hybridized, for example, two different content-based recommenders could work together, and a number of projects have investigated this type of hybrid: NewsDude,
which uses both naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbors classifiers in its news recommendations is just one example.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

Seven hybridization techniques:
*Weighted: The score of different recommendation components are combined numerically.
*Switching: The system chooses among recommendation components and applies the selected one.
*Mixed: Recommendations from different recommenders are presented together to give the recommendation.
*Feature Combination: Features derived from different knowledge sources are combined together and given to a single recommendation algorithm.
*Feature Augmentation: One recommendation technique is used to compute a feature or set of features, which is then part of the input to the next technique.
*Cascade: Recommenders are given strict priority, with the lower priority ones breaking ties in the scoring of the higher ones.
*Meta-level: One recommendation technique is applied and produces some sort of model, which is then the input used by the next technique.&lt;ref name=hybrids /&gt;

== Beyond accuracy ==
Typically, research on recommender systems is concerned about finding the most accurate recommendation algorithms. However, there are a number of factors that are also important.

*'''Diversity''' – Users tend to be more satisfied with recommendations when there is a higher intra-list diversity, e.g. items from different artists.&lt;ref name="Ziegler2005"&gt;{{cite book| author=Ziegler, C.N., McNee, S.M., Konstan, J.A. and Lausen, G.| chapter=Improving recommendation lists through topic diversification| title=Proceedings of the 14th international conference on World Wide Web| year=2005| pages=22–32|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Recommender persistence''' – In some situations, it is more effective to re-show recommendations,&lt;ref name="Beel2013e"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Marcel Genzmehr |author4=Andreas Nürnberger | chapter=Persistence in Recommender Systems: Giving the Same Recommendations to the Same Users Multiple Times| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| volume=8092| pages=390–394| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | series=Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS)| url=http://docear.org/papers/persistence_in_recommender_systems_--_giving_the_same_recommendations_to_the_same_users_multiple_times.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or let users re-rate items,&lt;ref name="Cosley2003"&gt;{{cite book| author=Cosley, D., Lam, S.K., Albert, I., Konstan, J.A., Riedl, {J}.| chapter=Is seeing believing?: how recommender system interfaces affect users' opinions| title=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems| year=2003| pages=585–592| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than showing new items. There are several reasons for this. Users may ignore items when they are shown for the first time, for instance, because they had no time to inspect the recommendations carefully.
*'''Privacy''' – Recommender systems usually have to deal with privacy concerns&lt;ref name="Pu2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={P}u, {P}., {C}hen, {L}., {H}u, {R}.| title=Evaluating recommender systems from the user's perspective: survey of the state of the art| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–39| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; because users have to reveal sensitive information. Building user profiles using collaborative filtering can be problematic from a privacy point of view. Many European countries have a strong culture of [[information privacy|data privacy]], and every attempt to introduce any level of user [[Profiling (information science)|profiling]] can result in a negative customer response. A number of privacy issues arose around the dataset offered by Netflix for the [[Netflix Prize]] competition. Although the data sets were anonymized in order to preserve customer privacy, in 2007 two researchers from the University of Texas were able to identify individual users by matching the data sets with film ratings on the Internet Movie Database.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 Rise of the Netflix Hackers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120124011808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72963 |date=January 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in December 2009, an anonymous Netflix user sued Netflix in Doe v. Netflix, alleging that Netflix had violated United States fair trade laws and the Video Privacy Protection Act by releasing the datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/12/netflix-privacy-lawsuit/|title=Netflix Spilled Your Brokeback Mountain Secret, Lawsuit Claims|date=17 December 2009|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led in part to the cancellation of a second Netflix Prize competition in 2010.&lt;ref name="nfcancel"/&gt; Much research has been conducted on ongoing privacy issues in this space. Ramakrishnan et al. have conducted an extensive overview of the trade-offs between personalization and privacy and found that the combination of weak ties (an unexpected connection that provides serendipitous recommendations) and other data sources can be used to uncover identities of users in an anonymized dataset.&lt;ref name="privacyoverview"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Naren Ramakrishnan |author2=Benjamin J. Keller |author3=Batul J. Mirza |author4=Ananth Y. Grama |author5=George Karypis |year = 2001 |title = Privacy Risks in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Internet Computing |volume = 5 |issue = 6 |url = http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/schein02methods.html |isbn = 1-58113-561-0 |publisher = [[IEEE Educational Activities Department]] |location = Piscataway, NJ |pages = 54–62 |doi = 10.1109/4236.968832 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''User demographics''' – Beel et al. found that user demographics may influence how satisfied users are with recommendations.&lt;ref name="Beel2013f"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joeran Beel |author2=Stefan Langer |author3=Andreas Nürnberger |author4=Marcel Genzmehr | chapter=The Impact of Demographics (Age and Gender) and Other User Characteristics on Evaluating Recommender Systems| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| pages=400–404| publisher=Springer|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | url=http://docear.org/papers/the_impact_of_users'_demographics_(age_and_gender)_and_other_characteristics_on_evaluating_recommender_systems.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their paper they show that elderly users tend to be more interested in recommendations than younger users.
*'''Robustness''' – When users can participate in the recommender system, the issue of fraud must be addressed.&lt;ref name="Konstan2012"&gt;{{cite journal| author={K}onstan, {J}.{A}., {R}iedl, {J}.| title=Recommender systems: from algorithms to user experience| journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction| year=2012| pages=1–23| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Serendipity''' – [[Serendipity]] is a measure of "how surprising the recommendations are".&lt;ref name="Ricci2011"&gt;{{cite journal| author={R}icci, {F}., {R}okach, {L}., {S}hapira, {B}., {K}antor {B}. {P}.| title=Recommender systems handbook| journal=Recommender Systems Handbook| year=2011| pages=1–35| publisher=Springer| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a recommender system that recommends milk to a customer in a grocery store might be perfectly accurate, but it is not a good recommendation because it is an obvious item for the customer to buy. However, high scores of serendipity may have a negative impact on accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonçalves|first=Diogo|last2=Costa|first2=Miguel|last3=Couto|first3=Francisco M.|date=2016-09-15|title=A Flexible Recommendation System for Cable TV|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307907905_A_Flexible_Recommendation_System_for_Cable_TV|journal=3rd Workshop on Recommendation Systems for Television and online Video (RecSysTV), At Boston, MA, USA|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Trust''' – A recommender system is of little value for a user if the user does not trust the system.&lt;ref name="Montaner2002"&gt;{{cite book| author=Montaner, Miquel, L{\'o}pez, Beatriz, de la Rosa, Josep Llu{\'\i}s| chapter=Developing trust in recommender agents| title=Proceedings of the first international joint conference on Autonomous agents and multiagent systems: part 1| year=2002| pages=304–305| accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trust can be built by a recommender system by explaining how it generates recommendations, and why it recommends an item.
*'''Labelling''' – User satisfaction with recommendations may be influenced by the labeling of the recommendations.&lt;ref name="Beel2013a"&gt;{{cite book| author=Beel, Joeran, Langer, Stefan, Genzmehr, Marcel| chapter=Sponsored vs. Organic (Research Paper) Recommendations and the Impact of Labeling| title=Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2013)|date=September 2013| pages=395–399| url=http://docear.org/papers/sponsored_vs._organic_(research_paper)_recommendations_and_the_impact_of_labeling.pdf|editor1=Trond Aalberg |editor2=Milena Dobreva |editor3=Christos Papatheodorou |editor4=Giannis Tsakonas |editor5=Charles Farrugia | accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the cited study [[click-through rate]] (CTR) for recommendations labeled as "Sponsored" were lower (CTR=5.93%) than CTR for identical recommendations labeled as "Organic" (CTR=8.86%). Recommendations with no label performed best (CTR=9.87%) in that study.

== Mobile recommender systems ==
{{see|Location based recommendation}}
One growing area of research in the area of recommender systems is mobile recommender systems. With the increasing ubiquity of internet-accessing [[smart phones]], it is now possible to offer personalized, context-sensitive recommendations. This is a particularly difficult area of research as mobile data is more complex than data that recommender systems often have to deal with (it is heterogeneous, noisy, requires spatial and temporal auto-correlation, and has validation and generality problems&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Yong Ge |author2=Hui Xiong |author3=Alexander Tuzhilin |author4=Keli Xiao |author5=Marco Gruteser |author6=Michael J. Pazzani |year = 2010 |title = An Energy-Efficient Mobile Recommender System |conference = Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining |url = http://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~gruteser/papers/KDD10.pdf |publisher = [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] |location = [[New York City|New York City, New York]] |pages = 899–908 |accessdate = 2011-11-17 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;). Additionally, mobile recommender systems suffer from a transplantation problem – recommendations may not apply in all regions (for instance, it would be unwise to recommend a recipe in an area where all of the ingredients may not be available).

One example of a mobile recommender system is one that offers potentially profitable driving routes for taxi drivers in a city.&lt;ref name="taxirecommender"/&gt; This system takes input data in the form of GPS traces of the routes that taxi drivers took while working, which include location (latitude and longitude), time stamps, and operational status (with or without passengers). It uses this data to recommend a list of pickup points along a route, with the goal of optimizing occupancy times and profits. This type of system is obviously location-dependent, and since it must operate on a handheld or embedded device, the computation and energy requirements must remain low.

Another example of mobile recommendation is what (Bouneffouf et al., 2012) developed for professional users. Using GPS traces of the user and his agenda, it suggests suitable information depending on his situation and interests. The system uses machine learning
techniques and reasoning processes in order to dynamically adapt the mobile recommender system to the evolution of the user’s interest. The author called his algorithm hybrid-ε-greedy.&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2012"&gt;{{citation|last=Bouneffouf |first=Djallel |contribution=Following the User's Interests in Mobile Context-Aware Recommender Systems: The Hybrid-e-greedy Algorithm |pages=657–662 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |title=Proceedings of the 2012 26th International Conference on Advanced Information Networking and Applications Workshops |year=2012 |url=http://www-inf.int-evry.fr/~bounef_d/index_fichiers/Hybrid-e-greedy%20for%20Mobile%20Context-aware%20Recommender%20System.pdf |isbn=978-0-7695-4652-0 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile recommendation systems have also been successfully built using the "Web of Data" as a source for structured information. A good example of such system is SMARTMUSEUM&lt;ref name="Ruotsalo2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tuukka Ruotsalo |author2=Krister Haav |author3=Antony Stoyanov |author4=Sylvain Roche |author5=Elena Fani |author6=Romina Deliai |author7=Eetu Mäkelä |author8=Tomi Kauppinen |author9=Eero Hyvönen | title = SMARTMUSEUM: A Mobile Recommender System for the Web of Data | pages = 657–662 | publisher = Elsevier| year = 2013 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570826813000061 | doi = 10.1016/j.websem.2013.03.001 | volume=20 | journal=Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses semantic modelling, information retrieval, and machine learning
techniques in order to recommend content matching user interests, even when presented with sparse or minimal user data.

There are three factors that could affect the mobile recommender systems and the accuracy of prediction results: the context, the recommendation method and privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pimenidis |first1=Elias |last2=Polatidis |first2=Nikolaos |last3=Mouratidis |first3=Haralambos |title=Mobile recommender systems: Identifying the major concepts |journal=Journal of Information Science |date=3 August 2018 |pages=016555151879221 |doi=10.1177/0165551518792213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risk-aware recommender systems ==
The majority of existing approaches to recommender systems focus on recommending the most relevant content to users using contextual information and do not take into account the risk of disturbing the user in specific situation. However, in many applications, such as recommending personalized content, it is also important to consider the risk of upsetting the user so as not to push recommendations in certain circumstances, for instance, during a professional meeting, early morning, or late at night. Therefore, the performance of the recommender system depends in part on the degree to which it has incorporated the risk into the recommendation process.

===Risk definition===
"The risk in recommender systems is the possibility to disturb or to upset the user
which leads to a bad answer of the user".&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"&gt;{{citation | type=Ph.D.
 | last = Bouneffouf  | first = Djallel | title= DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System
 | publisher = Institut National des Télécommunications | year = 2013 | url = http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01026136/fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these challenges, the authors in ''DRARS, A Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System''&lt;ref name="Bouneffouf2013"/&gt; have developed a dynamic risk sensitive recommendation system called DRARS (Dynamic Risk-Aware Recommender System), which models the context-aware recommendation as a [[Multi-armed bandit|bandit problem]]. This system combines a content-based technique and a contextual bandit algorithm. They have shown that DRARS improves the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy, the currently available best algorithm, by calculating the most optimal exploration value to maintain a trade-off between exploration and exploitation based on the risk level of the current user's situation. The authors conducted experiments in an industrial context with real data and real users and have shown that taking into account the risk level of users' situations significantly increased the performance of the recommender systems.

== The Netflix Prize ==
{{Main article|Netflix Prize}}

One of the events that energized research in recommender systems was the [[Netflix Prize]]. From 2006 to 2009, Netflix sponsored a competition, offering a grand prize of $1,000,000 to the team that could take an offered dataset of over 100 million movie ratings and return recommendations that were 10% more accurate than those offered by the company's existing recommender system. This competition energized the search for new and more accurate algorithms. On 21 September 2009, the grand prize of US$1,000,000 was given to the BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos team using tiebreaking rules.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lohr|first1=Steve|title=A $1 Million Research Bargain for Netflix, and Maybe a Model for Others|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/22/technology/internet/22netflix.html|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most accurate algorithm in 2007 used an ensemble method of 107 different algorithmic approaches, blended into a single prediction:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.netflixprize.com/assets/ProgressPrize2007_KorBell.pdf |author1=R. Bell |author2=Y. Koren |author3=C. Volinsky |title = The BellKor solution to the Netflix Prize |year = 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Predictive accuracy is substantially improved when blending multiple predictors. ''Our experience is that most efforts should be concentrated in deriving substantially different approaches, rather than refining a single technique.''  Consequently, our solution is an ensemble of many methods.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many benefits accrued to the web due to the Netflix project. Some teams have taken their technology and applied it to other markets. Some members from the team that finished second place founded [[Gravity R&amp;D]], a recommendation engine that's active in the RecSys community.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bodoky|first1=Thomas|title=Mátrixfaktorizáció one million dollars|url=http://index.hu/tech/net/2009/08/07/matrixfaktorizacio_egymillio_dollarert/|website=Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4-Tell, Inc. created a Netflix project–derived solution for ecommerce websites.

A second contest was planned, but was ultimately canceled in response to an ongoing lawsuit and concerns from the [[Federal Trade Commission]].&lt;ref name="nfcancel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.netflix.com/2010/03/this-is-neil-hunt-chief-product-officer.html | title = Netflix Prize Update | date = 2010-03-12 | publisher = Netflix Prize Forum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance measures ==
Evaluation is important in assessing the effectiveness of recommendation algorithms. The commonly used metrics are the [[mean squared error]] and [[root mean squared error]], the latter having been used in the Netflix Prize. The information retrieval metrics such as [[precision and recall]] or [[Discounted Cumulative Gain|DCG]] are useful to assess the quality of a recommendation method. Recently, diversity, novelty, and coverage are also considered as important aspects in evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Lathia, N., Hailes, S., Capra, L., Amatriain, X.: Temporal diversity in recommender systems. In: Proceedings of the 33rd International ACMSIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2010, pp. 210–217. ACM, New York&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of the classic evaluation measures are highly criticized.&lt;ref name="Turpin2001"&gt;{{cite book| author=Turpin, Andrew H, Hersh, William| chapter=Why batch and user evaluations do not give the same results| title=Proceedings of the 24th annual international ACM SIGIR conference on Research and development in information retrieval| year=2001| pages=225–231|  accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, results of so-called offline evaluations do not correlate with actually assessed user-satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beel|first=Joeran|last2=Genzmehr|first2=Marcel|last3=Langer|first3=Stefan|last4=Nürnberger|first4=Andreas|last5=Gipp|first5=Bela|date=2013-01-01|title=A Comparative Analysis of Offline and Online Evaluations and Discussion of Research Paper Recommender System Evaluation|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532511|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=7–14|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532511|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude "we would suggest treating results of offline evaluations [i.e. classic performance measures] with skepticism".

== Multi-criteria recommender systems ==
Multi-criteria recommender systems (MCRS) can be defined as recommender systems that incorporate preference information upon multiple criteria. Instead of developing recommendation techniques based on a single criterion values, the overall preference of user u for the item i, these systems try to predict a rating for unexplored items of u by exploiting preference information on multiple criteria that affect this overall preference value. Several researchers approach MCRS as a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem, and apply MCDM methods and techniques to implement MCRS systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Lakiotaki |first = K. |last2 = Matsatsinis |last3 = Tsoukias |first3 = A |url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=5751215&amp;tag=1 |title = Multicriteria User Modeling in Recommender Systems |journal = IEEE Intelligent Systems |volume = 26 |issue = 2 |pages = 64–76 |doi=10.1109/mis.2011.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; See this chapter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |title=Multi-Criteria Recommender Systems |authors=Gediminas Adomavicius, Nikos Manouselis, YoungOk Kwon |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630021251/http://ids.csom.umn.edu/faculty/gedas/NSFCareer/MCRS-chapter-2010.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for an extended introduction.

== Opinion-based recommender systems ==
In some cases, users are allowed to leave text review or feedback on the items. These user-generated text are implicit data for the recommender system because they are potentially rich resource of both feature/aspects of the item, and the user’s evaluation/sentiment to the item. Features extracted from the user-generated reviews are improved [[Metadata|meta-data]] of items, because as they also reflect aspects of the item like [[Metadata|meta-data]], extracted features are widely concerned by the users. Sentiments extracted from the reviews can be seen as user’s rating scores on the corresponding features. Popular approaches of opinion-based recommender system utilize various techniques including [[text mining]], [[information retrieval]] and [[sentiment analysis]] (see also [[Multimodal sentiment analysis]]).

== Recommender system evaluation ==
To measure the [[effectiveness]] of recommender systems, and compare different approaches, three types of [[evaluation]]s are available: user studies, [[A/B testing|online evaluations (A/B tests)]], and offline evaluations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; User studies are rather small scale. A few dozens or hundreds of users are presented recommendations created by different recommendation approaches, and then the users judge, which recommendations are best. In A/B tests, recommendations are shown to typically thousands of users of a real product, and the recommender system randomly picks at least two different recommendation approaches to generate recommendations. The effectiveness is measured with implicit measures of effectiveness such as [[conversion rate]] or [[click-through rate]]. Offline evaluations are based on historic data, e.g. a dataset that contains information about how users previously rated movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/|title=MovieLens dataset|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of recommendation approaches is then measured based on how well a recommendation approach can predict the users' ratings in the dataset. While a rating is an explicit expression of whether a user liked a movie, such information is not available in all domains. For instance, in the domain of citation recommender systems, users typically do not rate a citation or recommended article. In such cases, offline evaluations may use implicit measures of effectiveness. For instance, it may be assumed that a recommender system is effective that is able to recommend as many articles as possible that are contained in a research article's reference list. However, this kind of offline evaluations is seen critical by many researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|title=User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization|last=Jannach|first=Dietmar|last2=Lerche|first2=Lukas|last3=Gedikli|first3=Fatih|last4=Bonnin|first4=Geoffray|date=2013-06-10|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783642388439|editor-last=Carberry|editor-first=Sandra|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=25–37|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38844-6_3|editor-last2=Weibelzahl|editor-first2=Stephan|editor-last3=Micarelli|editor-first3=Alessandro|editor-last4=Semeraro|editor-first4=Giovanni}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turpin|first=Andrew H.|last2=Hersh|first2=William|date=2001-01-01|title=Why Batch and User Evaluations Do Not Give the Same Results|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/383952.383992|journal=Proceedings of the 24th Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval|series=SIGIR '01|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=225–231|doi=10.1145/383952.383992|isbn=1581133316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For instance, it has been shown that results of offline evaluations have low correlation with results from user studies or A/B tests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|last1=Langer|first1=Stefan|date=2015-09-14|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319245911|editor-last=Kapidakis|editor-first=Sarantos|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|pages=153–168|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-24592-8_12|editor-last2=Mazurek|editor-first2=Cezary|editor-last3=Werla|editor-first3=Marcin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A dataset popular for offline evaluation has been shown to contain duplicate data and thus to lead to wrong conclusions in the evaluation of algorithms.&lt;ref name="BasaranNtoutsi2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Basaran|first1=Daniel|last2=Ntoutsi|first2=Eirini|last3=Zimek|first3=Arthur|title=Redundancies in Data and their Effect on the Evaluation of Recommendation Systems: A Case Study on the Amazon Reviews Datasets|year=2017|pages=390–398|doi=10.1137/1.9781611974973.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reproducibility in recommender system research ==
In recent years there was a growing understanding in the community that  lots of previous research had little impact on the practical application of recommender systems. Ekstrand, Konstan, et al. criticize that "it is currently difficult to reproduce and extend recommender systems research results,” and that evaluations are “not handled consistently".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ekstrand|first=Michael D.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Michael|last3=Konstan|first3=Joseph A.|last4=Riedl|first4=John T.|date=2011-01-01|title=Rethinking the Recommender Research Ecosystem: Reproducibility, Openness, and LensKit|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2043932.2043958|journal=Proceedings of the Fifth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '11|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=133–140|doi=10.1145/2043932.2043958|isbn=9781450306836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Konstan and Adomavicius conclude that "the Recommender Systems research community is facing a crisis where a significant number of papers present results that contribute little to collective knowledge […] often because the research lacks the […] evaluation to be properly judged and, hence, to provide meaningful contributions.".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konstan|first=Joseph A.|last2=Adomavicius|first2=Gediminas|date=2013-01-01|title=Toward Identification and Adoption of Best Practices in Algorithmic Recommender Systems Research|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2532508.2532513|journal=Proceedings of the International Workshop on Reproducibility and Replication in Recommender Systems Evaluation|series=RepSys '13|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=23–28|doi=10.1145/2532508.2532513|isbn=9781450324656}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, lots of research about recommender systems can be considered as not reproducible.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Breitinger|first1=Corinna|last2=Langer|first2=Stefan|last3=Lommatzsch|first3=Andreas|last4=Gipp|first4=Bela|date=2016-03-12|title=Towards reproducibility in recommender-systems research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|journal=User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=69–101|doi=10.1007/s11257-016-9174-x|issn=0924-1868}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, operators of recommender systems find little guidance in the current research for answering the question, which recommendation approaches to use in a recommender systems. Said &amp; Bellogín conducted a study of recent papers published in the field, as well as benchmarked some of the most popular frameworks for recommendation and found large inconsistencies in results, even when the same algorithms and data sets were used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Said|first=Alan|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|date=2014-10-01|title=Comparative recommender system evaluation: benchmarking recommendation frameworks
|url=https://doi.org/10.1145/2645710.2645746|journal=Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=129–136|doi= 10.1145/2645710.2645746|isbn=9781450326681}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers demonstrated that minor variations in the recommendation algorithms or scenarios led to strong changes in the effectiveness of a recommender system. They conclude that seven actions are necessary to improve the current situation:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; "(1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research."

While reproducibility has not been considered for a long time in the recommender-system community, this aspects is much more considered recently, with several workshops and conferences focusing on reproducibility in recommender system research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Adamopoulos|first=Panagiotis|last2=Bellogín|first2=Alejandro|last3=Castells|first3=Pablo|last4=Cremonesi|first4=Paolo|last5=Steck|first5=Harald|date=2014-01-01|title=REDD 2014 – International Workshop on Recommender Systems Evaluation: Dimensions and Design|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2645710.2645780|journal=Proceedings of the 8th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems|series=RecSys '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=393–394|doi=10.1145/2645710.2645780|isbn=9781450326681}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anticipatory design ==
Anticipatory design is the combination of Internet of Things, User experience design and machine learning. Anticipatory design differs from conventional design, in that within anticipatory design the goal is to simplify the process and minimize difficulty by making decisions on behalf of the users. Examples of services that use various levels of anticipatory designs are: Amazon and Netflix production recommendation which recommend products based on previous behavior, the mobile application Peapod which uses a recommendation engine to allow users to fill their shopping basket based on previous orders, and the Nest thermostat which predicts the perfect room temperature based on user input and time of day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/09/anticipatory-design/|title=What You Need To Know About Anticipatory Design|date=2015-09-10|work=Smashing Magazine|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''safety instrumented system''' ('''SIS''') consists of an engineered set of hardware and software controls which are especially used on critical process systems.

== Examples ==
Safety instrumented systems are most often used in process (e.g., refineries, chemical, nuclear) facilities to provide protection such as:
* High fuel gas pressure initiates action to close the main fuel gas valve.
* High reactor temperature initiates action to open cooling media valve.
* High distillation column pressure initiates action to open a pressure vent valve.

==Critical process systems==
A critical process system can be identified as one which, once running and an operational problem occurs, may need to be put into a "Safe State" to avoid adverse Safety, Health and Environmental(SH&amp;E) consequences. A Safe State is a process condition, whether the process is operating or shutdown, such that a hazardous SH&amp;E event cannot occur.  

Examples of critical processes have been common since the beginning of the Industrial Age. One of the more well known critical processes is the operation of a steam boiler. Critical parts of the process would include the lighting of the burners, controlling the level of water in the drum, and controlling the steam pressure.

== Requirement specification ==
What a SIS shall do (''the functional requirements'') and how well it must perform (''the safety integrity requirements'') may be determined from [[Hazard and operability study|Hazard and operability studies]] (HAZOP), layers of protection analysis (LOPA), risk graphs, and so on. All techniques are mentioned in IEC 61511 and IEC 61508. During SIS design, construction, installation, and operation, it is necessary to verify that these requirements are met. The functional requirements may be verified by design reviews, such as failure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA) and various types of testing, for example factory acceptance testing, site acceptance testing, and regular functional testing.

The safety integrity requirements may be verified by reliability analysis. For SIS that operates on demand, it is often the probability of failure on demand (PFD) that is calculated. In the design phase, the PFD may be calculated using generic reliability data, for example from OREDA. Later on, the initial PFD estimates may be updated with field experience from the specific plant in question.

It is not possible to address all factors that affect SIS reliability through reliability calculations. It is therefore also necessary to have adequate measures in place (e.g., procedures and competence) to avoid, reveal, and correct SIS related failures.

=== Hazard identification ===
A formal process of hazard identification is performed by the project team engineers and other experts at the completion of the engineering design phase of each section of the process, known as a Unit of Operation. This team performs a systematic, rigorous, procedural review of each point of possible hazard, or "node", in the completed engineering design. This review and its resulting documentation is called a HAZOP study. A HAZOP study typically reveals hazardous scenarios which require further risk mitigating measures which are to be achieved by SIFs. Via a Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA) or some other approved method, [[Integrity Level | Integrity Levels (IL)]] are defined for the SIFs in their respective scenarios.  The Integrity Levels may be categorised as Safety Integrity Level (SIL) or Environmental Integrity Level (EIL). Based on HAZOP study recommendations and the IL rating of the SIFs; the engineering (including the BPCS and the SIF designs) for each unit operation is finalized.

== System design ==
A SIS is engineered to perform "specific control functions" to failsafe or maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur.  Safety Instrumented Systems must be independent from all other [[control system]]s that control the same equipment in order to ensure SIS functionality is not compromised. SIS is composed of the same types of control elements (including [[sensors]], [[logic solver | logic solvers]], [[actuators]] and other control equipment) as a Basic [[Process Control]] System (BPCS). However, all of the control elements in an SIS are dedicated solely to the proper functioning of the SIS.

The specific control functions performed by an SIS are called ''Safety Instrumented Functions'' (SIF). They are implemented as part of an overall [[risk management|risk reduction]] strategy which is intended to eliminate the likelihood of a previously identified SH&amp;E event that could range from minor equipment damage up to an event involving an uncontrolled catastrophic release of energy and/or materials.

The safe state must be achieved in a timely manner or within the "process safety time".

=== Equipment ===
The correct operation of an SIS requires a series of equipment to function properly.  It must have sensors capable of detecting abnormal operating conditions, such as high flow, low level, or incorrect valve positioning. A logic solver is required to receive the sensor input signal(s), make appropriate decisions based on the nature of the signal(s), and change its outputs according to user-defined logic. The logic solver may use electrical, electronic or programmable electronic equipment, such as [[relay]]s, trip [[amplifier]]s, or [[programmable logic controller]]s. Next, the change of the logic solver output(s) results in the final element(s) taking action on the process (e.g. closing a valve) to bring it to a safe state. Support systems, such as power, instrument air, and communications, are generally required for SIS operation. The support systems should be designed to provide the required integrity and [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].

== International standards ==
International standard [[IEC 61511]] was published in 2003 to provide guidance to end-users on the application of Safety Instrumented Systems in the process industries. This standard is based on [[IEC 61508]], a generic standard for design, construction, and operation of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic systems. Other industry sectors may also have standards that are based on IEC 61508, such as [[IEC 62061]] (machinery systems), [[IEC 62425]] (for railway signaling systems), IEC 61513 (for nuclear systems), and [[ISO 26262]] (for road vehicles, currently a draft international standard).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="988">'''Salt equivalent''' is usually quoted on food [[nutrition]] information tables on food labels, and is a different way of defining sodium intake, noting that salt is chemically [[sodium chloride]].

To convert from sodium to the approximate salt equivalent, multiply sodium content by 2.5:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{m_\mathrm{NaCl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} = \frac{m_\mathrm{Na}+m_\mathrm{Cl}}{m_\mathrm{Na}} \approx \frac{23\mathrm{u} + 35.5\mathrm{u}}{23\mathrm{u}} = \frac{58.5}{23} \approx 2.5&lt;/math&gt;

In [[control theory]] a '''self-tuning''' system is capable of optimizing its own internal running parameters in order to maximize or minimize the fulfilment of an [[objective function]]; typically the maximization of [[efficiency]] or [[error#Science and engineering|error]] minimization.

Self-tuning and auto-tuning often refer to the same concept.  Many software research groups consider auto-tuning the proper nomenclature.

Self-tuning systems typically exhibit [[non-linear]] [[adaptive control]].  Self-tuning systems have been a hallmark of the aerospace industry for decades, as this sort of feedback is necessary to generate [[Multi-objective optimization|optimal multi-variable control]] for non-linear processes.  In the telecommunications industry, [[adaptive communications]] are often used to dynamically modify operational system parameters to maximize efficiency and robustness.

==Examples==
Examples of self-tuning systems in computing include:
*[[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]]  (Transmission Control Protocol)
*[[Microsoft SQL Server]]  (Newer implementations only)
*[[FFTW]] (Fastest [[Fourier Transform]] in the West)
*ATLAS ([[Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software]])
*libtune (Tunables library for [[Linux]])
*PhiPAC (Self Tuning Linear Algebra Software for [[RISC]])
*[[MILEPOST GCC]] (Machine learning based self-tuning compiler)

Performance benefits can be substantial.  Professor [[Jack Dongarra]], an American computer scientist, claims self-tuning boosts performance, often on the order of 300%&lt;ref&gt;http://appliedmathematician.org/pdf/news/781.pdf Faster than a Speeding Algorithm&lt;/ref&gt;.

Digital self-tuning controllers are an example of self-tuning systems at the hardware level.

==Architecture==
Self-tuning systems are typically composed of four components: expectations, measurement, analysis, and actions. The expectations describe how the system should behave given exogenous conditions.

Measurements gather data about the conditions and behaviour.  Analysis helps determine whether the expectations are being met- and which subsequent actions should be performed. Common actions are gathering more data and performing dynamic reconfiguration of the system.

Self-tuning (self-adapting) systems of automatic control are systems whereby adaptation to randomly changing conditions is performed by means of automatically changing parameters or via automatically determining their optimum configuration &lt;ref&gt;http://bse.sci-lib.com/article099233.html Big Soviet Encyclopedia, Self-Tuning Systems {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
. In any non-self-tuning automatic control system there are parameters which have an influence on system stability and control quality and which can be tuned. If these parameters remain constant whilst operating conditions (such as input signals or different characteristics of controlled objects) are substantially varying, control can degrade or even become unstable. Manual tuning is often cumbersome and sometimes impossible. In such cases, not only is using self-tuning systems technically and economically worthwhile, but it could be the only means of robust control. Self-tuning systems can be with or without parameter determination.

In systems with parameter determination the required level of control quality is achieved by automatically searching for an optimum (in some sense) set of parameter values. Control quality is described by a generalised characteristic which is usually a complex and not completely known or stable function of the primary parameters. This characteristic is either measured directly or computed based on the primary parameter values. The parameters are then tentatively varied. An analysis of the control quality characteristic oscillations caused by the varying of the parameters makes it possible to figure out if the parameters have optimum values, i.e.. if those values deliver extreme (minimum or maximum) values of the control quality characteristic. If the characteristic values deviate from an extremum, the parameters need to be varied until optimum values are found. Self-tuning systems with parameter determination can reliably operate in environments characterised by wide variations of exogenous conditions.

In practice systems with parameter determination require considerable time to find an optimum tuning, i.e. time necessary for self-tuning in such systems is bounded from below. Self-tuning systems without parameter determination do not have this disadvantage. In such systems, some characteristic of control quality is used (e.g., the first time derivative of a controlled parameter). Automatic tuning makes sure that this characteristic is kept within given bounds. Different self-tuning systems without parameter determination exist that are based on controlling transitional processes, frequency characteristics, etc. All of those are examples of closed-circuit self-tuning systems, whereby parameters are automatically corrected every time the quality characteristic value falls outside the allowable bounds. In contrast, open-circuit self-tuning systems are systems with para-metrical compensation, whereby input signal itself is controlled and system parameters are changed according to a specified procedure. This type of self-tuning can be close to instantaneous. However, in order to realise such self-tuning one needs to control the environment in which the system operates and a good enough understanding of how the environment influences the controlled system is required.

In practice self-tuning is done through the use of specialised hardware or adaptive software algorithms. Giving software the ability to self-tune (adapt):

#Facilitates controlling critical processes of systems;
#Approaches optimum operation regimes;
#Facilitates design unification of control systems;
#Shortens the lead times of system testing and tuning;
#Lowers the criticality of technological requirements on control systems by making the systems more robust;
#Saves personnel time for system tuning.

[[File:Shear crack.svg|thumb|150px|A crack or tear may develop in a body from parallel shearing forces pushing in opposite directions at different points of the body. If the forces were aligned and aimed straight into each other, they would pinch or compress the body, rather than tear or crack it.]]

{{See|Shear stress}}
'''Shearing forces''' are unaligned [[force]]s pushing one part of a body in one specific direction, and another part of the body in the opposite direction. When the forces are aligned into each other, they are called [[compression forces]]. An example is a deck of cards being pushed one way on the top, and the other at the bottom, causing the cards to slide. Another example is when wind blows at the side of a peaked roof of a home - the side walls experience a force at their top pushing in the direction of the wind, and their bottom in the opposite direction, from the ground or foundation. William A. Nash defines shear force in terms of [[Plane (geometry)|planes]]: "If a plane is passed through a body, a force acting along this plane is called a ''shear force'' or ''shearing force''."&lt;ref name="Nash1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=William A. Nash|title=Schaum's Outline of Theory and Problems of Strength of Materials|pages=82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwdApH7qneAC&amp;pg=PR4|accessdate=20 May 2012|date=1 July 1998|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-046617-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shear force of steel and bolts==
Here follows a short example of how to work out the shear force of a piece of steel. The factor of 0.6 used to change from [[tensile force|tensile]] to shear force could vary from 0.58–0.62 and will depend on application.

Steel called EN8 bright has a tensile strength of 800{{nbsp}}MPa and mild steel has a tensile strength of 400{{nbsp}}MPa.

To work out the force to shear a 25&amp;nbsp;mm diameter round steel EN8 bright;
: Area of the 25{{nbsp}}mm round steel in mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (12.5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(π) ≈ 490.8{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 0.8{{nbsp}}kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × 490.8{{nbsp}}mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 392.64{{nbsp}}kN ≈ 40{{nbsp}}tonne-force
: 40{{nbsp}}tonne-force × 0.6 (to change force from tensile to shear) = 24{{nbsp}}tonne-force

When working with a [[rivet]]ed or tensioned [[bolted joint]], the strength comes from friction between the materials bolted together. Bolts are correctly torqued to maintain the friction. The shear force only becomes relevant when the bolts are not torqued.

A bolt with property class 12.9 has a tensile strength of 1200{{nbsp}}MPa (1{{nbsp}}MPa = 1{{nbsp}}N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or 1.2{{nbsp}}kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and the yield strength is 0.90 times tensile strength, 1080{{nbsp}}MPa in this case.

A bolt with property class 4.6 has a tensile strength of 400{{nbsp}}MPa (1{{nbsp}}MPa = 1{{nbsp}}N/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) or 0.4&amp;nbsp;kN/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and yield strength is 0.60 times tensile strength, 240{{nbsp}}MPa in this case.

In case of fasteners, proof load is specified as it gives a real life picture about the characteristics of the bolt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23365">The '''sleeper effect''' is a psychological phenomenon that relates to persuasion. It is a delayed increase of the effect of a message that is accompanied by a discounting cue.
[[Image:Sleeper Effect.jpg|thumb|right|Figure A: Normal Decay&lt;br /&gt;Figure B: Sleeper Effect]]

==The sleeper effect==
When people are exposed normally to a persuasive message (such as an engaging or persuasive television advertisement), their attitudes toward the advocacy of the message display a significant increase.

Over time, however, their newly formed attitudes seem to gravitate back toward the opinion held prior to receiving the message, almost as if they were never exposed to the communication.  This pattern of normal decay in attitudes has been documented as the most frequently observed longitudinal pattern of persuasion research (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).

In contrast, some messages are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a message disclaimer, a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient’s suspicion of the validity of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone.  Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this is referred to as the sleeper effect (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).

For example, in [[political campaign]]s during important elections, [[Swing vote|undecided voters]] often see negative advertisements about a party or candidate for office.  At the end of the advertisement, they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for the advertisement.  Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of the advertisement, and consequently, they may not be persuaded initially.  However, even though the source of the advertisement lacked credibility, voters will be more likely to be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by the advertisement).

This pattern of attitude change has puzzled social psychologists for nearly half a century, primarily due to its counter-intuitive nature and for its potential to aid in understanding attitude processes (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).  It has been a very widely studied phenomenon of persuasion research (Kumkale &amp; Albarracín, 2004; see also Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).
Despite a long history, the sleeper effect has been notoriously difficult to obtain 
or to replicate, with the exception of a pair of studies by Gruder et al. (1978).

== Controversy about the existence of a "sleeper effect" ==
One of the more challenging aspects that the sleeper effect posed to some researchers in early studies was the sheer difficulty of obtaining the effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Capon|first=N|author2=J. Hulbert |title=The Sleeper Effect - An awakening.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1973|doi=10.1086/268097|volume=37|page=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is controversial because the influence of a persuasive communication is greater when one measures the effect closer to the presentation instead of farther from the time of the reception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook|first=TD|author2=BR FLay |title=The persistence of experimentally induced attitude change|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eagly|first=Ah|author2=S. Chaiken |title=The psychology of attitudes|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After attempting to replicate the effect and failing, some researchers suggested that it might be better to accept the [[null hypothesis]] and conclude that the sleeper effect does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gillig|first=PM|author2=AG Greenwald |title=Is it time to lay the sleeper effect to rest?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|doi=10.1037/h0035744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleeper effect is involved with initial message impression so the phenomenon has implications for models of persuasion, including teaching methods, as well as more recent conceptualizations, such as the [[heuristic-systematic model]] and the [[elaboration likelihood model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.1.143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Cook and his associates responded by suggesting that previous studies failed to obtain the sleeper effect because the requirements for a strong test were not met.  Specifically, they argued that the sleeper effect will occur only if:
:(a) the message is persuasive;
:(b) the discounting cue has a strong enough effect to suppress initial attitude change;
:(c) enough time has elapsed between immediate and delayed post-tests; and

Experimental studies conducted did, in fact, provide evidence for the sleeper effect occurring under such theoretically relevant conditions.  Furthermore, the sleeper effect did not occur when any of the four requirements were not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruder|first=CL|author2=TD Cook |author3=KM Hennigan |author4=BR Flay |author5=C Alessis |author6=J Halamaj |title=Empirical tests of the absolute sleeper effect predicted from the discounting-cue hypothesis.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1978|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.36.10.1061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the dissociation interpretation, a sleeper effect appears to happen when a convincing message is conferred with a discounting cue (such as a low-credible source or counterargument). A sleeper effect occurs because of an impulsive dissociation of a message and a discounting cue over time (contrasting to a simple forgetting of a source).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pratkanis|first=Anthony R. |author2=Leippe |author3=Greenwald |author4=Baumgardner|title=In Search of Reliable Persuasion Effects: The Sleeper Effect is Dead.

==First identified==
The sleeper effect was first identified in U.S. soldiers during World War II, after attempts to change their opinions and morals. Hovland et al. measured the soldier’s opinions five days or nine weeks after they were shown a movie presentation of army propaganda.  It was found that the difference in opinions of those who had observed the army propaganda movie and those who did not watch the movie were greater nine weeks after viewing it than five days.  The difference in delayed persuasion is (which Hovland et al. termed) the sleeper effect, where there was a significant increase of persuasion in the experimental group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracín |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first efforts to justify the effect were consistent with the understanding of persuasion processes at that time.  Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect.  They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=CL|author2=W Weiss |title=The Influence of Source Credibility on Communication Effectiveness.|journal=Public Opinion Quarterly|year=1951|doi=10.1086/266350|volume=15|page=635}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two formulations vary in that (a) '''forgetting''' suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) '''dissociation''' suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumkale|first=G. Tarcan|author2=Dolores Albarracin |title=The Sleeper Effect in Persuasion: A Meta-Analytic Review|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses on how the sleeper effect occurs==
Because the sleeper effect has been considered to be counter-intuitive, researchers since the early 1950s have attempted to explain how and why it occurs.
[[Image:Sleeper Effect2.jpg|thumb|right|Figure A: Forgetting&lt;br /&gt;Figure B: Dissociation&lt;br /&gt;Figure C: Differential-Decay]]

===Forgetting and dissociation===
According to the forgetting hypothesis, a discounting cue associated with a message initially decreases acceptance of the message. As time goes by, one may observe a delayed increase of persuasion if the recipient forgets the cue but recalls the merits of the message (Hovland et al., 1949). To test this hypothesis, Hovland and his colleagues (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Kelman &amp; Hovland, 1953; Weiss, 1953) initiated a series of experiments in which participants received messages attributed to either trustworthy or untrustworthy sources and then completed measures of opinions as well as of recall of the message content and the source. Overall, messages with credible sources produced greater initial persuasion than messages delivered by non credible sources.

[[Carl Hovland|Hovland]], Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949) first discovered the effect by a well-known study that demonstrated the delayed impact of a [[World War II]] [[propaganda film|propaganda movie]] on American soldiers.

With a subset of conditions that caused participants to question the credibility of the source in the movie, participants later reported a slight increase of persuasion (much to the researchers’ surprise). After examining the results, they initially hypothesized that forgetting of the discounting cue (in this case, the non-credible source) was causing the effect. Over time, however, the effect of the messages presented by credible sources decayed, whereas the effect of the messages presented by non-credible sources either remained the same or increased slightly. Despite evidence for the sleeper effect from this series of studies, the recall measures indicated that recipients could still remember the non-credible sources of the messages at the time of the delayed follow-up.

This is when the forgetting hypothesis was replaced by the dissociation hypothesis. Now according to the dissociation hypothesis the sleeper effect does not need to imply that the discounting cue becomes permanently unavailable in memory. A weakened association between the cue and the message may be sufficient for the sleeper effect to occur. As the association weakens over time, rendering the cue less accessible in relation to the communication topic, there may be a delayed increase in persuasion as long as the message arguments are still memorable. To this extent, factors that facilitate retention of the message content should create settings conducive to the sleeper effect.

According to this reasoning, the sleeper effect occurs because the association between the discounting cue and the message in one’s memory becomes weakened over time; hence, when the message is recalled for purposes of producing an attitude, the source is not readily associated.

===Differential decay===

Something that Hovland and his team ignored that is important is why over time, the discounting cue becomes less accessible than the message even when both pieces are similarly effective at the onset.  To answer this question Greenwald, Pratkanis, and their team (Greenwald et al., 1986; Pratkanis et al., 1988) implemented a study to identify the conditions by which the sleeper effect does and does not occur.
Pratkanis directed a series of seventeen experiments in which he presented the discounting cue either before or after the message and found that the sleeper effect occurred mostly when the cue followed the message but not when the cue was first. 
In order to explain his findings, Pratkanis and his team proposed a modified forgetting hypothesis, which suggested that the sleeper effect occurs because the effect of the message and the cues decay at different rates. Based on this suggestion the message and the cue act like two communications operating in opposite directions. The sleeper effect emerges when the effect of these communications is about equal, promptly following message exposure, but the effect of the cue later decays more rapidly than that of the message. However, the timing of the discounting cue is essential to produce the effect because information presented first lasts longer, whereas more recent information dissipates more rapidly (Miller &amp; Campbell, 1959). Thus, the sleeper effect should occur when the discounting cue occurs at the end of a persuasive communication and stimulates a primacy effect of the message content.
Years later, Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, and Baumgardner (1988) offered an [[Alternate hypothesis|alternative hypothesis]] that differed from Hovland and his colleagues.

They argued that the conditions under which the sleeper effect is more likely to occur were not emphasized by the dissociation hypothesis.  Additionally, the requirements for a sleeper effect specified by Gruder et al. (1978) did not detail the empirical conditions necessary to observe the sleeper effect.

}}The '''Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics''' (SECED) was founded in 1969 to promote the study and practice of [[earthquake engineering]] and structural dynamics, including blast, impact and other vibration problems. It also supports study of societal and economic ramifications of major earthquakes.&lt;ref name="SECED"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home|url=http://www.seced.org.uk/|website=SECED|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the British branch of both the International Association (IAEE) and the European Association of Earthquake Engineering (EAEE).&lt;ref name="PreventionWeb"&gt;{{cite web|title=Society for Earthquake and Civil Engineering Dynamics (SECED)|url=http://www.preventionweb.net/organizations/13192|website=Prevention Web|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an Associated Society of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE), and is sponsored by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (IMechE), the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]] (IStructE) and the [[Geological Society of London|Geological Society]].&lt;ref name="SECED" /&gt;

SECED has organised conferences and lectures (see below). It hosted a 2002 European conference on earthquake engineering in London, and in July 2015 hosted a two-day conference at [[Homerton College]], [[Cambridge]] titled ''Earthquake Risk and Engineering towards a Resilient World''.&lt;ref name="Conf"&gt;{{cite web|title=SECED 2015 Conference|url=https://www.jillrogersassociates.co.uk/seced-home.html|website=Jill Rogers Associates|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also organises regular meetings and has published a newsletter since 1987.

'''Sociology''' is the scientific study of [[society]], patterns of social relationships, [[social interaction]], and [[culture]] of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;sociology. (n.d.).

Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to [[social policy]] and [[welfare]], while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the [[micro-sociology]] level of individual [[agency (sociology)|agency]] and interaction to the [[macro-sociology|macro]] level of systems and the [[social structure]].&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro" /&gt;

The different traditional focuses of sociology include [[social stratification]], [[social class]], [[social mobility]], [[sociology of religion|religion]], [[secularization]], [[Sociology of law|law]], [[sexuality]], [[gender]], and [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]]. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between [[structure and agency|social structure and individual agency]], sociology has gradually expanded its focus to other subjects, such as [[sociology of health|health]], [[medical sociology|medical]], [[economic sociology|economy]], [[military sociology|military]] and [[sociology of punishment|penal]] [[institution]]s, [[sociology of the Internet|the Internet]], [[sociology of Education|education]], [[social capital]], and the role of social activity in the development of [[sociology of scientific knowledge|scientific knowledge]].

The range of social scientific methods has also expanded. [[Social research]]ers draw upon a variety of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] and [[quantitative research|quantitative]] techniques. The [[linguistic turn|linguistic]] and [[cultural turn]]s of the mid-20th century led to increasingly [[verstehen|interpretative]], [[hermeneutic]], and [[philosophic]] approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s have seen the rise of new [[analytical sociology|analytically]], [[Mathematical sociology|mathematically]], and [[computational sociology|computationally]] rigorous techniques, such as [[agent-based model]]ling and [[social network|social network analysis]].&lt;ref name=MW/&gt;&lt;ref name="Computational Social Science"/&gt;

Social research informs [[politician]]s and [[public policy|policy makers]], [[education|educators]], [[urban planner|planners]], [[legislator]]s, [[Public administration|administrators]], [[Real estate development|developers]], [[business magnate]]s, managers, [[social worker]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s, [[non-profit organization]]s, and people interested in resolving [[social issues]] in general. There is often a great deal of crossover between social research, [[market research]], and other [[statistics|statistical]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;

===Origins===
[[File:Ibn Khaldoun-Kassus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ibn Khaldun]] statue in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]] (1332–1406)]]

Sociological reasoning predates the foundation of the discipline. [[Social analysis]] has origins in the common stock of [[Western culture|Western knowledge]] and [[philosophy]], and has been carried out from as far back as the time of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|ancient Greek philosopher]] [[Plato]], if not before.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} The origin of the [[Statistical survey|survey]], i.e., the collection of information from a sample of individuals, can be traced back to at least the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. H. Halsey]] (2004), ''A history of sociology in Britain: science, literature, and society'', p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Duncan Mitchell (1970), ''A new dictionary of sociology'', p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; while ancient philosophers such as [[Confucius]] wrote about the importance of social roles. There is evidence of early sociology in medieval Arab writings. Some sources consider [[Ibn Khaldun]], a 14th-century [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] scholar from North Africa (Tunisia), to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/15127|title=A sociological analysis of Ibn Khaldun's theory : a study in the sociology of knowledge|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhaouadi|first=Mahmoud|date=September 1, 1990|title=Ibn Khaldun: The founding father of eastern sociology|journal=International Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=319–335|doi=10.1177/026858090005003007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Faridah Hj|date=|title=Ibn Khaldun and Jane Addams:  The Real Father of Sociology and the Mother of Social Works|journal=Faculty of Business Management Universiti Teknologi Mara, Malaysia|volume=|pages=|citeseerx=10.1.1.510.3556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264385117|title=Debating the Origins of Sociology Ibn Khaldun as a Founding Father of Sociology|last=Mehmet M. &amp; Gilbert P.|first=|date=January 2012|website=Research Gate|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Early Islamic philosophy#Branches|Branches of the early Islamic philosophy]]); his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on [[social cohesion]] and [[social conflict]].&lt;ref name="Akhtar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Autonomous, the Universal and the Future of Sociology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mowlana"/&gt;

The word ''[[wiktionary:sociology|sociology]]'' (or ''"sociologie"'') is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. The [[Latin]] word: ''[[wiktionary:socius|socius]]'', "companion"; the suffix ''[[wiktionary:-logy|-logy]]'', "the study of" from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]] from [[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]], ''lógos'', "word", "knowledge". It was first coined in 1780 by the French essayist [[Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès]] (1748–1836) in an unpublished [[manuscript]].&lt;ref&gt;''Des Manuscrits de Sieyès. 1773–1799'', Volumes I and II, published by Christine Fauré, Jacques Guilhaumou, Jacques Vallier and Françoise Weil, Paris, Champion, 1999 and 2007. See also Christine Fauré and Jacques Guilhaumou, ''Sieyès et le non-dit de la sociologie: du mot à la chose'', in ''Revue d'histoire des sciences humaines'', Numéro 15, novembre 2006: Naissances de la science sociale. See also the article [[:fr:sociologie|'sociologie']] in the French-language Wikipedia.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sociology'' was later defined independently by the French [[philosopher of science]], [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) in 1838&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of Sociology'', Article: Comte, Auguste&lt;/ref&gt; as a new way of looking at society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=10 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte had earlier used the term ''social physics'', but that had subsequently been appropriated by others, most notably the Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]]. Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology, and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm. Writing shortly after the malaise of the [[French Revolution]], he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological [[positivism]], an epistemological approach outlined in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'' (1830–1842) and ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (1848). Comte believed a [[Law of three stages|positivist stage]] would mark the final era, after conjectural [[theological]] and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] phases, in the progression of human understanding.&lt;ref name="comte"/&gt; In observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and having classified the sciences, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ |title=Stanford Encyclopaedia: Auguste Comte |publisher=Plato.Stanford.edu |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auguste Comte2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857)]]
{{Quote|Comte gave a powerful impetus to the development of sociology, an impetus which bore fruit in the later decades of the nineteenth century. To say this is certainly not to claim that French sociologists such as [[Durkheim]] were devoted disciples of the high priest of positivism. But by insisting on the irreducibility of each of his basic sciences to the particular science of sciences which it presupposed in the hierarchy and by emphasizing the nature of sociology as the scientific study of social phenomena Comte put sociology on the map. To be sure, [its] beginnings can be traced back well beyond [[Montesquieu]], for example, and to [[Condorcet]], not to speak of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], Comte's immediate predecessor. But Comte's clear recognition of sociology as a particular science, with a character of its own, justified Durkheim in regarding him as the father or founder of this science, in spite of the fact that Durkheim did not accept the idea of the three states and criticized Comte's approach to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Copleson, Frederick S. J. [1974] ''A History of Philosophy: IX Modern Philosophy'' (1994).

For [[Isaiah Berlin]], Marx may be regarded as the "true father" of modern sociology, "in so far as anyone can claim the title."&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah. 1967. ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment''. Time Inc Book Division, New York. p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|To have given clear and unified answers in familiar empirical terms to those theoretical questions which most occupied men's minds at the time, and to have deduced from them clear practical directives without creating obviously artificial links between the two, was the principal achievement of Marx's theory. The sociological treatment of historical and moral problems, which Comte and after him, [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]] and [[Hippolyte Taine|Taine]], had discussed and mapped, became a precise and concrete study only when the attack of militant Marxism made its conclusions a burning issue, and so made the search for evidence more zealous and the attention to method more intense.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah. [1937] ''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment''. 3rd edition (1967). Time Inc Book Division, New York. pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Isaiah Berlin]]|''Karl Marx: His Life and Environment'' 1937}}

[[File:Spencer-detail.png|upright|thumb|right|[[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903)]]
[[Herbert Spencer]] (27 April 1820&amp;nbsp;– 8 December 1903) was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists. It is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime, far more than any other sociologist at the time. So strong was his influence that many other 19th-century thinkers, including [[Émile Durkheim]], defined their ideas in relation to his. Durkheim's ''[[Division of Labour in Society]]'' is to a large extent an extended debate with Spencer from whose sociology, many commentators now agree, Durkheim borrowed extensively.&lt;ref name="Émile Durkheim's Division of Labor and the Shadow of Herbert Spencer"/&gt; Also a notable [[biologist]], Spencer coined the term ''[[survival of the fittest]]''. While Marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology, Spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a [[laissez-faire]] style of government. His ideas were closely observed by conservative political circles, especially in the [[United States]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name=Commanger/&gt;

===Foundations of the academic discipline===
{{Main|Émile Durkheim|Social facts}}
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The first formal Department of Sociology in the world was established by [[Albion Woodbury Small|Albion Small]] - at the invitation of [[William Rainey Harper]] - at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1892, and the [[American Journal of Sociology]] was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by Small as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dibble, Vernonk. 1975. "The Legacy of Albion Small." Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical [[social research]]. While Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name=Poggi /&gt; For Durkheim, sociology could be described as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's monograph ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897) is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists. ''Suicide'' is a case study of variations in suicide rates among [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, and served to distinguish sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of [[structural functionalism]]. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or [[psychological]]) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]".

Sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of [[modernity]], such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], [[secularization]], and the process of "[[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]".&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jürgen, ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]: Modernity's Consciousness of Time'', Polity Press (1990), paperback, {{ISBN|0-7456-0830-2}}, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The field predominated in [[continental Europe]], with British [[anthropology]] and [[statistics]] generally following on a separate trajectory. By the turn of the 20th century, however, many theorists were active in the [[English-speaking world]]. Few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject, interacting also with [[economics]], [[jurisprudence]], psychology and [[philosophy]], with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields. Since its inception, sociological epistemology, methods, and frames of inquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged.&lt;ref name="Giddens Intro"/&gt;

Durkheim, Marx, and the German theorist [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) are typically cited as the three principal architects of sociology.&lt;ref name="Max Weber&amp;nbsp;– Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy"/&gt; [[Herbert Spencer]], [[William Graham Sumner]], [[Lester F. Ward]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], [[Vilfredo Pareto]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], [[Werner Sombart]], [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[Georg Simmel]] and [[Karl Mannheim]] are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists. Curricula also may include [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Marianne Weber]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology. Each key figure is associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation.&lt;ref name="transformation325"/&gt;

{{Quote|Marx and Engels associated the emergence of modern society above all with the development of capitalism; for Durkheim it was connected in particular with industrialization and the new social division of labor which this brought about; for Weber it had to do with the emergence of a distinctive way of thinking, the rational calculation which he associated with the Protestant Ethic (more or less what Marx and Engels speak of in terms of those 'icy waves of egotistical calculation'). Together the works of these great classical sociologists suggest what Giddens has recently described as 'a multidimensional view of institutions of modernity' and which emphasises not only capitalism and industrialism as key institutions of modernity, but also 'surveillance' (meaning 'control of information and social supervision') and 'military power' (control of the means of violence in the context of the industrialisation of war).&lt;ref name="transformation325"/&gt;|John Harriss|''The Second Great Transformation? Capitalism at the End of the Twentieth Century'' 1992}}

===Positivism and anti-positivism===
====Positivism====
{{Main|Positivism}}
The overarching [[methodology|methodological]] principle of [[positivism]] is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as [[natural science]]. An emphasis on [[empiricism]] and the [[scientific method]] is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.

{{quote|Our main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct.... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism.&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;|[[Émile Durkheim]]|''The Rules of Sociological Method'' (1895)}}

The term has long since ceased to carry this meaning; there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt; Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged, with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th-century developments in the philosophy of science. However, positivism (broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society) remains dominant in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

[[Loïc Wacquant]] distinguishes three major strains of positivism: [[Durkheimian]], Logical, and Instrumental.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; None of these are the same as that set forth by Comte, who was unique in advocating such a rigid (and perhaps optimistic) version.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt; While Émile Durkheim rejected much of the detail of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method. Durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; He developed the notion of objective ''sui generis'' "social facts" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed ''instrumental positivism''. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as the nature of social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, [[replicability]], [[reliabilism|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"/&gt; This positivism is more or less synonymous with [[quantitative research]], and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"/&gt;

====Anti-positivism====
{{Main|Anti-positivism}}
Reactions against social empiricism began when German philosopher [[Hegel]] voiced opposition to both empiricism, which he rejected as uncritical, and determinism, which he viewed as overly mechanistic.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements"/&gt; [[Karl Marx]]'s methodology borrowed from [[Hegelian dialectic]]ism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis, seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of "facts" with the elimination of illusions.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements2"/&gt; He maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented. Early hermeneuticians such as [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] pioneered the distinction between natural and social science ('[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'). Various [[neo-Kantian]] philosophers, [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]]s and [[Human science|human scientists]] further theorized how the analysis of the [[social reality|social world]] differs to that of the [[natural environment|natural world]] due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society, [[culture]], and [[being]].&lt;ref&gt;Rickman, H. P. (1960) ''The Reaction against Positivism and Dilthey's Concept of Understanding'', The London School of Economics and Political Science. p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = From Max Weber: essays in sociology|last = Weber|first = Max|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1946|isbn = |location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Italian context of development of social sciences and of sociology in particular, there are oppositions to the first foundation of the discipline, sustained by speculative philosophy in accordance with the antiscientific tendencies matured by critique of positivism and evolutionism, so a tradition Progressist struggles to establish itself (Cfr. Guglielmo Rinzivillo, ''La scienza e l'oggetto. Autocritica del sapere strategico'', Milan, Franco Angeli, 2010, p. 52 e sg., {{ISBN|978-88-568-2487-2}}). 

At the turn of the 20th century the first generation of German sociologists formally introduced methodological [[anti-positivism]], proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, [[value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbol]]s, and social processes viewed from a resolutely [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. Max Weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify [[causality|causal relationships]] of human "[[social action]]"—especially among "[[ideal type]]s", or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"/&gt; As a non-positivist, however, Weber sought relationships that are not as "historical, invariant, or generalisable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"/&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Fellow German sociologist, [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], theorised on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on "[[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]]" (lit. ''community'' and ''society''). Tönnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action: the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way ("pure sociology"), whereas the second empirically and inductively ("applied sociology").&lt;ref&gt;*Ferdinand Tönnies (ed. Jose Harris), ''Community and Civil Society'', Cambridge University Press (2001), hardcover, 266 pages, {{ISBN|0-521-56119-1}}; trade paperback, Cambridge University Press (2001), 266 pages, {{ISBN|0-521-56782-3}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Max Weber]]]]
{{Quote|[Sociology is] ... the science whose object is to interpret ''the meaning of social action'' and thereby give a ''causal explanation'' of the way in which the ''action proceeds'' and the ''effects which it produces''. By 'action' in this definition is meant the human behaviour when and to the extent that the agent or agents see it as ''subjectively meaningful'' ... the meaning to which we refer may be either (a) the meaning actually intended either by an individual agent on a particular historical occasion or by a number of agents on an approximate average in a given set of cases, or (b) the meaning attributed to the agent or agents, as types, in a pure type constructed in the abstract. In neither case is the 'meaning' to be thought of as somehow objectively 'correct' or 'true' by some metaphysical criterion. This is the difference between the empirical sciences of action, such as sociology and history, and any kind of ''prior'' discipline, such as jurisprudence, logic, ethics, or aesthetics whose aim is to extract from their subject-matter 'correct' or 'valid' meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, Max ''The Nature of Social Action'' in Runciman, W.G. 'Weber: Selections in Translation' Cambridge University Press, 1991. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Max Weber]]|''The Nature of Social Action'' 1922}}

Both Weber and [[Georg Simmel]] pioneered the "''[[Verstehen]]''" (or 'interpretative') method in social science; a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group, or indigenous people, on their own terms and from their own point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Kaern, Phillips &amp; Cohen. (1990) ''Georg Simmel and Contemporary Sociology''.

Relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime, Simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] and [[existentialism|existential]] writers than of Comte or Durkheim, paying particular concern to the forms of, and possibilities for, social individuality.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt; His sociology engaged in a neo-Kantian inquiry into the limits of perception, asking 'What is society?' in a direct allusion to Kant's question 'What is nature?'&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) ''Simmel: On individuality and social forms'' Chicago University Press, 1971. p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|The deepest problems of modern life flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life. The antagonism represents the most modern form of the conflict which primitive man must carry on with nature for his own bodily existence. The eighteenth century may have called for liberation from all the ties which grew up historically in politics, in religion, in morality and in economics in order to permit the original natural virtue of man, which is equal in everyone, to develop without inhibition; the nineteenth century may have sought to promote, in addition to man's freedom, his individuality (which is connected with the division of labor) and his achievements which make him unique and indispensable but which at the same time make him so much the more dependent on the complementary activity of others; Nietssche may have seen the relentless struggle of the individual as the prerequisite for his full development, while socialism found the same thing in the suppression of all competition&amp;nbsp;– but in each of these the same fundamental motive was at work, namely the resistance of the individual to being leveled, swallowed up in the social-technological mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;Simmel, Georg ''The Metropolis and Mental Life'' in Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. p. 324.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Georg Simmel]]|''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' 1903}}

==Theoretical traditions==
{{Main|Sociological theory}}

===Classical theory===
The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic&lt;ref name="Abend"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Abend|first = Gabriel |date = June 2008|title =The Meaning of 'Theory'|journal = Sociological Theory|volume = 26|number = 2|url = https://tirl.org/pc/readings/abend--meaning-of-theory.pdf |publisher = American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of the contentions of classical social theory. In [[Randall Collins]]' well-cited survey of sociological theory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/clc/1820705|title=library.wur.nl|last=Collins|first=R.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0195087024|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Steven E. Barkan |authorlink=Steven Barkan|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World, Brief Edition |chapter=Theoretical Perspectives in Sociology |url=http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2?e=barkbrief-ch01_s03 |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ([[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]) and [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] ([[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], [[Charles Cooley|Cooley]]) theories of social interaction. [[Utilitarianism]], also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with [[economics]], is an established tradition within sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michael Hechter |author2=Satoshi Kanazawa |title=Sociological Rational Choice Theory |journal=Annu. Rev. Sociol. |year=1997 |volume=23 |pages=191–214 |jstor=2952549 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James S., and Thomas J. Fararo. ''Rational choice theory''. New York: Sage (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, as argued by [[Raewyn Connell]], a tradition that is often forgotten is that of [[Social Darwinism]], which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raewyn Connell |title=Southern theory: the global dynamics of knowledge in social science |year=2007 |publisher=Polity |isbn=978-0745642482 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ_rAAAAMAAJ}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Reconstructing the History of Sociological Theory |author=Roscoe C. Hinkle |journal=Mid-American Review of Sociology |year=1982 |volume=VII |issue=1|pages=37–53 |url=https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/4915/1/MARSV7N1A3.pdf |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Lester F. Ward]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.

====Functionalism====
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and [[anthropology]], functionalism addresses the [[social structure]], referred to as [[social organization]] in among the classical theorists, as a whole and regarding the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]]) is to regard [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[institution]]s as 'organs' that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name="Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century"/&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eric Porth |author2=Kimberley Neutzling |author3=Jessica Edwards |url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Functionalism |publisher=Department of Anthropology College of Arts and Sciences The University of Alabama |title=Anthropological Theories: A Guide Prepared by Students for Students: Anthropological theories: Functionalism |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]], in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization. As [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation. functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giddens |first=Anthony |chapter=The Constitution of Society |title=The Giddens Reader |editor=Philip Cassell |publisher= MacMillan Press |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conflict theory====
{{Main|Conflict theory}}
Functionalist theories emphasize "cohesive systems" and are often contrasted with "conflict theories", which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality between particular groups. The following quotes from Durkheim and Marx epitomize the political, as well as theoretical, disparities, between functionalist and conflict thought respectively:

{{Quotation|To aim for a civilisation beyond that made possible by the nexus of the surrounding environment will result in unloosing sickness into the very society we live in. Collective activity cannot be encouraged beyond the point set by the condition of the social organism without undermining health.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile ''The Division of Labor in Society'' [1893] LA Coser: New York: The Free Press, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;|Émile Durkheim|''[[The Division of Labour in Society]]'' 1893}}

{{Quotation|The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.
Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.&lt;ref&gt;Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto'', introduction by Martin Malia (New York: Penguin group, 1998), p. 35 {{ISBN|0-451-52710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Karl Marx]] &amp; [[Friedrich Engels]]|''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' 1848}}

====Symbolic Interactionism====
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism|Dramaturgy (sociology)|Interpretive sociology|Phenomenological sociology}}
[[Symbolic interaction]]; often associated with [[Interactionism]], [[Phenomenological sociology]], [[Dramaturgy (sociology)|Dramaturgy]], [[Antipositivism|Interpretivism]], is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through micro-analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). Sociology 14th Edition. Boston: Pearson. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-205-11671-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition emerged in the [[Chicago School (sociology)|''Chicago School'']] of the 1920s and 1930s, which prior to World War II "had been ''the'' center of sociological research and graduate study".&lt;ref name="Second Chicago School"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Second Chicago School?: The Development of a Postwar American Sociology |editor=Gary Alan Fine |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1995 |isbn=9780226249384 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIZog56cAHEC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=A%20Second%20Chicago%20School%3F%20&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Second%20Chicago%20School?&amp;f=false}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=19 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some important sociologists associated with this approach include [[Max Weber]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[George Homans]] and [[Peter Blau]]. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of [[Ethnomethodology]] emerges from the work of [[Harold Garfinkel]].

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main| Utilitarianism|Rational choice theory|Exchange theory}}

Utilitarianism is often referred to as [[exchange theory]] or [[rational choice theory]] in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by [[Josh Whitford]], rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has (1) "a knowledge of alternatives," (2) "a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives," (3) "an ordering of preferences over outcomes," (4) "A decision rule, to select among the possible alternatives"&lt;ref&gt;"Pragmatism and the untenable dualism of means and ends: Why rational choice theory does not deserve paradigmatic privilege" ''Theory and Society'' 31 (2002): 325–363.&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of [[George C. Homans]], [[Peter Blau]] and [[Richard Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, R. M. "Social Exchange Theory." ''Annual Review of Sociology'' 2.1 (1976): 335–362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational sociologists [[James G. March]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] noted that an individual's [[bounded rationality|rationality is bounded]] by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] president [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]].

===20th-century social theory===
Following the decline of theories of sociocultural evolution, in the United States, the interactionism of the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] dominated American sociology. As [[Anselm Strauss]] describes, "We didn't think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology; we thought it was sociology."&lt;ref name="Second Chicago School"/&gt; After World War II, mainstream sociology shifted to the survey-research of [[Paul Lazarsfeld]] at [[Columbia University]] and the general theorizing of [[Pitirim Sorokin]], followed by [[Talcott Parsons]] at [[Harvard University]]. Ultimately, "the failure of the Chicago, Columbia, and Wisconsin [sociology] departments to produce a significant number of graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 1936–45 was to the advantage of the Harvard department."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Developments in American Sociological Theory, 1915–1950 |author=Roscoe C. Hinkle |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=9781438406770 |page=335 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1VY5jI2pVTgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA335#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Parsons began to dominate general theory, his work predominately referenced European sociology—almost entirely omitting citations of both the American tradition of sociocultural-evolution as well as pragmatism. In addition to Parsons' revision of the sociological canon (which included Marshall, Pareto, Weber and Durkheim), the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the Parsonian structural-functionalist movement, which reached its crescendo in the 1950s, but by the 1960s was in rapid decline.&lt;ref name="Coakley"/&gt;

By the 1980s, most functionalisms in Europe had broadly been replaced by [[conflict theory|conflict]]-oriented approaches&lt;ref name="Slattery"/&gt; and to many in the discipline, functionalism was considered "as dead as a dodo."&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; "According to Giddens, the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives. This third 'generation' of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches, critical theory, ethnomethodology, symbolic interactionism, structuralism, post-structuralism, and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Philip ''The Giddens Reader'' (1993) The Macmillan Press Ltd, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pax Wisconsana====
While some conflict approaches also gained popularity in the United States, the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically oriented [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theories]] with no single overarching, or "grand", theoretical orientation. [[John Levi Martin]] refers to this "golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm" as the ''[[Pax Wisconsana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=John Levi|title=The Explanation of Social Action|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]: numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Sacred Project of American Sociology |author=Christian Smith |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |page=142 |isbn=9780199377145 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=8l6yAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Pax%20Wisconsana%20john%20levi%20martin&amp;pg=PA142#v=onepage&amp;q=Pax%20Wisconsana%20john%20levi%20martin&amp;f=false |accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Omar Lizardo]] describes the ''Pax Wisconsana'' as: "a Midwestern flavored, [[Robert K. Merton|Mertonian]] resolution of the theory/method wars in which [sociologists] all agreed on at least two working hypotheses: (1) [[grand theory]]' is a waste of time; (2) [and] good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin."&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.nd.edu/~olizardo/syllabi/SOC63922-syllabus-spring11.pdf{{Dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century, several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses: structuralism, post-structuralism, cultural sociology and systems theory.

====Structuralism====
[[File:Anthony Giddens at the Progressive Governance Converence, Budapest, Hungary, 2004 October.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Anthony Giddens]]]]

The [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] movement originated primarily from the work of Durkheim as interpreted by two European anthropologists. [[Anthony Giddens]]' theory of structuration draws on the [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the French anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]. In this context, 'structure' refers not to 'social structure' but to the [[semiotic]] understanding of human culture as a [[sign (semiotics)|system of signs]]. One may delineate four central tenets of structuralism: First, structure is what determines the structure of a whole. Second, structuralists believe that every system has a structure. Third, structuralists are interested in 'structural' laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes. Finally, structures are the 'real things' beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Assiter, A 1984, "Althusser and structuralism", ''The British journal of sociology'', vol. 35, no. 2, Blackwell Publishing, pp. 272–296.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second tradition of structuralist thought, contemporaneous with Giddens, emerges from the American school of social network analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jonathan H. Turner |title=The Structure of Sociological Theory |edition=Fifth |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company |location=Belmont, California |url=https://people.uvawise.edu/pww8y/Supplement/TMSup/Turner%20StrucSociTh%201991/27Turner%20StrucSociTh%20NetwkAn.pdf |accessdate=18 December 2014}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; spearheaded by the [[Harvard Department of Social Relations]] led by [[Harrison White]] and his students in the 1970s and 1980s. This tradition of structuralist thought argues that, rather than semiotics, social structure is networks of patterned social relations. And, rather than Levi-Strauss, this school of thought draws on the notions of structure as theorized by Levi-Strauss' contemporary anthropologist, [[Radcliffe-Brown]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"&gt;Lizardo, Omar. "Beyond the antinomies of structure: Levi-Strauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Sewell." ''Theory and society'' 39.6 (2010): 651–688.&lt;/ref&gt; Some&lt;ref&gt;Fararo, Thomas J., and Carter T. Butts. "Advances in generative structuralism: structured agency and multilevel dynamics." ''Journal of Mathematical Sociology'' 24.1 (1999): 1–65.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to this as "network structuralism," and equate it to "British structuralism" as opposed to the "French structuralism" of Levi-Strauss.

====Post-structuralism====
[[Post-structuralist]] thought has tended to [[antihumanism|reject 'humanist' assumptions]] in the conduct of social [[theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony "The Constitution of Society" in ''The Giddens Reader'' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] provides a potent critique in his ''[[the Order of Things|Archaeology of the Human Sciences]]'', though Habermas and [[Richard Rorty|Rorty]] have both argued that Foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Habermas. ''Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present'' in Hoy, D (eds) ''Foucault: A critical reader'' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) ''Foucault: A critical reader'' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; The dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect. The [[anti-humanist]] position has been associated with "[[postmodernism]]", a term used in specific contexts to describe an ''era'' or ''phenomena'', but occasionally construed as a ''method''.

==Central theoretical problems==
Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central problems of sociological theory, which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. This consensus is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret S. Archer |author2=Jonathan Q. Tritt |editor=Jonathan Q. Tritter |title=Rational Choice Theory: Resisting Colonisation |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-0415242714 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vQbjnVBKRAkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=editions%3AW22YGhd2I3YC&amp;pg=PP1#v=snippet&amp;q=otherwise%20cope%20with%20the%20dichotomies%20represented%20by%20'subjectivism%20and%20objectivism',%20'agency%20and%20structure'%20&amp;f=false }}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[subjectivity and objectivity]], [[structure and agency]], and [[synchrony and diachrony]]. The first deals with ''knowledge'', the second with ''action'', and the last with ''time''. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems.

===Subjectivity and objectivity===
{{Main|Objectivity (science)|Objectivity (philosophy)|Subjectivity}}

The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand, the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is ''[[intersubjectivity]]'' achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description [[in situ]].

The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly:{{Peacock term|date=August 2016}}

{{quote| How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialised and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalised? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject| Pierre Bourdieu|"The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology'',1992, pg 235}}

Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,&lt;ref name="ArcherArcher1995"&gt;{{cite book|first=Margaret Scotford |last= Archer|title=Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMbNRp5EseMC&amp;pg=PA65|date=19 October 1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-48442-8|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological [[epistemology]] ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").&lt;ref name="The Constitution of Society"/&gt; A perennial question within this debate is that of "[[social reproduction]]": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?

===Synchrony and diachrony===
Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of [[Levi-Strauss]] who inherited it from the linguistics of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyse dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a ''language'', while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual ''speech''. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to ''Central Problems in Social Theory'', he states that, "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure ... we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of [[social reproduction]]. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim.&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.

==Research methodology==
{{Main|Social research}}
Many people divide sociological research methods into two broad categories, although many others see research methods as a continuum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bamberger|first1=Michael|title=Opportunities and Challenges for Integrating Quantitative and Qualitative Research |url= http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDERTRANSPORT/Resources/quantitative_qualitative.htm|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Quantitative method|Quantitative designs]] approach social phenomena through quantifiable evidence, and often rely on statistical analysis of many cases (or across intentionally designed treatments in an experiment) to create valid and reliable general claims
* [[Qualitative research|Qualitative designs]] emphasize understanding of social phenomena through direct observation, communication with participants, or analysis of texts, and may stress contextual and subjective accuracy over generality

Many sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques. These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory. While very different in many aspects, both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between [[social theory|theory]] and data.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt; Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; In the discipline's two most cited journals, quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two.&lt;ref name="Hunter"/&gt; (Most articles published in the largest British journal, on the other hand, are [[Qualitative research|qualitative]].) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective,&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; and the very term "methodology" is often used synonymously with "[[statistics]]." Practically all sociology PhD programmes in the United States require training in statistical methods. The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more 'trustworthy' and 'unbiased' by the greater public,&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt; though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists.&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;

The choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate. For example, a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a [[Survey research|survey questionnaire]] to a representative sample population. By contrast, a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual's [[social actions]] may choose ethnographic [[participant observation]] or open-ended interviews. Studies will commonly combine, or [[triangulation (social science)|'triangulate']], quantitative ''and'' qualitative methods as part of a 'multi-strategy' design. For instance, a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample, and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]].&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;

===Sampling===
[[File:Planche de Galton.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|The [[bean machine]], designed by early social research methodologist Sir [[Francis Galton]] to demonstrate the [[normal distribution]], which is important to much quantitative [[hypothesis testing]].]]
Quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete [[enumeration]] of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable [[subset]] of a [[Statistical population|population]]. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw [[inference]]s from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as [[sampling (statistics)|'sampling']]. While it is usually best to [[random sampling|sample randomly]], concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for [[stratified sampling]]. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates [[nonprobability sampling]], such as [[convenience sampling]] or [[snowball sampling]].&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;

===Methods===
''The following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive:''
* [[Archival research]] or the [[Historical method]]: draws upon the [[secondary data]] located in historical archives and records, such as biographies, memoirs, journals, and so on.
* [[Content analysis]]: The content of interviews and other texts is systematically analysed. Often data is 'coded' as a part of the '[[grounded theory]]' approach using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software, such as [[Atlas.ti]], [[MAXQDA]], [[NVivo]],&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Patricia Yancey, Turner, Barry A.. (1986). "Grounded Theory and Organisational Research". ''The Journal of Applied Behavioural Science'', 22(2), 141. Retrieved 21 June 2009, from ABI/INFORM Global database. (Document ID: 1155984).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[QDA Miner]].
* [[Experimental research]]: The researcher isolates a single social process and reproduces it in a laboratory (for example, by creating a situation where unconscious sexist judgements are possible), seeking to determine whether or not certain social [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]] can cause, or depend upon, other variables (for instance, seeing if people's feelings about traditional gender roles can be manipulated by the activation of contrasting [[gender stereotype]]s).&lt;ref name="Jost"/&gt; Participants are [[Random assignment|randomly assigned]] to different groups that either serve as [[Scientific control|controls]]—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. Randomization allows the researcher to be sure that any resulting differences between groups are the result of the treatment.
* [[Longitudinal study]]: An extensive examination of a specific person or group over a long period of time.
* [[Observation]]: Using data from the senses, the researcher records information about social phenomenon or behaviour. Observation techniques may or may not feature participation. In [[participant observation]], the researcher goes into the field (such as a community or a place of work), and participates in the activities of the field for a prolonged period of time in order to acquire a deep understanding of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=42 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data acquired through these techniques may be analysed either quantitatively or qualitatively.  In the observation research, a sociologist might study [[global warming]] in some part of the world that is less populated.
* [[Survey research]]: The researcher gathers data using interviews, questionnaires, or similar feedback from a set of people sampled from a particular population of interest. Survey items from an interview or questionnaire may be open-ended or closed-ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=40 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from surveys is usually analysed statistically on a computer.

===Computational sociology===
[[File:Sna large.png|thumb|upright=0.75|left|A [[social network]] diagram: individuals (or 'nodes') connected by relationships]]
{{Main|Computational sociology}}
Sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Blackwell"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2007 |title=Computational Sociology |last=Bainbridge |first=William Sims |encyclopedia=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology |publisher=Blackwell Reference Online |url=http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-85 |doi=10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x |editor=Ritzer, George|isbn=978-1-4051-2433-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[computer simulation]]s, [[artificial intelligence]], [[text mining]], complex statistical methods, and new analytic approaches like [[social network]] analysis and [[social sequence analysis]], computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modelling of social interactions.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;

Although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as [[physics]] and artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="Artificial Societies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooperation"/&gt; By the same token, some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences, such as measures of [[centrality|network centrality]] from the fields of social network analysis and [[network science]]. In relevant literature, computational sociology is often related to the study of [[social complexity]].&lt;ref name="The Computer as Laboratory: Toward a Theory of Complex Adaptive Systems"/&gt; Social complexity concepts such as [[complex systems]], [[non-linear]] interconnection among macro and micro process, and [[emergence]], have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology.&lt;ref name="Methodological Implications of Complex Systems Approaches to Sociality: Simulation as a Foundation for Knowledge"/&gt; A practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an "[[artificial society]]", by which researchers can analyse the structure of a social system.&lt;ref name="SfSS1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Generative"/&gt;

==Scope and topics==
{{Main|Outline of sociology}}

===Culture===
[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (left, front), [[Theodor Adorno]] (right, front), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] (right, back) 1965]]
{{Main|Sociology of culture|Cultural studies}}
Sociologists' approach to culture can be divided into a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not entirely interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/the-sociology-of-culture-versus-cultural-sociology/|title=the sociology of culture versus cultural sociology|website=orgtheory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of culture is an older term, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. Conversely, cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural.&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/ |title=Sociology of Culture and Cultural Sociology |publisher=blog.lib.umn.edu |accessdate=4 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182344/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/ |archivedate=5 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwQPS4H3aVcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Cultures%20and%20Societies%20in%20a%20Changing%20World&amp;pg=PT26#v=onepage&amp;q=cultural%20sociology&amp;f=false|title=Cultures and Societies in a Changing World|publisher=|isbn=9781412990547|author1=Griswold|first1=Wendy|date=10 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Georg Simmel|Simmel]], culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1971"/&gt; While early theorists such as [[Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss|Mauss]] were influential in [[cultural anthropology]], sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for [[Modernity|modern]] (rather than [[Primitive culture|primitive]] or ancient) society. Cultural sociology often involves the [[hermeneutic]] analysis of words, artefacts and symbols, or ethnographic interviews. However, some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture, Weber and Bourdieu for instance. The subfield is sometimes allied with [[critical theory]] in the vein of [[Theodor W. Adorno]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and other members of the [[Frankfurt School]]. Loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of [[cultural studies]]. [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies|Birmingham School]] theorists such as [[Richard Hoggart]] and [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] questioned the division between "producers" and "consumers" evident in earlier theory, emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts. Cultural Studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power. For example, a study of a [[subculture]] (such as white working class youth in London) would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class. The "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda.

====Art, music and literature====
{{Main|Sociology of literature|Sociology of art|Sociology of film|Sociology of music}}
Sociology of literature, film, and art is a subset of the sociology of culture. This field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications. A notable example is Pierre Bourdieu's 1992 ''Les Règles de L'Art: Genèse et Structure du Champ Littéraire'', translated by Susan Emanuel as ''Rules of Art: Genesis and Structure of the Literary Field'' (1996). None of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art, but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others. Marx's theory of ideology was directed at literature by Pierre Macherey, Terry Eagleton and Fredric Jameson. Weber's theory of modernity as cultural rationalization, which he applied to music, was later applied to all the arts, literature included, by Frankfurt School writers such as Adorno and Jürgen Habermas. Durkheim's view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by Robert Escarpit. Bourdieu's own work is clearly indebted to Marx, Weber and Durkheim.

===Criminality, deviance, law and punishment===
{{Main|Criminology|Sociology of law|Sociology of punishment|Deviance (sociology)|Social disorganization theory}}
Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, and control of criminal activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, [[psychology]], and the [[behavioural sciences]]. The sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, including both formally enacted rules (e.g., crime) and informal violations of cultural norms. It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; and how they are enforced. The concept of [[social disorganization]] is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms. For instance, [[Robert K. Merton]] produced a [[Robert K. Merton#Merton's theory of deviance|typology of deviance]], which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance.&lt;ref name="Robert K. Merton Remembered"/&gt;

====Sociology of law====
The study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology. Durkheim famously described law as the "visible symbol" of social solidarity.&lt;ref&gt;Banakar, Reza (2009) "Law Through Sociology's Looking Glass: Conflict and Competition in Sociological Studies of Law" in "The new ISA handbook in contemporary international sociology: Conflict, Competition, and Cooperation", Ann Denis, Devorah Kalekin-Fishman, eds., (London: Sage). An e-copy available at [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1327025 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The sociology of law refers to both a sub-discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies. Sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society, such as the development of legal [[institution]]s and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa. For example, an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the US over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime; and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial [[Social stratification|stratification]].&lt;ref name="Western"/&gt;

===Communications and information technologies===
The [[sociology of communications]] and information technologies includes "the social aspects of computing, the Internet, new media, computer networks, and other communication and information technologies".&lt;ref name="asanet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/CIT.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Communication and Information Technology Section|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402230046/http://www.asanet.org/sections/CIT.cfm|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Internet and digital media====
{{Main|Sociology of the Internet|Digital sociology}}
The Internet is of interest to sociologists in various ways; most practically as a tool for [[social research|research]] and as a discussion platform.&lt;ref&gt;D. R. Wilson, Researching Sociology on the Internet, [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-534-62437-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sociology of the Internet]] in the broad sense regards the analysis of [[online communities]] (e.g. [[newsgroup]]s, social networking sites) and [[virtual world]]s, thus there is often overlap with [[community sociology]]. Online communities may be studied statistically through [[social network|network analysis]] or interpreted qualitatively through [[virtual ethnography]]. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through [[new media]], thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an [[industrial society|industrial]] to an [[informational society]]. One notable text is [[Manuel Castells]]' ''[[The Internet Galaxy]]''—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The Internet Galaxy, Reflections on the Internet, Business and Society. Oxford, Oxford University Press (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is [[digital sociology]], which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century.

====Media====
{{Main|Media studies}}
As with [[cultural studies]], media study is a distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities, in particular, [[literary criticism]] and [[critical theory]]. Though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms is not in the remit of sociologists, analyses of [[socialization|socializing]] factors, such as [[ideology|ideological effects]] and [[audience reception]], stem from sociological theory and method. Thus the 'sociology of the media' is not a subdiscipline ''per se'', but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic.

===Economic sociology===
{{Main|Economic sociology}}
The term "economic sociology" was first used by [[William Stanley Jevons]] in 1879, later to be coined in the works of Durkheim, Weber and Simmel between 1890 and 1920.&lt;ref name="princeton1"/&gt; Economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena, emphasizing class relations and [[modernity]] as a philosophical concept. The relationship between [[capitalism]] and [[modernity]] is a salient issue, perhaps best demonstrated in Weber's ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905) and Simmel's ''[[The Philosophy of Money]]'' (1900). The contemporary period of economic sociology, also known as ''new economic sociology'', was consolidated by the 1985 work of [[Mark Granovetter]] titled "Economic Action and Social Structure: The Problem of Embeddedness". This work elaborated the concept of [[embeddedness]], which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations (and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part). [[Social network|Social network analysis]] has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon. Granovetter's theory of the [[Mark Granovetter#The strength of weak ties|strength of weak ties]] and [[Ronald Burt]]'s concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field.

====Work, employment, and industry====
{{Main|Industrial sociology|sociology of work|Industrial relations}}
The sociology of work, or industrial sociology, examines "the direction and implications of trends in [[technological]] change, [[globalization]], labour markets, work organization, [[managerial]] practices and [[division of labour|employment relations]] to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge, resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Tony J. 2008 ''Sociology, Work, and Industry''. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-43555-2}}. p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
{{Main|Sociology of education}}
The sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures, experiences, and other outcomes. It is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies.&lt;ref name="Dictionary"/&gt; A classic 1966 study in this field by [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]], known as the "Coleman Report", analysed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources (''i.e.'' per pupil spending).&lt;ref name="Hanushek"/&gt; The controversy over "school effects" ignited by that study has continued to this day. The study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms, and thus served as a catalyst for [[desegregation busing]] in American public schools.

===Environment===
{{Main|Environmental sociology|Sociology of disaster}}

Environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment, typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems, social impacts of those problems, and efforts to resolve them. As with other sub-fields of sociology, scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis, from global (e.g. world-systems) to local, societal to individual. Attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become ''defined'' and ''known'' to humans. As argued by notable environmental sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]], the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is Marx's analysis of the [[metabolic rift]], which influenced contemporary thought on [[sustainability]]. Environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the [[sociology of risk]], [[rural sociology]] and the [[sociology of disaster]].

====Human ecology====
{{Main|Human ecology|Architectural sociology|Visual sociology|Sociology of space}}

Human ecology deals with interdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural, social, and built environments. In addition to Environmental sociology, this field overlaps with [[architectural sociology]], [[urban sociology]], and to some extent [[visual sociology]]. In turn, visual sociology—which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life—overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography, film and other technologies of media.

====Social pre-wiring====
Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmc = 2951360|year = 2010|last1 = Castiello|first1 = U.|title = Wired to be Social: The Ontogeny of Human Interaction|journal = PLOS ONE|volume = 5|issue = 10|pages = e13199|last2 = Becchio|first2 = C.|last3 = Zoia|first3 = S.|last4 = Nelini|first4 = C.|last5 = Sartori|first5 = L.|last6 = Blason|first6 = L.|last7 = d'Ottavio|first7 = G.|last8 = Bulgheroni|first8 = M.|last9 = Gallese|first9 = V.|pmid = 20949058|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired" /&gt;

===Family, gender, and sexuality===
{{Main|Sociology of the family|Sociology of childhood|Sociology of gender|Feminist sociology|Feminist theory|Queer theory}}
[[File:WomanFactory1940s.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|"[[Rosie the Riveter]]" was an iconic symbol of the American [[United States home front during World War II|homefront]] and a departure from [[gender roles]] due to wartime necessity.]]
Family, gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology. A family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties :- Relations of blood / marriage / civil partnership or adoption. The family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies. It is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society. The sociology of the family examines the family, as an [[institution]] and unit of [[socialization]], with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the [[nuclear family]] and its distinct [[gender roles]]. The notion of "[[childhood]]" is also significant. As one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives, the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula. [[Feminist sociology]], on the other hand, is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality, particularly with respect to power and inequality. The primary concern of [[feminist theory]] is the [[patriarchy]] and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies, both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure. [[Feminist sociology]] also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Bose, Christine. 2012. "Intersectionality and Global Gender Inequality" Gender &amp; Society 26(1): 67–72&lt;/ref&gt; "How to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods" is also a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Role of Religion and Spirituality in Mental and Physical Health | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | date = February 2001 | first = Kevin S. | last = Seybold |author2=Peter C. Hill | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–24 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]] of gender, on the other hand, uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification. For example, one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Correll, Shelley, Stephen Benard, In Paik. 2007. "Getting a job: Is there a motherhood penalty?" American Journal of Sociology 112: 1297–1338.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health, illness, and the body===
{{Main|Sociology of health and illness|Medical sociology}}
The [[sociology of health and illness]] focuses on the social effects of, and public attitudes toward, [[illness]]es, diseases, [[mental health]] and [[disabilities]]. This sub-field also overlaps with [[gerontology]] and the study of the [[ageing]] process. Medical sociology, by contrast, focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions. In Britain, sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the Goodenough Report (1944).&lt;ref name="British Sociological Association: Medical Sociology"/&gt;

====Death, dying, bereavement====
A subfield of the sociology of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology is the study of death, dying and bereavement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/social-aspects-of-death,-dying-and-bereavement.aspx|title=The British Sociological Association|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714122235/http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/social-aspects-of-death%2C-dying-and-bereavement.aspx|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes referred to broadly as the [[sociology of death]]. This topic is exemplifed by the work of [[Douglas Davies]] and [[Michael C. Kearl]].

===Knowledge and science===
{{Main|Sociology of knowledge|Sociology of scientific knowledge|Sociology of the history of science|Sociology of science}}
The sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises, and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies. The term first came into widespread use in the 1920s, when a number of German-speaking theorists, most notably [[Max Scheler]], and [[Karl Mannheim]], wrote extensively on it. With the dominance of [[Structural functionalism|functionalism]] through the middle years of the 20th century, the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought. It was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s, particularly by [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]] in ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966) and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society (compare ''[[socially constructed reality]]''). The "archaeological" and "genealogical" studies of [[Michel Foucault]] are of considerable contemporary influence.

The sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity, especially dealing "with the social conditions and effects of science, and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity."&lt;ref name="socofsci-bendavid"/&gt; Important theorists in the sociology of science include [[Robert K. Merton]] and [[Bruno Latour]]. These branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of [[science and technology studies]]. Both the [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] and the [[British Sociological Association|BSA]] have sections devoted to the subfield of Science, Knowledge and Technology.&lt;ref name="asanet3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/SKAT.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Section on Science, Knowledge and Technology|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321045626/http://www.asanet.org/sections/SKAT.cfm|archivedate=21 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/science-technology-studies.aspx|title=The British Sociological Association|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714150113/http://www.britsoc.co.uk/study-groups/science-technology-studies.aspx|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Sociological Association|ISA]] maintains a Research Committee on Science and Technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/rc23.htm|title=ISA - Research Committee on Sociology of Science and Technology RC23|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leisure===
{{Main|Sociology of leisure|Sociology of sport}}
Sociology of leisure is the study of how humans organize their free time. Leisure includes a broad array of activities, such as [[Sociology of sport|sport]], tourism, and the playing of games. The sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work, as each explores a different side of the work–leisure relationship. More recent studies in the field move away from the work–leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture. This area of sociology began with [[Thorstein Veblen]]'s ''Theory of the Leisure Class''.&lt;ref&gt;Lueschen, G. 1980. Sociology of Sport: Development, Present State, and Prospects. ''Annual Review of Sociology'', 6: 315–347.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace, war, and conflict===
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies|Military sociology|Sociology of terrorism}}
This subfield of sociology studies, broadly, the dynamics of war, conflict resolution, peace movements, war refugees, conflict resolution and military institutions.&lt;ref name="asanet4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sectionpwsc/sectinfo.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Section Information|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a subset of this subfield, [[military sociology]] aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an [[Military organization|organization]]. It is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct [[social group|group]] with coerced [[collective action]] based on shared [[Advocacy group|interests]] linked to survival in [[vocation]] and [[combat]], with purposes and [[value (personal and cultural)|values]] that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns [[civilian]]-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies. Topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military, changes in military members' willingness to fight, military unionization, military professionalism, the increased utilization of women, the military industrial-academic complex, the military's dependence on research, and the institutional and organizational structure of military.&lt;ref name="Core Issues and Theory in Military Sociology"/&gt;

===Political sociology===
{{Main|Political sociology}}
[[File:JuergenHabermas.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jürgen Habermas]]]]
Historically, political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society. A typical research question in this area might be: "Why do so few American citizens choose to vote?"&lt;ref&gt;Piven, F. (1988) ''Why Americans Don't Vote: And Why Politicians Want it That Way'' Pantheon. {{ISBN|0-679-72318-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical [[survey research]] by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]]. A major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions, which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends. The field developed from the work of Max Weber and [[Moisey Ostrogorsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Lipset, S.M. ''Introduction: Ostrogorski and the Analytical Approach to the Comparative Study of Political Parties'' in M. Ostrogorski, Democracy and the Organisation of Political (2 vol, 1964; 1982 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research, but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=LWwBN3rUrO4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=contemporary+political+sociology |title=Contemporary Political Sociology: Globalization, Politics and Power |author=Kate Nash |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year= 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011 |isbn=9781444320770}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}&lt;!-- unless the intent was the web page itself, in which case this should be {{cite web}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of [[social movements]] and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5mazSOSvqrEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=social+movements#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Social movements: an introduction&amp;nbsp;– Donatella Della Porta, Mario Diani |date= 9 February 2009|accessdate=4 November 2011|isbn=9781405148214|last1=Porta |first1=Donatella Della |last2=Diani |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political sociology has also moved beyond [[methodological nationalism]] and analysed the role of non-governmental organizations, the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the Earth as a [[social construct]], and the role of [[Statelessness|stateless entities]] in the modern [[world society]]. Contemporary political sociologists also study inter-state interactions and [[human rights]].

===Population and demography===
{{Main|Demography|Human ecology|Mobilities}}

Demographers or sociologists of population study the size, composition and change over time of a given population. Demographers study how these characteristics impact, or are impacted by, various social, economic or political systems. The study of population is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology, which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology. Researchers in this field may study the movement of populations: transportation, migrations, diaspora, etc., which falls into the subfield known as [[Mobilities]] studies and is closely related to [[human geography]]. Demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or [[epidemiology]].

===Public sociology===
{{Main|Public sociology}}

Public sociology refers to an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, or set of political values. This approach is primarily associated with [[Michael Burawoy]] who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology is also part of the broader field of science communication or [[science journalism]]. In a distinct but similar vein,&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. ''Sociological Spectrum''. 36 (3): 183-190&lt;/ref&gt; [[applied sociology]], also known as [[clinical sociology]], [[policy sociology]] or [[sociological practice]], applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.

===Race and ethnic relations===
{{Main|Sociology of race and ethnic relations|Sociology of immigration}}
The sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the [[Social relation|social]], political, and economic relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of [[racism]], [[residential segregation]], and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]]. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;"Milton Louw&amp;nbsp;– Making A Better World." : Oldest Coloured Owned Business in Namibia. Web. 22 February 2012. &lt;http://milton-louw.blogspot.com/2011/03/oldest-coloured-owned-business-in.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Religion===
{{Main|Sociology of religion}}
The sociology of religion concerns the practices, historical backgrounds, developments, universal themes and roles of religion in society.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin J. Christiano, et al., (2nd ed., 2008), Sociology of Religion: Contemporary Developments, Lanham, Maryland: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers. {{ISBN|978-0-7425-6111-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history. The sociology of religion is distinguished from the [[philosophy of religion]] in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims, instead assuming what [[Peter L. Berger]] has described as a position of "methodological atheism".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Peter L. ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (1967). Anchor Books 1990 paperback: {{ISBN|0-385-07305-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology ''began'' with the analysis of religion in Durkheim's 1897 [[suicide (book)|study of suicide]] rates among [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations. Max Weber published four major texts on religion in a context of [[economic sociology]] and [[social stratification]]: ''[[The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism]]'' (1905), ''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]]'' (1915), ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]]'' (1915), and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]'' (1920). Contemporary debates often centre on topics such as [[secularization]], [[civil religion]], the intersection of religion and economics and the role of religion in a context of [[globalization]] and [[multiculturalism]].

===Social change and development===
{{Main|Social change| Development studies|Community development|International development}}

The sociology of change and development attempts to understand how societies develop and how they can be changed. This includes studying many different aspects of society, for example demographic trends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shackman|first1=Gene|last2=Wang|first2=Xun|last3=Liu|first3=Yalin|title=Brief Review of World Demographic Trends Summary|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1754255|website=SSRN|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; political or technological trends,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silberglitt|first1=Richard|last2=Anton|first2=Philip|last3=Howell|first3=David|title=The Global Technology Revolution 2020, In-Depth Analyses Bio/Nano/Materials/Information Trends, Drivers, Barriers, and Social Implications|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/technical_reports/TR303.html|publisher=Rand|accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or changes in culture. Within this field, sociologists often use [[macrosociology|macrosociological methods]] or [[Comparative historical research|historical-comparative methods]]. In contemporary studies of social change, there are overlaps with [[international development]] or [[community development]]. However, most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history. For instance, [[Marx]] contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society, while [[Weber]] argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of Protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances. In contrast to both, [[Durkheim]] argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of [[sociocultural evolution]]. Sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism. Most notably, [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] extends Marx's theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as [[world systems theory]]. Development sociology is also heavily influenced by [[post-colonialism]]. In recent years, [[Raewyn Connell]] issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the [[Global North]]. She argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the lived experiences of the [[Global South]], specifically, so-called, "Northern Theory" lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism.

There are many organizations studying social change, including the [[Fernand Braudel Center]] for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems, and Civilizations, and the [[Global Social Change Research Project]].

===Social networks===
[[File:Harrisonwhite.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|[[Harrison White]]]]
{{Main|Social network|Social network analysis|Figurational Sociology|Relational sociology|Sociomapping}}
A social network is a [[social structure]] composed of individuals (or organizations) called "nodes", which are tied (connected) by one or more specific types of [[interdependency]], such as [[friendship]], [[kinship]], financial exchange, dislike, [[sexual network|sexual relationships]], or relationships of beliefs, knowledge or prestige. Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local [[communities]] to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from [[relational sociology]], social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by [[Omar Lizardo]] also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last =Lizardo|first= Omar|title = How cultural tastes shape personal networks|journal = American Sociological Review|volume = 71|issue = 5 |date= October 2006|pages = 778–807|url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/25472427 |deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808142642/http://folders.nottingham.edu.cn/staff/zlizaw/Readings/Week%202/Lizardo%202006.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social network theory is usually defined in [[Mathematical sociology|formal mathematics]] and may include integration of geographical data into [[Sociomapping]].

===Social psychology===
{{Main|Social psychology (sociology)|Psychoanalytic sociology}}
Sociological social psychology focuses on micro-scale [[social actions]]. This area may be described as adhering to "sociological miniaturism", examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups.&lt;ref name="Sociological miniaturism: seeing the big through the small in social psychology"/&gt; Of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic, social, and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction. Some of the major topics in this field are social inequality, [[group dynamics]], prejudice, aggression, social perception, group behaviour, social change, non-verbal behaviour, socialization, conformity, leadership, and social identity. Social psychology may be taught with [[Social psychology (psychology)|psychological emphasis]].&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; In sociology, researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the [[experiment|experimental method]] (however, unlike their psychological counterparts, they also frequently employ other methodologies). Social psychology looks at social influences, as well as social perception and social interaction.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

===Stratification, poverty and inequality===
{{Main|Social stratification|Social inequality|Social mobility|Social class}}
Social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes, [[caste]]s, and divisions within a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=225 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[Western culture|Western societies]] stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers: upper class, middle class, and [[Working class|lower class]], but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes (e.g. [[occupational prestige|occupational]]).&lt;ref name="Social Class and Stratification"/&gt; Social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology. Proponents of [[structural functionalism]] suggest that, since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies, hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence. [[Conflict theory|Conflict theorists]], by contrast, critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of [[social mobility]] in stratified societies.

Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the [[means of production]] in the capitalist system: the [[bourgeoisie]] own the means, but this effectively includes the [[proletariat]] itself as the workers can only sell their own [[labour power]] (forming the [[base and superstructure|material base of the cultural superstructure]]). Max Weber critiqued Marxist [[economic determinism]], arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities, but on other status and power differentials (e.g. [[patriarchy]]). According to Weber, stratification may occur among at least three complex variables: (1) Property (class): A person's economic position in a society, based on birth and individual achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis |last2=Gerber |first=John |first2=Linda |year=2010 |title=Sociology |edition=7th Canadian |location=Toronto |publisher=[[Pearson Canada]] |page=243 |isbn=978-0-13-700161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification. Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat. (2) Prestige (status): A person's prestige, or popularity in a society. This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and (3) Power (political party): A person's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others. For example, individuals in state jobs, such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or a member of the United States Congress, may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stark|first= Rodney|title=Sociology|year=2006|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing|isbn=978-0-495-09344-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] provides a modern example in the concepts of [[cultural capital|cultural]] and [[symbolic capital]]. Theorists such as [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern Western societies, particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies.&lt;ref&gt;Dahrendorf, Ralf. (1959) Class and Class Conflict in Industrial Society. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Perspectives concerning globalization, such as [[dependency theory]], suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Bornschier V. (1996), 'Western society in transition' New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urban and rural sociology===
{{Main|Urban sociology|Rural sociology}}
Urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas. It is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making. After the [[industrial revolution]], works such as [[Georg Simmel]]'s ''[[The Metropolis and Mental Life]]'' (1903) focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity. In the 1920s and 1930s The [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School]] produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city, important to both urban sociology and criminology, utilizing [[symbolic interactionism]] as a method of field research. Contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of [[globalization]], for instance, in [[Saskia Sassen]]'s study of the "[[Global city]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sassen | first = Saskia | title = The global city: New York, London, Tokyo | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 2001 | origyear = 1991 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780691070636 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural sociology, by contrast, is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas. As agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions, rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists.

====Community sociology====
Often grouped with urban and rural sociology is that of community sociology or the sociology of community.&lt;ref name="asanet5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asanet.org/sections/CUS.cfm|title=American Sociological Association: Section on Community and Urban Sociology|publisher=asanet.org|accessdate=4 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315020313/http://asanet.org/sections/CUS.cfm|archivedate=15 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking various communities—including online communities—as the unit of analysis, community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people. For instance, German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] distinguished between two types of human association: ''[[Gemeinschaft]]'' (usually translated as "community") and ''[[Gesellschaft]]'' ("society" or "association"). In his 1887 work, ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Tönnies argued that ''Gemeinschaft'' is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity, due to the presence of a "unity of will".&lt;ref&gt;Tönnies, F. 1887. ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'development' or 'health' of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in [[development sociology]], exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of [[social capital]].

==Other academic disciplines==
Sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society, in particular [[anthropology]], [[political science]], [[economics]], [[social work]] and [[social philosophy]]. Many comparatively new fields such as [[communication studies]], [[cultural studies]], [[demography]] and [[literary theory]], draw upon methods that originated in sociology. The terms "[[social science]]" and "[[social research]]" have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology. The distinct field of [[social anthropology]] or anthroposociology is the dominant constituent of anthropology throughout the [[United Kingdom]] and Commonwealth and much of Europe ([[France]] in particular&lt;ref&gt;[http://cairn-int.info/abstract-E_ANSO_121_0093--cultural-anthropology-or-social-anthropo.htm#anchor_cite Dianteill, Erwan, "Cultural Anthropology or Social Anthropology? A Transatlantic Argument", L’Année sociologique 1/2012 (Vol. 62), p. 93-122].&lt;/ref&gt;), where it is distinguished from [[cultural anthropology]].&lt;ref name="UKAnthroBench"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/Publications/InformationAndGuidance/Documents/Anthropology07.pdf |title=Benchmark Statement Anthropology (UK) |publisher=QAA (UK) |date= |accessdate=2012-01-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921091757/http://www.qaa.ac.uk/Publications/InformationAndGuidance/Documents/Anthropology07.pdf |archive-date=21 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, social anthropology is commonly subsumed within cultural anthropology (or under the relatively new designation of [[sociocultural anthropology]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Sociology and [[applied sociology]] are connected to the professional and academic discipline of [[social work]].&lt;ref name="Web page"/&gt; Both disciplines study social interactions, community and the effect of various systems (i.e. family, school, community, laws, political sphere) on the individual.&lt;ref name="Generalist Practice with Organisations and Communities"/&gt; However, social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions; sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems.&lt;ref name="Direct Social Work Practice"/&gt; For example, a sociologist might study ''why'' a community is plagued with poverty. The [[applied sociology|applied sociologist]] would be more focused on practical strategies on ''what'' needs to be done to alleviate this burden. The social worker would be focused on ''action''; implementing theses strategies [[clinical social work|"directly"]] or [[Community practice|"indirectly"]] by means of [[mental health|mental health therapy]], [[counseling|counselling]], [[advocacy]], [[community organization]] or [[community mobilization]].&lt;ref name="Generalist Practice with Organisations and Communities"/&gt;

[[Social anthropology]] is the branch of [[anthropology]] that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in [[social group]]s. Practitioners of social anthropology, like sociologists, investigate various facets of [[social organization]]. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.&lt;ref name="James Trostle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Web page" /&gt;

[[Sociocultural anthropology]], which include [[linguistic anthropology]], is concerned with the problem of difference and similarity within and between human populations. The discipline arose concomitantly with the expansion of European colonial empires, and its practices and theories have been questioned and reformulated along with processes of decolonization. Such issues have re-emerged as transnational processes have challenged the centrality of the [[Nation state|nation-state]] to theorizations about culture and [[Power (social and political)|power]]. New challenges have emerged as public debates about [[multiculturalism]], and the increasing use of the culture concept outside of the academy and among peoples studied by anthropology. These times are not "business-as-usual" in the academy, in anthropology, or in the world, if ever there were such times.

[[Irving Louis Horowitz]], in his ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' (1994), has argued that the discipline, while arriving from a "distinguished lineage and tradition", is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making: "The decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking, and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; Furthermore: "A problem yet unmentioned is that sociology's malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism—to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis. Talented individuals who might, in an earlier time, have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business, law, the natural sciences, and even creative writing; this drains sociology of much needed potential."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1994"/&gt; Horowitz cites the lack of a 'core discipline' as exacerbating the problem. [[Randall Collins]], the [[Dorothy Swaine Thomas]] Professor in Sociology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the [[Social Evolution &amp; History]] journal, has voiced similar sentiments: "we have lost all coherence as a discipline, we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities, each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other."&lt;ref&gt;Randall Collins, Cited in Horowitz, Irving (1994) ''The Decomposition of Sociology'' Oxford University Press. p. 3–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[Times Higher Education|The Times Higher Education Guide]]'' published a list of 'The most cited authors of books in the Humanities' (including philosophy and psychology). Seven of the top ten are listed as sociologists: [[Michel Foucault]] (1), [[Pierre Bourdieu]] (2), [[Anthony Giddens]] (5), [[Erving Goffman]] (6), [[Jürgen Habermas]] (7), [[Max Weber]] (8), and [[Bruno Latour]] (10).&lt;ref name="The most cited authors of books in the humanities"/&gt;

'''''Sphaerotilus natans''''' is an aquatic [[periphyton]] organism associated with polluted water.  It forms colonies commonly known as "sewage fungus", but later identified as tightly sheathed filamentous [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun p.32-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
Straight or smoothly curved filaments 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and 100 to more than 500&amp;nbsp;µm in length are formed by rod-shaped cells with clear [[septum|septa]] growing within a long, tubular sheath.  An adhesive basal element at one end of the filament can aid attachment to solid surfaces.&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pellegrin |first1=Véronique  |last2=Juretschko |first2=Stefan  |last3=Wagner |first3= Michael |last4=Cottenceau  |first4=Gilles |year=1999 |title=Morphological and Biochemical Properties of a Sphaerotilus sp.

''S. natans'' stores reserves of [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|poly- ''beta'' -hydroxybutyrate]] as internal globules making up 30 to 40% of the dry weight of a colony.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;   Gram and Neisser staining reactions are negative.&lt;ref name="ebs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebsbiowizard.com/resources/micro-gallery/sphaerotilus-natans/|title=Sphaerotilus natans|publisher=Environmental Business Specialists LLC|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
''S. natans'' requires dissolved simple [[sugar]]s or [[organic acid]]s as a food supply, but needs less [[phosphorus]] than many competing organisms and can tolerate low [[oxygen]] concentrations.&lt;ref name="ebs"/&gt;  Capability to deposit elemental [[sulfur]] intracellularly in the presence of [[hydrogen sulfide]] is believed to be a detoxifying mechanism.  ''S. natans'' requires either [[cobalamin]] or [[methionine]] as a trace nutrient.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;  ''S. natans'' filaments can aid development of a periphyton [[biofilm]] trapping suspended particles and stabilizing colonies of other organisms including ''[[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.&lt;ref name="aem"/&gt;

==Significance==
''Sphaerotilus natans'' is often associated with a buoyant floc (or "bulking sludge") causing poor solids separation in [[activated sludge]] [[clarifier]]s of [[Sewage treatment#Secondary treatment|secondary sewage treatment]].&lt;ref name="h55"/&gt;  Metal surfaces covered with ''S. natans'' may experience accelerated [[corrosion]] if the slime creates a barrier causing differential oxygen concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Betz pp.288&amp;289&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. natans'' slimes may reduce quality of paper produced by [[paper mill]]s using recycled water streams.&lt;ref name="aem"/&gt;

'''Stem cells'''     are [[cell (biology)|biological cells]] that can [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into other types of cells and can [[cell division|divide]] to produce more of the same type of stem cells. They are found in [[multicellular organisms]].

In [[mammal]]s, there are two broad types of stem cells: [[embryonic stem cell]]s, which are isolated from the [[inner cell mass]] of [[blastocyst]]s, and [[adult stem cell]]s, which are found in various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. In [[adult]] organisms, stem cells and [[progenitor cell]]s act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing [[embryo]], stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see [[induced pluripotent stem cells]])—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.

There are three known accessible sources of [[autologous]] adult stem cells in humans:
# [[Bone marrow]], which requires extraction by ''harvesting'', that is, drilling into bone (typically the [[femur]] or [[iliac crest]]).
# Adipose tissue (fat cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coughlin RP, Oldweiler A, Mickelson DT, Moorman CT | title = Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Transplant Technique for Degenerative Joint Disease | journal = Arthroscopy Techniques | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e1761-e1766 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29399463 | pmc = 5795060 | doi = 10.1016/j.eats.2017.06.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Blood, which requires extraction through [[apheresis]], wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from [[umbilical cord blood]] just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.

Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies (e.g., [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplantation]]). Stem cells can now be [[Cell culture|artificially grown]] and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic [[cell line]]s and [[autologous]] embryonic stem cells generated through [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] or [[Cellular differentiation#Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiation]] have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuch BE | title = Stem cells--a clinical update | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 719–21 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16969445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into stem cells grew out of findings by [[Ernest McCulloch|Ernest A.

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
* ''Self-renewal'': the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* ''Potency'': the capacity to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms exist to ensure that a stem cell population is maintained:

1. [[Asymmetric cell division|Obligatory asymmetric replication]]: a stem cell divides into one mother cell that is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell that is differentiated.

When a stem cell self-renews it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.&lt;ref&gt;Shenghui, H. E., Nakada, D., &amp; Morrison, S. J. (2009). Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. Annual Review of Cell and Developmental, 25, 377–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell develops into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.

===Potency meaning===

These stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta.

* [[Unipotency|Unipotent]] cells can produce only one cell type, their own,&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; but have the property of self-renewal, which distinguishes them from non-stem cells (e.g. [[progenitor cell]]s, which cannot self-renew).

===Identification===
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[clonogenic assay]]s, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenstein AJ, Deriglasova UF, Kulagina NN, Panasuk AF, Rudakowa SF, Luriá EA, Ruadkow IA | title = Precursors for fibroblasts in different populations of hematopoietic cells as detected by the in vitro colony assay method | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–92 | year = 1974 | pmid = 4455512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-09-01|title=Stem Cell Therapy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976001611602093|journal=Apollo Medicine|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=271–276|doi=10.1016/S0976-0016(11)60209-3|issn=0976-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic==
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}

[[Embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) are the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] of a [[blastocyst]], an early-stage [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM | title = Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5391 | pages = 1145–7 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9804556 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145 | bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[embryo]]s reach the [[blastocyst]] stage 4–5 days post [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ESCs are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the [[placenta]].

During embryonic development these inner cell mass cells continuously divide and become more specialized.  For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as '[[neurectoderm]]', which will become the future [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore| name-list-format = vanc  |title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in development, [[neurulation]] causes the neurectoderm to form the [[neural tube]].  At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes [[encephalization]] to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain.  At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a [[neural stem cell]].  These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics.  The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called [[neurogenesis]].  One prominent example of a neural stem cell is the [[radial glial cell]], so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some [[glial]] characteristics, most notably the expression of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology | journal = Nature Reviews.

Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages ([[neuron]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, and [[oligodendrocyte]]s), and thus their potency is restricted.&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"/&gt;

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass.  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of [[gelatin]] as an [[extracellular matrix]] (for support) and require the presence of [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) in serum media. A drug cocktail containing inhibitors to [[GSK3B]] and the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]], called 2i, has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying QL, Wray J, Nichols J, Batlle-Morera L, Doble B, Woodgett J, Cohen P, Smith A | title = The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7194 | pages = 519–23 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18497825 | pmc = 5328678 | doi = 10.1038/nature06968 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..519Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic [[fibroblasts]] and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2).&lt;ref&gt;

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors [[Oct-4]], [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], and [[Sox2]] form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.&lt;ref&gt;

By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try and catch complications of diseases, or to study cells reactions to potentially new drugs.  The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]] as the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an [[embryo]]. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an [[autograft]]), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109104735/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-date=2009-01-09 |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=Stem Cell FAQ |date=2004-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amniotic==
Multipotent stem cells are also found in [[amniotic fluid]]. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic. [[Amniotic stem cells]] are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.&lt;ref&gt;

Amniotic stem cells are a topic of active research.

Use of stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells.

==Induced pluripotent==
{{Main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three [[germ layers]]. As such, they are deemed [[cell potency|multipotent]].

However, [[reprogramming]] allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein [[transcription factors]], pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making human embryonic stem cells|publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10170972|date=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16466265|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title=Skin Cells Can Become Embryonic Stem Cells|author1=Brand, Madeleine |author2=Palca, Joe |author3=Cohen, Alex |date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec07/stemcells_11-20.html|title=Breakthrough Set to Radically Change Stem Cell Debate|publisher=[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]|date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem cells was conducted by [[Shinya Yamanaka]] and his colleagues at [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref name = "overview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimbrel EA, Lanza R | title = Pluripotent stem cells: the last 10 years | journal = Regenerative Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 831–847 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27908220 | doi = 10.2217/rme-2016-0117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the transcription factors [[Oct-4|Oct3/4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[Klf4]] to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "og Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells.&lt;ref name= "2007 Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, Narita M, Ichisaka T, Tomoda K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 861–72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18035408 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junying Yu]], [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], and their colleagues at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human [[foreskin]].&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "wisconsin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu J, Vodyanik MA, Smuga-Otto K, Antosiewicz-Bourget J, Frane JL, Tian S, Nie J, Jonsdottir GA, Ruotti V, Stewart R, Slukvin II, Thomson JA | title = Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1917–20 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18029452 | doi = 10.1126/science.1151526 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1917Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were able to replicate [[Yamanaka]]'s finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.

Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share many similar properties, such as [[pluripotency]] and differentiation potential, the expression of [[pluripotency]] genes, [[epigenetic]] patterns, [[embryoid body]] and [[teratoma]] formation, and viable [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]] formation,&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; but there are many differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more "closed" or methylated than that of ESCs.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; There are thus questions about the "completeness" of [[reprogramming]] and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing [[adult cell]]s to be pluripotent appears to be viable.

As a result of the success of these experiments, [[Ian Wilmut]], who helped create the first cloned animal [[Dolly the Sheep]], has announced that he will abandon [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as an avenue of research.&lt;ref&gt;"His inspiration comes from the research by Prof [[Shinya Yamanaka]] at [[Kyoto University]], which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement."{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|title=Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning|author=Highfield, Roger |date=2007-11-16|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are [[pluripotent]]. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if [[reprogramming]] to pluripotency was "complete").&lt;ref name = "overview" /&gt; Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="R&amp;D"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinton DA, Daley GQ | title = The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells in research and therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7381 | pages = 295–305 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258608 | pmc = 3652331 | doi = 10.1038/nature10761 | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..295R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen blood samples can be used as a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100703175036/http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre6604si-us-stemcells-frozen/ Frozen blood a source of stem cells, study finds]. newsdaily.com (2010-07-01)&lt;/ref&gt; Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection.&lt;ref name= "R&amp;D" /&gt; Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in medical treatment and research.

==Lineage==
{{Main|Stem cell line}}
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckmann J, Scheitza S, Wernet P, Fischer JC, Giebel B | title = Asymmetric cell division within the human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment: identification of asymmetrically segregating proteins | journal = Blood | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 5494–501 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17332245 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-11-055921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in ''Drosophila'' germarium have identified the signals [[decapentaplegic]] and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;

==Treatments==
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition.  [[Bone marrow transplant]] is a form of stem cell therapy that has been used for many years without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells. Updated: 16 December 2013  [http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/WhyPerformStemCellTransplant.html Why Perform a Stem Cell Transplant?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site.

=== Advantages ===
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Master |first=Zubin |last2=McLeod |first2=Marcus |last3=Mendez |first3=Ivar | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007 |title=Benefits, Risks and Ethical Considerations in Translation of Stem Cell Research to Clinical Applications in Parkinson's Disease |jstor=27719821 |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Stem cell treatments may require [[immunosuppression]] because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.

Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moore KL, Persaud TV, Torchia MG | title = Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Saunders, Elsevier | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super-LOTIS''' is the second incarnation of the [[Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System]], located at the [[Steward Observatory]] on [[Kitt Peak]]. It
is an automated [[telescope]] designed to slew very rapidly to the location of [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs), to enable the simultaneous measurement of optical counterparts. GRBs can occur anywhere in the sky, fade very quickly, and were initially poorly localized, so the original LOTIS needed very rapid slewing (less than 10 sec) and an extremely wide [[field of view]] (greater than 15 degrees). However, this wide field of view meant it could not see faint sources, and only the brightest GRB afterglows could be studied.

Later satellites such as [[HETE-2]], and  [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory#BATSE|BATSE]] detector of the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]], delivered much more accurate GRB coordinates in real-time. This enabled the construction of Super-LOTIS, based upon a [[Boller and Chivens]] 0.6 meter telescope, with a much smaller field of view (originally 51' by 51'), but much deeper imaging. After a few years of operation in this mode (2000 to 2003), the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] was launched in 2004 providing even smaller error boxes. The super-LOTIS optics were modified again, now with a 17' by 17' field of view at the secondary focus, and a simultaneous visible/NIR camera.

To achieve the needed response time, Super-LOTIS is fully automated and connected via Internet socket to the [[Gamma-ray Burst Coordinates Network]]. It is still in operation as of 2012.

Since GRB searches only occupy a small fraction of the possible observing time, Super-LOTIS is also used for [[supernova]] searches&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aas.org/archives/BAAS/v32n2/aas196/436.htm |title=Novae and Supernovae Searches with the Super-LOTIS Telescope |publisher=AAS }}&lt;/ref&gt; and general astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ucolick.org/superlotis.html |title=Observing with Super-LOTIS |publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable engineering''' is the process of designing or operating systems such that they use energy and resources [[sustainability|sustainably]], in other words, at a rate that does not compromise the natural environment, or the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

==As an aspect of engineering disciplines==

Every engineering discipline is engaged in sustainable design, employing numerous initiatives, especially [[life cycle analysis]] (LCA), [[pollution prevention]], design for the environment (DfE), design for disassembly (DfD), and  design for recycling (DfR).  These are replacing or at least changing pollution control paradigms. For example, concept of a "cap and trade" has been tested and works well for some pollutants. This is a system where companies are allowed to place a "bubble" over a whole manufacturing complex or trade pollution credits with other companies in their industry instead of a "stack-by-stack" and "pipe-by-pipe" approach, i.e. the so-called "command and control" approach. Such policy and regulatory innovations call for some improved technology based approaches as well as better quality-based approaches, such as leveling out the pollutant loadings and using less expensive technologies to remove the first large bulk of pollutants, followed by higher operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) technologies for the more difficult to treat stacks and pipes. But, the net effect can be a greater reduction of pollutant emissions and effluents than treating each stack or pipe as an independent entity. This is a foundation for most sustainable design approaches, i.e. conducting a life-cycle analysis, prioritizing the most important problems, and matching the technologies and operations to address them. The problems will vary by size (e.g. pollutant loading), difficulty in treating, and feasibility. The most intractable problems are often those that are small but very expensive and difficult to treat, i.e. less feasible. Of course, as with all paradigm shifts, expectations must be managed from both a technical and an operational perspective.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sustainable_Design.html?id=vrj5DIQ-7m8C|&lt;/ref&gt;  
Historically, sustainability considerations have been approached by engineers as constraints on their designs. For example, hazardous substances generated by a manufacturing process were dealt with as a waste stream that must be contained and treated. The hazardous waste production had to be constrained by selecting certain manufacturing types, increasing waste handling facilities, and if these did not entirely do the job, limiting rates of production. [[Green engineering]] recognizes that these processes are often inefficient economically and environmentally, calling for a comprehensive, systematic life cycle approach.  Green engineering attempts to achieve four goals:&lt;ref name="C. Brasier 2008"&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Waste reduction;
# Materials management;
# Pollution prevention; and,
# Product enhancement.

Green engineering encompasses numerous ways to improve processes and products to make them more efficient from an environmental and sustainable standpoint. Every one of these approaches depends on viewing possible impacts in space and time. Architects consider the sense of place. Engineers view the site map as a set of fluxes across the boundary. The design must consider short and long-term impacts. Those impacts beyond the near-term are the province of sustainable design. 
The effects may not manifest themselves for decades. In the mid-twentieth century, designers specified the use of what are now known to be hazardous building materials, such as asbestos flooring, pipe wrap and shingles, lead paint and pipes, and even structural and mechanical systems that may have increased the exposure to molds and radon. Those decisions have led to risks to people inhabiting these buildings.  It is easy in retrospect to criticize these decisions, but many were made for noble reasons, such as fire prevention and durability of materials. However, it does illustrate that seemingly small impacts when viewed through the prism of time can be amplified exponentially in their effects.
Sustainable design requires a complete assessment of a design in place and time. Some impacts may not occur until centuries in the future. For example, the extent to which we decide to use nuclear power to generate electricity is a sustainable design decision. The radioactive wastes may have half-lives of hundreds of thousands of years. That is, it will take all these years for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. Radioactive decay is the spontaneous transformation of one element into another. This occurs by irreversibly changing the number of protons in the nucleus. Thus, sustainable designs of such enterprises must consider highly uncertain futures. For example, even if we properly place warning signs about these hazardous wastes, we do not know if the English language will be understood.
All four goals of green engineering mentioned above are supported by a long-term, life cycle point of view. A life cycle analysis is a holistic approach to consider the entirety of a product, process or activity, encompassing raw materials, manufacturing, transportation, distribution, use, maintenance, recycling, and final disposal. In other words, assessing its life cycle should yield a complete picture of the product.
The first step in a life cycle assessment is to gather data on the flow of a material through an identifiable society. Once the quantities of various components of such a flow are known, the important functions and impacts of each step in the production, manufacture, use, and recovery/disposal are estimated. Thus, in sustainable design, engineers must optimize for variables that give the best performance in temporal frames.&lt;ref name="C. Brasier 2008"/&gt;

==Accomplishments from 1992 to 2002==
*The World Engineering Partnership for [[Sustainable development|Sustainable Development]] (WEPSD) was formed and they are responsible for the following areas: redesign engineering responsibilities and ethic to sustainable development, analyze and develop a long term plan, find solution by exchanging information with partners and using new technologies, and solve the critical global environment problems, such as [[fresh water]] and climate change
*CASI Global was formed mainly as a platform for corporates and governments to share best practices; with a mission to promote the cause and knowledge of csr &amp; sustainability. Thousands of corporates and colleges across the world are now a part of CASI Global with a view to support this mission. CASI also offers Global Fellow programs on finance / operations / manufacturing / supply chain / etc. with a dual specialization in Sustainability. The idea is every professional has inculcate sustainability within their core function &amp; industry. http://www.casiglobal.us/ 
*Developed environmental policies, codes of ethics, and sustainable development guidelines
*[[Earth Charter]] was restarted as a [[civil society]] initiative
*The World Bank, [[United Nations Environment Programme|United Nations Environmental Program]], and the [[Global Environment Facility]] joined programs for sustainable development
*Launched programs for engineering students and practicing engineers on how to apply sustainable development concepts in their work
*Developed new approaches in industrial processes

== Sustainable housing ==
In 2013, the average annual electricity consumption for a U.S. residential utility customer was 10,908 kilowatt hours (kWh), an average of 909 kWh per month. Louisiana had the highest annual consumption at 15,270 kWh, and Hawaii had the lowest at 6,176 kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much electricity does an American home use? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=97&amp;t=3|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residential sector itself uses 18%&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How much energy is consumed in the world by each sector? - FAQ - U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)|url = http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=447&amp;t=1|website = www.eia.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the total energy generated and therefore, incorporating sustainable construction practices there can be significant reduction in this number. Basic Sustainable construction practices include : 
# '''Sustainable Site and Location:''' One important element of green that is often overlooked happens to simply be where we choose to build. Avoiding inappropriate sites such as farmland and locating the site near existing infrastructure, like roads, sewers, stormwater systems and transit, allows builders to lessen negative impact on a home's surroundings.
# '''Water Conservation:''' Conserving water can be economically done by installing low-flow fixtures that often cost the same as less efficient models. Water can be saved in landscaping applications by simply choosing the proper plants.
# '''Materials:''' Green materials include many different options. Most often, people assume that "green" means recycled materials. Although that recycled materials represent one option, green materials also include reused materials, renewable materials like bamboo and cork, or materials local to your region. Remember, a green material does not have to cost more or be of lesser or higher quality. Most green products are comparable to their non-green counterparts.
# '''Energy Conservation:''' Probably the most important part of building green is energy conservation. By implementing passive design, structural insulated panels (SIPs), efficient lighting, and renewable energy like [[solar energy]] and [[geothermal energy]], a home can benefit from reduced energy consumption or qualify as a net-zero energy home.
# '''Indoor Environmental Quality:''' The quality of the indoor environment plays a pivotal role in a person's health. In many cases, a much healthier environment can be created through avoiding hazardous materials found in paint, carpet, and other finishes. It is also important to have proper ventilation and ample day lighting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Green Homes vs Traditional Homes - Buildipedia|url = http://buildipedia.com/at-home/design-remodeling/green-homes-vs-traditional-homes|website = buildipedia.com|accessdate = 2015-09-02|first = Michael Tolson MBA, LEED|last = AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Savings===
# '''Water Conservation:''' A newly constructed home can implement products with the WaterSense label at no additional costs and achieve a water savings of 20% when including the water heater savings and the water itself.
# '''Energy Conservation:''' Energy conservation is definitely the most intensive when it comes to cost premiums for implementation. However, it also has the largest potential for savings. Minimum savings can be achieved at no additional cost by pursuing passive design strategies. The next step up from passive design in the level of green (and ultimately the level of savings) would be implementing advanced building envelopematerials, like structural insulated panels (SIPs). SIPs can be installed for approximately $2 per linear foot of exterior wall. That equals a total premium of less than $500 for a typical one-story home, which will bring an energy savings of 50%. According to the DOE, the average annual energy expense for a single family home is $2,200. So SIPs can save up to $1,100 per year. To reach the savings associated with a net-zero energy home, renewable energy would have to be implemented on top of the other features. A geothermal energy system could achieve this goal with a cost premium of approximately $7 per square foot, while a photovoltaic system (solar) would require up to a $25,000 total premium.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">In [[biological nomenclature]], a '''syntype''' is any one of two or more [[Type (biology)|biological types]] that is listed in a [[species description|description]] of a [[taxon]] where no [[holotype]] was designated. Precise definitions of this and related terms for types have been established as part of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]].

==In zoology==
In [[zoology|zoological]] nomenclature, a syntype is defined as "Each specimen of a type series (q.v.) from which neither a [[holotype]] nor a [[lectotype]] has been designated [Arts. 72.1.2, 73.2, 74]. The syntypes collectively constitute the name-bearing type." (Glossary of the zoological Code &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=ICZN|year=1999 |title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement (Art. 72.3), but modern attempts to publish species or [[subspecies]] descriptions based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered [[name-bearing type]]s.&lt;ref name="Geiger"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Charles F. Sturm |editor2=Timothy A. Pearce |editor3=Ángel Valdés |year=2006 |title=The Mollusks: a Guide to Their Study, Collection, and Preservation |publisher=[[Universal-Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-58112-930-4 |chapter=Taxonomy and taxonomic writing: a primer |author=Daniel L. Geiger |pages=147–159 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-NbmHx93s8gC&amp;pg=PA154}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[lectotype]] may be designated from among the syntypes, reducing the other specimens to the status of ''paralectotype''.&lt;ref name="Geiger"/&gt; They are no longer name-bearing types, though if the lectotype is lost or destroyed, it is generally preferable to use a paralectotype as a replacement ([[neotype]]). Where specimens in a syntype series are found to belong to different taxa, this may cause nomenclatural instability, since the [[nominal species]] can be interpreted in different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Carden Wallace|Carden C. Wallace]] |year=1999 |title=Staghorn Corals of the World: a Revision of the Coral Genus ''Acropora'' (Scleractinia; Astrocoeniina; Acroporidae) Worldwide, with Emphasis on Morphology, Phylogeny and Biogeography |publisher=[[CSIRO Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-643-06391-4 |chapter=Summary of type material |pages=7–19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y5uVU4MfIKAC&amp;pg=PA1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In botany==
In [[botany|botanical]] nomenclature, a syntype can be made in the description of a species or an [[Infraspecific name (botany)|infraspecific]] taxon. It is defined as "any specimen cited in the protologue when there is no holotype, or any one of two or more specimens simultaneously designated as types." (Art. 9.5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.
