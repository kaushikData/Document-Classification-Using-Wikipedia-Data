During the growth of the ancient [[civilization]]s, '''ancient technology''' was the result from advances in [[engineering]] in [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. These advances in the [[history of technology]] stimulated societies to adopt new ways of living and governance.

This article includes the advances in technology and the development of several engineering arts in [[historic times]] before the [[Middle Ages]], which began after the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] in [[Anno Domini|AD]] 476,&lt;ref&gt;Clare, I.

{{Ancient technology}}

A significant number of [[Inventions in the Islamic world|inventions were developed in the Islamic world]]; a geopolitical region that has at times extended from [[al-Andalus]] and Africa in the west to the Indian subcontinent and [[Malay Archipelago]] in the east. Many of these inventions had direct implications for [[Fiqh]] related issues.

== Ancient civilizations ==

=== Mesopotamia ===

They were one of the first [[Bronze age]] people in the world. Early on they used [[copper]], [[bronze]] and [[gold]], and later they used [[iron]]. Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals. Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for [[armor]] as well as for different weapons such as [[sword]]s, [[dagger]]s, [[spear]]s, and [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s.

According to the assyriologist [[Stephanie Dalley]], the earliest [[pump]] was the [[Archimedes' screw]], first used by [[Sennacherib]], King of [[Assyria]], for the [[Domestic water system|water systems]] at the [[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]] and [[Nineveh]] in the 7th century BCE. This attribution, however, is refuted by the historian of ancient water-lifting devices Olseon in the same paper, who still credits, as well as most other scholars, [[Archimedes]] with the invention.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley and [[John Peter Oleson]] (January 2003). "Sennacherib, Archimedes, and the Water Screw: The Context of Invention in the Ancient World", ''Technology and Culture'' '''44''' (1).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oleson"&gt;{{Cite book

Perhaps the most important advance made by the [[Mesopotamia]]ns was the [[Cuneiform|invention of writing]] by the [[Sumer]]ians. With the invention of writing came the first recorded laws called the [[Code of Hammurabi]] as well as the first major piece of literature called the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].

Although archaeologists don't know for sure who invented the wheel, the oldest wheel discovered was found in Mesopotamia. It is likely the Sumer first used the wheel in making pottery in 3500BC and used it for their chariots in around 3200 BC.

The Mesopotamians used a [[sexagesimal]] number system with the base 60 (like we use base 10). They divided time up by 60s including a 60-second minute and a 60-minute hour, which we still use today. They also divided up the circle into 360 degrees. They had a wide knowledge of mathematics including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, quadratic and cubic equations, and fractions. This was important in keeping track of records as well as in some of their large building projects. The Mesopotamians had formulas for figuring out the circumference and area for different geometric shapes like rectangles, circles, and triangles. Some evidence suggests that they even knew the Pythagorean Theorem long before Pythagoras wrote it down. They may have even discovered the number for pi in figuring the circumference of a circle.

[[Babylonian astronomy]] was able to follow the movements of the stars, planets, and the Moon. Application of advanced math predicted the movements of several planets.  By studying the phases of the Moon, the Mesopotamians created the first [[calendar]]. It had 12 lunar months and was the predecessor for both the [[Jewish calendar|Jewish]] and [[Greek calendar]]s.

[[Babylonian medicine]] used logic and recorded medical history to be able to diagnose and treat illnesses with various creams and pills. Mesopotamians had two kinds of medical practices, magical and physical. Unlike today they would use both on the same patient. They didn’t see it as one as good and one as bad.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Chadwick, ''First Civilization: Ancient Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt (2)'' (London: Equinox Publishing Ltd, 2005), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mesopotamians made many technological discoveries. They were the first to use the potter's wheel to make better pottery, they used irrigation to get water to their crops, they used bronze metal (and later iron metal) to make strong tools and weapons, and used looms to weave cloth from wool.

For later medieval technologies developed in the Mesopotamian region, now known as [[Iraq]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

===Egypt===
[[File:TurinPapyrus1.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Left half of the Turin papyrus map, courtesy J. Harrell]]
The [[Egyptians]] invented and used many simple machines, such as the [[inclined plane|ramp]] to aid construction processes. They were among the first to extract [[gold]] by large-scale mining using [[fire-setting]], and the first recognisable [[map]], the [[Turin papyrus]] shows the plan of one such mine in [[Nubia]].

Egyptian [[paper]], made from [[papyrus]], and [[pottery]] were mass-produced and exported throughout the Mediterranean basin. The [[wheel]], however, did not arrive until foreign invaders introduced the [[chariot]]. They developed Mediterranean [[maritime history|maritime]] technology including ships and lighthouses. Early construction techniques utilized by the Ancient Egyptians made use of bricks composed mainly of clay, sand, silt, and other minerals. These constructs would have been vital in flood control and irrigation, especially along the Nile delta.&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy Trzciñski , Malgorzata Zaremba , Sawomir Rzepka , Fabian Welc , and Tomasz Szczepañski. “Preliminary Report on Engineering Properties and Environmental Resistance of Ancient Mud Bricks from Tell El-retaba Archaeological Site in the Nile Delta,” ''Studia Quarternaria'' 33, no. 1 (2016): 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

For later technologies in [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Ægyptus|Roman Egypt]], and [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab Egypt]], see [[Ancient Greek technology]], [[Roman technology]] and [[Inventions in medieval Islam]] respectively.

===Africa===
{{main|Science and technology in Africa}}
Technology in Africa has a history stretching to the beginning of the human species, stretching back to the first evidence of [[Stone Age|tool use]] by hominid ancestors in the [[Hominid evolution|areas of Africa]] where humans are believed to have evolved. Africa saw the advent of some of the earliest [[ironworking]] technology in the [[Aïr Mountains]] region of what is today [[Niger]] and the erection of some of the world's oldest monuments, pyramids and towers in [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], and [[History of North Africa|North Africa]]. In Nubia and ancient Kush, glazed quartzite and building in brick was developed to a greater extent than in Egypt. Parts of the East African [[Swahili Coast]] saw the creation of the world's oldest [[carbon steel]] creation with high-temperature [[blast furnace]]s created by the [[Haya people]] of Tanzania.

=== Indian subcontinent ===
{{main|History of Indian Science and Technology|List of Indian inventions}}
{{See also|List of inventions and discoveries of the Indus Valley Civilization}}

The [[history of Science and Technology in India|history of science and technology in India]] dates back to the earliest civilizations of the world. The Indus Valley civilization yields evidence of [[mathematics]], [[hydrography]], [[metrology]], and sewage collection and disposal being practiced by its inhabitants.

The [[Indus Valley Civilization]], situated in a resource-rich area, is notable for its early application of city planning and sanitation technologies. Cities in the Indus Valley offer some of the first examples of closed gutters, public baths, and communal granaries. The [[Takshashila]] University was an important seat of learning in the ancient world. It was the center of education for scholars from all over Asia. Many [[Greeks|Greek]], Persian and [[China|Chinese]] students studied here under great scholars including [[Kautilya]], Panini, [[Jivaka]], and Vishnu Sharma.
[[File:Mohenjo-daro.jpg|thumb|200px|Excavated ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]], Pakistan.]]

The ancient system of medicine in India, [[Ayurveda]] was a significant milestone in Indian history. It mainly uses herbs as medicines. Its origins can be traced back to origin of [[Atharvaveda]]. The [[Sushruta Samhita]] (400 BC) by Sushruta has details about performing cataract surgery, plastic surgery, etc.

Ancient India was also at the forefront of seafaring technology - a panel found at [[Mohenjo-daro]], depicts a sailing craft. Ship construction is vividly described in the Yukti Kalpa Taru, an ancient Indian text on Shipbuilding. (The Yukti Kalpa Taru had been translated and published by Prof. Aufrecht in his 'Catalogue of Sanskrit [[Manuscripts]]').

Indian construction and architecture, called '[[Vaastu Shastra]]', suggests a thorough understanding or materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation. Ancient Indian culture was also pioneering in its use of vegetable dyes, cultivating plants including [[indigo]] and [[cinnabar]]. Many of the dyes were used in art and sculpture. The use of [[perfume]]s demonstrates some knowledge of [[chemistry]], particularly [[distillation]] and purification processes.

=== China ===
{{main|History of science and technology in China|List of Chinese inventions}}
[[File:ArmillarySphere1.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Chinese [[armillary sphere]]]]

The [[history of science and technology in China]] shows significant advances in science, technology, mathematics, and astronomy. The first recorded observations of comets, solar eclipses, and supernovae were made in China.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture and herbal medicine were also practiced. The [[Four Great Inventions]] of China: the [[compass]], [[gunpowder]], papermaking, and printing were among the most important technological advances, only known in Europe by the end of the Middle Ages.

According to the Scottish researcher [[Joseph Needham]], the Chinese made many first-known discoveries and developments. Major technological contributions from China include early [[Seismology|seismological]] detectors, [[matches]], [[paper]], the double-action [[piston pump]], [[cast iron]], the iron [[plough]], the multi-tube [[seed drill]], the [[suspension bridge]], [[natural gas]] as fuel, the [[magnetic compass]], the [[raised-relief map]], the [[propeller]], the [[crossbow]], the [[south-pointing chariot]], and [[gunpowder]]. Other Chinese discoveries and inventions from the Medieval period, according to Joseph Needham's research, include: [[block printing]] and [[movable type]], phosphorescent paint, and the [[spinning wheel]].

The solid-fuel [[rocket]] was invented in China about 1150 AD, nearly 200 years after the invention of [[black powder]] (which acted as the rocket's fuel). At the same time that the [[age of exploration]] was occurring in the West, the Chinese emperors of the [[Ming Dynasty]] also sent ships, [[Treasure voyages|some reaching Africa]]. But the enterprises were not further funded, halting further exploration and development. When [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s ships reached [[Brunei]] in 1521, they found a wealthy city that had been fortified by Chinese engineers, and protected by a [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] noted that much of the technology of Brunei was equal to Western technology of the time. Also, there were more cannons in Brunei than on Magellan's ships, and the Chinese merchants to the Brunei court had sold them [[spectacles]] and [[porcelain]], which were rarities in Europe.

===Persia===
{{main|Science and technology in Iran}}

The [[Qanat]], a water management system used for irrigation, originated in [[Iran]] before the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] of Persia&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persian Empire"; link to a specific iteration of this topic --&gt;. The oldest and largest known qanat is in the Iranian city of [[Gonabad]] which, after 2,700&amp;nbsp;years, still provides drinking and agricultural water to nearly 40,000&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ward English  | first = Paul  | title = The Origin and Spread of Qanats in the Old World | journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society | volume =  112| issue =  3 | pages =170–181 | publisher = [[JSTOR]]
  | date = June 21, 1968 | jstor=986162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century AD, Persians in [[Afghanistan]] developed the first practical [[windmill]]s. For later medieval technologies developed in [[Islamization of Iran|Islamic Persia]], see [[Inventions in medieval Islam]].

=== Greek and Hellenistic ===
[[File:Heron's Windwheel.jpg|thumb|200px|Hero's wind-powered [[Organ (music)|organ]] (reconstruction)]]
{{main|Ancient Greek technology}}

[[Ancient Greek technology]] developed at an unprecedented speed during the 5th century BC, continuing up to and including the Roman period, and beyond. Some inventions that are credited to the ancient Greeks are the following: the gear, screw, bronze casting techniques, [[water clock]], [[water organ]](hydraulis), [[torsion siege engine]], and the use of steam to operate some experimental machines and toys. Many of these inventions occurred late in the Greek period, often inspired by the need to improve weapons and tactics in war.

[[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] engineers invented many technologies and improved upon pre-existing technologies, particularly during the [[Hellenistic period]]. [[Heron of Alexandria]] invented a basic [[steam engine]] and demonstrated knowledge of mechanic and pneumatic systems. [[Archimedes]] invented several machines. The Greeks were unique in pre-industrial times in their ability to combine scientific research with the development of new technologies. One example is the [[Archimedean screw]]; this technology was first conceptualized in mathematics, then built. Other technologies invented by Greek scientists include the [[ballista]]e, the [[piston pump]], and primitive [[analog computers]] like the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. Greek architects were responsible for the first true [[dome]]s, and were the first to explore the [[Golden ratio]] and its relationship with geometry and architecture.

Apart from [[Hero of Alexandria]]'s steam [[aeolipile]], Hellenistic technicians were the first to invent watermills and windwheels, making them global pioneers in three of the four known means of non-human propulsion prior to the Industrial Revolution (the fourth being sails). However, only water power was used extensively in antiquity.

Other Greek inventions include torsion catapults, pneumatic catapults, crossbows, cranes, rutways, organs, the keyboard mechanism, gears, differential gears, screws, refined parchment, showers, dry docks, diving bells, odometer and astrolabes. In architecture, Greek engineers constructed monumental lighthouses such as the [[Lighthouse of Alexandria|Pharos]] and devised the first central heating systems. The [[Tunnel of Eupalinos]] is the earliest tunnel in history which has been excavated with a scientific approach from both ends.

Automata like vending machines, automatic doors and many other ingenious devices were first built by Hellenistic engineers as [[Ctesibius]], [[Philo of Byzantium]] and Heron. Greek technological treatises were scrupuously studied and copied by later Byzantine, Arabic and Latin European scholars and provided much of the foundation for further technological advances in these civilizations.

=== Roman ===
{{main|Roman technology}}
[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|right|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]] in France, a Roman aqueduct]]
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]

[[Roman technology]] supported Roman civilization and made the expansion of Roman commerce and Roman military possible over nearly a thousand years. The Roman Empire had an advanced set of technology for their time. Some of the Roman technology in Europe may have been lost during the turbulent eras of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Roman technological feats in many different areas like: civil engineering, construction materials, transport technology, and some inventions such as the [[mechanical reaper]] went unmatched until the 19th century.
Romans developed an intensive and sophisticated agriculture, expanded upon existing iron working technology, created [[Roman law|laws]] providing for individual ownership, advanced stonemasonry technology, advanced [[Roman road|road-building]] (exceeded only in the 19th century), military engineering, civil engineering, spinning and weaving and several different machines like the [[reaper|Gallic reaper]] that helped to increase productivity in many sectors of the Roman economy. They also developed water power through building aqueducts on a grand scale, using water not just for drinking supplies but also for [[irrigation]], powering [[water mill]]s and in mining. They used drainage wheels extensively in deep underground mines, one device being the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. They were the first to apply [[hydraulic mining]] methods for prospecting for metal ores, and for extracting those ores from the ground when found using a method known as [[hushing]].

Roman engineers build [[monumental arches]], [[List of Roman amphitheatres|amphitheatres]], [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]], [[Thermae|public baths]], [[Roman bridge|true arch bridges]], [[harbour]]s, [[List of Roman dams|dam]]s, vaults and [[List of Roman domes|domes]] on a very large scale across their Empire. Notable Roman inventions include the [[Codex|book (Codex)]], [[glass blowing]] and [[concrete]]. Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the [[concrete]] which the Romans formulated was especially durable. Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day. Roman society had also carried over the design of a door lock with tumblers and springs from Greece. Like many other aspects of innovation and culture that were carried on from Greece to Rome, the lines between where each one originated from have become skewed over time. These mechanisms were highly sophisticated and intricate for the era.&lt;ref&gt;Naif A. Haddad, "Critical Review, Assessment and Investigation of Ancient Technology Evolution of Door Locking Mechanisms in S.E. Mediterranean," ''Mediterranean Archaeology &amp; Archaeometry'' 16, no. 1: 43-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman civilization was highly urbanized by pre-modern standards. Many cities of the [[Roman Empire]] had over 100,000 inhabitants with the capital Rome being the largest metropolis of antiquity. Features of Roman urban life included multistory apartment buildings called [[Insula (building)|insulae]], street paving, public flush toilets, glass windows and [[Hypocaust|floor and wall heating]]. The Romans understood [[hydraulics]] and constructed [[fountain]]s and waterworks, particularly [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s, which were the hallmark of their civilization. They exploited water power by building [[water mill]]s, sometimes in series, such as the sequence found at [[Barbegal]] in southern France and suspected on the [[Janiculum]] in Rome. Some [[Thermae|Roman baths]] have lasted to this day. The Romans developed many technologies which were apparently lost in the [[Middle Ages]], and were only fully reinvented in the 19th and 20th centuries. They also left texts describing their achievements, especially [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Frontinus]] and [[Vitruvius]].

Other less known Roman innovations include [[cement]], boat mills, arch [[dam]]s and possibly [[tide mill]]s.

== Mesoamerica &amp; Andean Region ==
Lacking suitable beasts of burden and inhabiting domains often too mountainous or boggy for wheeled transport, the ancient civilizations of the Americas did not develop wheeled transport or the mechanics associated with animal power. Nevertheless, they produced advanced engineering including above ground and underground acqeducts, quake-proof masonry, artificial lakes, dykes, 'fountains,' pressurized water,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |title=Maya plumbing, first pressurized water feature found in New World |author=A’ndrea Messer |date=February 8, 2011 |website=Penn State News |access-date=August 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208225152/http://live.psu.edu/story/46532 |archive-date=2013-02-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; road ways and complex terracing.

'''Animal nutrition''' focuses on the dietary needs of [[animals]], primarily those in [[agriculture]] and food production, but also in zoos, aquariums, and wildlife management.

There are seven major classes of [[nutrient]]s: [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fibre]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]].

==Constituents of diet==
Macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built) and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can be used to generate energy internally,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7167-4684-0 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance. Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class dietary material, fiber (i.e., non-digestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear.

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]]. [[Essential amino acids]] cannot be made by the animal. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs normally only during prolonged starvation.

Other dietary substances found in plant foods ([[phytochemicals]], [[polyphenol]]s) are not identified as essential nutrients but appear to impact health in both positive and negative ways. Most foods contain a mix of some or all of the nutrient classes, together with other substances. Some nutrients can be stored internally (e.g., the fat soluble vitamins), while others are required more or less continuously. Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients or, in extreme cases, too much of a required nutrient. For example, both salt provides sodium and chloride, both essential nutrients, but will cause illness or even death in too large amounts.

Dietary fibre is a [[carbohydrate]] (polysaccharide or oligosaccharide) that is incompletely absorbed in some animals. 

===Protein===
Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair). They also form the enzymes which control chemical reactions throughout the body. Each molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which are characterized by the inclusion of nitrogen and sometimes sulfur. The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance). As there is no protein or amino acid storage provision, amino acids must be present in the diet. Excess amino acids are discarded, typically in the urine. For all animals, some amino acids are ''[[essential amino acid|essential]]'' (an animal cannot produce them internally) and some are ''[[non-essential amino acid|non-essential]]'' (the animal can produce them from other nitrogen-containing compounds). A diet that contains adequate amounts of amino acids (especially those that are essential) is particularly important in some situations: during early development and maturation, pregnancy, lactation, or injury (a burn, for instance). 

A few amino acids from protein can be converted into glucose and used for fuel through a process called [[gluconeogenesis]]; this is done in quantity only during starvation.

===Minerals===
Dietary [[Mineral (nutrient)|mineral]]s are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet.

Many elements are essential in relative quantity; they are usually  called "bulk minerals". Some are structural, but many play a role as [[electrolyte]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nelson, D. L. |author2=Cox, M. M. | title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry | edition=3rd | publisher=Worth Publishing | location=New York | year=2000 |  isbn=1-57259-153-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* [[Calcium]], a common electrolyte, but also needed structurally structural (for muscle and digestive system health, bones, some forms neutralizes acidity, may help clear toxins, and provide signaling ions for nerve and membrane functions)
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity)
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=0-444-89307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health)
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte
* [[Sulfur]] for three amino acids and therefore many proteins (skin, hair, nails, liver, and pancreas)

Many elements are required in trace amounts, usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=0-935702-73-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vitamins===
[[Vitamin]] deficiencies may result in disease conditions. Excess of some vitamins is also dangerous to health (notably [[vitamin A]]), and animal nutrition researchers have managed to establish safe levels for some common companion animals.&lt;ref&gt;Morris PJ, Salt C, Raila J, Brenten T, Kohn B, Schweigert FJ, Zentek J. Safety evaluation of vitamin A in growing dogs. British Journal of Nutrition. 2012; 108(10):1800-1809.&lt;/ref&gt; Deficiency or excess of minerals can also have serious health consequences.

==Ash==
Though not really a nutrient as such, an entry for ''ash'' is sometimes found on nutrition labels, especially for [[pet food]].  This entry measures the weight of inorganic material left over after the food is burned for two hours at 600&amp;nbsp;°C.  Thus, it does not include water, fibre, and nutrients that provide calories, but it does include some nutrients, such as minerals &lt;ref&gt;Purina; [http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F The Facts About Dietary Ash] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721050811/http://www.purinaone.com/CoolTools/Nutrition101.aspx?ArticleId=CE5F9A76-C480-496F-A0B1-9BDAA4675A4F |date=July 21, 2011 }}; last checked 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Too much ash may contribute to [[feline urological syndrome]] in [[domestic cat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;R. Glenn Brown; [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1680954 Low ash cat foods: The role of magnesium in feline nutrition]; Canadian Veterinary Journal 1989 January 30(1): 73–79; last checked 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intestinal bacterial flora==
Animal [[intestine]]s contain a large population of [[gut flora]] which are essential to [[digestion]], and are also affected by the food eaten.

[[File:Estuary-mouth.jpg|thumb|307px|right|An [[estuary]] mouth and coastal waters, part of an aquatic ecosystem]]

An '''aquatic ecosystem''' is an [[ecosystem]]  in a [[body of water]]. [[Biocoenosis|Communities]] of [[biota (ecology)|organisms]] that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{TOC left}}
{{clear}}

==Types==
===Marine===
{{main|Marine ecosystem}}
Marine ecosystems, the largest of all ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology: The Marine Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/marine.php?|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover approximately 71% of the [[Earth's surface]] and contain approximately 97% of the planet's water. They generate 32% of the world's net [[primary production]].&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are distinguished from freshwater ecosystems by the presence of dissolved [[chemical compound|compounds]], especially [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, in the water. Approximately 85% of the dissolved materials in [[seawater]] are [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Seawater has an average salinity of 35 [[parts-per notation|parts per thousand]] of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web| last = United States Environmental Protection Agency| authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency| title = Marine Ecosystems| date = 2 March 2006| url = http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/aquatic/marine.html| accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|300px|right|A classification of marine habitats.]]
Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The [[ocean]]ic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live.  The [[benthic]] zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The [[intertidal zone|intertidal]] zone is the area between high and low tides; in this figure it is termed the littoral zone. Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include [[estuary|estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[coral reef]]s, [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]] swamps.  In the deep water, [[hydrothermal vent]]s may occur where [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[sulfur]] [[bacteria]] form the base of the food web.

[[class (biology)|Classes]] of organisms found in marine ecosystems include [[brown algae]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[coral]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[shark]]s. Fishes caught in marine ecosystems are the biggest source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Environmental problems concerning marine ecosystems include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[Fisheries and climate change|climate change]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Freshwater===

{{main|Freshwater ecosystem}}

[[File:Panorama presa las niñas mogan gran canaria.jpg|thumb|640px|left|Freshwater ecosystem.]]{{clear}}
Freshwater ecosystems cover 0.78% of the Earth's surface and inhabit 0.009% of its total water. They generate nearly 3% of its net primary production.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book

  | title = Nature's Services
  | publisher = [[Island Press]]

  | isbn = 1-55963-476-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems:
*[[Lentic system ecology|Lentic]]: slow moving water, including [[pond|pool]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s.
*[[Lotic System Ecology|Lotic]]: faster moving water, for example [[stream]]s and [[river]]s.
*[[Wetland]]s: areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time.&lt;ref name=Vaccari&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-471-74178-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lentic ===
{{see also|Lake ecosystem}}

[[File:Primary zones of a lake.png|thumb|400px|right|The three primary zones of a lake.]]
Lake ecosystems can be divided into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure).  The first, the [[littoral zone]], is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur.  The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone.  In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them.  In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones.  Some systems use other names.  The off shore areas may be called the [[pelagic zone]], the [[photic zone]] may be called the [[limnetic zone]] and the [[aphotic zone]] may be called the [[profundal zone]]. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a [[riparian zone]] which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.

[[Wetland]]s can be part of the lentic system, as they form naturally along most lake shores, the width of the wetland and littoral zone being dependent upon the slope of the shoreline and the amount of natural change in water levels, within and among years. Often dead trees accumulate in this zone, either from windfalls on the shore or logs transported to the site during floods.  This woody debris provides important habitat for fish and nesting birds, as well as protecting shorelines from erosion.

Two important subclasses of lakes are [[pond]]s, which typically are small lakes that intergrade with wetlands, and water [[reservoir]]s. Over long periods of time, lakes, or bays within them, may gradually become enriched by nutrients and slowly fill in with organic sediments, a process called succession. When humans use the watershed, the volumes of sediment entering the lake can accelerate this process. The addition of sediments and nutrients to a lake is known as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

====Ponds====

Ponds are small bodies of freshwater with shallow and still water, [[marsh]], and [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p. p.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. [[Food web]]s are based both on free-floating [[algae]] and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators.  Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as [[vernal pools]]. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;

===Lotic ===
{{see also|River ecosystem}}

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland and lowland]] rivers.  The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] derive the majority of their food base from algae. [[Fish migration|Anadromous fish]] are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed.  The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.&lt;ref name= Keddy/&gt;

===Wetlands ===
Wetlands are dominated by [[vascular plant]]s that have adapted to saturated soil.&lt;ref name=Keddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Wetland Ecology. Principles and Conservation.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main types of wetlands: swamp, marsh, fen and bog (both fens and bogs are types of [[mire]]). Wetlands are the most productive natural ecosystems in the world because of the proximity of water and soil. Hence they support large numbers of plant and animal species. Due to their productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with [[ditch|dykes]] and [[drainage|drains]] and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Their closeness to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;  The Louisiana coast around New Orleans is a well-known example;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.  Environmental Reviews 15: 1- 35.&lt;/ref&gt; the Danube Delta in Europe is another.&lt;ref&gt;Gastescu, P. (1993). The Danube Delta: geographical characteristics and ecological recovery. Earth and Environmental Science, 29, 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Aquatic ecosystems perform many important environmental functions. For example, they [[biogeochemical cycle|recycle nutrients]], purify water, attenuate floods, recharge ground water and provide habitats for wildlife.&lt;ref name=Loeb&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Loeb
  | first = Stanford L.
  | title = Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Systems
  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]
  | date = 24 January 1994
  | isbn = 0-87371-910-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic ecosystems are also used for human recreation, and are very important to the [[tourism]] industry, especially in coastal regions.&lt;ref name=Daily/&gt;

The health of an aquatic ecosystem is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem can be a result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen consuming materials, and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"&gt;Vallentyne, J. R. (1974). The Algal Bowl: Lakes and Man, Miscellaneous Special Publication No. 22. Ottawa, ON: Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Marine Service.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1983). The Norfolk Broadland: experiments in the restoration of a complex wetland. Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 58, 521–561.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A., Campbell, D., McFalls T., Shaffer, G., Moreau, R., Dranguet, C., and Heleniak, R. (2007). The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future. Environmental Reviews, 15, 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic characteristics==
An ecosystem is composed of [[Biotic component|biotic]] communities that are structured by biological interactions and [[abiotic]] environmental factors. Some of the important abiotic environmental factors of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments.  There may be complicated feedback loops.  For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.

The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J. B.

Nutrient levels are important in controlling the abundance of many species of algae.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1982). The nitrogen and phosphorus dependence of algal biomass in lakes: an empirical and theoretical analysis. Limnology and Oceanography, 27, 1101–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can in effect determine which species of algae come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1983). Low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios favor dominance by bluegreen algae in lake phytoplankton. Science, 221, 669–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae are a very important source of food for aquatic life, but at the same time, if they become over-abundant, they can cause declines in fish when they decay.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"/&gt; Similar over-abundance of algae in coastal environments such as the Gulf of Mexico produces, upon decay, a hypoxic region of water known as a [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. E. and Rabelais, N. N. (2003). Linking landscape and water quality in the Mississippi River Basin for 200 years. BioScience, 53, 563–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salinity of the water body is also a determining factor in the kinds of species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The degree of salinity in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of [[wetland]] (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species.  Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.&lt;ref name = Keddy/&gt;

Freshwater used for [[irrigation]] purposes often absorbs levels of salt that are harmful to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt;

==Biotic characteristics==
The biotic characteristics are mainly determined by the organisms that occur.  For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there.  For example, many wetland plants must produce [[aerenchyma]] to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic characteristics are more subtle and difficult to measure, such as the relative importance of competition, mutualism or predation.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, B. R., Grosholz, E. D., and Bertness, M. D. (eds.) (2009). Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotrophic organisms===
[[Autotroph]]ic organisms are producers that generate organic compounds from inorganic material. Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; The more shallow the water, the greater the biomass contribution from rooted and floating vascular plants. These two sources combine to produce the extraordinary production of estuaries and wetlands, as this autotrophic biomass is converted into fish, birds, amphibians and other aquatic species.

Chemosynthetic bacteria are found in benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water that comes from [[volcanic vent]]s. Great concentrations of animals that feed on these bacteria are found around volcanic vents. For example, there are [[giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in length and clams (''[[Calyptogena magnifica]]'') 30&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book| last = Chapman| first = J.L.|author2=Reiss, M.J.| title = Ecology| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| date = 10 December 1998| isbn = 0-521-58802-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterotrophic organisms===
[[Heterotrophic]] organisms consume autotrophic organisms and use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials to create their own [[biomass]].&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; [[Euryhaline]] organisms are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while [[stenohaline]] or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;

'''Architectural theory''' is the act of thinking, discussing, and writing about [[architecture]]. Architectural theory is taught in most architecture schools and is practiced by the world's leading [[architect]]s. Some forms that architecture theory takes are the [[lecture]] or dialogue, the treatise or book, and the paper project or [[architectural design competition|competition entry]]. Architectural theory is often didactic, and theorists tend to stay close to or work from within schools. It has existed in some form since [[ancient history|antiquity]], and as publishing became more common, architectural theory gained an increased richness. Books, magazines, and journals published an unprecedented number of works by architects and critics in the 20th century. As a result, styles and movements formed and dissolved much more quickly than the relatively enduring modes in earlier history. It is to be expected that the use of the internet will further the discourse on architecture in the 21st century.

==History==

===Antiquity===
[[File:De architectura.jpg|thumb|left|200px|1521 Cesare Cesariano Italian translation of De Architectura Libri Decem (The Ten Books on Architecture) by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio. Preserved in the Smithsonian Museum of American History]]
There is little information or evidence about major architectural theory in antiquity, until the 1st century BCE, with the work of [[Vitruvius]]. This does not mean, however, that such works did not exist, given that many works never survived antiquity.

Vitruvius was a Roman [[writer]], [[architect]], and [[engineer]] active in the 1st century BCE. He was the most prominent architectural theorist in the Roman Empire known today, having written ''[[De architectura]]'' (known today as ''The Ten Books of Architecture''), a treatise written in [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] on architecture, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. Probably written between 27 and 23 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;Kruft, p. 447.&lt;/ref&gt; it is the only major contemporary source on classical architecture to have survived. Divided into ten sections or "books", it covers almost every aspect of Roman architecture, from town planning, materials, decorations, temples, water supplies, etc. It rigorously defines the classical [[orders of architecture]]. It also proposes the three fundamental laws that [[Architecture]] must obey, in order to be so considered: ''firmitas, utilitas, venustas'', translated in the 17th century by [[Sir Henry Wotton]] into the English slogan ''firmness, commodity and delight'' (meaning structural adequacy, functional adequacy, and beauty). The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the Renaissance, adding archaeological underpinnings to the rise of the [[Renaissance]] style, which was already under way. Renaissance architects, such as Niccoli, Brunelleschi and Leon Battista Alberti, found in "De Architectura" their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a scientific discipline.

===Middle Ages===
Throughout the Middle Ages, architectural knowledge was passed by transcription, word of mouth and technically in master builders' lodges.&lt;ref&gt;Evers, Thoenes, et al., p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the laborious nature of transcription, few examples of architectural theory were penned in this time period. Most works from this period were theological, and were transcriptions of the bible, so the architectural theories were the notes on structures included therein. The [[Abbot Suger]]'s ''Liber de rebus in administratione sua gestis'', was an architectural document that emerged with [[gothic architecture]]. Another was [[Villard de Honnecourt]]'s portfolio of drawings from about the 1230s.

In [[Song Dynasty]] China, Li Jie published the ''[[Yingzao Fashi]]'' in 1103, which was an architectural treatise that codified elements of [[Chinese architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;Liang Ssu-ch'eng. ''A Pictorial History of Chinese Architecture: a Study of the Development of its Structural System and the Evolution of its Types''. MIT press, 1984. {{ISBN|0-262-12103-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy
Shatzman Steinhardt ed. ''Chinese Architecture''. Yale University Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-300-09559-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
The first great work of architectural theory of this period belongs to [[Leon Battista Alberti]], ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', which placed Vitruvius at the core of the most profound theoretical tradition of the modern ages. From Alberti, good architecture is validated through the Vitruvian triad, which defines its purpose. This triplet conserved all its validity until the 19th century. A major transition into the 17th century and ultimately to the phase of Enlightenment was secured through the advanced mathematical and optical research of the celebrated architect and geometer [[Girard Desargues]], with an emphasis on his studies on conics, perspective and projective geometry.

===Enlightenment===
The Age of the Enlightenment witnessed considerable development in architectural theory on the European continent. New archeological discoveries (such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum) drove new interest in Classical art and architecture. Thus the term Neoclassicism, exemplified by the writings of Prussian art critic [Johann Joachim Winkelmann], arose to designate 18th-century architecture which looked to these new Classical precedents for inspiration in building design.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Middleton and David Watkin, Neoclassicism and 19th-century architecture. The MIT Press, 1980 and Barry Bergdoll, European Architecture 1750–1890, Oxford University Press, 2000.l,&lt;/ref&gt;

Major architectural theorists of the Enlightenment include Julien-David Leroy, Abbé Marc-Antoine Laugier, Giovanni Battista Piranesi,  
Robert Adam, James Stuart, [[Georg Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]], *[http://web.mit.edu/mmj4/www/downloads/footprint1.pdf "The Cunning of Architecture's Reason,"] Footprint (#1, Autumn 2007), pp. 31-46.&lt;/ref&gt;
and Nicholas Revett.

===19th century===
[[File:Essai sur l'Architecture - Frontispiece.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Frontispiece of Marc-Antoine Laugier: Essai sur l'Architecture 2nd ed. 1755 by Charles Eisen (1720-1778). Allegorical engraving of the Vitruvian primitive hut.]]
A vibrant strain of [[Neoclassicism]], inherited from [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]]'s seminal Essai, provided the foundation for two generations of international activity around the core themes of classicism, [[primitivism]] and a "return to Nature."

Reaction against the dominance of [[neo-classical architecture]] came to the fore in the 1820s with [[Augustus Pugin]] providing a moral and theoretical basis for [[Gothic Revival architecture]], and in the 1840s [[John Ruskin]] developed this ethos.

The American sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] published the essay ''American Architecture'' in August 1843 in which he rejected the imitation of old styles of buildings and outlined the functional relationship between architecture and decoration. These theories anticipated the development of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] in [[modern architecture]].

Towards the end of the century, there occurred a blossoming of theoretical activity. In England, Ruskin's ideals underpinned the emergence of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] exemplified by the writings of [[William Morris]]. This in turn formed the basis for [[Art Nouveau]] in the [[UK]], exemplified by the work of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]], and influenced the [[Vienna Secession]]. On the Continent, the theories of [[Viollet-le-Duc]] and [[Gottfried Semper]] provided the springboard for enormous vitality of thought dedicated to architectural innovation and the renovation of the notion of style. Semper in particular developed an international following, in [[Germany]], [[England]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and the [[United States]]. The generation born during the middle-third of the 19th century was largely enthralled with the opportunities presented by Semper's combination of a breathtaking historical scope and a methodological granularity. In contrast to more recent, and thus "modern", thematically self-organized theoretical activities, this generation did not coalesce into a "movement." They did, however, seem to converge on Semper's use of the concept of ''Realismus'', and they are thus labelled proponents of [[architectural realism]]. Among the most active Architectural Realists were: [[Georg Heuser]], [[Rudolf Redtenbacher]], [[Constantin Lipsius]], [[Hans Auer]], [[Paul Sédille]], [[Lawrence Harvey (architect)|Lawrence Harvey]], [[Otto Wagner]] and [[Richard Streiter]].

===20th century===
In 1889 [[Camillo Sitte]] published ''Der Städtebau nach seinem künstlerischen Grundsätzen'' (translated as ''City Planning According to Artistic Principles'') which was not exactly a criticism of architectural form but an aesthetic criticism (inspired by medieval and [[Baroque]] town planning) of 19th-century urbanism. Mainly a theoretical work, it had an immediate impact on architecture, as the two disciplines of architecture and planning intertwined. Demand for it was so high that five editions appeared in German between 1889 and 1922 and a French translation came out in 1902. (No English edition came out until 1945.) For Sitte, the most important issue was not the architectural shape or form of a building but the quality of the urban spaces that buildings collectively enclose, the whole being more than the sum of its parts. The Modern Movement rejected these thoughts and [[Le Corbusier]] energetically dismissed the work. Nevertheless, Sitte's work was revisited by [[post-modern]] architects and theorists from the 1970s, especially following its republication in 1986 by Rizzoli, in an edition edited by Collins and Collins (now published by [[Dover]]). The book is often cited anachronistically today as a vehicle for the criticism of the [[Modern Movement]].

Also on the topic of artistic notions with regard to urbanism was [[Louis Sullivan]]'s ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'' of 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Louis H. Sullivan. ''Kindergarten Chats and Other Writings.'' Courier Dover Publications, 1979. Page 202. {{ISBN|0-486-23812-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this essay, Sullivan penned his famous alliterative adage "form ever follows function"; a phrase that was to be later adopted as a central tenet of Modern architectural theory. While later architects adopted the abbreviated phrase "form follows function" as a polemic in service of functionalist doctrine,  Sullivan wrote of function with regard to biological functions of the natural order. Another influential planning theorist of this time was [[Ebenezer Howard]], who founded the [[garden city movement]]. This movement aimed to form communities with architecture in the [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts style]] at [[Letchworth]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] and popularised the style as domestic architecture.

In [[Vienna]], the idea of a radically new [[modern architecture]] had many theorists and proponents. An early use of the term ''modern architecture'' in print occurred in the title of a book by [[Otto Wagner]],&lt;ref&gt;Otto Wagner. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AvgjAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq ''Moderne Architektur: Seinen Schülern ein Führer auf diesem Kunstgebiete.''] Anton Schroll. 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otto Wagner. Translated by Harry Francis Mallgrave. ''Modern Architecture: A Guidebook for His Students to This Field of Art.'' Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. 1988. {{ISBN|0-226-86938-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; who gave examples of his own work representative of the [[Vienna Secession]] with [[art nouveau]] illustrations, and didactic teachings to his students. Soon thereafter, [[Adolf Loos]] wrote ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', and while his own style is usually seen in the context of the [[Jugendstil]], his demand for "the elimination of ornament" joined the slogan "[[form follows function]]" as a principle of the architectural so-called [[Modern Movement]] that came to dominate the mid-20th century. [[Walter Gropius]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] and [[Le Corbusier]] provided the theoretical basis for the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] with aims of using industrialised architecture to reshape society. [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], while modern in rejecting historic revivalism, was idiosyncratic in his theory, which he conveyed in copious writing.  Wright did not subscribe to the tenets of the International Style, but evolved what he hoped would be an American, in contrast to a European, progressive course.  Wright's style, however, was highly personal, involving his particular views of man and nature. Wright was more poetic and firmly maintained the 19th-century view of the creative artist as unique genius.  This limited the relevance of his theoretical propositions.  Towards the end of the century [[postmodern architecture]] reacted against the austerity of High Modern (International Style) principles, viewed as narrowly normative and doctrinaire.

===Contemporary===
[[File:CIDADE - 201405 - 25 (14222237271).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Cidade da Cultura / Eisenman Architects.]]
In contemporary architectural discourse theory has become more concerned with its position within culture generally, and thought in particular.  This is why university courses on architecture theory may often spend just as much time discussing philosophy and cultural studies as buildings, and why advanced postgraduate research and doctoral dissertations focus on philosophical topics in connection with architectural humanities. Some architectural theorists aim at discussing philosophical themes, or engage in direct dialogues with philosophers, as in the case of [[Peter Eisenman]]'s and [[Bernard Tschumi]]'s interest in [[Derrida]]'s thought, or [[Anthony Vidler]]'s interest in the works of [[Freud]] and [[Lacan]], in addition to an interest in [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s ''Poetics of Space'' or texts by [[Gilles Deleuze]]. This has also been the case with educators in academia like [[Dalibor Vesely]] or Alberto-Perez Gomez, and in more recent years this philosophical orientation has been reinforced through the research of a new generation of theorists (E.G. [[Jeffrey Kipnis]] or [[Sanford Kwinter]]).  Similarly, we can refer to contemporary architects who are interested in philosophy and cultural studies. Some are interested in [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]], like [[Christian Norberg-Schulz]], or specialize as philosophers and historians of science, such as [[Nader El-Bizri]]. Others, like Manfredo Tafuri, are interested in new ontological definitions of architecture tracing a new notion of modernity in architecture. The notion that theory entails critique also stemmed from post-structural [[literary studies]] in the work of many other theorists and architects, such as Mark Wigley, among others. In their theories, architecture is compared to a language which can be invented and re-invented every time it is used. This theory influenced the so-called deconstructivist architecture.  In contrast, network society innovators, especially Silicon Valley software developers, have embraced [[Christopher Alexander]]'s emphasis on [[The Timeless Way of Building]] (1979) based on pattern languages that are optimized on-site as construction unfolds.

Since 2000, architectural theory has also had to face the rapid rise of urbanism and [[globalization]]. By developing a new understanding of the city, many theorists developed new understandings of the urban conditions of our planet (E.G. [[Rem Koolhaas]]'s ''Bigness''). Interests in fragmentation and architecture as transient objects further affected such thinking (e.g. the concern for employing high technology), but also related to general concerns such as [[ecology]], [[mass media]], and economism.

In the past decade, there has been the emergence of the so-called "Digital" Architecture. Several currents and design methodologies are being developed simultaneously, some of which reinforce each other, whereas others work in opposition. One of these trends is [[Biomimicry]], which is the process of examining nature, its models, systems, processes, and elements, to emulate or take inspiration from them in order to solve human problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reading.ac.uk/biomimetics/about.htm Reading University: What is Biomimetics?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323042805/http://www.reading.ac.uk/biomimetics/about.htm |date=March 23, 2012 }} Retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects also design organic-looking buildings in the attempt to develop a new formal language. Another trend is the exploration of those computational techniques that are influenced by algorithms relevant to biological processes and sometimes referred to as [[Digital morphogenesis]]. Trying to utilize [[Computational creativity]] in architecture, [[Genetic algorithms]] developed in computer science are used to evolve designs on a computer, and some of these are proposed and built as actual structures. Since these new architectural tendencies emerged, many theorists and architects have been working on these issues, developing theories and ideas such as Patrick Schumacher's Parametricism.

Nonetheless, there is no evidence for claiming that we are witnessing the birth of an entirely new type of architectural theory and practice. 
Contemporary architecture's theoretical world is plural and multicolored. There are different dominant schools of architectural theory which are based on linguistic analysis, philosophy, post-structuralism, or cultural theory. For instance, there is emerging interest in the re-discovery of the post-modernist project ([[Sam Jacob]]), in the definition of new radical tendencies of architecture and its implication in the development of cities ([[Pier Vittorio Aureli]]), and in a new formalist approach to architecture through the appropriation of concepts from the [[Object Oriented philosophy]] ([[Peter Trummer]] or [[Tom Wiscombe]]). It is too early, however, to say whether any of these explorations will have widespread or lasting impact on architecture.

'''Arvind Sharma''' is the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at [[McGill University]]. Sharma's works focus on [[comparative religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[philosophy of religion]] and the role of women in religion. Some of his more widely read works include ''Our Religions'' and ''Women in World Religions'', which were edited by him. ''Feminism in World Religions'' was selected as a [[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]] Outstanding Academic Book (1999).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.emory.edu/HSC/sharma.html Dr. Arvind Sharma], Emory University Hindu Students Council, retrieved 2015-04-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography== 
Arvind Sharma was born on the 13th of January 1940 in [[Varanasi]], [[India]] . Raised in a family that traditionally worked in the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), he followed suit and joined the IAS in 1962 after a distinguished academic career. 

He served in the State of Gujarat until 1968, when he moved to the United States to pursue higher studies in economics at the [[University of Syracuse]], obtaining a Masters in economics in 1970.  While pursuing the role of non-economic factors in economic development he became interested in religion and joined Harvard Divinity School in 1972.  After obtaining a Masters in Theological Studies, concentrating on comparative religion, he earned his PhD from the Department of Sanskrit and Indian Studies in 1978.  His doctorate work involved the first ever translation in English of Abhinavagupta's commentary on the Bhagavad Gita.

While at Harvard he was recruited in 1976 by the newly founded Department of Studies in Religion at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. In 1980 he moved to the University of Sydney, from where he was hired by McGill University in Canada in 1987.  In 1994 he was appointed the Birks Professor of Comparative Religion at McGill University, where he continues to teach as of 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24065">'''The Building Strong Families Program''' (BSF) is part of the Healthy Marriage Initiative funded by the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], "to learn whether well-designed interventions can help couples fulfill their aspirations for a healthy relationship, marriage, and a strong family."&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

Between 2002-2011, "BSF programs were implemented by non-profit and public agencies at 12 locations in seven states, and enrolled more than 5,000 volunteer couples ... The intervention featured up to 42 hours of multi-couple group sessions led by trained facilitators, focusing on skills that, according to earlier research, are associated with relationship and marital stability and satisfaction."&lt;ref name=opre&gt;[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/resource/the-building-strong-families-project-implementation-of-eight-programs-to] U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten-year program was implemented through a contract by the [[Administration for Children and Families]] with Mathematica Policy Research.&lt;ref name=mathematica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813065842/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/ |archivedate=2010-08-13 |df= }} Mathematica Policy Research website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major study questions of the Building Strong Families Project included:&lt;ref name="opre"/&gt;

* '''Foundation''': What underlying conditions, preparation, resources, and context make it possible to implement programs that focus on promoting healthy marriage for a target population of low-income unwed couples with children? On what theories of behavior and family well-being do the programs rest? What types of organizations are well suited to operating such programs?
* '''Operation''': What are the important issues and challenges in designing, implementing, and operating programs, and what lessons can be drawn from the program experience? What services are included, and how do they complement existing programs for low-income families?
* '''Participation''': Who participates and for how long? What services do they receive? How does participation differ for subgroups?
* '''Impacts''': How do BSF programs affect couples’ attitudes and expectations about marriage, the quality and stability of their relationships, and whether they marry? What effects are found on parents and their relationships with their children, and the well-being and development of children? Which program designs work best?

==Rationale==

"Strengthening relationships and increasing fathers' involvement have emerged as central national policy strategies to improve the lives of low-income families and enhance the well-being of children. We are conducting studies to increase understanding about how to help low-income couples solidify their relationships, engage fathers more fully, and create the best environments in which to raise children ... [our] 10-year Building Strong Families demonstration is testing whether workshops on communication and relationship skills, combined with social supports, can help unwed parents stay together, manage conflict, maintain intimacy, increase the degree to which fathers are involved in their children’s lives, and improve children’s early development. The study is using a rigorous random assignment design and includes more than 5,000 couples in seven states. A report released in May 2010 provides short-term results on BSF’s impacts on couples after about 15 months, focusing on the stability and quality of the couples’ relationships."&lt;ref name="mathematica"/&gt;

==Impact report==
[[File:BSF Impacts.jpg|thumb|BSF 15-Month Impact Report]]

In May 2010, Mathematica reported findings from a 15-month follow-up of program and control group participants:

* BSF had no effect on whether couples were still together 15 months after they had applied for the program, when data from the eight BSF programs are combined. At this point, 76 percent of BSF couples were still romantically involved, compared with 77 percent of control group couples. Similarly, BSF and control group couples were equally likely to be married to each other at that time (17 and 18 percent respectively) and to be living together, whether married or unmarried (62 percent for both research groups)."&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/Family_Support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720101532/http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/family_support/BSF_impact_finalrpt.pdf |archivedate=2013-07-20 |df= }} Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation, Wood, Robert G., et al., "The Building Strong Families Project," May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fifteen months after they applied for the program, BSF and control group couples reported being equally happy in their romantic relationships, with average ratings of 8.4 and 8.3 respectively on a 0-to-10 relationship happiness scale. Similarly, BSF and control group couples gave very similar ratings of supportiveness and affection in their relationships, with average support and affection scale values of 3.5 on a 1-to-4 scale for couples in both research groups. In addition, BSF had no overall effect on how faithful couples were to each other.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
* When results are averaged across all eight programs, BSF did not improve couples’ ability to manage their conflict. Couples in both research groups reported similar levels of use of constructive conflict behaviors, such as keeping a sense of humor and listening to the other partner’s perspective during disagreements. Similarly, there was no difference between the research groups in the avoidance of destructive conflict behaviors, such as withdrawing when there is a disagreement or allowing small disagreements to escalate. In addition, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF had no effect on how likely couples were to experience [[intimate partner violence]]. Similarly, when results are averaged across all programs, BSF did not improve co-parenting or increase father involvement. BSF and control group couples reported that their co-parenting relationships were of equally high quality. In addition, at the 15-month follow-up, couples in both research groups were equally likely to report that fathers were living with their children, spending substantial time with them, and providing them with substantial financial support.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;
*The Baltimore BSF program [Loving Couples, Loving Children] had negative effects on couples’ relationships. BSF couples were less likely than control group couples to remain romantically involved, 59 percent versus 70 percent. Baltimore BSF couples reported being less supportive and affectionate toward each other than control group couples did. In addition, women in the Baltimore BSF program were more likely than women in the control group to report having been severely physically assaulted by a romantic partner in the past year, 15 percent compared with 9 percent. Baltimore BSF couples also rated the quality of their co-parenting relationship lower than control group couples did and reported that BSF fathers spent less time with their children and were less likely to provide them financial support than control group fathers were.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt;

==Impact debate==

Scholars offered different perspectives on the findings:

A study from Harvard's Kennedy School reported: "In general, at the time of the 15-month follow-up the BSF intervention did not have a statistically or substantively significant effect on couples‘ relationship status or quality, or fathers‘ involvement with their children. Although the BSF had little or no effect on couples‘ relationships overall, impacts varied meaningfully across the eight evaluation sites; for example, the Oklahoma City site‘s BSF program had a consistent pattern of positive effects at 15 months. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, at the Baltimore site the BSF intervention had numerous negative effects: at the time of the 15-month follow-up survey, Baltimore couples who had been randomly assigned to participate in the BSF program were much less likely than control group couples to be romantically involved; fathers assigned to the BSF program were less likely to provide substantial financial support for their children or see them regularly; and mothers in the BSF sample were more likely to report experiencing a severe physical assault than were mothers in the control group."&lt;ref&gt;Clarkwest, Andrew; Killewald, Alexandra; Wood, Robert. "Stepping up or Stepping Back: Highly Disadvantaged Parents' Responses to the Building Strong Families Program," Harvard University, John F. Kennedy School of Government, May 23, 2012.[http://www.hks.harvard.edu/var/ezp_site/storage/fckeditor/file/pdfs/centers-programs/centers/wiener/wps/BSF_Baltimore_chapter_05232012_HKS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article for RH Reality Check, Joseph DiNorcia wrote, "The evidence is unmistakable: there’s just no amount of government coaxing that will make unmarried couples want to, as Beyoncé would say, 'put a ring on it.' A new report from Mathematica Policy Research, Inc, shows that the relationship skills education programs implemented by the Administration for Children and Families have, with a few exceptions, no effect on participants. These programs provide 'education' and support services to unmarried, low-income, heterosexual couples with newborn babies, and are among the marriage-promotion projects which had been enthusiastically touted by the Bush administration as a magic pill for poverty and unstable families."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/node/14001] DiNorcia, Joseph. "Building Strong Families Found Completely Ineffective," RH Reality Check, August 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Stanley, Ph.D. and Frank Fincham, Ph.D., two leading researchers in the field of Marriage and Relationship Education (MRE), attributed the impact findings to flaws in program implementation, arguing: "A summary from the BSF study that marriage/relationship education (MRE) does not work is not tenable, in our view. In addition to studying many other aspects of program and delivery, BSF really became more of a study of participation rates than of the impacts of MRE and other program elements. The main reason is that, in many sites, the 'dose' of MRE that couples received was quite low. In fact, in some sites, only 40% of couples ever attended even one session together."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.narme.org]"Comments from Dr. Scott Stanley and Dr. Frank Fincham on the Building Strong Families Study," National Association of Relationship and Marriage Educators, July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Loving Couples Loving Children (LCLC) is a curriculum developed by [[John Gottman|John and Julie Gottman]] especially for low-income couples who are expecting a child. John Gottman is world-renowned for his scientific work identifying the predictors of relationship success and failure, while Julie Gottman is a master clinician who provides advanced training in marriage education and couples therapy ... To engage and retain the interest of low-income couples, they substantially modified the presentation of the material by developing a series of video 'talk shows' in which racially and ethnically diverse low-income couples discuss relationship issues. Each of the forty-two sessions in LCLC begins with such a talk show, which leads to a lively discussion among group participants. In these unscripted shows real couples, not actors, describe the challenges they have faced in their relationship and how they overcame them. The second half of each group session is devoted to activities that teach specific skills and techniques that couples can use to address the issues raised in the video. Participants practice skills with their partners during the session, with individual attention from the male and female co-facilitators, as needed."&lt;ref name=dion&gt;Dion, Robin M. "Healthy Marriage Programs: Learning What Works," Marriage and Child Wellbeing, Volume 15, Number 2, Fall 2005. [http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=37&amp;articleid=110&amp;sectionid=714]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Love's Cradle is based on the well-established Relationship Enhancement (RE) program, adapted and supplemented by new material developed especially to address issues identified by researchers as crucial barriers to positive family formation in fragile families. Created by Mary Ortwein, a marriage and family therapist with experience serving low-income families, and Bernard Guerney, the original developer of RE, Love's Cradle relies on a simplified and more culturally sensitive version of Relationship Enhancement taught at the fifth-grade level, and adds content to the standard RE skills. The simplified version avoids psychological jargon and teaches skills at a slower pace, with greater access to individual skills coaching. Love's Cradle consists of twenty-one two-hour group sessions. Ten sessions, most at the beginning of the program, are devoted to the simplified RE skills. Additional sessions allow couples to use their new skills to address the issues indicated by research to be common to low-income couples, including how to build, rebuild, and maintain trust; deal with multiple- partner fertility; manage emotions; work as a team on money matters; and reframe their understanding of marriage. Love's Cradle was field-tested with low-income couples and will be part of the Building Strong Families national evaluation."&lt;ref name="dion"/&gt;

"The Becoming Parents Program (BPP) curriculum, developed by Dr. Pamela Jordan, focused on three areas: (1) communication, problem-solving, friendship, and fun; (2) self-care and anger management; and (3) infant care and development. To meet BSF requirements, BPP was adapted to include material relevant for low-income families. The information on communication, problem-solving, friendship, and fun was largely drawn from the PREP curriculum. Skills included using a 'speaker–listener' technique, establishing ground rules, identifying hidden issues, and maintaining friendship and fun in the relationship. The focus on self-care and anger management included such strategies as using time-out to prevent escalation. Material was adapted from the Stop Anger and Violence Prevention program and the Domestic Conflict Containment Program."&lt;ref name=catalog&gt;"Catalog of Research: Programs for Low-Income Couples," Mathematica Policy Research, May 2012.[http://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/opre/catalog_couples.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CGIAR''' (formerly the '''Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research''') is a global partnership that unites organizations engaged in research for a food-secured future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902213810/http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR research is dedicated to reducing rural poverty, increasing food security, improving human health and nutrition, and ensuring sustainable management of natural resources. It is carried out by 15 centers that are members of the CGIAR Consortium, in close collaboration with hundreds of partners, including national and regional research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, development organizations, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902213810/http://www.cgiar.org/who-we-are/ |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this through a network of 15 research centers known as the [[CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice |first=Africa |url=http://www.cgiar.org/cgiar-consortium/research-centers/ |title=CGIAR |publisher=Consortium.cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These research centers are spread around the globe, with most centers located in the [[Global South]], at [[Center of origin|Vavilov Centers]] of agricultural crop genetic diversity.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenburg, Jr., Jack Ralph (2004) First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology, 1492-2000, Second Edition, Madison: University of Wisconsin Press&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR research centers are generally run in partnership with other organizations, including national and regional agricultural research institutes, civil society organizations, academia, and the private sector.

CGIAR is unusual in that it is not part of an international political institution such as the United Nations or the World Bank; it is an ad-hoc organization which receives funds from its members.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/2549/cgiar%4040_final_LOWRES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The membership of CGIAR includes country governments, institutions, and philanthropic foundations including the USA, Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Japan, the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO), the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), the [[World Bank]], the European Commission, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, and the Fund of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC Fund). In 2009 CGIAR had revenues of US$629 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cgiar.org/publications/annual/cgiar-annualreport2010/cgiar-annualreport2010/cgiar_annual_report/2009_CGIAR_Full_Financial_Report_FINAL.pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== CGIAR's vision ==
CGIAR's vision is to:

:Reduce poverty and hunger, improve human health and nutrition, and enhance ecosystem resilience through high-quality international agricultural research, partnership and leadership.

== Strategic objectives ==
CGIAR's vision is supported by four strategic objectives:

* Reducing [[rural poverty]]
* Improving [[food security]]
* Improving [[nutrition]] and [[health]]
* Sustainably managing [[natural resources]]

The Strategy and Results Framework&lt;ref&gt;http://library.cgiar.org/bitstream/handle/10947/5224/CGIAR-SRF-March_2011_BROCHURE.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; describes how CGIAR intends to work towards those objectives.

== History ==
=== The early years ===
CGIAR arose in response to the widespread concern in the mid-20th century that rapid increases in human populations would soon lead to widespread [[famine]]. Starting in 1943, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the Mexican government laid the seeds for the [[Green Revolution]] when they established the Office of Special Studies, which resulted in the establishment of the [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([[IRRI]]) in 1960 and [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] (CIMMYT) in 1963 with support from the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation, developing high-yielding, disease-resistant varieties that dramatically increased production of these staple cereals, and turned India, for example, from a country regularly facing starvation in the 1960s to a net exporter of cereals by the late-1970s. But it was clear that these foundations alone could not fund all the agricultural research and development efforts needed to feed the world's population. In 1969, the [[Pearson Commission on International Development]] urged the international community to undertake "intensive international effort" to support "research specializing in food supplies and tropical agriculture".

In 1970, the Rockefeller Foundation proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat. This was further supported and developed by the [[World Bank]], FAO and UNDP, and CGIAR was established on May 19, 1971, to coordinate international agricultural research efforts aimed at reducing poverty and achieving [[food security]] in developing countries.

CGIAR originally supported four centres: CIMMYT; [[International Rice Research Institute]] ([[IRRI]]); the [[International Center for Tropical Agriculture]] (CIAT); and the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] (IITA). The initial focus on the staple cereals—rice, wheat and maize—widened during the 1970s to include cassava, chickpea, sorghum, potato, millet and other food crops, and encompassed livestock, farming systems, the conservation of genetic resources, plant nutrition, water management, policy research, and services to national agricultural research centers in developing countries. By 1983 there were 13 research centers around the world under its umbrella.&lt;ref&gt;Establishment of CGIAR - see Mark Dowie, ''American Foundations: An Investigative History'', Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 2001, (p.114)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion and consolidation ===
By the 1990s the number of centers supported by CGIAR had grown to 18. Mergers between the two livestock centers the [[International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases]] (ILRAD) and the [[International Livestock Centre for Africa]] (ILCA)) and the absorption of work on bananas and plantains into the program of the [[International Plant Genetic Resources Institute]] (IPGRI; now [[Bioversity International]]) reduced the number to 16. Later another center (ISNAR) was absorbed{{clarification needed|date=March 2017 &lt;!--into what?--&gt;}}, reducing the total number of supported centers to 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/who/history/index.html#5 |title=History of CGIAR / CGIAR |publisher=Cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction in the number of supported centers was not enough to address problems facing the group. These included the logistics of funders and the group alike in dealing with a large number of centers. This led to the creation of three classes of centers, divided into high, medium, and low impact delivery. 

At the same time, a number of aid recipient countries like China, India, and Malaysia created their own development agencies and developed cadres of agricultural scientists. Private donors and industries also contributed, while research institutions in the rich world turned their attention to problems of the poor. CGIAR, however, failed to embrace these changes in any effective way.

=== CGIAR reforms ===
Seeking to increase its efficiency and build on its previous successes, CGIAR embarked on a program of reform in 2001. Key among the changes implemented was the adoption of Challenge Programs as a means of harnessing the strengths of the diverse centers to address major global or regional issues. Three Challenge Programs were established within the supported research centers and a fourth to FARA, a research forum in Africa:
* Water and Food, aimed at producing more food using less water;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfid.gov.uk/r4d/SearchResearchDatabase.asp?ProjectID=60685 |title=Research for Development &gt; Water and Food Challenge Programme |publisher=DFID |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Including [[Basin Focal Projects]])
* HarvestPlus, to improve the micronutrient content of staple foods;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://knowledge.cta.int/en/S-T-Organisations/International/HarvestPlus |title=HarvestPlus / International / S&amp;T Organisations / Home - Knowledge for Development |publisher=Knowledge.cta.int |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Generation, aimed at increasing the use of [[plant genetic resources | crop genetic resources]] to create a new generation of plants that meet farmers and consumers needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijpg/2008/369601/ |title=The Generation Challenge Programme Platform: Semantic Standards and Workbench for Crop Science |publisher=Hindawi.com |date=2007-09-22 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A new CGIAR ===
Since CGIAR was established there have been large changes in the agricultural research "landscape". Fluctuations in food and energy prices and in financial markets are adding uncertainty to the environment in which farmers and consumers operate. Climate change will have a wide range of impacts on agriculture, with changes in growing conditions for crops, livestock, and fish and the pests and diseases that affect them. Droughts and storms are expected to increase in frequency and severity, undermining the efforts of farmers, foresters and fishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/15538-079b31d45081fe9c3dbc6ff34de4807e4.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - main document3 ivan.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will have a large impact on food security.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19703.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, CGIAR embarked on a change process to improve the engagement between all stakeholders in international agricultural research for development—donors, researchers and beneficiaries—and to refocus the efforts of the centers on major global development challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Yojana Sharma |url=http://www.scidev.net/en/features/a-revolution-to-combat-world-hunger.html |title=A revolution to combat world hunger |publisher=SciDev.Net |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgiar.org/changemanagement/briefs/march08.html |title=Browsing by Subject "CGIAR newsletters" |publisher=Cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key objective was to integrate the work of the centers and their partners, avoiding fragmentation and duplication of effort.

CGIAR components include the [[CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers]], the CGIAR Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905190501/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/ |archive-date=2011-09-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the CGIAR Independent Science and Partnership Council (ISPC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecouncil.cgiar.org/ |title=Independent Science &amp; Partnership Council: ISPC home |publisher=Sciencecouncil.cgiar.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partners. Research is guided by the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/sites/cgiarfund.org/files/Documents/PDF/CGIAR-SRF-March%202011_BROCHURE.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331111653/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/sites/cgiarfund.org/files/Documents/PDF/CGIAR-SRF-March%202011_BROCHURE.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGIAR Consortium unites the centers supported by CGIAR; it coordinates limited research activities of about fifteen research projects (See list below) among the centers and provides donors with a single contact point to centers. The CGIAR Fund aims to harmonize the efforts of donors to contribute to agricultural research for development, increase the funding available by reducing or eliminating duplication of effort among the centers and promote greater financial stability. The CGIAR ISPC, appointed by the CGIAR Fund Council, provides expert advice to the funders of CGIAR, particularly in ensuring that CGIAR's research programs are aligned with the Strategy and Results Framework. It provides a bridge between the funders and the CGIAR Consortium. The hope was that the Strategy and Results Framework would provide the strategic direction for the centers and CGIAR Research Programs, ensuring that they focus on delivering measurable results that contribute to achieving CGIAR objectives. However the research programs were designed prior to the Framework being ready, so now some refitting will have to take place to get the programs inline with it.&lt;ref&gt;http://consortium.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/CGIAR-SRF-Feb_20_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A biennial Global Conference on Agricultural Research for Development (GCARD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=What is GCARD GCARD 2012 GCARD 2010 |url=http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/gcard/aboutGCARD |title=What is GCARD |publisher=EGFAR |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061054/http://www.egfar.org/egfar/website/gcard/aboutGCARD |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; provides a forum for closer engagement of developing countries and partners in developing and guiding the research and development agenda of the CGIAR Consortium and the CGIAR Fund. The first GCARD was held in Montpellier, France, in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=What is GCARD GCARD 2012 GCARD 2010 |url=http://www.egfar.org/egfarW/website/gcard |title=GCARD |publisher=EGFAR |date= |accessdate=2012-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061109/http://www.egfar.org/egfarW/website/gcard |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CGIAR Consortium was established in April 2010. It is based at the  [[Agropolis International|Agropolis campus]] in Montpellier. The CGIAR Fund was established in January 2010 and is based in Washington, DC.

====CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers====
The '''CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers''' was established in April 2010 to coordinate and support the work of the 15 international agricultural research centers supported by CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; It plays a central role in formulating the CGIAR Strategy and Results Framework (SRF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consortium.cgiar.org/our-strategic-research-framework/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928002728/http://consortium.cgiar.org/our-strategic-research-framework/ |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that guides the work of CGIAR supported centers on CGIAR funded research and developing CGIAR Research Programs under the SRF. The work of the CGIAR Consortium is governed by the Consortium Board, a 10-member panel that has fiduciary responsibility for CGIAR Research Programs, including monitoring and evaluation and reporting progress to donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/the-consortium-board/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930034056/http://consortium.cgiar.org/about-us/the-consortium-board/ |archivedate=2011-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; CGIAR Research Programs are approved and funded by the CGIAR Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711021646/http://www.cgiarfund.org/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on a contractual basis through performance agreements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/how_the_fund_works |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101080923/http://www.cgiarfund.org/cgiarfund/how_the_fund_works |archive-date=2011-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CGIAR Research Programs ====
CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs) are multi-center, multi-partner initiatives built on three core principles: impact on CGIAR's four system-level objectives; making the most of the centers' strengths; and strong and effective partnerships.

The following research programmes have now been approved (lead centers shown in brackets):

*FiSH - Fish in Agri-Food Systems ([[WorldFish]])

A new strategy and results framework was approved in 2015 and the portfolio of research programs revised. The systems programs dryland systems, aquatic agricultural systems, and Humidtropics ceased to be standalone programs, even though they were seen as what was new to the reformed CGIAR, but were not given a real chance to take off and prosper, mainly due to funding reductions, but also because of a refocus on commodity value chains. These commodity programs were renamed to, for example, RTB Systems Program or Rice Systems Program. Some work of the earlier systems programs were incorporated, but most was lost.

== Impacts of CGIAR ==
The impacts of CGIAR research have been extensively assessed, as demonstrated by a review article published in the journal ''Food Policy'' in 2010.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Renkow, M. and Byerlee, D. 2010. The impacts of CGIAR research: A review of recent evidence. Food Policy, 35 (5):391-402&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the impact of the CGIAR centers has come from crop genetic improvement. The high-yielding wheat and rice varieties that were the foundation of the Green Revolution were the beginning of a long line of successes. An assessment of the impact of crop breeding efforts at CGIAR centers between 1965 and 1998 showed that 65 percent of the area planted to ten crops addressed by CGIAR—wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, barley, lentils, beans, cassava, and potatoes—was planted in improved varieties. Of this, 60 percent was sown with varieties with CGIAR ancestry (more than 90 percent in the case of lentils, beans, and cassava), and half of those varieties came from crosses made at a CGIAR center.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, R.E. 2003. Modern variety production: a synthesis. In: Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D. (Eds.), Crop Variety Improvement and its Effect on Productivity: The Impact of International Agricultural Research. [[CAB International|CABI]] Publishing, Wallingford, UK, pp. 427–446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evenson, R.E. 2003. Production impacts of crop genetic improvement programmes. In: Evenson, R.E., Gollin, D. (Eds.), Crop Variety Improvement and its Effect on Productivity: The Impact of International Agricultural Research. CABI Publishing, Wallingford, UK, pp. 447–472.&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary value of CGIAR's investment in crop improvement is huge, running into the billions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Raitzer, D.A. and Kelley, T.G. 2008. Benefit-cost meta-analysis of investment in the international agricultural research centers of the CGIAR. Agricultural Systems, 96 (1–3):108–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

The centers have also contributed to such fields as improving the nutritional value of staple crops; pest and disease control through breeding resistant varieties; integrated pest management and biological control (e.g., control of the cassava mealybug in sub-Saharan Africa through release of a predatory wasp); improvements in livestock and fish production systems; genetic resources characterization and conservation; improved natural resource management; and contributions to improved policies in numerous areas, including forestry, fertilizer, milk marketing, and genetic resources conservation and use. The introduction of no-tillage systems in the rice-wheat systems in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, for example, generated economic benefits of about US$165 million between 1990 and 2010 from an investment of only US$3.5 million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Even the most conservative estimate of the measurable benefits of CGIAR research indicate US$2 in benefits for every US$1 invested.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload/212527/SCBriefbfitcostan.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Center for Transnational Legal Studies''' (CTLS) is a global educational center for the study of transnational law.&lt;ref name="law.utoronto.ca"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.utoronto.ca/students_content.asp?itemPath%3D2%2F2%2F11%2F0%2F0%26contentId%3D1756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610205621/http://www.law.utoronto.ca/students_content.asp?itemPath=2%2F2%2F11%2F0%2F0&amp;contentId=1756 |archivedate=2011-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center was founded in London in October 2008 as an initiative by Georgetown University Law Center, providing educational services and student resources. It was constituted as a joint venture between ten leading law schools from around the world, each contributing faculty and students to the center.&lt;ref name="law.utoronto.ca" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esade.edu/carreras_universitarias/eng/ged/internacionalidad/ctls&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center's founding institutions are [[Georgetown University Law Center]], [[University of Toronto]],  [[King's College London]],  [[National University of Singapore]], [[ESADE]],  [[Fribourg University]],  [[Free University of Berlin]],  [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[University of Turin, Faculty of Law|University of Torino]],  [[Melbourne Law School]],  and the [[University of São Paulo]].  The Center also has several affiliate institutions, including [[Bucerius Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctls.georgetown.edu/info/index.html#Newctrtranslegal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616153620/http://ctls.georgetown.edu/info/index.html |archivedate=2009-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CTLS facilities are located at Swan House at 37-39 High Holborn Street in London's legal quarter.

In [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] [[mathematics]], a '''circular shift''' is the operation of rearranging the entries in a [[tuple]], either by moving the final entry to the first position, while shifting all other entries to the next position, or by performing the inverse operation. A circular shift is a special kind of [[cyclic permutation]], which in turn is a special kind of [[permutation]]. Formally, a circular shift is a [[permutation]] σ of the ''n'' entries in the tuple such that either 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)\equiv (i+1)&lt;/math&gt; [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', for all entries ''i = 1, ..., n''
or
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)\equiv (i-1)&lt;/math&gt; [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''n'', for all entries ''i = 1, ..., n''.

The result of repeatedly applying circular shifts to a given tuple are also called the '''circular shifts''' of the tuple.

For example, repeatedly applying circular shifts to the four-tuple (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') successively gives
* (''d'', ''a'', ''b'', ''c''),
* (''c'', ''d'', ''a'', ''b''),
* (''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''a''),
* (''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'') (the original four-tuple),
and then the sequence repeats; this four-tuple therefore has four distinct circular shifts. However, not all ''n''-tuples have ''n'' distinct circular shifts. For instance, the 4-tuple (''a'', ''b'', ''a'', ''b'') only has 2 distinct circular shifts. In general the number of circular shifts of an ''n''-tuple could be any divisor of ''n'', depending on the entries of the tuple.

In [[computer programming]], a '''circular shift''' (or '''bitwise rotation''') is a [[shift operator]] that shifts all bits of its operand. Unlike an [[arithmetic shift]], a circular shift does not preserve a number's sign bit or distinguish a number's [[exponent]] from its [[significand]] (sometimes referred to as the [[Logarithm|mantissa]]). Unlike a [[logical shift]], the vacant bit positions are not filled in with zeros but are filled in with the bits that are shifted out of the sequence.

== Implementing circular shifts ==
Circular shifts are used often in [[cryptography]] in order to permute bit sequences. Unfortunately, many programming languages, including [[C (programming language)|C]], do not have operators or standard functions for circular shifting, even though virtually all [[processors]] have [[bitwise operation]] instructions for it (e.g. [[Intel x86]] has ROL and ROR).
However, some compilers may provide access to the processor instructions by means of [[intrinsic function]]s. In addition, it is possible to write standard ANSI C code that compiles down to the "rotate" assembly language instruction (on CPUs that have such an instruction). Most C compilers recognize the following idiom, and compile it to a single 32-bit rotate instruction.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2007-11/msg01112.html GCC: "Optimize common rotate constructs"]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.mail-archive.com/llvm-commits@cs.uiuc.edu/msg17216.html "Cleanups in ROTL/ROTR DAG combiner code"] mentions that this code supports the "rotate" instruction in the CellSPU
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
/*
 * Shift operations in C are only defined for shift values which are
 * not negative and smaller than sizeof(value) * CHAR_BIT.
 * The mask, used with bitwise-and (&amp;), prevents undefined behaviour
 * when the shift count is 0 or &gt;= the width of unsigned int.
 */

#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;  // for uint32_t, to get 32bit-wide rotates, regardless of the size of int.
#include &lt;limits.h&gt;  // for CHAR_BIT

uint32_t rotl32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) {
    const unsigned int mask = CHAR_BIT*sizeof(value) - 1;
    count &amp;= mask;
    return (value &lt;&lt; count) | (value &gt;&gt; (-count &amp; mask));
}

uint32_t rotr32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) {
    const unsigned int mask = CHAR_BIT*sizeof(value) - 1;
    count &amp;= mask;
    return (value &gt;&gt; count) | (value &lt;&lt; (-count &amp; mask));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This safe and compiler-friendly implementation was developed by [[John Regehr]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1063 Safe, Efficient, and Portable Rotate in C/C++]&lt;/ref&gt; and further polished by Peter Cordes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/776523/224132 Stackoverflow: Best practices for rotates in C/C++]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://stackoverflow.com/a/31488147/224132 Near constant time rotate that does not violate the standards]&lt;/ref&gt;

A simpler version is often seen when the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is limited to the range of 1 to 31 bits:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
uint32_t rotl32 (uint32_t value, unsigned int count) {
    return value&lt;&lt;count | value&gt;&gt;(32-count);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
This version is dangerous because if the &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is 0 or 32, it asks for a 32-bit shift, which is [[undefined behaviour]] in the C language standard.  However, it tends to work anyway, because most microprocessors implement &lt;code&gt;value&gt;&gt;32&lt;/code&gt; as either a 32-bit shift (producing 0) or a 0-bit shift (producing the original &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;), and either one produces the correct result in this application.

For C++, the use of templates can expand the support to all integer types:&lt;source lang=cpp&gt; // https://stackoverflow.com/a/776550/3770260
template &lt;typename INT&gt;
#if __cplusplus &gt; 201100L // Apply constexpr to C++ 11 to ease optimization
constexpr
#endif // See also https://stackoverflow.com/a/7269693/3770260
INT rol(INT val, size_t len) {
#if __cplusplus &gt; 201100L &amp;&amp; _wp_force_unsigned_rotate // Apply unsigned check C++ 11 to make sense
    static_assert(std::is_unsigned&lt;INT&gt;::value,
                  "Rotate Left only makes sense for unsigned types");
#endif
    return (val &lt;&lt; len) | ((unsigned) val &gt;&gt; (-len &amp; (sizeof(INT) * CHAR_BIT - 1)));
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Example==
If the bit sequence 0001 0111 were subjected to a circular shift of one bit position... (see images below)
{|
|
* to the left would yield: 0010 1110
[[Image:Rotate left.svg|thumb|left|300px|Left circular shift.]]
|
* to the right would yield: 1000 1011.
[[Image:Rotate right.svg|thumb|left|300px|Right circular shift.]]
|}
If the bit sequence 1001 0110 were subjected to the following operations:
* left circular shift by 2 positions: 0101 1010
* left circular shift by 3 positions: 1011 0100

[[Cyclic code]]s are a kind of [[block code]] with the property that the circular shift of a codeword will always yield another codeword. This motivates the following general definition: For a [[string (computer science)|string]] ''s'' over an alphabet ''Σ'', let ''shift(s)'' denote the set of circular shifts of ''s'',
and for a set ''L'' of strings, let ''shift''(''L'') denote the set of all circular shifts of strings in ''L''. If ''L'' is a cyclic code, then ''shift''(''L'') ⊆ ''L''; this is a necessary condition for ''L'' being a [[cyclic language]]. The operation ''shift''(''L'') has been studied in [[formal language theory]]. For instance, if ''L'' is a [[context-free language]], then ''shift''(''L'') is again context-free.&lt;ref&gt;T. Oshiba, "Closure property of the family of context-free languages under the cyclic shift operation", Transactions of IECE, '''55D''':119–122, 1972.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Maslov, "Cyclic shift operation for languages", Problems of Information Transmission '''9''':333–338, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, if ''L'' is described by a [[regular expression]] of length ''n'', there is a regular expression of length [[Big O notation|''O'']](''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) describing ''shift''(''L'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | zbl=1176.68105 | last1=Gruber | first1=Hermann | last2=Holzer | first2=Markus | title=Language operations with regular expressions of polynomial size | url=http://www.hermann-gruber.com/data/derivatives-journal.pdf | journal=Theoretical Computer Science | volume=410 | number=35 | pages=3281–3289 | year=2009 | doi=10.1016/j.tcs.2009.04.009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[polymer physics]], the '''coil–globule transition''' is the collapse of a [[macromolecule]] from an expanded coil state through an [[Ideal chain|ideal coil state]] to a collapsed globule state, or vice versa.  The coil–globule transition is of importance in [[biology]] due to the presence of coil-globule transitions in biological macromolecules such as [[protein]]s&lt;ref name="sherman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=E|author2=Haran G|title=Coil-globule transition in the denatured state of a small protein|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|year=2006|volume=103|issue=31|pages=11539–11543|doi=10.1073/pnas.0601395103 |bibcode = 2006PNAS..10311539S |pmc=1544205}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vasilevskaya|first=VV|author2=Khokhlov AR|title=Collapse of a Single DNA Molecule in Poly(Ethylene Glycol) Solutions|journal=Journal of Chemical Physics|year=1995|volume=102|issue=16|pages=6595–6602| bibcode=1995JChPh.102.6595V | doi = 10.1063/1.469375}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also analogous with the swelling behavior of a [[Cross-link|crosslinked]] [[polymer]] [[gel]] and is thus of interest in [[biomedical engineering]] for controlled drug delivery.  A particularly prominent example of a polymer possessing a coil-globule transition of interest in this area is that of [[Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)]](PNIPAAm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu |first=C |author2=Wang X |title=Globule-to-Coil Transition of a Single Homopolymer Chain in Solution |journal=Physical Review Letters |year=1998 |volume=80 |issue=18 |pages=4092–4094 |url=http://ludfc39.u-strasbg.fr/pdflib/polymers/collapse/1998_wu_wang.pdf |accessdate=25 September 2010 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.4092 |bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.4092W |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721022738/http://ludfc39.u-strasbg.fr/pdflib/polymers/collapse/1998_wu_wang.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

In its coil state, the [[radius of gyration]] of the macromolecule scales as its chain length to the three-fifths power.  As it passes through the coil–globule transition, it shifts to scaling as chain length to the half power (at the transition) and finally to the one third power in the collapsed state.&lt;ref name="ox"&gt;{{cite web|title=The globule to coil transition|url=http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/~doye/jon/papers/homop/node8.html|accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The direction of the transition is often specified by the constructions 'coil-to-globule' or 'globule-to-coil' transition.

==Origin==
This transition is associated with the transition of a polymer chain from good solvent behavior through ideal or [[Theta solvent]] behavior to poor solvent behavior.  The canonical coil–globule transition is associated with the [[Upper critical solution temperature]] and the associated Flory theta point.  In this case, collapse occurs with cooling and results from favorable attractive energy of the polymer to itself.  A second type of coil–globule transition is instead associated with the [[lower critical solution temperature]] and its corresponding theta point.  This collapse occurs with increasing temperature and is driven by an unfavorable entropy of mixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simmons|first=DS|author2=Sanchez IC|title=A Model for a Thermally Induced Polymer Coil-to-Globule Transition|journal=Macromolecules|year=2008|volume=41|pages=5885–5889|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ma800151p|accessdate=25 September 2010|doi=10.1021/ma800151p|bibcode = 2008MaMol..41.5885S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of this type is embodied by the polymer PNIPAAM, mentioned above. Coil globule transitions may also be driven by charge effects, in the case of polyelectrolytes.  In this case pH and ionic strength changes within the solution may trigger collapse, with increasing counterion concentration generally leading to collapse in a uniformly charged polyelectrolyte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulrich|first=S|author2=Laguecir A|title=Titration of hydrophobic polyelectrolytes using Monte Carlo simulations|journal=Journal of Chemical Physics|year=2005|volume=122|pages=094911 | doi = 10.1063/1.1856923 |bibcode = 2005JChPh.122i4911U }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In polyampholytes containing both positive and negative charges, the opposite may hold true.

'''Crime mapping''' is used by analysts in [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]] to map, visualize, and analyze crime incident patterns.  It is a key component of [[crime analysis]] and the [[CompStat]] policing strategy.  Mapping crime, using [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), allows crime analysts to identify [[Crime hotspots|crime hot spots]], along with other trends and patterns.

==Overview==
Using GIS, crime analysts can overlay other datasets such as [[census]] [[demographics]], locations of [[pawnbroker|pawn shops]], schools, etc., to better understand the underlying causes of [[crime]] and help [[police|law enforcement]] administrators to devise strategies to deal with the problem.  GIS is also useful for law enforcement operations, such as allocating police officers and dispatching to [[9-1-1|emergencies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/library/brochures/pdfs/crime-analysis.pdf|title=Crime Analysis: GIS Solutions for Intelligence-Led Policing|last=esri|first=|date=|website=esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Underlying theories that help explain spatial behavior of criminals include [[environmental criminology]], which was devised in the 1980s by Patricia and Paul Brantingham,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Environmental Criminology|year=1981|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=0-88133-539-8|editor-last=Brantingham|editor-first=Paul J.|editor2-last=Brantingham|editor2-first=Patricia L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[routine activity theory]], developed by Lawrence Cohen and Marcus Felson and originally published in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Lawrence E.|last2=Felson|first2=Marcus|title=Social change and crime rate trends: A routine activity approach|journal=American Sociological Review|year=1979|volume=44|issue=4|pages=588–607|doi=10.2307/2094589|publisher=American Sociological Association|jstor=2094589}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rational choice theory (criminology)|rational choice theory]], developed by Ronald V. Clarke and Derek Cornish, originally published in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cornish | first=Derek | last2=Clarke | first2=Ronald V. | title=The Reasoning Criminal | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1986 | isbn=3-540-96272-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, crime mapping and analysis has incorporated spatial data analysis techniques that add [[statistics|statistical]] rigor and address inherent limitations of spatial data, including spatial [[autocorrelation]] and spatial heterogeneity.  Spatial data analysis helps one analyze crime data and better understand why and not just where crime is occurring.

Research into computer-based crime mapping started in 1986, when the [[National Institute of Justice]] (NIJ) funded a project in the [[Chicago Police Department]] to explore crime mapping as an adjunct to [[community policing]]. That project was carried out by the CPD in conjunction with the Chicago Alliance for Neighborhood Safety, the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]], and [[Northwestern University]], reported on in the book, ''Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maltz|first=Michael D.|last2=Gordon|first2=Andrew C.|last3=Friedman|first3=Warren|title=Mapping Crime in Its Community Setting: Event Geography Analysis|year=2000|origyear=1990|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=0-387-97381-8|url=http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/forr/pdf/crimjust/mappingcrime.pdf|edition=Internet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of this project prompted NIJ to initiate the Drug Market Analysis Program (with the appropriate acronym D-MAP) in five cities, and the techniques these efforts developed led to the spread of crime mapping throughout the US and elsewhere, including the [[New York City Police Department]]'s [[CompStat]].

==Applications==
Crime analysts use crime mapping and analysis to help law enforcement management (e.g. the police chief) to make better decisions, target resources, and formulate strategies, as well as for tactical analysis (e.g. crime forecasting, [[geographic profiling]]).  [[New York City]] does this through the [[CompStat]] approach, though that way of thinking deals more with the short term.  There are other, related approaches with terms including Information-led policing, [[Intelligence-led policing]], [[Problem-oriented policing]], and [[Community policing]].  In some law enforcement agencies, crime analysts work in civilian positions, while in other agencies, crime analysts are sworn officers.

From a research and [[public policy|policy]] perspective, crime mapping is used to understand patterns of [[prison|incarceration]] and [[recidivism]], help target resources and programs, evaluate [[Crime prevention through environmental design|crime prevention]] or crime reduction programs (e.g. Project Safe Neighborhoods, Weed &amp; Seed and as proposed in ''[[Broken windows theory|Fixing Broken Windows]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelling|first=George|last2=Coles|first2=Catherine|title=Fixing Broken Windows: Restoring Order and Reducing Crime in Our Communities|isbn=0-684-83738-2|year=1997|publisher=Simon &amp;amp; Schuster|place=New York|origyear=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and further understanding of causes of crime.

The boom of internet technologies, particularly web-based geographic information system (GIS) technologies, is opening new opportunities for use of crime mapping to support crime prevention. Research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leong|first=Kelvin.|last2=Chan|first2=Stephen|title=A content analysis of web-based crime mapping in the world's top 100 highest GDP cities|journal=Crime Prevention and Community Safety|year=2013|volume=15|pages=1–22|doi=10.1057/cpcs.2012.11|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that the functions provided in web-based crime mapping are less than in most traditional crime mapping software. In conclusion, existing works of web-based crime mapping focus on supporting community policing rather than analytical functions such as pattern analysis and prediction.

The term ‘'''critical spatial practice'''’ refers to forms of design practice between art and architecture. [[Jane Rendell]] introduced therm in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, ‘A Place Between Art, Architecture and Critical Theory’, Proceedings to Place and Location (Tallinn, Estonia, 2003), pp. 221-33.&lt;/ref&gt; Rendell later consolidated and developed the term as one that defined practices located at a three-way intersection: between theory and practice, public and private, and art and architecture. For Rendell, critical spatial practice is informed by Michel de Certeau’s [[The Practice of Everyday Life]] (1980, translated into English in 1984),&lt;ref&gt;Certeau, Michel De, The Practice of Everyday Life (University of California Press, 2011) &lt;http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520271456&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Henri Lefebvre]]’s The Production of Space (1974, translated into English in 1991),&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, Henri, The Production of Space (Wiley-Blackwell, 1991) &lt;http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0631181776.html&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the critical theory of the Frankfurt School,&lt;ref&gt;	Corradetti, Claudio, ‘Frankfurt School and Critical Theory | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy’, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Rome, Italy: Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy) &lt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/frankfur/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; but her definition aims to transpose the key qualities of critical theory – self-reflection and social transformation – into practice. In Rendell’s work, critical spatial practices are those that question and transform the social conditions of the sites into which they intervene, as well as test the boundaries and procedures of their own disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, Art and Architecture (London: IB Tauris, 2006), pp. 1–2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 66 and 191. &lt;http://www.janerendell.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Critical_Spatial_Practice.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rendell, Jane, ‘Critical Spatial Practice as Parrhesia’, MaHKUscript. Journal of Fine Art Research, 1 (2016) &lt;https://doi.org/10.5334/mjfar.13&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


Other theorists and practitioners have since worked with the term, evolving it in different directions. For example, there was the reading group and blog spot initiated by Nicholas Brown in the early 2000s, which came out of discussions around Brown’s own artistic walking practice.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Nicholas, ‘Critical Spatial Practice’, Critical Spatial Practice, 2006 &lt;http://www.walkinginplace.org/iprh/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senn, Nicholas, ‘Critical Spatial Practice: January 2006’, Critical Spatial Practice, 2006 &lt;http://criticalspatialpractice.blogspot.co.uk/2006_01_01_archive.html&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Nikolaus Hirsch and [[Markus Miessen]] started a book series with Sternberg Press called Critical Spatial Practice, which focused on architectural discourse and practice. In the first publication, they asked, "What is Critical Spatial Practice?"&lt;ref&gt;Miessen, Markus, and Nikolaus Hirsch, What Is Critical Spatial Practice?, Critical Spatial Practice 1 (Sternberg Press, 2012) &lt;http://www.sternberg-&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Hirsch and Miessen set up a website site called criticalspatialpractice.org to archive their work in this area since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Miessen, Markus, ‘Architecture and Critical Spatial Practice (ACSP)’, Critical Spatial Practice &lt;http://criticalspatialpractice.org/&gt; [accessed 17 May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The MaHKUscript, Journal of Fine Art Research published a special issue on critical spatial practice in 2016, where many of the contributors enact critical spatial practices concerned with political and ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;Slager, Henk, ‘Critical Spatial Practice’, MaHKUscript. Journal of Fine Art Research, 1 (2016) &lt;https://doi.org/10.5334/mjfar.14&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Impact evaluation]] of [[fair trade]] systems, like [[cost-benefit analysis]], start with the premise that any intervention in an economic system has various impacts throughout that system: some significant, many small; some costs, some benefits; some people benefit, others are harmed. Impact evaluations aim to identify costs and benefits throughout the system, then quantify them, so that people do not make unwarranted claims of impact and so that informed decisions can be made. 

The [[World Bank]] and Inter Bank in America have developed guidelines, but analysis is considered particularly difficult with developing country agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Winters, P., Alessandro Maffioli and Lina Salazar, ‘Introduction to the Special Feature: Evaluating the Impact of Agricultural Projects in Developing Countries’ Journal of Agricultural Economics, Vol. 62, No. 2, 2011, 393–402 doi: 10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00296.x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winters, P., Salazar, L. and Maffioli, A. ‘Designing impact evaluations for agricultural projects’, Impact Evaluation Guidelines, Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-198. (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2010). Accessed at http://www.iadb.org/document.cfm?id=35529432&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelucci, M. and Di Maro, V. Project Evaluation and Spillover Effects. Impact Evaluation Guidelines, Strategy Development Division, Technical Notes No. IDB-TN-136 (Washington, DC: Inter-American Development Bank, 2010). Accessed at http://www-personal.umich.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Clemens and Gabriel Demombynes, ‘When Does Rigorous Impact Evaluation Make a Difference? The Case of the Millennium Villages’, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 5477, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Griffiths has examined the additional problems that arise when analysing the impact of Fairtrade interventions, arising from the way it is organized.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics: Volume 105, Issue 3 (2012), Page 357-373 (DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Studies==
Impact studies require study of the counterfactual, using [[control group]]s to ensure that an impact is the result of the intervention being studied, which is often impossible and always difficult with Fairtrade because of the way that Fairtrade is organized, notably because the Fairtrade farmers and cooperatives are selected from the richer and more efficient, and because the non-Fairtrade farmers may be harmed by Fairtrade. These problems arise with both case studies and more general surveys, and are particularly intractable when the appropriate control group is in another country. There have been virtually no base period studies, to determine the position before a cooperative joined Fairtrade, so it is seldom possible to claim that the farmers in a cooperative are better off or have more self-esteem because of Fairtrade, rather than because Fairtrade selects efficient cooperatives with educated, efficient, well-off farmers.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The possibility that all groups of farmers have increased incomes because of higher world prices, changed exchange rates etc. is difficult to tackle. As most of the extra money paid by consumers is taken by firms in rich countries or is spent on added costs incurred in meeting Fairtrade standards, it is seldom possible to identify direct financial benefit to farmers, and the studies concentrate on non-monetary benefits, like improvement in self-esteem or the creation of [[community development]] projects. These are difficult to measure, and it is particularly difficult to measure these non-monetary benefits in control groups of local non-Fairtrade farmers, the extent to which non-Fairtrade farmers lose self-esteem, etc. because they are excluded from Fair trade impact studies, for instance, and even more difficult to measure any effects on non-Fairtrade farmers in other, poorer, countries. The decision on which such measures to include introduces a bias: it may be asked whether there are other non-money costs or benefits that might be included in the studies which would give answers less favourable to Fairtrade.

An unpublished consultancy report prepared for Fairtrade &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, V., &amp; Pound, B.: 2009, The Last Ten Years: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature on the Impact of Fairtrade. Retrieved from http://www.fairtrade.org.uk/resources/natural_resources_institute.aspx &lt;/ref&gt; found only 33 studies that met their own criteria (not those of the World Bank or Inter-American Bank) for impact studies. These 33 included unpublished undergraduate and masters’ dissertations, unpublished theses, articles by employees or members of Fairtrade cooperatives, several reports on the same cooperatives, and one report cited under two different titles. 

Griffiths&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics: Volume 105, Issue 3 (2012), Page 357-373 (DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that even this is optimistic: there are very few studies that examine any of the costs identified by critics of Fairtrade in the [[Fair trade debate]], and fewer still that attempt to quantify them. There are few mentions in the literature of the biggest financial costs and benefits, the extra price paid by consumers and the extra profit made by companies in rich countries, and fewer attempts to quantify these.  

One impact, the  amount of money going to businesses in rich countries rather than to Third World producers, is addressed in only a handful of studies.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N. (2010). “Empowering Coffee Traders? The Coffee Value Chain from Nicaraguan Fair Trade Farmers to Finnish Consumers.” Journal of Business Ethics , 97:257-270&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kilian, B., Jones, C., Pratt, L., &amp; Villalobos, A. (2006). “Is Sustainable Agriculture a Viable Strategy to Improve Farm Income in Central America? A Case Study on Coffee”. Journal of Business Research , 59(3), 322–330.&lt;/ref&gt; These show that in some cases 90% to 99.5% of the extra money paid by consumers is kept as extra profit by firms in rich countries but cannot show that this is typical. The conclusion is rather that secretiveness prevents impact analysis of the full Fairtrade system. Few studies analyse how much extra money is received by the cooperatives, what it is spent on, how much is taken by managers of cooperatives and how much reaches the farmers. Few studies discuss the costs identified in the [[Fair trade debate]]. 

There are, however, case studies of Fairtrade cooperatives which do not attempt to be impact studies, identifying and quantifying all positive and negative impacts, but are, rather, examinations of how subsections of the system operate, usually single Fairtrade cooperatives and sometimes one Fairtrade product in a country - valuable but different research.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Even if twenty or thirty studies which met the impact evaluation criteria could be identified, it would not be possible to generalize from them because it is not claimed that they are typical.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} The studies are not of randomly selected cooperatives. They are concentrated on better known, more successful and well established ones, and there are few which examine the problems of cooperatives which have recently joined Fairtrade or of the least successful quartile of Fairtrade cooperatives.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"/&gt;

==''Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology and Controversy''==
''Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology'' is a feminist open access journal published in collaboration with the Fembot Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=JOURNAL-TOC|title=Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology|url=http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/index.php?action=search&amp;subAction=hits&amp;journalID=27454&amp;userQueryID=14401&amp;high=1&amp;ps=30&amp;page=1&amp;items=0&amp;journal_filter=0&amp;journalby=0|website=JournalTOC:|publisher=Heriott-Watt University|accessdate=31 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been housed at [[Knight Library|UO Libraries]] and now is administered through the University of Maryland.

The '''Franz–Keldysh effect''' is a change in [[optical absorption]] by a [[semiconductor]] when an [[electric field]] is applied.  The effect is named after the German physicist [[Walter Franz]] and Russian physicist [[Leonid Keldysh]] (nephew of [[Mstislav Keldysh]]).

Karl W. Böer observed first the shift of the optical [[absorption edge]] with electric fields &lt;ref&gt;K. W. Böer, H. J. Hänsch, and U. Kümmel, Naturwiss. 19, 460 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; during the discovery of high-field domains&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer Monatsber. Deutsch.Akad. d.Wissensch. 1,272 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; and named this the Franz-effect.&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer Z. für Physik, 155,184 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, when the English translation of the Keldysh paper became available, he corrected this to the Franz–Keldysh effect.&lt;ref&gt;Karl W. Böer H.J. Hänsch and U. Kümmel Zeitschr. für Physik 155, 170 (1959)&lt;/ref&gt;

As originally conceived, the Franz–Keldysh effect is the result of [[wavefunction]]s "leaking" into the band gap. When an electric field is applied, the [[electron]] and [[electron hole|hole]] wavefunctions become [[Airy function]]s rather than plane waves. The Airy function includes a "tail" which extends into the classically forbidden band gap. According to [[Fermi's Golden Rule]], the more overlap there is between the wavefunctions of a free electron and a hole, the stronger the optical absorption will be. The Airy tails slightly overlap even if the electron and hole are at slightly different potentials (slightly different physical locations along the field). The absorption spectrum now includes a tail at energies below the band gap and some oscillations above it. This explanation does, however, omit the effects of [[exciton]]s, which may dominate optical properties near the band gap.

The Franz–Keldysh effect occurs in uniform, bulk semiconductors, unlike the [[quantum-confined Stark effect]], which requires a quantum well. Both are used for [[Electro-absorption modulator]]s. The Franz–Keldysh effect usually requires hundreds of [[volt]]s, limiting its usefulness with conventional electronics – although this is not the case for commercially available Franz–Keldysh-effect electro-absorption modulators that use a waveguide geometry to guide the optical carrier.

== Effect on modulation spectroscopy ==
The [[absorption coefficient]] is related to the [[dielectric constant]] (especially the complex term). From Maxwell's equation, we can easily find out the relation,

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \frac{2\omega k_0} {c}={{\omega\kappa_2} \over{n_0c}}.&lt;/math&gt;

We will consider the direct transition of an electron from the valence band to the [[conduction band]] induced by the [[Ray (optics)|incident light]] in a [[perfect crystal]] and try to take into account of the change of absorption coefficient for each Hamiltonian with a probable interaction like electron-photon, electron-hole, external field. These approach follows from.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;C. Hamaguchi, "Basic Semiconductor Physics", Springer (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; We put the 1st purpose on the theoretical background of Franz–Keldysh effect and third-derivative modulation spectroscopy.

===One electron Hamiltonian with EM (electro magnetic) field===
&lt;math&gt;H = {1 \over 2m} (p+eA)^2 + V(r)&lt;/math&gt; (A: [[vector potential]], V(r): periodic potential)

&lt;math&gt;A = {1 \over 2} A_0 e [e^{i(k_p \cdot r - \omega t)}+e^{-i(k_p \cdot r - \omega t)}]&lt;/math&gt;
(k&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and e are the wave vector of em field and [[unit vector]].)

Neglecting the square term &lt;math&gt;A^2&lt;/math&gt; and using the relation &lt;math&gt;A\cdot p  = p \cdot A&lt;/math&gt; within the Coulomb gauge &lt;math&gt;\nabla\cdot A=0&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain

&lt;math&gt;H \sim {p^2 \over 2m} + V(r) + {e \over m} A \cdot p&lt;/math&gt;

Then using the [[Bloch wave|Bloch function]] &lt;math&gt;|jk\rangle = e^{ik \cdot r} u_{jk}(r)&lt;/math&gt; (j= v, c that mean valence band, conduction band)

the transition probability can be obtained such that

&lt;math&gt;w_{cv} = {2 \pi \over \hbar} |\langle ck'| {e \over m} A \cdot p |vk\rangle|^2\delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;= {\pi e^2 \over 2 \hbar m^2}A_0 ^2 |\langle ck'|exp(ik_p \cdot r)e \cdot p |vk\rangle |^2 \delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]&lt;/math&gt;(&lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; means [[wave vector]] of light)
&lt;math&gt;e \cdot p_{cv} = {1 \over V} \int_v e^{i(k_p +k-k') \cdot r} {u^*}_{ck'}(r)e \cdot (p+ \hbar k)u_{vk} (r) d^3r&lt;/math&gt;

Power dissipation of the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] per unit time and unit volume gives rise to following equation

&lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega w_{cv} = {1 \over 2} \omega \kappa_2 \epsilon_0 {E_0}^2&lt;/math&gt;

From the relation between the [[electric field]] and the vector potential, &lt;math&gt;{E} = -{{\partial A} \over {\partial t}}&lt;/math&gt;, we may put &lt;math&gt;E_0 = \omega A_0&lt;/math&gt;

And finally we can get the imaginary part of the dielectric constant and surely the absorption coefficient.
&lt;math&gt;\kappa = {{\pi e^2} \over {\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}}\sum_{k,k'} |e \cdot p_{cv}|^2 \delta[\Epsilon _c (k') - \Epsilon _v (k) - \hbar \omega]\delta_{kk'} &lt;/math&gt;

===2-body(electron-hole) Hamiltonian with EM field===
An electron in the [[valence band]](wave vector k) is excited by photon absorption into the conduction band(the wave vector at the band is &lt;math&gt;k'=k_e&lt;/math&gt;) and leaves a hole in the valence band(the wave vector of the hole is &lt;math&gt;k_h=-k&lt;/math&gt;). In this case, we include the electron-hole interaction.(&lt;math&gt;V(r_e -r_h)&lt;/math&gt;)

Thinking about the direct transition, &lt;math&gt;|k_e|, |k_h|&lt;/math&gt; is almost same. But Assume the slight difference of the momentum due to the photon absorption is not ignored and the bound state- electron-hole pair is very weak and the [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] approximation is valid for the treatment. Then we can make up the following procedure, the wave function and wave vectors of the electron and hole

&lt;math&gt; \Psi_{ij} (r_e, r_h) = \psi_{ik_e}(r_e) \psi_{jk_h} (r_h)&lt;/math&gt; (i, j are the band indices, and r&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, r&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;, k&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; are the coordinates and wave vectors of the electron and hole respectively)

And we can take a total wave vector '''K''' such that

&lt;math&gt;K = k_e + k_h.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;H=H_e + H_h +V(r_e -r_h)&lt;/math&gt;

Then, Bloch functions of the electron and hole can be constructed with the phase term &lt;math&gt;A^{n,K}_{cv}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K}(r_e,r_h) = \sum_{c,k_e,v,k_h}A^{n,K}_{cv}(k_e,k_h) \psi_{ck_e}(r_e) \psi_{vk_h} (r_h)&lt;/math&gt;

If V slowly over the distance of the integral, the term can be treated like following.

&lt;math&gt;[\Epsilon_c(k_e) + \Epsilon_h(k_h)+V(r_e-r_h)-\epsilon]A^{n,K}_{c,V}(k_e,k_h) =0(*)&lt;/math&gt;

here we assume that the conduction and valence bands are parabolic with scalar masses and that at the top of the valence band &lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_v =0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e.
&lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_c(k_e) = {{\hbar^2k_e^2} \over {2m_e}}+\Epsilon_G, \Epsilon_h(k_h)={{\hbar^2k_h^2} \over {2m_h}}&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\Epsilon_G&lt;/math&gt; is the energy gap)

Now, The [[Fourier transform]] of &lt;math&gt;A^{n,K}_{cv}(k_e,k_h)&lt;/math&gt; and above (*), the effective mass equation for the exciton may be written as

&lt;math&gt;[(-{\hbar^2 \over 2M}\nabla^2)+(-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} \nabla^2-{e^2 \over 4\pi\epsilon r})]\Phi^{n,k}(r,R) = [\Epsilon-\Epsilon_G] \cdot \Phi^{n,K}(r,R)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;r=r_e-r_h, R={{m_e r_e + m_h r_h}\over {m_e+m_h}}, {1 \over \mu} = {1\over m_e}+{1 \over m_h}, M= m_e + m_h &lt;/math&gt;

then the solution of eq is given by

&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K} (r,R) = \Psi_K(R)\psi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Psi^{n,K} (r,R) = {1 \over \sqrt {V}}exp(iK \cdot R) \phi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\phi_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; is called the envelope function of an exciton. The ground state of the exciton is given in analogy to the [[hydrogen atom]].

then, the [[dielectric function]] is

&lt;math&gt;\kappa_2(\omega) = {\pi e^2 \over{\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}} |e \cdot p_{cv}|^2\sum_{\lambda} |\phi_\lambda(0)|^2 \delta(\Epsilon_G + \Epsilon_\lambda - \hbar\omega)(**) &lt;/math&gt;

detailed calculation is in.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Franz–Keldysh effect means an electron in a valence band can be allowed to be excited into a conduction band by absorbing a photon with its energy below the band gap. Now we're thinking about the effective mass equation for the [[Kinematics|relative motion]] of [[electron hole]] pair when the external field is applied to a crystal. But we are not to take a mutual potential of electron-hole pair into the Hamiltonian.

When the Coulomb interaction is neglected, the effective mass equation is

&lt;math&gt;[-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu} \nabla^2 - eE \cdot r ] \psi(r) = \epsilon \psi(r)&lt;/math&gt;.

And the equation can be expressed,

&lt;math&gt;[-{\hbar^2 \over 2\mu}{d^2 \over {dr_i^2}}-eE_ir_i-\epsilon_i]\psi(r_i) = 0&lt;/math&gt;( where &lt;math&gt;\mu_i&lt;/math&gt; is the value in the direction of the principal axis of the reduced effective mass tensor)

Using change of variables:

&lt;math&gt;\hbar\theta_i = ({{e^2E_i^2\hbar^2} \over {2\mu_i}})^{1/3}, \xi_i={{\epsilon_i+eE_ir_i}\over{\hbar\theta_i}} &lt;/math&gt;

then the solution is

&lt;math&gt;\psi(\xi_x,\xi_y,\xi_z)=C_x C_y C_z Ai(-\xi_x)Ai(-\xi_y)Ai(-\xi_z)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C_i = {{\sqrt{e|E_i|}}\over{\hbar\theta}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, &lt;math&gt;E_y=E_z=0, E_x&lt;/math&gt; the solution is given by

&lt;math&gt;\psi(x,y,z)=C \cdot Ai({{-eEx-\epsilon+\hbar^2k_y^2/2\mu_y + \hbar^2k_z^2/2\mu_z} \over {\hbar\theta_x}})&lt;/math&gt;

The dielectric constant can be obtained inserting this equation to the (**) (above block), and changing the summation with respect to λ to &lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d\epsilon_xd\epsilon_yd\epsilon_z&lt;/math&gt;

The integral with respect to &lt;math&gt;d\epsilon_x d\epsilon_y&lt;/math&gt; is given by the joint [[density of states]] for the two-D band. (the Joint density of states is nothing but the meaning of DOS of both electron and hole at the same time.)

&lt;math&gt;{\kappa(\omega, E)} = {{\pi^2} \over{\epsilon_0 m^2 \omega^2}}|e \cdot p_cv|^2 {{e|E_x|} \over {\hbar\theta_x^2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{J^{2D}}_{cv}(\hbar\omega - \epsilon_G - \epsilon_x) \cdot|Ai(-{{\epsilon_x} \over {\hbar\theta}})^2 |d\epsilon_x.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J^{2D}_{cv}(\hbar\omega) = {(\mu_y\mu_z)^{1/2} \over \pi\hbar^2}, \hbar\omega &gt; \epsilon_G. &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=0, \hbar\omega &lt; \epsilon_G.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we put &lt;math&gt;\eta = {{\hbar\omega - \epsilon_G} \over {\hbar\theta_x}}&lt;/math&gt;

And think about the case we find &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;&lt;0 &lt;/math&gt;, thus &lt;math&gt;\hbar\omega &lt;&lt; \epsilon_G&lt;/math&gt; with the asymptotic solution for the [[Airy function]] in this limit.

Finally,&lt;math&gt;\kappa _2(\omega, E_x) = {1/2}\kappa_2(\omega)exp[{-4 \over 3}({{\epsilon_G-\hbar\omega} \over {\hbar\theta_x}})]&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the dielectric function for the [[Photon|incident photon]] energy below the band gap exist! These results indicate that absorption occurs for an incident photon.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4424">'''Gal's accurate tables''' is a method devised by [[Shmuel Gal]] to provide accurate values of [[special functions]] using a [[lookup table]] and [[interpolation]]. It is a fast and efficient method for generating values of functions like the [[exponential function|exponential]] or the [[trigonometric functions]] to within last-bit 
accuracy for almost all argument values without using extended precision arithmetic.

The main idea in Gal's accurate tables is a different tabulation for the special function being computed. Commonly, the range is divided into several subranges, each with precomputed values and correction formulae.  To compute the function, look up the closest point and compute a correction as a function of the distance.

Gal's idea is to not precompute equally spaced values, but rather to [[perturbation theory|perturb]] the points ''x'' so that both ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') are very nearly exactly representable in the chosen numeric format.  By searching approximately 1000 values on either side of the desired value ''x'', a value can be found such that ''f''(''x'') can be represented with less than ±1/2000 bit of [[rounding error]].  If the correction is also computed to ±1/2000 bit of accuracy (which does not require extra floating-point precision as long as the correction is less than 1/2000 the magnitude of the stored value ''f''(''x''), ''and'' the computed correction is more than ±1/1000 of a bit away from exactly half a bit (the difficult rounding case), then it is known whether the exact function value should be rounded up or down.

The technique provides an efficient way to compute the function value to within ±1/1000 least-significant bit, i.e. 10 extra bits of precision.  If this approximation is more than ±1/1000 of a bit away from exactly midway between two representable values (which happens all but 2/1000 of the time, i.e. 99.8% of the time), then the correctly rounded result is clear.

Combined with an extended-precision fallback algorithm, this can compute the correctly rounded result in very reasonable ''average'' time.

2/1000 (0.2%) of the time, a higher-precision function evaluation is required to resolve the rounding uncertainty, but this is infrequent enough that it has little effect on the average calculation time.

The problem of generating function values which are accurate to the last bit is known as the [[table-maker's dilemma]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2177">'''Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya''' ([[Arabic]]: هجر امذيبية) is an ancient settlement that date back to the kingdom of Hadramawt in [[Nisab District|Nisab]] district of [[Shabwah Governorate]] in [[Yemen]]. The site [[necropolis]] (100 m large) revealed elaborate and extraordinary burial objects. Though the findings was concentrated in a small portion of the general area. Four burials only were excavated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
[[File:Shabwa2.jpg||thumb|250px| Silver ladle found in one of the burials]]
The city sequence is divided into 5 phases based on major changes of the site architecture. The initial phase on the hill top is usually dated to first centuries AD and was dominated by a single building constructed using characteristic technique of pre-Islamic south Arabia. Only one room in the structure with preserved floor exist. It appears, from the fill beneath the plaster floor, that at one point, the building was renewed. Glacis (4–6 m wide) was also constructed on the site, however whether it encircle the entire tell is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Two seasons at Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya, Yemen, Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (AEE):  P.93&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the surface layers of the necropolis, the tombs appear to span over several centuries. Grave 3 is dated approximately between 1st to 4th century AD. And the artifacts found there shows detectable Roman artistic influence.

Four burials had been excavated in the site necropolis, only grave 3 was intact, and it yielded great amount of funerary possessions. Which apparently belonged to either an upper class individual, or rather a soldier as suggested by the presence of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KellsFol034rXRhoDet3.jpeg|right|thumb|250px|Detail of elaborate interlace from the [[Book of Kells]].]]
In the [[visual arts]], '''interlace''' is a decorative element found in  [[medieval art]]. In interlace, bands or portions of other [[motif (visual arts)|motif]]s are looped, [[braid]]ed, and [[knot]]ted in complex [[geometry|geometric]] patterns, often to fill a space. Interlacing is common in the [[Migration period art]] of [[Northern Europe]], especially in the [[Insular art]] of Ireland and the British Isles and [[Norse art]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] and in [[Islamic interlace patterns|Islamic art]].

Intricate braided and interlaced patterns, called ''plaits'' in British usage, are found in late [[Roman art]] in many parts of Europe, in [[mosaic]] floors and other media.  [[Coptic art|Coptic manuscripts and textiles]] of 5th- and 6th-century Christian Egypt are decorated with broad-strand ribbon interlace ornament bearing a "striking resemblance" to the earliest types of knotwork found in the [[Insular art]] manuscripts of Ireland and the  [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name="M1"&gt;Mitchell et al. 1977, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and application==

[[File:Torque de Foxados - Detalle.JPG|thumb|left|Interlace and [[rotational symmetry]]: Iron Age ''Torque de Foxados'', Museo de [[Pontevedra]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]]]

===Northern Europe===
Interlace is a key feature of the "Style II" [[animal style]] decoration of Migration Period art, and is found widely across Northern Europe, and was carried by the [[Lombards]] into Northern Italy.  Typically the long "ribbons" eventually terminate in an animal's head.  By about 700 it becomes less common in most of Europe, but continues to develop in the British Isles and [[Scandinavia]], where it is found on metalwork, woodcarving, [[runestone]]s, [[high cross]]es, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the 7th to 12th centuries.  Artist [[George Bain (artist)|George Bain]] has characterised the early Insular knotwork found in the 7th-century [[Book of Durrow]] and the [[Durham Cathedral]] [[Gospel Book Fragment (Durham Cathedral Library, A. II. 10.)|Gospel Book fragment]] as "broken and rejoined" braids.&lt;ref&gt;Bain 1973, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Whether Coptic braid patterns were transmitted directly to [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] [[monastery|monasteries]] from the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] or came via [[Lombards|Lombardic]] Italy is uncertain.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt; Art historian [[James Johnson Sweeney]] argued for direct communication between the [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] of [[Early history of Ireland|Early Christian Ireland]] and the Coptic monasteries of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop 2001, p.270&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This new style featured elongated beasts intertwined into symmetrical shapes, and can be dated to the mid-7th century based on the accepted dating of examples in the [[Sutton Hoo]] treasure.&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;   The most elaborate interlaced [[zoomorphism|zoomorphics]] occur in [[Viking Age]] art of the [[Urnes style]] (arising before 1050), where tendrils of foliate designs intertwine with the stylized animals.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Campbell 1980, pp. 150-151&lt;/ref&gt;

The full-flowering of Northern European interlace occurred in the [[Insular art]] of the British Isles, where the animal style ornament of Northern Europe blended with ribbon knotwork and Christian influences in such works as the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the [[Cross of Cong]].&lt;ref name="M1" /&gt;  Whole [[carpet page]]s were illuminated with abstract patterns, including much use of interlace, and stone [[high cross]]es combined interlace panels with figurative ones.  Insular interlace was copied in continental Europe, closely in the [[Franco-Saxon school]] of the 8th to 11th centuries, and less so in other [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] schools of illumination, where the tendency was to [[foliage|foliate]] decorative forms.  In [[Romanesque art]] these became typical, and the interlace generally much less complex.  Some animal forms are also found.

===Islamic art===
{{main|Islamic interlace patterns}}
Geometric interlacing patterns are common in Islamic ornament. They can be considered a particular type of [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]]. [[Umayyad architecture|Umayyad architectural]] elements such as floor [[mosaics]], window grilles, carvings and wall paintings, and decorative metal work of the 8th to 10th centuries are followed by the intricate interlacings common in later medieval [[Islamic art]]. Interlaced elaborations are also found in [[Kufic]] [[calligraphy]].

===Southern Europe===
Interlace and knotwork are often found in [[Byzantine art]], continuing Roman usage, but they are not given great prominence. One notable example of a widespread local usage of interlace is the [[Croatian wattle|three-ribbon interlace]] found in the [[Early middle ages|early]] [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|medieval Croatia]] on stone carvings from the 9th to 11th centuries.

'''Islamic ethics''' (أخلاق إسلامية), defined as "good character," historically took shape gradually from the 7th century and was finally established by the 11th century.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; It was eventually shaped as a successful amalgamation of the [[Qur'an]]ic teachings, the teachings of the Prophet [[Muhammad]], the [[precedent]]s of [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] (see [[Sharia]] and [[Fiqh]]), the [[Jahiliyyah|pre-Islamic]] [[Arab]]ian tradition, and non-Arabic elements (including [[Persia]]n and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ideas) embedded in or integrated with a generally [[Islam]]ic structure.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq" /&gt; Although Muhammad's preaching produced a "radical change in [[moral value]]s based on the sanctions of the new religion and the present religion, and fear of God and of the Last Judgment", the tribal practice of Arabs did not completely die out. Later [[Muslim scholars]] expanded the religious ethic of the Qur'an and [[Hadith]] in immense detail.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Akhlaq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Foundational motives==
The foundational source in the gradual codification of Islamic ethics was the Muslim understanding and interpretations of the Qur'an and practices of Muhammad. Its meaning has always been in context of active submission to God (Arabic: [[Allah]]), performed by the community in unison. The motive force in Islamic ethics is the notion that every human being is called to "command the good and forbid the [[evil]]" in all spheres of life. Muslims understand the role of Muhammad as attempting to facilitate this submission. Another key factor in the field of Islamic ethics is the belief that mankind has been [[fitrah|granted the faculty to discern]] God's will and to abide by it. This faculty most crucially involves reflecting over the meaning of existence. Therefore, regardless of their environment, humans are believed to have a [[moral responsibility]] to submit to God's will and to follow Islam (as demonstrated in the Qur'an, {{Quran-usc-range|7|172|173}}).&lt;ref name="EncEthic"&gt;{{harvnb|Becker|Becker|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This natural inclination is, according to the Qur'an, subverted by mankind's focus on material success: such focus first presents itself as a need for basic survival or security, but then tends to manifest into a desire to become distinguished amongst one's peers. Ultimately, the focus on [[materialism]], according to the Islamic texts, hampers with the innate reflection as described above, resulting in a state of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' or "heedlessness."&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;
Muslims believe that Muhammad, like other [[prophets in Islam]], was sent by God to remind human beings of their moral responsibility, and challenge those ideas in society which opposed submission to God. According to Kelsay, this challenge was directed against five main characteristics of pre-Islamic Arabia:&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

# The division of Arabs into varying tribes (based upon blood and kinship). This categorization was confronted by the ideal of a unified community based upon [[taqwa|Islamic piety]], an "''[[ummah]]'';"
# The acceptance of the worship of a multitude of deities besides Allah - a view challenged by strict [[Tawhid|Islamic monotheism]], which dictates that Allah has no partner in worship nor any equal;
# The trait of ''muruwwa'' ([[Masculine|manliness]]), which Islam discouraged, instead emphasizing on the traits of humility and piety;
# The focus on achieving fame or establishing a legacy, which was replaced by the concept that mankind would be called to account before God on the [[Qiyamah|day of resurrection]];
# The reverence of and compliance with ancestral traditions, a practice challenged by Islam — which instead assigned primacy to submitting to God and following revelation.

These changes lay in the reorientation of society as regards to identity and life of the Muslim belief, [[world view]], and the hierarchy of values. From the viewpoint of subsequent generations, this caused a great transformation in the society and moral order of life in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. For Muhammad, although [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] exemplified "heedlessness," it was not entirely without merit. Muhammad approved and exhorted certain aspects of the Arab pre-Islamic tradition, such as the care for one’s near kin, for widows, orphans, and others in need and for the establishment of [[justice]]. However, these values would be re-ordered in importance and placed in the context of strict [[monotheism]].&lt;ref name="EncEthic"/&gt;

==Moral commandments==

In the 17th chapter, "Al-Israa" ("The Night Journey"), verses {{Quran-usc-range|17|22|39}}, the [[Qur'an]] provides a set of moral stipulations which are "among the (precepts of) wisdom, which thy Lord has revealed to thee" that can be reasonably categorised as ten in number. According to S. A. Nigosian, Professor of religious studies at [[University of Toronto|the University of Toronto]], these resemble the Ten Commandments in the Bible and "represents the fullest statement of the code of behavior every Muslim must follow".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nigosian|2004|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these verses are not regarded by Islamic scholars as set apart from any other moral stipulations in the Qur'an, nor are they regarded as a substitute, replacement, or abrogation of some other set of commandments as found in the previous revelations.  
# '''Worship only God:''' Do not make with Allah another god; lest you will sit disgraced and forsaken. ({{cite quran|17|22|style=ref}})
# '''Be kind, honourable and humble to one's parents:''' And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him alone, and to be good to the parents. Whether one or both of them reach old age [while] with you, say not to them [so much as], a word of disrespect, and do not repel them but speak to them a noble word. ({{cite quran|17|23|style=ref}}) And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, "My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small." ({{cite quran|17|24|style=ref}})
# '''Be neither miserly nor wasteful in one's expenditure:''' And give the relative his right, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully. ({{cite quran|17|26|style=ref}}) Indeed, the spendthrifts are brothers of the devil, and the devil is, to his lord, ungrateful. ({{cite quran|17|27|style=ref}}) And if you [must] turn away from the needy awaiting mercy from your Lord which you expect, then speak to them a gentle word. ({{cite quran|17|28|style=ref}}) And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck or extend it to its utmost reach, so that you [thereby] become blamed and insolvent. ({{cite quran|17|29|style=ref}})
# '''Do not engage in 'mercy killings' for fear of starvation:''' And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin. ({{cite quran|17|31|style=ref}})
# '''Do not commit adultery:''' And do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is an immorality and an evil way. ({{cite quran|17|32|style=ref}})
# '''Do not kill unjustly:''' And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority, but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported [by the law]. ({{cite quran|17|33|style=ref}})
# '''Care for orphaned children:''' And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in the way that is best, until he reaches maturity...({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Keep one's promises:''' ...fulfill (every) engagement [i.e. promise/covenant], for (every) engagement will be questioned (on the Day of Reckoning). ({{cite quran|17|34|style=ref}})
# '''Be honest and fair in one's interactions:''' And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with an even balance. That is the best [way] and best in result. ({{cite quran|17|35|style=ref}})
# '''Do not be arrogant in one's claims or beliefs:''' And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - all those will be questioned. ({{cite quran|17|36|style=ref}}) And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth [apart], and you will never reach the mountains in height. ({{cite quran|17|37|style=ref}})

Many Muslim theologians see the [[Golden rule#Islam|'''Golden Rule''']] implicit in some verses of the Qur'an and in the [[Hadith]]. The Golden Rule was agreed 1993 also by Muslims as a central unconditional ethical norm in the [[Declaration Toward a Global Ethic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|PWR|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early reforms under Islam==
{{main|Early reforms under Islam}}

Many reforms in human rights took place under [[Islam]] between 610 and 661, including the period of [[Muhammad]]'s  mission and the rule of the [[Rashidun|four immediate successors]] who established the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun Caliphate]]. Historians generally agree that Muhammad preached against what he saw as the social evils of his day,&lt;ref&gt;Alexander (1998), p.452&lt;/ref&gt; and that Islamic social reforms in areas such as [[social security]], family structure, [[slavery]], and the rights of women and [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]] improved on what was present in existing [[Arab]] society at the time.&lt;ref name="EoI_Akhlaq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1974), p.234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson (2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998), p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gallagher|2007|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, according to [[Bernard Lewis]], Islam "from the first denounced [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] privilege, rejected [[hierarchy]], and adopted a formula of the career open to the talents."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt; [[John Esposito]] sees Muhammad as a reformer who condemned practices of the pagan Arabs such as [[female infanticide]], [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the poor, [[usury]], murder, false contracts, and theft.&lt;ref name="Espos"&gt;Esposito (2005) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Lewis believes that the egalitarian nature of Islam "represented a very considerable advance on the practice of both the [[Greco-Roman]] and the [[Persian Empire|ancient Persian]] world."&lt;ref name="LewisNYRB"/&gt;

The [[Constitution of Medina]], also known as the ''Charter of Medina'', was drafted by Muhammad in 622. It constituted a formal agreement between Muhammad and all of the significant tribes and families of Yathrib (later known as [[Medina]]), including [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, and [[pagan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone (1999) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2009|loc=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Watt|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1964|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document was drawn up with the explicit concern of bringing to an end the bitter intertribal fighting between the clans of the Aws ([[Banu Aus|Aus]]) and [[Khazraj]] within Medina.  To this effect it instituted a number of rights and responsibilities for the Muslim, Jewish and pagan communities of Medina bringing them within the fold of one community-the [[Ummah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serjeant|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Constitution established the security of the community, [[freedom of religion]], the role of Medina as a [[haram]] or sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the [[Women's rights|security of women]], stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of [[Blood money (term)|blood-wite]] (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of [[Eye for an eye|lex talionis]]).

Muhammad made it the responsibility of the Islamic government to provide food and clothing, on a reasonable basis, to [[Prisoners of war|captives]], regardless of their religion. If the prisoners were in the custody of a person, then the responsibility was on the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Maududi (1967), Introduction of Ad-Dahr, "Period of revelation", pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis states that Islam brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching consequences. "One of these was the presumption of freedom; the other, the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined circumstances," Lewis continues. The position of the Arabian slave was "enormously improved": the Arabian slave "was now no longer merely a chattel but was also a human being with a certain religious and hence a [[social status]] and with certain quasi-legal rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Esposito states that reforms in [[women's rights]] affected marriage, divorce, and [[inheritance]].&lt;ref name="Espos" /&gt; Women were not accorded with such legal status in other cultures, including the West, until centuries later.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Lindsay. p.6224&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford Dictionary of Islam'' states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood.&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"&gt;Esposito (2004), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; "The [[dowry]], previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"&gt;Khadduri (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a "status" but rather as a "contract", in which the woman's consent was imperative.&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OxfordDicT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="majid"/&gt; "Women were given inheritance rights in a [[patriarchal society]] that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives."&lt;ref name="Espos"/&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]] states that "compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work."&lt;ref name = "Schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Montgomery Watt]] states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: "At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible - they had no [[Property|right to own property]], were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons." Muhammad, however, by "instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards."&lt;ref&gt;Maan, McIntosh (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Haddad and Esposito state that "Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of [[Family|family life]], marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society."&lt;ref&gt;Haddad, Esposito (1998) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Robert Bellah]] (''Beyond belief'') argues that Islam in its seventh-century origins was, for its time and place, "remarkably modern...in the high degree of commitment, involvement, and participation expected from the rank-and-file members of the community."  This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized on the equality of all Muslims, where leadership positions were open to all. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests "the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or group responsibility."&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe (2005) vol. 5, pp. 66-76. "Social Sciences and the Qur’an"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmentalism==
{{see also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}

Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of [[natural capital]], i.e. producing land. Traditions of [[haram (site)]] and [[hima (environmental protection)|hima]], an Arabic term meaning "protected place", and early [[urban planning]] were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within [[carrying capacity]] and to preserve the [[natural environment]] as an obligation of [[Caliph|khalifa]] or "stewardship".&lt;ref name="Haq"&gt;{{harvnb|Haq|2001|pp=111–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Muslims established themselves in [[Madinah]], Muhammad surveyed the
natural resources in the region—the wadis (riverbeds); the rich, black volcanic soil; the high rangelands—and decreed that they be preserved and set aside as a hima.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Verde|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hadith]]s on agriculture and [[environmental philosophy]] were compiled in the "Book of Agriculture" of the ''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'', which included the following saying:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=There is none amongst the believers who plants a tree, or sows a seed, and then a bird, or a person, or an animal eats thereof, but it is regarded as having given a charitable gift [for which there is great recompense].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sahih Bukhari]]'' 3:513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several such statements concerning the environment are also found in the Qur'an, such as the following:&lt;ref name="Haq" /&gt;

{{quote|text=And there is no animal in the earth nor bird that flies with its two wings, but that they are communities like yourselves.{{cite quran|6|38}}}}

The earliest known treatises dealing with environmentalism and [[environmental science]], especially pollution, were [[Islamic medicine|Arabic medical treatises]] written by [[al-Kindi]], [[Qusta ibn Luqa]], [[al-Razi]], [[Ibn Al-Jazzar]], [[al-Tamimi]], [[al-Masihi]], [[Avicenna]], [[Ali ibn Ridwan]], [[Ibn Jumay]], [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon]], [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], Ibn al-Quff, and [[Ibn al-Nafis]]. Their works covered a number of subjects related to pollution such as air pollution, [[water pollution]], [[soil contamination]], [[municipal solid waste]] mishandling, and [[environmental impact assessment]]s of certain localities.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gari|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], [[Al-Andalus]] also had the first [[waste container]]s and [[waste disposal]] facilities for [[litter]] collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Scott|1904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Artz|1980|pp=148–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;([[cf.]] [http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 References] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080229042135/http://www.1001inventions.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=main.viewSection&amp;intSectionID=441 |date=2008-02-29 }}, 1001 Inventions)&lt;/ref&gt;

"In order to preserve the natural environment by not polluting, plant trees, support environmentally-friendly goods and products, Muslims must rectify themselves through simplicity, contentment, resisting endless desires, and then remembering God as well as following His commands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Holy Quran and the Environment |url=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |year=2010 |chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818180319/http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html |archivedate=2013-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued [[humanistic]] and [[Rationalism|rational]] approaches in discourses regarding [[values]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodman|2003|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Democratic participation===
{{main|Islamic democracy}}
{{further|Shura|Ijma}}

In the early Islamic [[Caliphate]], the head of state, the Caliph, had a position based on the notion of a successor to Muhammad's political authority, who, according to Sunnis, were ideally elected by the people or their representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2004|pp=116–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, later Caliphates during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] had a lesser degree of democratic participation, but since "no one was superior to anyone else except on the basis of piety and virtue" in Islam, and following the example of Muhammad, later Islamic rulers often held [[public consultation]]s with the people in their affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Electing or appointing a Caliph

[[Fred Donner]], in his book ''The Early Islamic Conquests'' (1981), argues that the standard Arabian practice during the early Caliphates was for the prominent men of a kinship group, or tribe, to gather after a leader's death and elect a leader from amongst themselves, although there was no specified procedure for this [[shura]], or consultative assembly. Candidates  were usually from the same lineage as the deceased leader, but they were not necessarily his sons. Capable men who would lead well were preferred over an ineffectual direct heir, as there was no basis in the majority Sunni view that the head of state or governor should be chosen based on lineage alone. Al-Mawardi has written that the caliph should be [[Quraysh (tribe)|Qurayshi]]. [[Al-Baqillani|Abu Bakr Al-Baqillani]] has said that the leader of the Muslims simply should be from the majority. [[Abu Hanifa an-Nu‘man]] also wrote that the leader must come from the majority.&lt;ref name=2muslims&gt;{{harvnb|Al-Ghamdy|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Majlis ash-Shura

Traditional Sunni Islamic lawyers agree that ''[[shura]]'', loosely translated as 'consultation of the people', is a function of the caliphate. The [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]] advise the caliph. The importance of this is premised by the following verses of the Qur'an:{{or|date=October 2010}}

{{quote|text={{cite quran|42|38|expand=no|quote=...those who answer the call of their Lord and establish the prayer, and who conduct their affairs by Shura. [are loved by God]}}}}
{{quote|text={{cite quran|3|159|expand=no|quote=...consult them (the people) in their affairs. Then when you have taken a decision (from them), put your trust in Allah}}}}

The [[majlis]] is also the means to elect a new caliph. Al-Mawardi has written that members of the majlis should satisfy three conditions: they must be just, they must have enough knowledge to distinguish a good caliph from a bad one, and must have sufficient wisdom and judgment to select the best caliph. Al-Mawardi also said in emergencies when there is no caliphate and no majlis, the people themselves should create a majlis, select a list of candidates for caliph, then the majlis should select from the list of candidates.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt; Some modern interpretations of the role of the Majlis ash-Shura include those by Islamist author [[Sayyid Qutb]] and by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], the founder of a transnational political movement devoted to the revival of the Caliphate. In an analysis of the shura chapter of the Qur'an, Qutb argued Islam requires only that the ruler consult with at least some of the ruled (usually the elite), within the general context of God-made laws that the ruler must execute.  Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, writes that Shura is important and part of "the ruling structure" of the Islamic caliphate, "but not one of its pillars," and may be neglected without the Caliphate's rule becoming unIslamic.  Non-Muslims may serve in the majlis, though they may not vote or serve as an official.

===Religious pluralism===
Islamic legal framework included [[religious pluralism]]. Classical [[Sharia]], the [[religious law]]s and courts of  [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Jews]] and [[Hinduism|Hindus]], were usually accommodated within the Islamic legal framework, as seen in the early Caliphate, [[Al-Andalus]], [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], and the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman Millet]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachedina|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-Muslims were allowed to engage in religious practices that was usually forbidden by Islamic law. In a notable example, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] practice of [[incest]]uous "self-marriage" where a man could marry his mother, sister or daughter, was to be tolerated according to [[Ibn Qayyim]] (1292–1350). He based his opinion on the precedent that the prophet Muhammad, who did not forbid such self-marriages among Zoroastrians despite coming in contact with them and having knowledge of their practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious minorities were also free to do whatever they wished in their own homes, provided they did not publicly engage in illicit sexual activity in ways that could threaten public morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jackson|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom of expression===
Citizens of the Rashidun Caliphate were also free to criticize the [[Rashidun]] Caliphs, as the [[rule of law]] was binding on the [[head of state]] just as much as it was for the citizens. In a notable incident, when [[Umar]] tried to investigate a disturbance, by entering a home without permission, he was criticized for his behavior; he was also later criticized for the judgement he gave in that case.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|pp=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also numerous other situations where citizens insulted Caliph Umar, but he tolerated the insults and simply provided them explanations. Similar situations also occurred during the time of Caliph [[Ali]]. For example, there was an occasion when he was giving a [[Khutbah|sermon]] and a [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] rudely interrupted him with insulting language. Though he was urged to punish the interrupter, Ali declined on the grounds that his "right to freedom of speech must not be imperilled."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bontekoe|Stepaniants|1997|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad]] quotes a letter by a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]], in which he gives permission to a Christian he was attempting to convert to speak his mind freely, as evidence that in Islam even religious controversies were not exempt from open discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahmad|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to George Makdisi and Hugh Goddard, "the idea of [[academic freedom]]" in universities was "modelled on Islamic custom" as practiced in the medieval [[Madrasah]] system from the 9th century. Islamic influence was "certainly discernible in the foundation of the first deliberately planned university" in Europe, the [[University of Naples Federico II]] founded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1224.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goddard|2000|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written by the fourth Rashidun Caliph and first cousin of the prophet Muhammad, [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] to his governor of Egypt, [[Malik al-Ashtar]]. The Caliph advises his governor on dealings with the poor masses thus:
{{quote|text=Out of your hours of work, fix a time for the complainants and for those who want to approach you with their grievances. During this time you should do no other work but hear them and pay attention to their complaints and grievances. For this purpose you must arrange public audience for them during this audience, for the sake of Allah, treat them with kindness, courtesy and respect. Do not let your army and police be in the audience hall at such times so that those who have grievances against your regime may speak to you freely, unreservedly and without fear. [http://www.al-islam.org/nahjul/letters/letter53.htm Nahjul Balaagha letter 53]}}

===Human rights===
{{see also|Sharia|Early reforms under Islam|Caliphate|Islamic Jurisprudence: An International Perspective|Women in Islam|Islamic feminism}}

In the field of human rights, early [[Ulema|Islamic jurists]] introduced a number of advanced legal concepts which anticipated similar modern concepts in the field. These included the notions of the [[charitable trust]] and the [[Trust law|trusteeship]] of property; the notion of brotherhood and [[social solidarity]]; the notions of human [[dignity]] and the [[dignity of labour]]; the notion of an ideal law; the condemnation of [[anti-social behavior]]; the [[presumption of innocence]]; the notion of "bidding unto good" (assistance to those in distress); and the notions of [[sharing]], [[Duty of care|caring]], [[universalism]], fair [[industrial relations]], fair contract, commercial [[integrity]], freedom from [[usury]], [[women's rights]], [[privacy]], [[abuse]] of rights, [[juristic person]]ality, [[individual freedom]], [[equality before the law]], [[Legal aid|legal representation]], non-[[Ex post facto law|retroactivity]], supremacy of the law, [[judicial independence]], judicial [[impartiality]], limited [[sovereignty]], [[Toleration|tolerance]], and democratic participation. Many of these concepts were adopted in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] through contacts with [[Islamic Spain]] and the [[Emirate of Sicily]], and through the [[Crusades]] and the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=129–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=1. Pages 129-131 are opinions of the Sri Lankan Jurist Weeramantry; it is interesting primary source/claim, but disputed by vast majority of scholars. We need secondary or tertiary sources, or at least a few additional sources to this sweep of claims. 2. In the field of human rights, there is a lot of debate on its historical foundations, see Jack Donnelly;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donnelly|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 3. For neutral point of view, this credit claim to Islam must be balanced by a summary of dispute.|date=July 2013}}

The concept of [[inalienable rights]] was found in early Islamic law and jurisprudence, which denied a ruler "the right to take away from his subjects certain rights which inhere in his or her person as a human being." Islamic rulers could not take away certain rights from their subjects on the basis that "they become rights by [[reason]] of the fact that they are given to a subject by a law and from a source which no ruler can question or alter."&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=132, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that [[John Locke]]'s formulation of inalienable rights and conditional rulership, which were present in Islamic law centuries earlier, may have also been influenced by Islamic law, through his attendance of lectures given by [[Edward Pococke]], a professor of [[Islamic studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=8, 135, 139–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Islamic law recognized two sets of human rights. In addition to the category of [[civil and political rights]] (covered in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]), Islamic law also recognized an additional category: [[social rights|social]], economic and [[cultural rights]]. This latter category was not recognized in the [[Western law|Western legal]] tradition until the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=7, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of [[privacy]], which was not recognized in Western legal traditions until modern times, was recognized in Islamic law since the beginning of Islam.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7"&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|pp=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of women's rights, women generally had more legal rights under Islamic law than they did under Western legal systems until the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badawi|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "French married women, unlike their Muslim sisters, suffered from restrictions on their legal capacity which were removed only in 1965."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Badr|Mayer|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Noah Feldman, a [[Harvard University]] law professor, notes:

{{quote|text=As for sexism, the common law long denied married women any property rights or indeed legal personality apart from their husbands. When the British applied their law to Muslims in place of Shariah, as they did in some colonies, the result was to strip married women of the property that Islamic law had always granted them — hardly progress toward equality of the sexes.&lt;ref name=Feldman/&gt;}}

In the ''[[North Carolina Law Review]]'' journal, Professor John Makdisi of the [[University of North Carolina School of Law]] writes in "The Islamic Origins of the Common Law" article:

{{quote|text=[T]he manner in which an act was qualified as morally good or bad in the spiritual domain of Islamic religion was quite different from the manner in which that same act was qualified as legally valid or invalid in the temporal domain of Islamic law. Islamic law was secular, not canonical... Thus, it was a system focused on ensuring that an individual received justice, not that one be a good person.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Makdisi|1999|p=1704}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Count Leon Ostorog, a French jurist, wrote the following on classical Islamic law in 1927:

{{quote|text=Those Eastern thinkers of the ninth century laid down, on the basis of their theology, the principle of the Rights of Man, in those very terms, comprehending the rights of individual liberty, and of inviolability of person and property; described the supreme power in Islam, or Califate, as based on a contract, implying conditions of capacity and performance, and subject to cancellation if the conditions under the contract were not fulfilled; elaborated a Law of War of which the humane, chivalrous prescriptions would have put to the blush certain belligerents in World War I; expounded a doctrine of toleration of non-Moslem creeds so liberal that our West had to wait a thousand years before seeing equivalent principles adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some scholars have suggested that the idea of "a charter defining the duties of a sovereign toward his subjects, as well as subjects toward the sovereign", which led to the "genesis of European legal structures" and the development of the ''[[Magna Carta]]'', may have been "brought back by Crusaders who were influenced by what they had learned in the [[Levant]] about the governing system" established by [[Saladin]]. It has also been suggested that "much of the West’s understanding of liberalism in law, economics and society has roots in medieval Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence of Islamic law on European law was the [[presumption of innocence]], which was introduced to Europe by King [[Louis IX of France]] soon after he returned from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] during the [[Crusades]]. Prior to this, European legal procedure consisted of either [[trial by combat]] or [[trial by ordeal]]. In contrast, Islamic law was based on the presumption of innocence from its beginning, as declared by the Caliph [[Umar]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boisard|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other freedoms and rights recognized in the Islamic legal system based on the Qur'an since the 7th century, but not recognized in the Western world until much later, include "the rights to know, to choose belief and behaviour, to read and write, the right to power, and even the right to choose government."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Splichal|2002|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Rule of law

Islamic jurists anticipated the concept of the [[rule of law]], the equal subjection of all classes to the ordinary law of the land, where no person is above the law and where officials and private citizens are under a [[duty]] to obey the same law. A [[Qadi]] (Islamic judge) was also not allowed to discriminate on the grounds of religion, [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human skin color|colour]], [[kinship]] or [[prejudice]]. There were also a number of cases where [[Caliph]]s had to appear before judges as they prepared to take their verdict.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry132,135" /&gt; The following [[hadith]] established the principle of rule of law in relation to [[nepotism]] and accountability:&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Bukhari, Volume 4, Book 56, Number 681&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Narrated ‘Aisha: The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, "Who will intercede for her with Allah's Apostle?" Some said, "No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah's Apostle." When Usama spoke about that to Allah's Apostle Allah's Apostle said: "Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allah’s Prescribed Punishments?" Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, "What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah's Legal punishment on him. By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad (my daughter) stole, I would cut off her hand."}}

Various Islamic lawyers do however place multiple conditions, and stipulations e.g. the poor cannot be penalised for stealing out of poverty, before executing such a law, making it very difficult to reach such a stage. It is well known during a time of drought in the [[Rashidun Empire|Rashidun caliphate]] period, capital punishments were suspended until the effects of the drought passed.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

According to Noah Feldman, a law professor at [[Harvard University]], the legal scholars and jurists who once upheld the rule of law were replaced by a law governed by the state due to the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of Sharia by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the early 19th century:&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{harvnb|Feldman|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=How the scholars lost their exalted status as keepers of the law is a complex story, but it can be summed up in the adage that partial reforms are sometimes worse than none at all. In the early 19th century, the Ottoman empire responded to military setbacks with an internal reform movement. The most important reform was the attempt to codify Shariah. This Westernizing process, foreign to the Islamic legal tradition, sought to transform Shariah from a body of doctrines and principles to be discovered by the human efforts of the scholars into a set of rules that could be looked up in a book.}}

{{quote|text=Once the law existed in codified form, however, the law itself was able to replace the scholars as the source of authority. Codification took from the scholars their all-important claim to have the final say over the content of the law and transferred that power to the state.}}

;Accountability of rulers

Sunni Islamic lawyers have commented on when it is permissible to disobey, [[Impeachment|impeach]] or remove rulers in the Caliphate. This is usually when the rulers are not meeting public responsibilities obliged upon them under Islam. Al-Mawardi said that if the rulers meet their Islamic responsibilities to the public, the people must obey their laws, but if they become either unjust or severely ineffective then the Caliph or ruler must be impeached via the [[Majlis-ash-Shura|Majlis ash-Shura]]. Similarly Al-Baghdadi believed that if the rulers do not uphold [[justice]], the ummah via the majlis should give warning to them, and if unheeded then the Caliph can be impeached. [[Al-Juwayni]] argued that Islam is the goal of the ummah, so any ruler that deviates from this goal must be impeached. Al-Ghazali believed that [[oppression]] by a caliph is enough for impeachment. Rather than just relying on impeachment, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] obliged [[rebellion]] upon the people if the caliph began to act with no regard for Islamic law. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said that to ignore such a situation is ''[[haraam]]'', and those who cannot revolt inside the caliphate should launch a struggle from outside. Al-Asqalani used two [[ayah]]s from the Qur'an to justify this:

{{quote|text={{cite quran|33|67|end=68|expand=no|quote=...And they (the sinners on qiyama) will say, 'Our Lord! We obeyed our leaders and our chiefs, and they misled us from the right path. Our Lord! Give them (the leaders) double the punishment you give us and curse them with a very great curse'...}}}}

Islamic lawyers commented that when the rulers refuse to step down via successful impeachment through the Majlis, becoming dictators through the support of a corrupt army, if the majority agree they have the option to launch a revolution against them. Many noted that this option is only exercised after factoring in the potential cost of life.&lt;ref name=2muslims/&gt;

;Right of revolution

According to scholar [[Bernard Lewis]], the [[Qur'an and Sunnah]] have several points to make on governance regarding the [[right of revolution]] in Islam:

{{quote|text=The Quran, for example, makes it clear that there is a duty of obedience: "Obey God, obey the Prophet, obey those who hold authority over you." And this is elaborated in a number of sayings attributed to Muhammad. But there are also sayings that put strict limits on the duty of obedience. Two dicta attributed to the Prophet and universally accepted as authentic are indicative. One says, "there is no obedience in sin"; in other words, if the ruler orders something contrary to the divine law, not only is there no duty of obedience, but there is a duty of disobedience. This is more than the right of revolution that appears in Western political thought. It is a duty of revolution, or at least of disobedience and opposition to authority. The other pronouncement, "do not obey a creature against his creator," again clearly limits the authority of the ruler, whatever form of ruler that may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Medical ethics==
{{main|Bimaristan}}

The ethical standards of Muslim physicians was first laid down in the 9th century by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]], who wrote the ''Adab al-Tabib'' (''Conduct of a Physician''), the first treatist dedicated to [[medical ethics]]. He regarded physicians as "guardians of souls and bodies", and wrote twenty chapters on various topics related to medical ethics, including:&lt;ref name=Ethics&gt;[http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=570 Islamic Science, the Scholar and Ethics], Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* What the physician must avoid and beware of
* The manners of [[visitor]]s
* The care of [[Cure|remedies]] by the physician
* The [[dignity]] of the medical [[profession]]
* The [[Test (assessment)|examination]] of physicians
* The removal of corruption among physicians

Because Islam views itself as a total system governing all areas, Islamic medical ethics view the patient as a whole. Classical texts speak more about "health", than "illness", showing an emphasis on prevention rather than cure.&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt;

===Drugs===
The earliest known [[Prohibition (drugs)|prohibition]] of illegal drugs occurred under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], which prohibited the use of [[Hashish]], a preparation of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], as a [[recreational drug]]. Classical [[Ulema|jurists]] in medieval [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], however, accepted the use of the Hashish drug for medicinal and therapeutic purposes, and agreed that its "medical use, even if it leads to mental derangement, remains exempt" from punishment. In the 14th century, the Islamic scholar [[Az-Zarkashi]] spoke of "the permissibility of its use for medical purposes if it is established that it is beneficial."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mary Lynn Mathre, with "this legal distinction between the [[intoxicant]] and the medical uses of cannabis, medieval [[Kalam|Muslim theologians]] were far ahead of present-day [[American law]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathre|1997|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical peer review===

The first documented description of a [[peer review]] process is found in the ''Ethics of the Physician'' by [[Ishaq ibn 'Ali al-Ruhawi]] (854–931) of al-Raha, [[Syria]], where the notes of a practising [[Islamic medicine|Islamic physician]] were reviewed by peers and the physician could face a lawsuit from a maltreated patient if the reviews were negative.&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Spier|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Al Kawi|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neuroethics===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
Islamic [[neuroethics]] and [[neurotheology]] hold a sympathetic attitude towards the mentally ill, as exemplified in [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5 of the Qur'an:&lt;ref name=Paladin&gt;{{harvnb|Paladin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Do not give your property which God assigned you to manage to the insane: but feed and cloth the insane with this property and tell splendid words to him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Qur'an]], [[An-Nisa|Sura 4]]:5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This Quranic verse summarized Islam's attitudes towards the mentally ill, who were considered unfit to manage property but must be treated [[humane]]ly and be kept under care by a [[Legal guardian|guardian]], according to [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref name=Paladin/&gt; This positive neuroethical understanding of [[mental health]] consequently led to the establishment of the first [[psychiatric hospital]]s in the medieval Islamic world from the 8th century,&lt;ref name=Dening-57&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an early scientific understanding of [[neuroscience]] and [[psychology]] by medieval [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] and psychologists, who discovered that mental disorders are caused by [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctions]] in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Youssef|Youssef|Dening|1996|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military ethics==
{{main|Islamic military jurisprudence}}

The early Islamic treatises on [[international law]] from the 9th century onwards covered the application of Islamic ethics, [[Islamic economic jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic military jurisprudence]] to international law,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelsay|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were concerned with a number of modern international law topics, including the [[law of treaties]]; the treatment of diplomats, [[hostage]]s, [[refugee]]s and [[prisoners of war]]; the [[right of asylum]]; [[Laws of war|conduct on the battlefield]]; protection of women, children and [[non-combatant]] civilians; contracts across the lines of [[battle]]; the use of [[poison]]ous weapons; and devastation of enemy territory.&lt;ref name=Weeramantry&gt;{{harvnb|Weeramantry|1997|p=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic legal principles of international law were mainly based on Qur'an and the [[Sunnah]] of Muhammad, who gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's [[caliph|successor]] and [[Sahaba|close companion]], [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the Muslim army:&lt;ref name=Zuhur&gt;{{harvnb|Aboul-Enein|Zuhur|2004|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.&lt;ref name=Zuhur/&gt;}}

===Prisoners of war===
{{main|Prisoners of war in Islam}}

After Sultan [[al-Kamil]] defeated the [[Franks]] during the [[Crusades]], Oliverus Scholasticus praised the Islamic [[laws of war]], commenting on how al-Kamil supplied the defeated Frankish army with food:&lt;ref name=Weeramantry/&gt;

{{quote|text=Who could doubt that such goodness, friendship and charity come from God? Men whose parents, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, had died in agony at our hands, whose lands we took, whom we drove naked from their homes, revived us with their own food when we were dying of hunger and showered us with kindness even when we were in their power.&lt;ref name="Weeramantry136-7" /&gt;}}

==Peace and justice==
{{main|Peace In Islamic Thought}}

As in other [[Abrahamic faith|Abrahamic]] religions, peace is a basic concept of [[Islam]]. The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term "Islam" itself (إسلام) is usually translated as "submission"; submission of desires to the will of God. It comes from the term ''aslama'', which means "to surrender" or "resign oneself".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Islam | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam Online | author=L. Gardet, J. Jomier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lane|p=1413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arabic word ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'' (سلام) ("peace") has the same [[S-L-M|root]] as the word ''Islam''.&lt;ref name="Harper"&gt;{{harvnb|Harper|2001|loc=Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One Islamic interpretation is that individual personal peace is attained by utterly submitting to [[Allah]]. The greeting "[[S-L-M|Salaam alaykum]]", favoured by [[Muslims]], has the literal meaning "Peace be with you".&lt;ref name="Harper" /&gt; Muhammad is reported to have said once, "Mankind are the dependents, or slaves of God, and the most beloved of them to God are those who are the most excellent to His dependents." "Not one of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself." Great Muslim scholars of prophetic tradition such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and Sharafuddin al [[Al-Nawawi|Nawawi]] have said&lt;ref&gt;[[Fath al-Bari]] and sharh [[sahih bukhari]] by Imam Al Nawawi&lt;/ref&gt; that the words "his brother" mean any person irrespective of faith.

==Welfare==
{{main|Bayt al-mal}}

The concepts of [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and pension were introduced in early Islamic law as forms of ''[[Zakat]]'' (charity), one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]], since the time of the [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in the 8th century. The taxes (including ''Zakat'' and ''[[Jizya]]'') collected in the [[treasury]] of an Islamic government was used to provide income for the needy, including the [[Poverty|poor]], [[Old age|elderly]], [[orphan]]s, [[widow]]s, and the [[Disability|disabled]]. According to the Islamic jurist [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel, 1058–1111), the government was also expected to store up food supplies in every region in case a [[disaster]] or [[famine]] occurs. The [[Caliphate]] was thus one of the earliest [[welfare state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=308–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hamid|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 9th century, funds from the treasury were also used towards the ''[[Waqf]]'' ([[charitable trust]]s), often for the purpose of building of [[Madrassah]]s and [[Bimaristan]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Crone|2005|pp=309–310, 312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal welfare===
{{See also|Islam and animals}}

Concern for the treatment of animals can be found in the Qur'an and in the teachings of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, which inspired debates over [[animal rights]] by later medieval Muslim scholars. The 10th-century work, "''Disputes Between Animals and Man''", part of the [[Epistles of the Brethren of Purity]], has been considered a classic in this regard. Inspired by the [[Ayah|Qur'anic verse]]: "all the creatures that crawl on the earth and those that fly with their wings are communities like yourselves" (6:38), the [[Shafi'i]] jurist [['Izz al-Din Ibn 'Abd al-Salam al-Sulami]] (d. 1262) formulated the first full-fledged charter of the rights of livestock and animals in his legal treatise ''Rules for Judgement in the Cases of Living Beings'' (''Qawa'id al-ahkam fi masalih al-anam'') which was based on the stories and sayings of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sardar|2011|p=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coward|1995|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bekoff|2010|p=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
The son of Elizabeth Melup and Szymon Rykwert, Rykwert was born in [[Warsaw]] in 1926 and moved to England in 1939, on the eve of the second World War. Rykwert was educated at Charterhouse and then at the [[Bartlett School of Architecture]] ([[University College, London|University College]], London) and the [[Architectural Association]] in London. His first academic posts were lecturing at Hammersmith School of Arts &amp; Crafts and subsequently at the [[Ulm School of Design]] from 1958, and then as Librarian and Tutor at the [[Royal College of Art]] from 1961 to 1967 where he obtained his PhD He was appointed Professor of Art at the newly created [[University of Essex]], a post he held from 1967 until 1980, when he moved to Cambridge first as [[Slade Professor of Fine Art]] and then as Reader in Architecture. Here Rykwert continued his influential master's programme, taught with the architectural critic [[Dalibor Vesely]]. In 1988 Rykwert was appointed as the Paul Philippe Cret Professor of Architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, a post he held until 1998; he is now Emeritus Professor.

Joseph Rykwert has lectured or taught at many major schools of architecture throughout the world and has held visiting appointments at Princeton, the Cooper Union, New York, Harvard Graduate School of Design, the [[University of Sydney]], of Louvain, the Institut d'Urbanisme, Paris, the [[Central European University]] and others: in 1998–99 he was a British Academy visiting professor at the University of Bath. He has held senior fellowships at the Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts, Washington, and the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities. In 1984 Rykwert was appointed Chevalier dans l’ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He holds honorary degrees from the University of Edinburgh (1995), the University of Cordoba, Argentina (1998), the University of Bath (2000), of Toronto (2005) Rome (20005) and Trieste (2007), and is a member of the Italian Accademia di San Luca and the Polish Academy. In 2000 he was awarded the Bruno Zevi prize in architectural history by the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture|Biennale of Venice]], and in 2009 the Gold Medal Bellas Artes, Madrid. He has been president of the international council of architectural critics (CICA) since 1996, and is the recipient of the 2014 [[Royal Gold Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Wainwright: [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/sep/18/riba-gold-medal-joseph-rykwert "RIBA awards Royal Gold Medal to architectural historian Joseph Rykwert"], in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

He was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[2014 Birthday Honours]] for services to architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60895 |date=14 June 2014 |page=b10 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016 he received an honorary degree in [[pedagogy]] at the [[University of Bologna]].

== Works ==
Joseph Rykwert's preoccupations are many, but some particular themes stand out. His work is fundamentally concerned with the origin of architectural ideas and, having experienced displacement himself at an early age, with our sense of 'place'. In ''The Idea of a Town: The Anthropology of Urban Form in Rome, Italy and the Ancient World'' (first published in 1963 and in two subsequent editions), rather than accept the archaeologists’ viewpoint of the ancient city as an outcome of practical settlement needs, Rykwert broke new ground in understanding the ancient town as a product of sacred and symbolic rituals. The book served as a timely critique of post-war New Town developments. In ''On Adam’s House in Paradise: The Idea of the Primitive Hut in Architectural History'' (1972 and subsequent editions) Rykwert examined the persistent idea that architecture could be returned to a lost state of accord with nature, an accord symbolised by the fabled idea that Adam had built a house in Eden. In ''The First Moderns: The Architects of the Eighteenth Century'' (1980), Rykwert traced the origins of many modern ideas that are commonly assumed to be recent inventions (such as optics and perspective). The book is not a conventional history of style, but rather one of ideas and culture. Frances Yates explained this novelty of approach in ''The Times Literary Supplement'': ‘The range of Rykwert's learning is enormous. History of gardens, Chinese influences, festival architecture, all contribute to the overflowing wealth. Great figures in the history of thought and science — Bacon, Newton, Vico — are seen from new angles....This is no superficial history of styles, no conventional history of ideas. It invigorates both through the attempt at a new kind of history of architecture.’ In ''The Dancing Column: On Order in Architecture'' (1996) Rykwert turned his attention to the origins of the architectural Orders, and more recently in ''The Seduction of Place: The History and Future of Cities'' (2000) to the question of how to make successful urban spaces and forms in cities today.

Throughout his career Rykwert has been preoccupied with the work of the Renaissance architect [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. In 1955 Rykwert published an annotated edition of Leoni's 1756 translation of Alberti's treatise, entitled ''The Ten Books of Architecture, by L.B. Alberti'', and this was followed in 1989 with a new translation from Latin, entitled ''On the Art of Building in Ten Books'' (published with [[Robert Tavernor]] and [[Neil Leach]]). In 1994 Rykwert co-curated (with [[Robert Tavernor]] and Anne Rykwert) an international exhibition on Alberti's work, held at the Palazzo Te in Mantua. Alberti's overlapping interest in architectural theory and practice, and his conception of the architect as a philosopher and student of many arts, led Rykwert to identify him as representing the model architect for an age where the role of the designer is in danger of being reduced to that of a businessman or technocrat. The conception of architecture as a product of inter-related disciplines and as a sister to other visual arts informs Rykwert's latest book, ''The Judicious Eye: Architecture Against the Other Arts'', published in 2008.

Joseph Rykwert married his second wife, Anne, during his time in Essex, and she has been a collaborator on notable works including the international Alberti exhibition and a book on the Adam brothers. Rykwert’s teaching has influenced several generations of architects and historians. Sir James Stirling commented on ''The First Moderns'', for example, that it was: ‘An erudite lead into my favourite period (early nineteenth century) with amazing revelations on the architectural heroes of the time.’ Many of Rykwert’s former pupils have gone on to have significant careers in their own right, such as [[Daniel Libeskind]], Shams Naga, Eric Parry, [[Alberto Pérez-Gómez]], [[Mohsen Mostafavi]], [[Robert Tavernor]], [[Vaughan Hart]] and [[David Leatherbarrow]]. Many university departments of architecture in the United Kingdom or America employ members of staff who were taught by Rykwert.

Unlike many architectural historians before him, Joseph Rykwert has not been concerned with architectural style or the classical language ''per se'', but rather with the meaning of a particular design that should always find its own appropriate expression. Throughout his work he has been concerned with practice as much as with theory, and with the ways in which buildings are actually designed and made.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20761">'''Kin recognition''', also called '''kin detection''', is an organism's ability to distinguish between close genetic kin and non-kin. In [[evolutionary biology]] and [[psychology]], such an ability is presumed to have evolved for [[inbreeding avoidance]].

An additional [[adaptation|adaptive function]] sometimes posited for kin recognition is a role in [[kin selection]]. There is debate over this, since in strict theoretical terms kin recognition is not necessary for kin selection or the cooperation associated with it. Rather, [[eusociality|social behaviour]] can emerge by kin selection in the demographic conditions of 'viscous populations' with organisms interacting in their natal context, without active kin discrimination, since social participants by default typically share recent common origin. Since kin selection theory emerged, much research has been produced investigating the possible role of kin recognition mechanisms in mediating altruism. Taken as a whole, this research suggests that active powers of recognition play a negligible role in mediating social cooperation relative to less elaborate cue-based and context-based mechanisms, such as familiarity, [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and phenotype matching.

Because cue-based 'recognition' predominates in social mammals, outcomes are non-deterministic in relation to actual genetic kinship, instead outcomes simply reliably correlate with genetic kinship in an organism's typical conditions. A well-known human example of an inbreeding avoidance mechanism is the [[Westermarck effect]], in which unrelated individuals who happen to spend their childhood in the same household find each other sexually unattractive. Similarly, due to the cue-based mechanisms that mediate social bonding and cooperation, unrelated individuals who grow up together in this way are also likely to demonstrate strong [[Social Bonding and Nurture Kinship|social and emotional ties, and enduring altruism]].

==Theoretical background==
The English evolutionary biologist [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[inclusive fitness]], and the related theory of [[kin selection]], were formalized in the 1960s and 1970s to explain the evolution of social behaviours. Hamilton's early papers, as well as giving a mathematical account of the selection pressure, discussed possible implications and behavioural manifestations. Hamilton considered potential roles of cue-based mechanisms mediating altruism versus 'positive powers' of kin discrimination:

{{quote|The selective advantage which makes behaviour conditional in the right sense on the discrimination of factors which correlate with the relationship of the individual concerned is therefore obvious. It may be, for instance, that in respect of a certain social action performed towards neighbours indiscriminately, an individual is only just breaking even in terms of inclusive fitness. If he could learn to recognise those of his neighbours who really were close relatives and could devote his beneficial actions to them alone an advantage to inclusive fitness would at once appear. Thus a mutation causing such discriminatory behaviour itself benefits inclusive fitness and would be selected. In fact, the individual may not need to perform any discrimination so sophisticated as we suggest here; a difference in the generosity of his behaviour according to whether the situations evoking it were encountered near to, or far from, his own home might occasion an advantage of a similar kind." (1996 [1964], 51)&lt;ref name="H1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=William D. |year=1964 |title=The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–52 |doi= 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4 |pmid=5875341}} Reprinted in. 1996. ''Narrow Roads of Gene Land. Vol. 1.'' Oxford: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These two possibilities, [[altruism]] mediated via 'passive situation' or via 'sophisticated discrimination', stimulated a generation of researchers to look for evidence of any 'sophisticated' kin discrimination. However, Hamilton later (1987) developed his thinking to consider that "an innate kin recognition adaptation" was unlikely to play a role in mediating altruistic behaviours:

{{quote|But once again, we do not expect anything describable as an innate kin recognition adaptation, used for social behaviour other than mating, for the reasons already given in the hypothetical case of the trees.(Hamilton 1987, 425)&lt;ref name="H1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |year=1987 |chapter=Discriminating nepotism: expectable, common and overlooked |title=Kin recognition in animals |editor-first=D. J. C. |editor-last=Fletcher |editor2-first=C. D. |editor2-last=Michener |location=New York |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0471911992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The implication that the [[inclusive fitness]] criterion can be met by mediating mechanisms of cooperative behaviour that are context and location-based has been clarified by recent work by West ''et al.'':

{{quote|In his original papers on inclusive fitness theory, Hamilton pointed out a sufficiently high relatedness to favour altruistic behaviours could accrue in two ways — kin discrimination or limited dispersal (Hamilton, 1964, 1971, 1972, 1975). There is a huge theoretical literature on the possible role of limited dispersal reviewed by Platt &amp; Bever (2009) and West et al. (2002a), as well as experimental evolution tests of these models (Diggle et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2004; Kümmerli et al., 2009 ). However, despite this, it is still sometimes claimed that kin selection requires kin discrimination (Oates &amp; Wilson, 2001; Silk, 2002 ). Furthermore, a large number of authors appear to have implicitly or explicitly assumed that kin discrimination is the only mechanism by which altruistic behaviours can be directed towards relatives... [T]here is a huge industry of papers reinventing limited dispersal as an explanation for cooperation. The mistakes in these areas seem to stem from the incorrect assumption that kin selection or indirect fitness benefits require kin discrimination (misconception 5), despite the fact that Hamilton pointed out the potential role of limited dispersal in his earliest papers on inclusive fitness theory (Hamilton, 1964; Hamilton, 1971; Hamilton, 1972; Hamilton, 1975). (West et al. 2010, p. 243 and supplement)&lt;ref name="W2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=West |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |journal=[[Evolution and Social Behaviour]] |volume=32 |year=2011 |issue=4 |pages=231–262 |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Criticism==
Leading [[inclusive fitness]] theorists such as Grafen have argued that the whole research program around kin recognition is somewhat misguided:

{{quote|Do animals really recognise kin in a way that is different from the way they recognise mates, neighbours, and other organisms and objects?’. Certainly animals use recognition systems to recognise their offspring, their siblings and their parents. But to the extent that they do so in the same way that they recognise their mates and their neighbours, I feel it is unhelpful to say they have a kin recognition system."
(Grafen 1991, 1095)&lt;ref name="G1991"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grafen |first=A. |year=1991 |title=Development, the Conveniently Forgotten Variable in True Kin Recognition - Reply |journal=[[Animal Behaviour (journal)|Animal Behaviour]] |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=1091–1092 |doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(05)80649-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Others have cast similar doubts over the enterprise:

{{quote|[T]he fact that animals benefit from engaging in spatially mediated behaviors is not evidence that these animals can recognize their kin, nor does it support the conclusion that spatially based differential behaviors represent a kin recognition mechanism (see also discussions by Blaustein, 1983; Waldman, 1987; Halpin 1991). In other words, from an evolutionary perspective it may well be advantageous for kin to aggregate and for individuals to behave preferentially towards nearby kin, whether or not this behaviour is the result of kin recognition per se" (Tang-Martinez 2001, 25)&lt;ref name="TM2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tang-Martinez |first=Z. |year=2001 |title=The mechanisms of kin discrimination and the evolution of kin recognition in vertebrates: a critical re-evaluation |journal=[[Behavioural Processes]] |volume=53 |issue=1–2 |pages=21–40 |doi=10.1016/S0376-6357(00)00148-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Experimental evidence==
Kin recognition is a behavioral adaptation noted in many species but proximate level mechanisms are not well documented. Recent studies have shown that kin recognition can result from a multitude of sensory input. Jill Mateo notes that there are three components are prominent in kin recognition. First, "production of unique phenotypic cues or labels". Second, "perception of these labels and the degree of correspondence of these labels with a 'recognition template'", and finally the recognition of the phenotypes should lead to "action taken by the animal as a function of the perceived similarity between its template and an encountered phenotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mateo |first=Jill M. |title=Kin Recognition in Ground Squirrels and Other Rodents |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=84 |issue=4 |year=2003 |pages=1163–1181 |doi=10.1644/BLe-011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three components allow for several possible mechanisms of kin recognition. Sensory information gathered from visual, olfactory and auditory stimuli are the most prevalent. The [[belding ground squirrel]] kin produce similar odors in comparison to non-kin. Mateo notes that the squirrels spent longer investigating non-kin scents suggesting recognition of kin odor. It's also noted that belding's ground squirrels produce at least two scents arising from dorsal and oral secretions, giving two opportunities for kin recognition. Auditory distinctions have been noted among avian species. [[Long-tailed tit]]s (''Aegithalos caudatus'') are capable of discriminating kin and non-kin based on contact calls. Distinguishing calls are often learned from adults during the nestling period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sharp |first=Stuart P. |title=Learned kin recognition cues in a social bird |journal=Nature |volume=434 |issue=7037 |year=2005 |pages=1127–1130 |doi=10.1038/nature03522 |display-authors=etal |pmid=15858573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies suggest that the bald-faced hornet, ''[[Dolichovespula maculata]]'', can recognize nest mates by their cuticular hydrocarbon profile, which produces a distinct smell.&lt;ref&gt;Discrimination Between Natal and Non- Natal Nests by the Social Wasps Dolichovespula maculata and Polistes fuscatus. Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. Deanna Ferguson, George J. Gamboa and Julia K. Jones. Departement of Biological Sciences, Oakland University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kin recognition in some species may also be mediated by immunogenetic similarity of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Villinger |first=J. |last2=Waldman |first2=B. |year=2012 |title=Social discrimination by quantitative assessment of immunogenetic similarity |journal=Proc. R. Soc. B |volume=279 |issue=1746 |pages=4368–4374 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.1279 |pmc=3479794 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a discussion of the interaction of these social and biological kin recognition factors see Lieberman, Tooby, and Cosmides (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lieberman |first=D. |last2=Tooby |first2=J. |last3=Cosmides |first3=L. |title=The architecture of human kin detection |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=445 |issue=7129 |pages=727–731 |year=2007 |doi=10.1038/nature05510 |pmid=17301784 |pmc=3581061}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that, as applied to humans, this nature-nurture interactionist perspective allows a synthesis&lt;ref name="SBNK" /&gt; between theories and evidence of social bonding and cooperation across the fields of evolutionary biology, psychology ([[attachment theory]]) and cultural anthropology ([[nurture kinship]]).

==In plants==
Kin recognition is an adaptive behavior observed in living beings to prevent inbreeding, and increase fitness of populations, individuals and genes. Kin recognition is the key to successful [[reciprocal altruism]], a behavior that increases reproductive success of both organisms involved. Reciprocal altruism as a product of kin recognition has been observed and studied in many animals, and more recently, [[plants]]. Due to the nature of plant reproduction and growth, plants are more likely than animals to live in close proximity to family members, and therefore stand to gain more from the ability to differentiate kin from strangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldman|first=B. |year=1988|title=The Ecology of Kin Recognition |journal=ECOLOGY, EVOLUTION, AND SYSTEMATICS |volume=19 |pages=543–571 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.19.110188.002551 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, botanists have been conducting studies to determine which plant species can recognize kin, and discover the responses of plants to neighboring kin. Murphy and Dudley (2009) shows that ''[[Impatiens pallida]]'' has the ability to recognize individuals closely related to them and those not related to them. The physiological response to this recognition is increasingly interesting. ''I. pallida'' responds to kin by increasing branchiness and stem elongation, to prevent shading relatives, and responds to strangers by increasing leaf to root allocation, as a form of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Murphy|first1=G. |last2=Dudley|first2=S. |year=2009|title=Kin recognition: Competition and cooperation in Impatiens (Balsaminaceae) |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=96 |doi=10.3732/ajb.0900006 |pages=1990–1996 |pmid=21622319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Bhatt et al. (2010) show that ''Cakile edentula'', the American sea rocket, has the ability to allocate more energy to root growth, and competition, in response to growing next to a stranger, and allocates less energy to root growth when planted next to a sibling. This reduces competition between siblings and increases fitness of relatives growing next to each other, while still allowing competition between non-relative plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bhatt|first=M. |year=2010|title=Kin recognition, not competitive interactions, predicts root allocation in young Cakile edentula seedling pairs |journal=New Phytologist |volume=189 |pages=1135–1142 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03548.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the mechanisms involved in kin recognition. They most likely vary between species as well as within species. A study by Bierdrzycki et al. (2010) shows that root secretions are necessary for ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' to recognize kin vs. strangers, but not necessary to recognize self vs. non-self roots. This study was performed using secretion inhibitors, which disabled the mechanism responsible for kin recognition in this species, and showed similar growth patterns to Bhatt et al., (2010) and Murphy and Dudley (2009) in control groups. The most interesting result of this study was that inhibiting root secretions did not reduce the ability of ''Arabidopsis'' to recognize their own roots, which implicates a separate mechanism for self/non-self recognition than that for kin/stranger recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bierdrzycki|first=M. |year=2010|title=Root exudates mediate kin recognition in plants |journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology |volume=3 |pages=28–35 |doi=10.4161/cib.3.1.10118 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While this mechanism in the roots responds to exudates and involves competition over resources like nitrogen and phosphorus, another mechanism has been recently proposed, which involves competition over light, in which kin recognition takes place in leaves. In their 2014 study, Crepy and Casal conducted multiple experiments on different accessions of ''A. thaliana''. These experiments showed that ''Arabidopsis'' accessions have distinct R:FR and blue light signatures, and that these signatures can be detected by photoreceptors, which allows the plant to recognize its neighbor as a relative or non-relative. Not much is known about the pathway that ''Arabidopsis'' uses to associate these light patterns with kin, however, researchers ascertained that photoreceptors phyB, cry 1, cry 2, phot1, and phot2 are involved in the process by performing a series of experiments with knock-out mutants. Researchers also concluded that the auxin-synthesis gene TAA1 is involved in the process, downstream of the photoreceptors, by performing a similar experiments using Sav3 knock-out mutants. This mechanism leads to altered leaf direction to prevent shading of related neighbors and to reduce competition for sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Crepy|first=M. |year=2014|title=RoPhotoreceptor-mediated kin recognition in plants. |journal=New Phytologist |volume=205 |pages=329–38 |doi=10.1111/nph.13040 |pmid=25264216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inbreeding avoidance==
{{main|Inbreeding avoidance}}

When mice inbreed with close relatives in their natural habitat, there is a significant detrimental effect on progeny survival.&lt;ref name="pmid7939661"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiménez JA, Hughes KA, Alaks G, Graham L, Lacy RC |title=An experimental study of inbreeding depression in a natural habitat |journal=Science |volume=266 |issue=5183 |pages=271–3 |year=1994 |pmid=7939661 |doi= 10.1126/science.7939661}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inbreeding is detrimental, it tends to be avoided. In the [[house mouse]], the [[Major urinary proteins|major urinary protein]] (MUP) gene cluster provides a highly polymorphic scent signal of genetic identity that appears to underlie kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance.  Thus there are fewer matings between mice sharing MUP haplotypes than would be expected if there were random mating.&lt;ref name="pmid17997307"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherborne AL, Thom MD, Paterson S, Jury F, Ollier WE, Stockley P, Beynon RJ, Hurst JL |title=The genetic basis of inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Curr. Biol. |volume=17 |issue=23 |pages=2061–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17997307 |pmc=2148465 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.10.041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another mechanism for avoiding inbreeding is evident when a female house mouse mates with multiple males. In such a case, there appears to be egg-driven sperm selection against sperm from related males.&lt;ref name="pmid26154782"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Firman RC, Simmons LW |title=Gametic interactions promote inbreeding avoidance in house mice |journal=Ecol. Lett. |volume=18 |issue=9 |pages=937–43 |year=2015 |pmid=26154782 |doi=10.1111/ele.12471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[toad]]s, male advertisement vocalizations may serve as cues by which females recognize their kin and thus avoid inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waldman | first1 = B | last2 = Rice | first2 = JE | last3 = Honeycutt | first3 = RL | year = 1992 | title = Kin recognition and incest avoidance in toads| journal = Am. Zool. | volume = 32 | pages = 18–30 | doi = 10.1093/icb/32.1.18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dioecy|dioecious]] plants, the [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]] may receive [[pollen]] from several different potential donors. As multiple [[pollen tube]]s from the different donors grow through the stigma to reach the [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]], the receiving maternal plant may carry out pollen selection favoring pollen from less related donor plants.&lt;ref name=Teixeira&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Teixeira S, Foerster K, Bernasconi G |title=Evidence for inbreeding depression and post-pollination selection against inbreeding in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia |journal=Heredity (Edinb) |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=101–12 |year=2009 |pmid=18698334 |doi=10.1038/hdy.2008.86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, kin recognition at the level of the pollen tube apparently leads to post-pollination selection to avoid inbreeding depression. Also, seeds may be aborted selectively depending on donor–recipient relatedness.&lt;ref name=Teixeira /&gt;

[[File:무령왕 금귀걸이.jpg|thumb|right|220px|A pair of king's earrings, made from gold and jade, early 6th century (Baekje). From tomb of [[Muryeong of Baekje|King Munyeong]]]]
The tradition of '''[[Korea]]n jade carving''' dates back to [[neolithic]] finds along the [[Namgang]] river basin in [[Gyeongju]]. Jade rings and accessories were worn by the higher classes of society, especially women, from the [[three kingdoms]] period and reached their peak in the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] dynasty, the golden age of jadework. Korean jadework often includes [[buddhist]] motifs, [[cicada]]s, and peanut-shaped good luck talismans on the small scale, as well as larger-scale architectural pieces.

==Contemporary jade masters==

Amongst the most famous is [[Jang Ju-won]] who has been designated Important Intangible cultural heritage No. 100. Jang is known for his refinement, and largely self-taught has recovered jadework for future generations.

==Local Markets==

In the local markets there now exists a wide variety of jade carvings and jewelry available for purchase.  These items are much less costly than their Chinese counterparts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5870">[[image:IJsselmeer satellite.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Markerwaard would be on what is now the [[Markermeer]]]]

The '''Markerwaard''' is the name of a proposed [[polder]] in the [[IJsselmeer]] that was never built. The construction of Markerwaard would have resulted in the near-total reclamation of the [[Markermeer]].

[[Cornelis Lely]]'s plan projected a polder in the south-west of the [[Zuiderzee]], originally named ''Hoornsche Polder'', referring to [[Hoorn]], then simply "Southwest Polder".&lt;ref&gt;Ir. J.F.R. van de Wall (1952): 'De groei van het ontwerp voor de Oosterpolder',  ''Ts. v.h. Kon. Ned. Aardr. Gen.'', 69:3, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the name was changed to Markerwaard Polder, after the island of  [[Marken]]. However, reclamation of three other polders took place first, and preparations for the Markerwaard were being made while draining of the northeast and southeast polders (today's [[Flevoland]]) were underway.

In 1941 work for this project started; about 2&amp;nbsp;km of a dike north of [[Marken]] was built. It would have had an area of nearly 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But the German occupation stopped the project. Later, it was decided that the [[Flevopolder]] should have priority. In 1957, the island of Marken was connected to mainland Holland. In 1976 the dam [[Houtribdijk]] connecting [[Enkhuizen]] and [[Lelystad]] was completed, a necessary step in the construction of Markerwaard, the dikes for the bordering lakes were still to be completed.  However the entire project became mired in political and environmental controversy.  In the late 1970s, the project was revised down leaving wide [[bordering lakes]] between the polder and [[North Holland]]. [[Marken]] would remain a peninsula, unlike on the original project. At this stage, the Markerwaard would have had an area of 410&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{asof|1961}} Markerwaard was expected to be finished in 1978.&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate on a final decision regarding it took over twenty years. The questions concerned the need, on one side, for more agricultural areas, new residential subdivisions, and a new airport (to relieve pressure on [[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]]). On the other side of the debate were primarily ecological issues, with the argument that the value of the lake as a recreation area was considered by some to be stronger than the potential benefits of the polder. Additionally, it was argued that, in case of drought, the lake would be very useful for the production of drinking water, and that in heavy weather, the lake serves as a buffer zone.

Finally, in 2003, it was decided not to build this polder.&lt;ref&gt;In de '''Nota Ruimte''' ''Ruimte voor ontwikkeling'', Deel 4 ''Definitieve versie'', Hoofdstuk 4 ''Gebieden en thema's'', Paragraaf 6 ''IJsselmeergebied'', Sub-paragraaf 4 ''Specifieke beleidskeuzen'', Kop 3 ''Buitendijkse ontwikkelingen'' staat op pag. 156: "De ruimtelijke reservering voor een Markerwaard vervalt."

In 2012, plans emerged to create the [[Marker Wadden]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-10683.html Intentieverklaring Marker Wadden, Rijkswaterstaat], Dutch government bulletin, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a group of islands designed to establish nature reserves in the north of the Markermeer.

The '''Max-Planck-Institute for Human Development''' (Max-Planck-Institut für Bildungsforschung) is an internationally renowned social science research organization. Located in [[Berlin]], it was initiated in 1961 and officially began operations in 1963 under the name Institute for Educational Research in the [[Max Planck Society]], before receiving its current name in 1971. Its co-founder and first director was Hellmut Becker. The institute is part of the Human Sciences Section of the Max Planck Society.

Research activities focus on the [[Developmental psychology|development]] and [[education]] of [[humans]], with an emphasis on [[basic research]]. The concept of education is defined broadly, embracing both formal educational processes as well as developmental processes from childhood to old age. Currently, around 350 employees contribute to interdisciplinary research in four research centers and four research groups.

Research Centers
# Center for Adaptive Rationality (Director: [[Ralph Hertwig]])
# Center for Lifespan Psychology (Managing Director: [[Ulman Lindenberger]])
# Research Center History of Emotions (Director: [[Ute Frevert]])

Research Groups
# Max Planck Research Group iSearch | Information Search, Ecological and Active Learning Research with Children (Head: Azzurra Ruggeri)
# Max Planck Research Group Neural and Computational Basis of Learning, Memory and Decision Making (Head: Nicolas Schuck)
# Max Planck Research Group Naturalistic Social Cognition (Head: Annie E. Wertz)
# Heisenberg Research Group Socio-Emotional Development and Health Across the Lifespan (Head: Michaela Riediger)
# Otto Hahn Research Group on Associative Memory in Old Age (Head: Yvonne Brehmer)

In addition, there are two more research centers:

# The Harding Center for Risk Literacy was opened in April 2009. Motivating its research is the vision of enlightened individuals who are equipped to deal with risks in the modern technological world in an informed way. Director of the Harding Center is [[Gerd Gigerenzer]].
#The Max Planck UCL Centre for Computational Psychiatry and Ageing Research took up its work in April 2014. It is the result of the existing collaboration between the Max Planck Society and University College London that began in 2011. The Centre is dedicated to studying the causes of psychiatric disorders as well as the causes of individual differences in cognitive development, with an emphasis on adulthood and old age. Two Co-Directors form the Leading Team of the Centre: Ray Dolan for [[University College London]] and [[Ulman Lindenberger]] for the [[Max Planck Society]].  

The Research Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition (Director:[[Gerd Gigerenzer]]) ended its activities in 2017. 

The Research Center of Educational Research (Director: [[Jürgen Baumert]]) ended its activities in 2010. Its best-known projects were the TIMS study ([[TIMSS]]) and the [[PISA]] study, whose results received wide attention by both the [[mass media]] and [[politicians]].

The institute is located in [[Wilmersdorf]], a neighbourhood in the southwest of Berlin, immediately bordering on the neighborhood of [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]], and is therefore considered part of Dahlem's traditional science district. This is home to a number of scientific organizations such as the [[Free University Berlin]], which works together with the institute.

The founding director of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development was [[Hellmut Becker]], subsequently joined by [[Dietrich Goldschmidt]] (1963) and [[Saul B. Robinsohn]] (1964) as the first generation of directors. They were followed by directors [[Wolfgang Edelstein]] (1973), [[Peter M. Roeder]] (1973) and [[Friedrich Edding]] (director from 1973), [[Paul B. Baltes]] (1980), [[Karl Ulrich Mayer]] (1983), [[Jürgen Baumert]] (1996), [[Gerd Gigerenzer]] (1997), [[Ulman Lindenberger]] (2003), [[Ute Frevert]] (2008), and [[Ralph Hertwig]] (2012).

'''Metapsychology''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''meta'' 'beyond, transcending', and ''ψυχολογία'' '[[psychology]]')&lt;ref name=OMD&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813174048/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?metapsychology Metapsychology Online Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is that aspect of any psychological theory which refers to the structure of the theory itself (hence the prefix "meta") rather than to the entity it describes. The psychology is about the psyche; the metapsychology is about the psychology. The term is used mostly in discourse about psychoanalysis, the psychology developed by [[Sigmund Freud]], which today is regarded as a branch of science (with roots in the work of Freud's scientific mentors and predecessors, especially Helmholtz, Brucke, Charcot, and Janet) and/or a hermeneutics of understanding (with roots in Freud's literary sources, especially Sophocles and, to a lesser extent, Goethe and Shakespeare).  Emphasis on the scientific status of psychoanalysis has been renewed in the emerging discipline of neuropsychoanalysis, whose major exemplar is Mark Solms. The hermeneutic vision of psychoanalysis is the focus of influential works by Donna Orange.

On March 10, 1898, he wrote to Fiess: "It seems to me that ({{lang-de|als ob}})&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Roudinesco |first=Élisabeth |authorlink=Élisabeth Roudinesco |last2=Plon |first2=Michel |title=Wörterbuch der Psychoanalyse.

A salient example of Freud's own metapsychology is his chracterization of psychoanalysis as a "simultaneously closed system, fundamentally unrelated and impervious to the external world and as an open system inherently connected and responsive to environmental influence''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Jonathan |title=The foundational wisdom in Freud's and Loewald's metapsychologies |journal=Modern Psychoanalysis |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=2–25 |publisher=Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/6559b62f61964d350d95da9f488c482a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=36244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s, Freud wrote a series of twelve essays, to be collected as ''Preliminaries to a Metapsychology''. Five of these were published independently under the titles: "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes," "Repression," "The Unconscious," "A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams," and "Mourning and Melancholia." The remaining seven remained unpublished, an expression of Freud's ambivalence about his own attempts to articulate the whole of his vision of psychoanalysis.  In 1919 he wrote to [[Lou Andreas-Salome]], "Where is my Metapsychology? In the first place it remains unwritten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud |first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |title=On metapsychology: the theory of psychoanalysis |page=102 |publisher=The Penguin Freud Library |volume=11 |location=London |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-140-13801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he published ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', a text with metaphysical ambitions.

'''Migration Period art''' denotes the artwork of the [[Germanic peoples]] during the [[Migration period]] (ca. 300-900). It includes the '''Migration art''' of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the [[Insular art]] or Hiberno-Saxon art of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] and Celtic fusion in the [[British Isles]]. It covers many different styles of art including the '''polychrome style''' and the [[animal style]]. After [[Christianization]], Migration Period art developed into various schools of Early [[Medieval art]] in Western Europe which are normally classified by region, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] and [[Carolingian art]], before the continent-wide styles of [[Romanesque art]] and finally [[Gothic art]] developed.

==Background==
[[File:Paar Prunkfibeln.jpg|thumb|Germanic ''[[Fibula_(brooch)|fibulae]]'', early 5th century]]
In the 3rd century, the [[Crisis of the 3rd Century|Roman Empire almost collapsed]] and its army was becoming increasingly [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] in make-up, so that in the 4th century when [[Huns]] pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The [[Visigoths]] settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the [[Franks]] settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] invaded [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. By the close of the 6th century the [[Western Roman Empire]] was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, [[Barbarian kingdoms|Germanic kingdoms]].

Although these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and became farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for "mobile" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes.  The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before [[Germanic Christianity|conversion to Christianity]] was buried with its owner.  Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived.

Three styles dominate Germanic art. The ''polychrome style'' originated with the [[Goths]] who had settled in the [[Black Sea]] area. The ''[[animal style]]'' was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was [[Insular art]] or the ''Hiberno-Saxon style'', a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, [[Celtic art|Celtic]], Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques.

During the 2nd century the Goths of southern [[Russia]] discovered a newfound taste for gold figurines and objects inlaid with precious stones. This style was borrowed from [[Scythians]] and the [[Sarmatians]], had some Greco-Roman influences, and was also popular with the Huns. Perhaps the most famous examples are found in the fourth-century [[Pietroasele treasure]] ([[Romania]]), which includes a great gold eagle [[brooch]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/20070114030307/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/metalwork02.jpg picture]). The eagle motif derives from East Asia and results from the participation of the forebears of the Goths in the Hunnic Empire, as in the fourth-century Gothic polychrome eagle-head belt buckle ([https://web.archive.org/web/19991018233910/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/metalwork12.jpg picture]) from South Russia.

The Goths carried this style to Italy, southern France and Spain. One well known example is the Ostrogothic eagle ([[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]) from [[Cesena]], Italy, now at the museum in [[Nuremberg]]. Another is the Visigothic polychrome [[votive crown]] ([https://web.archive.org/web/19991010193109/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/crown01.jpg picture]) of [[Recceswinth]], King of Toledo, found in a votive crown hoard of c. 670 at [[Fuente de Guarrazar]], near [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. The popularity of the style can be attested to by the discovery of a polychrome sword ([https://web.archive.org/web/19991014043050/http://www.hp.uab.edu/image_archive/ujg/metalwork05.jpg picture]) in the tomb of Frankish king [[Childeric I]] (died ''ca'' 481), well north of the Alps.

===Animal style===
{{Main|Animal style}}
[[Image:Sutton.Hoo.PurseLid.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|Purse lid from [[Sutton Hoo]], c. 625]]
The study of Northern European, or "Germanic", zoomorphic decoration was pioneered by [[Bernhard Salin]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Bernhard Salin|Biography on swedish Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; in a work published in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''Die altgermanische Thierornamentik'', Stockholm 1904, [http://openlibrary.org/works/OL4889930W/Die_altgermanische_Thierornamentik The Open Library online text], written in German and heavily illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; He classified animal art of the period roughly from 400 to 900 into three phases: Styles I, II and III. The origins of these different phases are still the subject of considerable debate; the development of trends in late-Roman popular art in the provinces is one element, and the older traditions of nomadic Asiatic steppe peoples another.  The first two styles are found very widely across Europe in the art of the "barbarian" peoples of the Migration Period.

'''Style I'''. First appears in northwest Europe, it became a noticeable new style with the introduction of the [[chip carving]] technique applied to bronze and silver in the 5th century. It is characterized by animals whose bodies are divided into sections, and typically appear at the fringes of designs whose main emphasis is on abstract patterns.

'''Style II'''. After about 560-570 Style I was in decline and Salin's Style II began to replace it.  Style II's animals are whole beasts, but their bodies are elongated into "ribbons" which intertwined into symmetrical shapes with no pretence of naturalism, and rarely any legs, so that they tend to be described as serpents, although the heads often have characteristics of other types of animal. The animal becomes subsumed into ornamental patterns, typically using [[interlace (art)|interlace]]. Thus two bears are facing each other in perfect symmetry ("confronted"), forming the shape of a heart. Examples of Style II can be found on the gold purse lid.

After about 700 localised styles develop, and it is no longer very useful to talk of a general Germanic style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yZVeZnUXMiAC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=Salin+animal+style&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Dj2KTNGGEY_KjAfQp4GKBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Salin%20animal%20style&amp;f=false Rituals of power: from late antiquity to the early Middle Ages],  By Frans Theuws, Janet L. Nelson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  Salin '''Style III''' is found mainly in Scandinavia, and may also be called [[Viking art]].

===Christian influence===
[[Byzantine enamel|Byzantine enameling]] highly influenced Migration period metalwork. The Church in the early Migration period emerged as the only supranational force in Europe after the collapse of the Roman Empire. It provided a unifying element and was the only institution left that could preserve selected rudiments of classical civilization. As the conversion of Germanic peoples by the end of the 7th centuries in western Europe neared completion, the church became the prime patron for art, commissioning [[illuminated manuscripts]] and other liturgical objects. The record shows a steady decline in Germanic forms and increasing Mediterranean influence. This process occurred quickly with the Goths of Italy and Spain and more slowly the further north one looked. This change can be observed in the 8th century [[Merovingian]] codex [[Gelasian Sacramentary]], it contained no Style II elements, instead showing Mediterranean examples of fish used to construct large letters at the start of chapters.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}

Insular art, often also known as [[Hiberno-Saxon art]], especially in relation to [[illuminated manuscript]]s) was confined to Great Britain and Ireland and was the fusion of Germanic traditions (via the Anglo-Saxons) with Celtic traditions (via Irish monks). It can first be seen in the late 7th century and the style would continue in Britain for about 150 years until the Viking invasions of the 9th century (after which we see the emergence of [[Anglo-Saxon art]]), and in Ireland up until the 12th century (after which see [[Romanesque art]]).

===History===
[[File:Ireland 2010 etc 029 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Tara Brooch]], front view, early 8th century.]]
Ireland was converted to Christianity by missions from Britain and the continent, beginning in the mid-fifth century, while simultaneously pagan [[Angles]], [[Saxons]] and [[Jutes]] were settling in England. The extreme political fragmentation of Ireland and its total lack of urban development prevented the emergence of a strong episcopal structure. Monasticism consequently emerged as the dominant force in Irish Christianity, and thus in Irish Christian art.

[[Celtic Christianity]] also developed a strong emphasis on missionary activity. Around 563 [[Saint Columba]] founded a base on the Scottish island of [[Iona]], from which to convert [[Picts|Pictish]] pagans in [[Scotland]]; this monastic settlement became long remained a key centre of Christian culture in northern Britain. Columban monks then went to [[Northumbria]] in 635 and founded a monastery on the island of [[Lindisfarne]], from which to convert the north of England. However Rome had already begun the conversion of the [[Anglo-Saxons]] from the south with a mission to [[Kent]] in 597. Conflict arose between the Irish monks and Rome on the date to celebrate Easter, leading to withdrawal of the Irish mission from Lindisfarne to Iona. However, the widespread use of Irish decorative forms in art produced in England, and vice versa, attests to the continuing importance of interaction between the two cultures. England would come under increasing Mediterranean influence, but not before Irish Celtic and Anglo-Saxon art had profitably fused.

The first major work that can be called purely Hiberno-Saxon is the [[Book of Durrow]] in the late 7th century. There followed a golden age in metalworking, manuscripts and stone sculpture. In the 9th century the heyday of the Hiberno-Saxon style neared its end, with the disruptions of Viking raids and the increasing dominance of Mediterranean forms (see [[Anglo-Saxon art]]).

===Illuminated manuscripts===
[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Book of Durrow]], 7th century Ireland. One of the earliest pieces of Hiberno-Saxon art. Trinity College Library, Dublin.]]
The surviving evidence of Irish [[Celtic art]] from the Iron Age period is dominated by metalwork in a [[La Tène style]].  [[Hanging bowl]]s such as those found at [[Sutton Hoo]] are among some of the most important of these crafts. As Irish missionaries began to spread the word of the Gospels they needed books, and almost from the start, they began to embellish their texts with artwork drawing from the designs of these metalworking traditions. The spirals and scrolls in the enlarged opening letters&amp;mdash;found in the earliest manuscripts such as the 7th century [[Cathach of St. Columba]] manuscript&amp;mdash;borrows in style directly from Celtic enamels and La Tène metalworking motifs.

After the Cathach of St. Columba, book decoration became increasingly more complex and new styles from other cultures were introduced. [[Carpet page]]s&amp;mdash;entire pages of ornamentation with no text&amp;mdash;were inserted, usually at the start of each Gospel. The geometric motifs and [[interlace (visual arts)|interlaced]] patterns may have been influences from [[Copts|Coptic]] Egypt or elsewhere in the Byzantine Middle East.  The increasing use of animal ornamentation was an Anglo-Saxon contribution of its animal style. All of these influences and traditions combined into what could be called a new Hiberno-Saxon style, with the [[Book of Durrow]] in the later 7th century being the first of its type. The [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] is another famous example.

The [[Book of Kells]] was probably created in Iona in the 8th century. When the monks fled to Ireland in the face of Viking raids in 807, they probably brought it with them to Kells in Ireland. It is the most richly decorated of the Hiberno-Saxon manuscripts and represents a large array of techniques and motifs created during the 8th century.

===Metalworking===
In the 7th century there emerged a resurgence of [[metalwork]]ing with new techniques such as gold [[filigree]] that allowed ever smaller and more detailed ornamentations, especially on the penannular and [[pseudo-penannular]] [[Celtic brooch]]es that were important symbols of status for the elite, and also worn by clergy as part of their [[vestment]]s. The [[Tara Brooch]] and [[Ardagh Hoard]] are among the most magnificent Insular examples, whilst the 7th century royal jewellery from the [[Sutton Hoo]] ship burial shows a Pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon style. They brought together all of the available skills of the [[goldsmith]] in one piece: ornamentation applied to a variety of techniques and materials, [[chip carving]], [[filigree]], [[cloisonné]] and [[rock crystal]].

===Stone sculpture===
{{Main|High cross}}
The skills displayed in metalworking can be seen in stone [[sculpture]]s. For many centuries it had been Irish custom to display a large wooden cross inside the monastic building enclosure. These were then translated into stone crosses called [[high cross]]es and covered with the same intricate patterns used by goldsmiths, and often figure sculptures.

'''MIRIAM''' (Minimum Information Required In The Annotation of Models&lt;ref&gt;The original article used the verb "requested", but this has evolved through community use into "required", and is in line with other Minimum Information (MI) standards available through the MIBBI portal&lt;/ref&gt;) is a community-level effort to standardize  the annotation and curation processes of quantitative models of biological systems.&lt;ref name="pmid16333295"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt1156 |title=Minimum information requested in the annotation of biochemical models (MIRIAM) |year=2005 |last1=Novère |first1=Nicolas Le |last2=Finney |first2=Andrew |last3=Hucka |first3=Michael |last4=Bhalla |first4=Upinder S |last5=Campagne |first5=Fabien |last6=Collado-Vides |first6=Julio |last7=Crampin |first7=Edmund J |last8=Halstead |first8=Matt |last9=Klipp |first9=Edda |last10=Mendes |first10=Pedro |last11=Nielsen |first11=Poul |last12=Sauro |first12=Herbert |last13=Shapiro |first13=Bruce |last14=Snoep |first14=Jacky L |last15=Spence |first15=Hugh D |last16=Wanner |first16=Barry L |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1509–15 |pmid=16333295|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a set of guidelines suitable for use with any structured format, allowing different groups to collaborate and share resulting models. Adherence to these guidelines also facilitates the sharing of software and service infrastructures built upon modeling activities.

The idea of "a set of good practices" including "some obligatory metadata" was first proposed by Nicolas Le Novère in October 2004 as part of a discussion to develop a common database of models in systems biology (which led to the creation of [[BioModels Database]]). These initial ideas were further refined at a meeting in Heidelberg, during [[International Conference on Systems Biology|ICSB]] 2004, with representatives from many other interested groups.

'''MIRIAM''' is a registered project of the MIBBI (minimum information for biological and biomedical investigations).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mibbi.org/ Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations{{psc|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MIRIAM Guidelines==

The '''MIRIAM Guidelines''' are composed of three parts, ''reference correspondence'', ''attribution annotation'', and ''external resource annotation'', each of which deals with a different aspect of information that should be included within a model.

===Reference correspondence===

'Reference correspondence' deals with the basic reference information needed to make use of the model, detailing on a gross level the format of the model file, and its instantiability for simulation purposes.

* The model file must be encoded in a public, standardized, machine-readable format ([[SBML]], [[CellML]], [[GENESIS (software)|GENESIS]], ...).
* The model file must be valid with respect to its encoding schema.
* The model must be associated with a reference description or publication detailing its origin, even if it is a composite.
* The encoded model structure must reflect the (biological) process(es) detailed in the reference description.
* The model must be instantiable; necessary quantitative parameters, such as initial conditions, should be provided if they are needed for a simulation.
* When instantiated, the model must be capable of reproducing representative results as given in the reference description, within an epsilon (algorithms, round-up errors).

===Attribution annotation===

'Attribution annotation' deals with the attribution information that must be embedded within the model file.

* The model must have a name.
* The model must include a citation of the reference description identifying the authors of the model.
* The model must include the name and contact details of the model creators.
* The date and time of model creation and last modification should be specified. A model history is useful but not required.
* The model should be linked to a precise statement about its terms of use and distribution, regardless of whether it is 'free to use' or not.

===External resource annotation===

'External resource annotation' defines the manner in which annotations should be constructed. Those annotations contain references to entities in databases, classifications, ontologies, etc. One of the purposes of annotation is to allow unambiguous identification of the various model components.

* The annotation must unambiguously relate a piece of knowledge to a model constituent.
* The referenced information should be described using a triplet &lt;code&gt;{data collection, collection-specific identifier, optional qualifier}&lt;/code&gt;:
** The annotation should be expressed as a [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI).
**  The collection-specific identifier should be analysed within the framework of the data collection.
** Qualifiers (optional) should be used to refine the link between the model components and the referenced information, for example "has_a", "is_version_of" and "is_homolog_to".

More information about the existing qualifiers is available from BioModels.net.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biomodels.net/qualifiers/ |title=website |publisher=Biomodels.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So far, annotation is mainly a manual work, so to ensure their longevity the usage of perennial URIs is necessary. It was recognised that the generation of valid and unique URIs for annotation required the creation of a catalogue of shared namespaces for use by the community. This function is provided by the [[MIRIAM Registry]]. The Registry also provides a variety of supporting auxiliary features to enable automated procedures based upon these URIs. The ability to generate resolvable identifiers is provided through the use of the resolving layer, [[Identifiers.org]].

'''Niklas Luhmann''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|m|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈluːman|lang}}; December 8, 1927 – November 6, 1998) was a [[Germany|German]] [[sociologist]], philosopher of social science, and a prominent thinker in [[systems theory]], who is considered one of the most important social theorists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bechmann and Stehr, 'The Legacy of Niklas Luhmann' Society (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Luhmann was born in [[Lüneburg]], [[Prussia]], where his father's family had been running a [[brewery]] for several generations. After graduating from the Johanneum school in 1943, he was conscripted as a [[Luftwaffenhelfer]] in [[World War II]] and served for two years until, at the age of 17, he was taken [[prisoner of war]] by American troops in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;In an interview Luhmann once said: ''"... die Behandlung war –&amp;nbsp;gelinde gesagt&amp;nbsp;– nicht nach den Regeln der internationalen Konventionen".'' Source: Detlef Horster (1997), ''Niklas Luhmann'', München, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war Luhmann studied law at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]] from 1946 to 1949, when he obtained a law degree, and then began a career in Lüneburg's public administration. During a sabbatical in 1961, he went to [[Harvard]], where he met and studied under [[Talcott Parsons]], then the world's most influential social systems theorist.

In later years, Luhmann dismissed Parsons' theory, developing a rival approach of his own. Leaving the civil service in 1962, he lectured at the national [[Deutsche Hochschule für Verwaltungswissenschaften]] (University for Administrative Sciences) in [[Speyer]], Germany, until 1965, when he was offered a position at the [[Sozialforschungsstelle]] (Social Research Centre) of the [[University of Münster]], led by [[Helmut Schelsky]].
1965/66 he studied one semester of sociology at the University of Münster.

Two earlier books were retroactively accepted as a PhD thesis and [[habilitation]] at the University of Münster in 1966, qualifying him for a university professorship. In 1968/1969, he briefly served as a lecturer at [[Theodor Adorno]]'s former chair at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] and then was appointed full professor of sociology at the newly founded [[University of Bielefeld]], Germany (until 1993). He continued to publish after his retirement, when he finally found the time to complete his magnum opus, ''Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft'' (literally, "The Society of Society"), which was published in 1997, and translated subsequently in English, under the title "Theory of Society" (volume I in 2012 and volume II in 2013).

==Works==
Luhmann wrote prolifically, with more than 70 books and nearly 400 scholarly articles published on a variety of subjects, including law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. While his theories have yet to make a major mark in American sociology, his theory is currently well known and popular in German sociology,&lt;ref name="(Roth 2011)"&gt;Roth, S. (2011) Les deux angleterres et le continent. Anglophone sociology as the guardian of Old European semantics, Journal of Sociocybernetics, Vol. 9, No. 1-2, available for [http://ssrn.com/abstract=2265350 download at SSRN]&lt;/ref&gt; and has also been rather intensively received in [[Japan]] and Eastern Europe, including [[Russia]]. His relatively low profile elsewhere is partly due to the fact that translating his work is a difficult task, since his writing presents a challenge even to readers of German, including many sociologists. (p. xxvii Social Systems 1995)

Much of Luhmann's work directly deals with the operations of the legal system and his autopoietic theory of law is regarded as one of the more influential contributions to the [[sociology of law]] and socio-legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N, ''A Sociological Theory of Law'' (1985) and ''Law As a Social System'', translated by Klaus A. Ziegert (Oxford University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Luhmann is probably best known to North Americans for his debate with the [[critical theory|critical theorist]] [[Jürgen Habermas]] over the potential of [[social system]]s theory. Like his one-time mentor [[Talcott Parsons]], Luhmann is an advocate of "grand theory," although neither in the sense of philosophical foundationalism nor in the sense of "meta-narrative" as often invoked in the critical works of post-modernist writers. Rather, Luhmann's work tracks closer to complexity theory broadly speaking, in that it aims to address any aspect of social life within a universal theoretical framework - of which the diversity of subjects he wrote about is an indication. Luhmann's theory is sometimes dismissed as highly abstract and complex, particularly within the Anglophone world, whereas his work has had a more lasting influence on scholars from German-speaking countries, Scandinavia and Italy.&lt;ref name="(Roth 2011)"/&gt;

Luhmann himself described his theory as "labyrinth-like" or "non-linear" and claimed he was deliberately keeping his prose enigmatic to prevent it from being understood "too quickly", which would only produce simplistic misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;"Niklas Luhmann: Unverständliche Wissenschaft: Probleme einer theorieeigenen Sprache, in: Luhmann, ''Soziologische Aufklärung 3: Soziales System, Gesellschaft, Organisation''. Wiesbaden: VS Verlag, 4th. ed. 2005, pp. 193-205, quote on p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems theory===
Luhmann's systems theory focuses on three topics, which are interconnected in his entire work.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann (1975), "Systemtheorie, Evolutionstheorie und Kommunikationstheorie", in: ''Soziologische Gids'' 22 3. pp.154–168&lt;/ref&gt;
# Systems theory as societal theory
# Communication theory and
# Evolution theory
The core element of Luhmann's theory, pivots around the problem of the contingency of the meaning and thereby it becomes a theory of [[communication]]. Social systems are systems of communication, and society is the most encompassing social system. Being the social system that comprises all (and only) communication, today's society is a world society.&lt;ref&gt;Niklas Luhmann. (1982). The World Society as a Social System. International Journal of General Systems, 8:3, 131-138.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[system]] is defined by a boundary between itself and its [[social environment|environment]], dividing it from an infinitely complex, or (colloquially) chaotic, exterior. The interior of the system is thus a zone of reduced complexity: Communication within a system operates by selecting only a limited amount of all information available outside. This process is also called "reduction of complexity".
The criterion according to which information is selected and processed is meaning (in German, ''Sinn''). Both social systems and psychic  systems (see below for an explanation of this distinction) operate by processing meaning.

Furthermore, each system has a distinctive identity that is constantly reproduced in its communication and depends on what is considered meaningful and what is not. If a system fails to maintain that identity, it ceases to exist as a system and dissolves back into the environment it emerged from. Luhmann called this process of reproduction from elements previously filtered from an over-complex environment [[autopoiesis]] (pronounced "auto-poy-E-sis"; literally: self-creation), using a term coined in [[cognitive biology]] by Chilean thinkers [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]]. Social systems are ''operationally closed'' in that while they use and rely on resources from their environment, those resources do not become part of the systems' operation. Both thought and digestion are important preconditions for communication, but neither appears in communication as such. Note, however, that Maturana argued very vocally that this appropriation of autopoietic theory was conceptually unsound, as it presupposes the autonomy of communications from actual persons. That is, by describing social systems as operationally closed networks of communications, Luhmann (according to Maturana) ignores the fact that communications presuppose human communicators. Autopoiesis only applies to networks of processes that reproduce themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varela, F., Maturana, H., &amp; Uribe, R.|title=Autopoiesis: The organization of living systems, its characterization and a model|journal=Biosystems|year=1974|volume=5|pages=187–196|doi=10.1016/0303-2647(74)90031-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but communications are reproduced by humans. For this reason, the analogy from biology to sociology does not, in this case, hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maturana, H., &amp; Poerkson, B.|title=From Being to Doing: The Origins of the Biology of Cognition|year=2004|publisher=Carl Auer International|isbn=3896704486|pages=105–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Luhmann explicitly stressed that he does not refer to a "society without humans", but to the fact that communication is autopoietic. Communication is made possible by human bodies and consciousness&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, pp.56.&lt;/ref&gt;, but this does not make communication operationally open. To "participate" in communication, one must be able to render one's thoughts and perceptions into elements of communication. This can only ever occur as a communicative operation (thoughts and perceptions cannot be directly transmitted) and must therefore satisfy internal system conditions that are specific to communication: intelligibility, reaching and addressee and gaining acceptance&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Luhmann likens the operation of autopoiesis (the filtering and processing of information from the environment) to a [[program (management)|program]], making a series of logical distinctions (in German, ''Unterscheidungen''). Here, Luhmann refers to the British mathematician [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s logic of distinctions that Maturana and Varela had earlier identified as a model for the functioning of any cognitive process. The supreme criterion guiding the "self-creation" of any given system is a defining [[binary code]]. This binary code is not to be confused with the computers operation: Luhmann (following Spencer-Brown and [[Gregory Bateson]]) assumes that auto-referential systems are continuously confronted with the dilemma of disintegration/continuation. This dilemma is framed with an ever-changing set of available choices; every one of those potential choices can be the system's selection or not (a binary state, selected/rejected). The influence of Spencer-Brown's book, ''[[Laws of Form]]'', on Luhmann can hardly be overestimated.

Although Luhmann first developed his understanding of social systems theory under Parsons' influence, he soon moved away from the Parsonian concept. The most important difference is that Parsons framed systems as forms of [[Action theory (sociology)|action]], in accordance with the [[AGIL paradigm]]. Parsons' systems theory treats systems as [[Open system (systems theory)|operationally open]], and interactive through an [[Input/output|input and output schema]]. Influenced by [[second-order cybernetics]], Luhmann instead treats systems as [[autopoietic]] and [[Open_and_closed_systems_in_social_science#Sociology|operationally closed]]&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Introduction to Systems Theory''. Polity, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. Systems must continually construct themselves and their perspective of reality through processing the distinction between system and [[Environment (systems)|environment]], and self-reproduce themselves as the product of their own elements. Social systems are defined by Luhmann not as action but as [[Recursion|recursive]] communication. Modern society is defined as a world system consisting of the sum total of all communication happening at once&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, pp. 83-99.&lt;/ref&gt;, and individual function systems (such as the economy, politics, science, love, art, the media, etc.) are described as social subsystems which have "outdifferentiated" from the social system and achieved their own operational closure and autopoiesis&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 2''. Stanford University Press, 2013, pp. 65ff.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Another difference is that Parsons asks how certain subsystems contribute to the functioning of overall society. Luhmann starts with the  [[Differentiation (sociology)|differentiation of the systems]]  themselves out of a nondescript environment. While he does observe how certain systems fulfill functions that contribute to "society" as a whole, he dispenses with the assumption of ''a priori'' [[Collective consciousness|cultural or normative consensus]] or "complimentary purpose" which was common to Durkheim and Parsons' conceptualization of a social function&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;. For Luhmann, functional differentiation is a consequence of selective pressure under temporalized complexity, and it occurs as function systems independently establish their own ecological niches by performing a function&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 1''. Stanford University Press, 2012, esp. pp. 336-343.&lt;/ref&gt;. Functions are therefore not the coordinated components of the organic social whole, but rather contingent and selective responses to reference problems which obey no higher principle of order and could have been responded to in other ways.

Finally, the systems' autopoietic closure is another fundamental difference from Parsons' concept. Each system works strictly according to its very own code and can observe other systems only by applying its code to their operations. For example, the code of the economy involves the application of the distinction between payment and non-payment. Other system operations appear within the economic field of references only insofar as this economic code can be applied to them. Hence, a political decision becomes an economic operation when it is observed as a government spending money or not. Likewise, a legal judgement may also be an economic operation when settlement of a contractual dispute obliges one party to pay for the goods or services they had acquired. The codes of the economy, politics and law operate autonomously, but their "interpenetration"&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Social Systems''. Stanford University Press, 1995, Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; is evident when observing "events"&lt;ref&gt;Luhmann, N. ''Theory of Society, Vol. 2''. Stanford University Press, 2013, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; which simultaneously involve the participation of more than one system.

One seemingly peculiar, but within the overall framework strictly logical, axiom of Luhmann's theory is the human being's position outside any social system, initially developed by Parsons. Consisting of "pure communicative actions" (a reference to [[Jürgen Habermas]]) any social system requires human consciousnesses (personal or psychical systems) as an obviously necessary, but nevertheless environmental resource. In Luhmann's terms, human beings are neither part of society nor of any specific systems, just as they are not part of a conversation. Luhmann himself once said concisely that he was "not interested in people". That is not to say that people were not a matter for Luhmann, but rather, the communicative actions of people are constituted (but not defined) by society, and society is constituted (but not defined) by the communicative actions of people: society is people's environment, and people are society's environment. Thus, sociology can explain how persons can change society; the influence of the environment (the people) on the system (the society), the so-called ''"structural coupling"''. In fact Luhmann himself replied to the relevant criticism by stating that "In fact the theory of autopoietic systems could bear the title ''Taking Individuals Seriously'', certainly more seriously than our humanistic tradition" (Niklas Luhmann, ''Operational Closure and Structural Coupling: The Differentiation of the Legal System'', Cardozo Law Review, vol. 13: 1422). This approach has attracted criticism from those who argue that Luhmann has at no point demonstrated the operational closure of social systems, or in fact that autopoietic social systems actually exist. He has instead taken this as a premise or presupposition, resulting in the logical need to exclude humans from social systems, which prevents the social systems view from accounting for the individual behavior, action, motives, or indeed existence of any individual person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autopoiesis in Organization: Theory and Practice|year=2009|publisher=Emerald|location=Bingley, UK|pages=111–129|author=Fuchs, C., &amp; Hofkirchner, W.|chapter=Autopoiesis and Critical Social Systems Theory. In Magalhães, R., Sanchez, R., (Eds.),}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luhmann was devoted to the ideal of non-normative science introduced to sociology in the early 20th century by [[Max Weber]] and later re-defined and defended against its critics by [[Karl Popper]]. However, in an academic environment that never strictly separated descriptive and normative theories of society, Luhmann's sociology has widely attracted criticism from various intellectuals, including [[Jürgen Habermas]].{{fact|date=March 2017}}

===Luhmann's reception===
Luhmann's systems theory is not without its critics; his definitions of "autopoietic" and "social system" differ from others.
At the same time his theory is being applied or used worldwide by sociologists and other scholars. It is often used in analyses dealing with [[Corporate Social Responsibility|corporate social responsibility]], organisational [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]], [[Governance|governance structures]] as well as with [[sociology of law]] and of course general [[sociology]].
===Miscellaneous===
Luhmann also appears as a character in [[Paul Wühr]]'s work of literature ''[[Das falsche Buch]]'', together with - among others - [[Ulrich Sonnemann]], [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]].

Luhmann owned a pub ("Pons") in his parents' house in his native town of [[Lüneburg]]. The house, which also contained his father's brewery, had been in his family's hands since 1857.

'''Ornithology''' is a branch of [[zoology]] that concerns the study of [[birds]]. Several aspects of ornithology differ from related disciplines, due partly to the high visibility and the aesthetic appeal of birds.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, Ian|year=1998|title=Population limitation in birds|publisher=Academic Press|page=2|isbn=978-0-12-517366-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The science of ornithology has a long history and studies on birds have helped develop several key concepts in evolution, behaviour and ecology such as the definition of [[species]], the process of [[speciation]], [[instinct]], [[learning]], [[ecological niche]]s, [[guild (ecology)|guilds]], [[island biogeography]], [[phylogeography]], and [[bird conservation|conservation]].&lt;ref name=mayr&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mayr, E.|year=1984|title=Commentary: The Contributions of Ornithology to Biology|journal=BioScience|volume=34|issue=4|pages=250–255|doi=10.2307/1309464|jstor=1309464|bibcode=1985BioSc..35..499W}}&lt;/ref&gt; While early ornithology was principally concerned with descriptions and distributions of species, ornithologists today seek answers to very specific questions, often using birds as models to test hypotheses or predictions based on theories. Most modern biological theories apply across taxonomic groups, and the number of professional scientists who identify themselves as "ornithologists" has therefore declined.&lt;ref name=bibby2003/&gt; A wide range of tools and techniques is used in ornithology, both inside the laboratory and out in the field, and innovations are constantly made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sutherland, W.

==Etymology==
The word "ornithology" comes from the late 16th-century Latin ''ornithologia'' meaning "bird science" from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ὄρνις ''ornis'' ("bird") and λόγος ''logos'' ("theory, science, thought").&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|ornithology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of ornithology}}
The history of ornithology largely reflects the trends in the [[history of biology]], as well as many other scientific disciplines, including [[ecology]], [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[paleontology]], and more recently, molecular biology. Trends include the move from mere descriptions to the identification of patterns, thus towards elucidating the processes that produce these patterns.

The earliest record of falconry comes from the reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC) in [[Assyria]]. Falconry is thought to have made its entry to Europe only after AD 400, brought in from the east after invasions by the [[Huns]] and [[Alans]]. Starting from the eighth century, numerous Arabic works on the subject and general ornithology were written, as well as translations of the works of ancient writers from Greek and [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. In the 12th and 13th centuries,  crusades and conquest had subjugated Islamic territories in southern Italy, central Spain, and the Levant under European rule, and for the first time translations into Latin of the great works of Arabic and Greek scholars were made with the help of Jewish and Muslim scholars, especially in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], which had fallen into Christian hands in 1085 and whose libraries had escaped destruction. [[Michael Scot]]us from Scotland made a Latin translation of Aristotle's work on animals from Arabic here around 1215, which was disseminated widely and was the first time in a millennium that this foundational text on zoology became available to Europeans. Falconry was popular in the [[Normans|Norman]] court in Sicily, and a number of works on the subject were written in [[Palermo]]. [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] (1194–1250) learned about an falconry during his youth in Sicily and later built up a [[menagerie]] and sponsored translations of Arabic texts, among which the popular Arabic work known as the ''[[Moamyn|Liber Moaminus]]'' by an unknown author which was translated into Latin by Theodore of Antioch from Syria in 1240-1241 as the ''De Scientia Venandi per Aves'', and also Michael Scotus (who had removed to Palermo) translated [[Avicenna|Ibn Sīnā]]'s ''Kitāb al-Ḥayawān'' of 1027 for the Emperor, a commentary and scientific update of Aristotle's work which was part of Ibn Sīnā's massive ''[[The Book of Healing|Kitāb al-Šifāʾ]]''. Frederick II eventually wrote his own treatise on falconry, the ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', in which he related his ornithological observations and the results of the hunts and experiments his court enjoyed performing.&lt;ref name="egerton"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Egerton, F. |year=2003 |title=A History of the Ecological Sciences, Part 8: Fredrick II of Hohenstaufen: Amateur Avian Ecologist and Behaviorist |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=40–44|url=http://esapubs.org/bulletin/current/history_list/history_part8.pdf|doi=10.1890/0012-9623(2003)84[40:AHOTES]2.0.CO;2 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=van Oppenraay |first=Aafke M.I. |date=2017 |title=Avicenna's ''Liber de animalibus'' ('''Abbreviatio Avicennae''') - Preliminaries and State of Affairs |url=https://pure.knaw.nl/ws/files/6003490/Avicenna_s_Liber_de_animalibus_Abbreviatio_Avicennae_._VanOppenraay_2017.pdf |journal=Documenti e Studi Sulla Tradizione Filosofica Medievale |volume=28 |pages=401–416 |doi= |access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several early German and French scholars compiled old works and conducted new research on birds. These included [[Guillaume Rondelet]], who described his observations in the Mediterranean, and [[Pierre Belon]], who described the fish and birds that he had seen in France and the Levant. Belon's ''Book of Birds'' (1555) is a folio volume with descriptions of some 200 species. His comparison of the skeleton of humans and birds is considered as a landmark in [[comparative anatomy]].&lt;ref name="miall"&gt;{{cite book |author=Miall, L.

[[William Turner (ornithologist)|William Turner]]'s ''Historia Avium'' (''History of Birds''), published at [[Cologne]] in 1544, was an early ornithological work from England. He noted the commonness of [[red kite|kite]]s in English cities where they snatched food out of the hands of children. He included folk beliefs such as those of anglers. Anglers believed that the [[osprey]] emptied their fishponds and would kill them, mixing the flesh of the osprey into their fish bait. Turner's work reflected the violent times in which he lived, and stands in contrast to later works such as [[Gilbert White]]'s ''[[The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne]]'' that were written in a tranquil era.&lt;ref name="miall"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gilbertwhite"&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Gilbert |title=The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne |year= 1887 |origyear=1789 |location=London |publisher=Cassell &amp; Company| oclc=3423785 |pages=38–39 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20933/20933-h/20933-h.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[Francis Willughby]] (1635–1672) and [[John Ray]] (1627–1705) came up with the first major system of bird classification that was based on function and morphology rather than on form or behaviour. Willughby's ''Ornithologiae libri tres'' (1676) completed by John Ray is sometimes considered to mark the beginning of scientific ornithology. Ray also worked on ''Ornithologia'', which was published posthumously in 1713 as ''Synopsis methodica avium et piscium''.&lt;ref name="white"&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |year=1999 |title=Ornithology Collections in the Libraries at Cornell University: A Descriptive Guide |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/ornithology/guide/hillguide.htm |accessdate=2007-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest list of British birds, ''Pinax Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum'', was written by [[Christopher Merrett]] in 1667, but authors such as John Ray considered it of little value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Koinm, Albert J. |year=2000 |title=Christopher Merrett's Use of Experiment |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=23–32 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.2000.0093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray did, however, value the expertise of the naturalist [[Sir Thomas Browne]] (1605–82), who not only answered his queries on ornithological identification and nomenclature, but also those of Willoughby and Merrett in letter correspondence.

Towards the late 18th century, [[Mathurin Jacques Brisson]] (1723–1806) and [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Comte de Buffon]] (1707–1788) began new works on birds. Brisson produced a six-volume work ''Ornithologie'' in 1760 and Buffon's included nine volumes (volumes 16–24) on birds ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux'' (1770–1785) in his work on science ''Histoire naturelle générale et particulière'' (1749–1804). Jacob Temminck sponsored [[François Le Vaillant]] [1753–1824] to collect bird specimens in Southern Africa and Le Vaillant's six-volume ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux d'Afrique'' (1796–1808) included many non-African birds. His other bird books produced in collaboration with the artist Barraband are considered among the most valuable illustrated guides ever produced. [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]] (1748–1831) spent 10 years studying North American birds and wrote the ''Histoire naturelle des oiseaux de l'Amerique septentrionale'' (1807–1808?). Vieillot pioneered in the use of life histories and habits in classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=White, Jeanne A. |title=Hill Collection — 18th c.

In the early 19th century, [[Lewis and Clark]] studied and identified many birds in the western United States. [[John James Audubon]], born in 1785, observed and painted birds in France and later in the [[Ohio]] and [[Mississippi]] valleys. From 1827 to 1838, Audubon published ''[[Birds of America (book)|The Birds of America]]'', which was engraved by [[Havell family|Robert Havell, Sr.]] and his son Robert Havell, Jr. Containing 435 engravings, it is often regarded as the greatest ornithological work in history.

===Scientific studies===
[[File:Bird eggs.jpg|thumb|left|Early bird study focused on collectibles such as eggs and nests.]]
The emergence of ornithology as a scientific discipline began in the 18th century, when [[Mark Catesby]] published his two-volume ''Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands'', a landmark work which included 220 hand-painted engravings and was the basis for many of the species [[Carl Linnaeus]] described in the 1758 ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]''. Linnaeus' work revolutionised bird taxonomy by assigning every species a [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]], categorising them into different genera.
However, ornithology did not emerge as a specialised science until the Victorian era—with the concept of natural history, and the collection of natural objects such as bird eggs and skins.&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite book|author=Allen, David E.|year=1994|title=The naturalist in Britain: a social history|isbn=978-0691036328|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Farber, Paul L.|year=1982|title=The Emergence of Ornithology as a Scientific Discipline, 1760–1850|publisher=D. Reidel Publishing Company, Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specialization led to the formation in Britain of the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] in 1858. In 1859, the members founded its journal ''[[The Ibis]]''. The sudden spurt in ornithology was also due in part to [[colonialism]]. At 100 years later, in 1959, [[Reginald Ernest Moreau|R. E. Moreau]] noted that ornithology in this period was preoccupied with the geographical distributions of various species of birds.&lt;ref name="ibis-history"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Kristin|year=2004|title=''The Ibis'': Transformations in a Twentieth Century British Natural History Journal|journal=Journal of the History of Biology|volume=37|pages=515–555| doi=10.1007/s10739-004-1499-3|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bird collectors of the Victorian era observed the variations in bird forms and habits across geographic regions, noting local specialization and variation in widespread species. The collections of museums and private collectors grew with contributions from various parts of the world. The naming of species with binomials and the organization of birds into groups based on their similarities became the main work of museum specialists. The variations in widespread birds across geographical regions caused the introduction of trinomial names.
[[File:KaupClassification.svg|thumb|Kaup's classification of the crow family]]
The search for patterns in the variations of birds was attempted by many. [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] (1775–1854), his student [[Johann Baptist von Spix]] (1781–1826), and several others believed that a hidden and innate mathematical order existed in the forms of birds. They believed that a "natural" classification was available and superior to "artificial" ones. A particularly popular idea was the [[Quinarian system]] popularised by [[Nicholas Aylward Vigors]] (1785–1840), [[William Sharp Macleay]] (1792–1865), [[William John Swainson|William Swainson]], and others. The idea was that nature followed a "rule of five" with five groups nested hierarchically. Some had attempted a rule of four, but [[Johann Jakob Kaup]] (1803–1873) insisted that the number five was special, noting that other natural entities such as the senses also came in fives. He followed this idea and demonstrated his view of the order within the crow family. Where he failed to find five genera, he left a blank insisting that a new genus would be found to fill these gaps. These ideas were replaced by more complex "maps" of affinities in works by [[Hugh Edwin Strickland]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name=ohara&gt;{{cite journal|author=O’Hara, Robert J.|year=1988|title=Diagrammatic classifications of birds, 1819–1901: views of the natural system in 19th-century British ornithology|pages=2746–2759 |journal=Acta XIX Congressus Internationalis Ornithologici|url=http://rjohara.net/cv/1988-ioc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1975|isbn=978-0-674-64485-4|author=Stresemann, Erwin|title=Ornithology.

The [[Galapagos]] [[finch]]es were especially influential in the development of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution. His contemporary [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] also noted these variations and the geographical separations between different forms leading to the study of [[biogeography]]. Wallace was influenced by the work of [[Philip Lutley Sclater]] on the distribution patterns of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sclater, P.

[[File:SwainsonQuinarian.jpg|thumb|right|[[Quinarian system]] of bird classification by Swainson]]
For Darwin, the problem was how species arose from a common ancestor, but he did not attempt to find rules for delineation of species. The [[species problem]] was tackled by the ornithologist [[Ernst Mayr]], who was able to demonstrate that geographical isolation and the accumulation of genetic differences led to the splitting of species.&lt;ref name=konishi&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Konishi, Masakazu |author2=Emlen, Stephen T. |author3=Ricklefs, Robert E. |author4=Wingfield, John C.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1989|title=Contributions of Bird Studies to Biology|journal=Science|volume=246|issue=4929|pages=465–472|doi=10.1126/science.2683069|pmid=2683069|bibcode = 1989Sci...246..465K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ornithology and the genesis of the Synthetic Theory of Evolution|last=Junker|first=Thomas|journal=Avian Science|volume=3|issue=2&amp;3|pages=65–73|year=2003|url=http://www.thomas-junker.homepage.t-online.de/pdf/03tjas.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early ornithologists were preoccupied with matters of species identification. Only systematics counted as true science and field studies were considered inferior through much of the 19th century.&lt;ref name=haffer/&gt; In 1901, [[Robert Ridgway]] wrote in the introduction to ''The Birds of North and Middle America'' that:
{{quote|There are two essentially different kinds of ornithology: systematic or scientific, and popular. The former deals with the structure and classification of birds, their synonymies, and technical descriptions. The latter treats of their habits, songs, nesting, and other facts pertaining to their life histories.}}
This early idea that the study of living birds was merely recreation held sway until ecological theories became the predominant focus of ornithological studies.&lt;ref name=mayr/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt; The study of birds in their habitats was particularly advanced in Germany with [[bird ringing]] stations established as early as 1903. By the 1920s, the ''Journal für Ornithologie'' included many papers on the behaviour, ecology, anatomy, and physiology, many written by [[Erwin Stresemann]]. Stresemann changed the editorial policy of the journal, leading both to a unification of field and laboratory studies and a shift of research from museums to universities.&lt;ref name=haffer&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Archives of Natural History|volume=35|issue=1|pages=76–87|year=2008|title=The origin of modern ornithology in Europe|author=Haffer, J.|doi=10.3366/E0260954108000077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ornithology in the United States continued to be dominated by museum studies of morphological variations, species identities, and geographic distributions, until it was influenced by Stresemann's student Ernst Mayr.&lt;ref name="barrow"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barrow, Mark V.|year=1998|title=A passion for birds: American ornithology after Audubon|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691049540}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, some of the earliest ornithological works that used the word ecology appeared in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Alexander, H. G.|year=1915|title=A Practical Study of Bird Ecology|journal=British Birds|volume=8|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ibis'', however, resisted the introduction of these new methods of study, and  no paper on ecology appeared until 1943.&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt; The work of [[David Lack]] on population ecology was pioneering. Newer quantitative approaches were introduced for the study of ecology and behaviour, and this was not readily accepted. For instance, [[Claud Ticehurst]] wrote:
{{quote|Sometimes it seems that elaborate plans and statistics are made to prove what is commonplace knowledge to the mere collector, such as that hunting parties often travel more or less in circles.|Ticehurst&lt;ref name="ibis-history"/&gt;}}
David Lack's studies on population ecology sought to find the processes involved in the regulation of population based on the evolution of optimal clutch sizes. He concluded that population was regulated primarily by [[Density-dependent inhibition|density-dependent controls]], and also suggested that natural selection produces life-history traits that maximize the fitness of individuals. Others, such as [[V. C. Wynne-Edwards|Wynne-Edwards]], interpreted population regulation as a mechanism that aided the [[Group selection|"species" rather than individuals]]. This led to widespread and sometimes bitter debate on what constituted the "unit of selection".&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt; Lack also pioneered the use of many new tools for ornithological research, including the idea of using [[Radar ornithology|radar]] to study bird migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lack, David|year=1959|title=Watching migration by Radar|url=https://www.britishbirds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/article_files/V52/V52_N08/V52_N08_P258_267_A056.pdf|journal=British Birds|volume=52|issue=8|pages=258–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds were also widely used in studies of the niche hypothesis and [[Georgii Gause]]'s [[competitive exclusion]] principle. Work on resource partitioning and the structuring of bird communities through competition were made by [[Robert MacArthur]]. Patterns of [[biodiversity]] also became a topic of interest. Work on the relationship of the number of species to area and its application in the study of [[island biogeography]] was pioneered by [[E. O. Wilson]] and [[Robert MacArthur]].&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt; These studies led to the development of the discipline of [[landscape ecology]].

Brown in his work on explaining territorial behaviour. This led to more studies of behaviour that made use of cost-benefit analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brown, J. L.|year=1964|title=The evolution of diversity in avian territorial systems|journal=Wilson Bull.|volume=76|pages=160–169|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v076n02/p0160-p0169.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rising interest in [[sociobiology]] also led to a spurt of bird studies in this area.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v098n02/|title=Contents of The Auk 1981 Volume 98 Number 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of imprinting behaviour in ducks and geese by [[Konrad Lorenz]] and the studies of instinct in [[European herring gull|herring gull]]s by [[Nicolaas Tinbergen]] led to the establishment of the field of [[ethology]]. The study of learning became an area of interest and the study of [[Birdsong|bird songs]] has been a model for studies in neuroethology. The study of hormones and physiology in the control of behaviour has also been aided by bird models. These have helped in finding the [[Proximate and ultimate causation|proximate causes]] of circadian and seasonal cycles. Studies on migration have attempted to answer questions on the evolution of migration, orientation, and navigation.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;

The growth of genetics and the rise of molecular biology led to the application of the [[gene-centered view of evolution]] to explain avian phenomena. Studies on kinship and altruism, such as [[helpers at the nest|helpers]], became of particular interest. The idea of [[inclusive fitness]] was used to interpret observations on behaviour and life history, and birds were widely used models for testing hypotheses based on theories postulated by [[W. D. Hamilton]] and others.&lt;ref name=konishi/&gt;

The new tools of molecular biology changed the study of bird systematics, which changed from being based on [[phenotype]] to the underlying [[genotype]]. The use of techniques such as [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] to study evolutionary relationships was pioneered by [[Charles Sibley]] and [[Jon Edward Ahlquist]], resulting in what is called the [[Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy]]. These early techniques have been replaced by newer ones based on [[mitochondrial DNA]] sequences and [[molecular phylogenetics]] approaches that make use of computational procedures for [[sequence alignment]], construction of [[phylogenetic tree]]s, and calibration of [[molecular clock]]s to infer evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=O'Hara, Robert J.|year=1991|title=Essay review of Phylogeny and Classification of Birds: A Study in Molecular Evolution by Charles G.

===Rise to popularity===
The use of [[field glass]]es or [[telescope]]s for bird observation began in the 1820s and 1830s, with pioneers such as [[John Freeman Milward Dovaston|J. Dovaston]] (who also pioneered in the use of bird feeders), but instruction manuals did not begin to insist on the use of optical aids such as "a first-class telescope" or "field glass" until the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allen, D.

[[File:VillageBirdsFlorenceMerriam.jpg|thumb|Page from an early field guide by [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey]]]]
The rise of field guides for the identification of birds was another major innovation. The early guides such as those of [[History of British Birds|Thomas Bewick (two volumes)]] and [[History of British Birds (1843)|William Yarrell (three volumes)]] were cumbersome, and mainly focused on identifying specimens in the hand. The earliest of the new generation of field guides was prepared by [[Florence Augusta Merriam Bailey|Florence Merriam]], sister of [[Clinton Hart Merriam]], the mammalogist. This was published in 1887 in a series ''Hints to Audubon Workers:Fifty Birds and How to Know Them'' in Grinnell's ''[[Audubon Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="barrow"/&gt; These were followed by new field guides including classics by [[Roger Tory Peterson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dunlap, Tom|title=Tom Dunlap on Early Bird Guides.

The interest in [[birdwatching]] grew in popularity in many parts of the world, and the possibility for amateurs to contribute to biological studies was soon realized. As early as 1916, [[Julian Huxley]] wrote a two-part article in ''[[The Auk]]'', noting the tensions between amateurs and professionals, and suggested the possibility that the "vast army of bird lovers and bird watchers could begin providing the data scientists needed to address the fundamental problems of biology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley, J.|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science (part 1)|journal=Auk|volume=33|issue=2|pages=142–161|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n02/p0142-p0161.pdf|doi=10.2307/4072162|jstor=4072162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley, J.|year=1916|title=Bird-watching and biological science (part 2)|journal=Auk|volume=33|issue=3|pages=256–270|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/auk/v033n03/p0256-p0270.pdf|doi=10.2307/4072322|jstor=4072322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations were started in many countries, and these grew rapidly in membership, most notable among them being the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) in Britain and the [[Audubon Society]] in the US, which started in 1885. Both these organizations were started with the primary objective of conservation. The RSPB, born in 1889, grew from a small group of women in [[Croydon]], who met regularly and called themselves the "Fur, Fin, and Feather Folk" and who took a pledge "to refrain from wearing the feathers of any birds not killed for the purpose of food, the ostrich only exempted." The organization did not allow men as members initially, avenging a policy of the British Ornithologists' Union to keep out women.&lt;ref name="allen"/&gt; Unlike the RSPB, which was primarily conservation oriented, the British Trust for Ornithology was started in 1933 with the aim of advancing ornithological research. Members were often involved in collaborative ornithological projects. These projects have resulted in atlases which detail the distribution of bird species across Britain.&lt;ref name=bibby2003&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bibby, C.J.|year=2003|title=Fifty years of Bird Study: Capsule Field ornithology is alive and well, and in the future can contribute much more in Britain and elsewhere|journal=Bird Study|volume=50|issue=3|pages=194–210|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bto/bird/2003/00000050/00000003/art00001|doi=10.1080/00063650309461314 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Breeding Bird Surveys, conducted by the US Geological Survey, have also produced atlases with information on breeding densities and changes in the density and distribution over time. Other volunteer collaborative ornithology projects were subsequently established in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/BBS/|title=North American Breeding Bird Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
The tools and techniques of ornithology are varied, and new inventions and approaches are quickly incorporated. The techniques may be broadly dealt under the categories of those that are applicable to specimens and those that are used in the field, but the classification is rough and many analysis techniques are usable both in the laboratory and field or may require a combination of field and laboratory techniques.

===Collections===
{{main|Bird collections}}
[[File:Godwit prep.jpg|thumb|left|Bird-preservation techniques]]
The earliest approaches to modern bird study involved the collection of eggs, a practice known as [[oology]]. While collecting became a pastime for many amateurs, the labels associated with these early egg collections made them unreliable for the serious study of bird breeding. To preserve eggs, a tiny hole was made and the contents extracted. This technique became standard with the invention of the blow drill around 1830.&lt;ref name=allen /&gt; Egg collection is no longer popular; however, historic museum collections have been of value in determining the effects of [[pesticide]]s such as [[DDT]] on physiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Newton, I.|year=1979|title=Population ecology of raptors|isbn=978-0856610233|publisher=T. &amp; A.

[[File:BirdMorpho.svg|thumb|Morphometric measurements of birds are important in systematics.]]
The use of bird skins to document species has been a standard part of systematic ornithology. Bird skins are prepared by retaining the key bones of the wings, legs, and skull along with the skin and feathers. In the past, they were treated with [[arsenic]] to prevent fungal and insect (mostly [[Dermestidae|dermestid]]) attack. Arsenic, being toxic, was replaced by less-toxic [[borax]]. Amateur and professional collectors became familiar with these skinning techniques and started sending in their skins to museums, some of them from distant locations. This led to the formation of huge collections of bird skins in museums in Europe and North America. Many private collections were also formed. These became references for comparison of species, and the ornithologists at these museums were able to compare species from different locations, often places that they themselves never visited. [[Morphometrics]] of these skins, particularly the lengths of the tarsus, bill, tail, and wing became important in the descriptions of bird species. These skin collections have been used in more recent times for studies on [[molecular phylogenetics]] by the extraction of [[ancient DNA]]. The importance of [[biological type|type specimens]] in the description of species make skin collections a vital resource for systematic ornithology. However, with the rise of molecular techniques,  establishing the taxonomic status of new discoveries, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (''Laniarius liberatus'', no longer a valid species) and the [[Bugun liocichla]] (''Liocichla bugunorum''), using blood, DNA and feather samples as the [[holotype]] material, has now become possible.

Other methods of preservation include the storage of specimens in spirit. Such wet specimens have special value in physiological and anatomical study, apart from providing better quality of DNA for molecular studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Livezey, Bradley C.|year=2003|title=Avian spirit collections: attitudes, importance and prospects|journal=Bull. B. O. C.|volume=123A|pages=35–51 |url=http://www.carnegiemnh.net/birds/Livezey%20(2003).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Freeze drying]] of specimens is another technique that has the advantage of preserving stomach contents and anatomy, although it tends to shrink, making it less reliable for morphometrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Winker, K.|year=1993|title=Specimen shrinkage in Tennessee warblers and Traill's flycatchers|journal=J.

===In the field===
The study of birds in the field was helped enormously by improvements in optics. Photography made it possible to document birds in the field with great accuracy. High-power spotting scopes today allow observers to detect minute morphological differences that were earlier possible only by examination of the specimen "in the hand".&lt;ref name="shorebirds"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hayman, Peter |author2=Marchant, John |author3=Prater, Tony  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1986|title=Shorebirds: An Identification Guide to the Waders of the World|isbn=978-0395602379|publisher=Croom Helm, London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bird in the hand may be examined and [[morphometrics|measurements]] can be made, including standard lengths and weights. Feather moult and skull ossification provide indications of age and health. Sex can be determined by examination of anatomy in some sexually nondimorphic species. Blood samples may be drawn to determine hormonal conditions in studies of physiology, identify DNA markers for studying genetics and kinship in studies of breeding biology and phylogeography.

===In the laboratory===
Many aspects of bird biology are difficult to study in the field. These include the study of behavioural and physiological changes that require a long duration of access to the bird. Nondestructive samples of blood or feathers taken during field studies may be studied in the laboratory. For instance, the variation in the ratios of stable hydrogen isotopes across latitudes makes establishing the origins of migrant birds possible using [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] analysis of feather samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hobson, K.

Studies in bird behaviour include the use of tamed and trained birds in captivity. Studies on [[bird intelligence]] and [[bird vocalization#Learning|song learning]] have been largely laboratory-based. Field researchers may make use of a wide range of techniques such as the use of dummy owls to elicit mobbing behaviour, and dummy males or the use of call playback to elicit territorial behaviour and thereby to establish the boundaries of bird territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Slater, P.

The chicken has long been a [[model organism]] for studying vertebrate [[developmental biology]]. As the embryo is readily accessible, its development can be easily followed (unlike [[house mouse|mice]]). This also allows the use of [[electroporation]] for studying the effect of adding or silencing a gene. Other tools for perturbing their genetic makeup are chicken [[embryonic stem cell]]s and [[viral vector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stern CD |title=The chick; a great model system becomes even greater |journal=Dev.

Wild birds impact many human activities, while domesticated birds are important sources of eggs, meat, feathers, and other products. Applied and economic ornithology aim to reduce the ill effects of problem birds and enhance gains from beneficial species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8832">In physics, a '''photon gas''' is a [[gas]]-like collection of [[photon]]s, which has many of the same properties of a conventional gas like [[hydrogen]] or [[neon]] – including pressure, temperature, and entropy. The most common example of a photon gas in equilibrium is [[black body radiation]].

Photons are part of family of particles known as [[Boson|bosons]], particles that follow [[Bose-Einstein distribution|Bose-Einstein statistics]] and with integer [[Spin (physics)|spin]]. A [[Bose gas|gas of bosons]] with only one type of particle is uniquely described by three state functions such as the [[temperature]], [[volume]], and the [[particle number|number of particles]]. However, for a black body, the [[energy]] distribution is established by the interaction of the photons with matter, usually the walls of the container. In this interaction, the number of photons is not conserved. As a result, the [[chemical potential]] of the black body photon gas is zero. The number of state variables needed to describe a black body state is thus reduced from three to two (e.g. temperature and volume).

==Thermodynamics of a black body photon gas==
In an classical [[ideal gas]] with massive particles, the energy of the particles is distributed according to a [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]. This distribution is established as the particles collide with each other, exchanging energy (and momentum) in the process. In a photon gas, there will also be an equilibrium distribution, but photons do not collide with each other (except under very extreme conditions, see [[two-photon physics]]), so the equilibrium distribution must be established by other means. The most common way that an equilibrium distribution is established is by the interaction of the photons with matter. If the photons are absorbed and emitted by the walls of the system containing the photon gas, and the walls are at a particular temperature, then the equilibrium distribution for the photons will be a [[black body]] distribution at that temperature.

A very important difference between a [[Bose gas]] (gas of massive bosons) and a photon gas with a black body distribution is that the number of photons in the system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may drop back to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the [[photon energy|photon energies]] of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. It can be shown that, as a result of this lack of constraint on the number of photons in the system, the [[chemical potential]] of the photons must be zero for black body radiation.

The thermodynamics of a black body photon gas may be derived using [[Gas in a box|quantum mechanical arguments]]. The derivation yields the spectral energy distribution ''u'' which is the energy per unit volume per unit frequency interval:

:&lt;math&gt;u(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3 }{c^3}~\frac{1}{e^\frac{h\nu}{kT} - 1}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''h''&amp;nbsp; is [[Planck's constant]], ''c''&amp;nbsp; is the speed of light, ''ν''&amp;nbsp; is the frequency, ''k''&amp;nbsp; is Boltzmann's constant, and ''T''&amp;nbsp; is temperature.

Integrating over frequency and multiplying by the volume, ''V'', gives the [[internal energy]] of a black body photon gas:
:&lt;math&gt;U = \left(8\frac{\pi^5 k^4}{15c^3 h^3}\right) V T^4&lt;/math&gt;

The derivation also yields the (expected) number of photons ''N'':
:&lt;math&gt;N = \left(\frac{16\pi k^3\zeta(3)}{c^3 h^3 (2 \pi)^3}\right)VT^3&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\zeta(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]]. Note that for a particular temperature, the [[particle number]] ''N'' varies with the volume in a fixed manner, adjusting itself to have a constant density of photons.

If we note that the equation of state for an ultra-relativistic quantum gas (which inherently describes photons) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;U = 3PV&lt;/math&gt;
then we can combine the above formulas to produce an equation of state that looks much like that of an ideal gas:
:&lt;math&gt;PV = \frac{\zeta(4)}{\zeta(3)}NKT \approx 0.9\, NKT&lt;/math&gt;

The following table summarizes the thermodynamic state functions for a black body photon gas. Notice that the pressure can be written in the form &lt;math&gt;P\propto aT^4 &lt;/math&gt;, which is independent of volume.

==Isothermal transformations==
As an example of a thermodynamic process involving a photon gas, consider a cylinder with a movable piston. The interior walls of the cylinder are "black" in order that the temperature of the photons can be maintained at a particular temperature. This means that the space inside the cylinder will contain a blackbody-distributed photon gas. Unlike a massive gas, this gas will exist without the photons being introduced from the outside – the walls will provide the photons for the gas. Suppose the piston is pushed all the way into the cylinder so that there is an extremely small volume. The photon gas inside the volume will press against the piston, moving it outward, and in order for the transformation to be isothermic, a counter force of almost the same value will have to be applied to the piston so that the motion of the piston is very slow. This force will be equal to the pressure times the cross sectional area (''A''&amp;nbsp;) of the piston. This process can be continued at a constant temperature until the photon gas is at a volume ''V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;. Integrating the force over the distance (''x''&amp;nbsp;) traveled yields the total work done to create this photon gas at this volume
:&lt;math&gt;W = -\int_0^{x_0} P (A \mathrm{d}x)&lt;/math&gt;

where the relationship ''V = Ax''&amp;nbsp; has been used. Defining
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{8\pi^5 k^4}{15c^3 h^3}&lt;/math&gt;

The pressure is
:&lt;math&gt;P(x) = \frac{bT^4}{3}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integrating, the work done is just
:&lt;math&gt;W = -\frac{bT^4 Ax_0}{3} = \frac{bT^4 V_0}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of heat that must be added in order to create the gas is

:&lt;math&gt;Q = U - W = H_0\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the enthalpy at the end of the transformation. It is seen that the enthalpy is the amount of energy needed to create the photon gas.

'''Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling''' is a [[mathematical modeling]] technique for predicting the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of synthetic or natural chemical substances in humans and other animal species. PBPK modeling is used in pharmaceutical research and drug development, and in health [[risk assessment]] for cosmetics or general chemicals.

PBPK models strive to be mechanistic by mathematically transcribing anatomical, physiological, physical, and chemical descriptions of the phenomena involved in the complex ADME processes. A large degree of residual simplification and empiricism is still present in those models, but they have an extended domain of applicability compared to that of classical, empirical function based, [[pharmacokinetic]] models. PBPK models may have purely predictive uses, but other uses, such as statistical inference, have been made possible by the development of [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian]] statistical tools able to deal with complex models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gelman|first=A.|author2=Bois, F.Y. |author3=Jiang, J. |title=Physiological pharmacokinetic analysis using population modeling and informative prior distributions|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|year=1996|volume=91|issue=436|pages=1400–1412|doi=10.1080/01621459.1996.10476708}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is true for both toxicity risk assessment and therapeutic drug development.

PBPK models try to rely ''a priori'' on the anatomical and physiological structure of the body, and to a certain extent, on biochemistry. They are usually [[multi-compartment model]]s, with compartments corresponding to predefined organs or tissues, with interconnections corresponding to blood or lymph flows (more rarely to diffusions). A system of [[differential equations]] for concentration or quantity of substance on each compartment can be written, and its parameters represent blood flows, pulmonary ventilation rate, organ volumes etc., for which information is available in scientific publications. Indeed, the description they make of the body is simplified and a balance needs to be struck between complexity and simplicity. Besides the advantage of allowing the recruitment of ''a priori'' information about parameter values, these models also facilitate inter-species transpositions or extrapolation from one mode of administration to another (''e.g.'', inhalation to oral). An example of a 7-compartment PBPK model, suitable to describe the fate of many solvents in the mammalian body, is given in the Figure on the right.

==History==

The first pharmacokinetic model described in the scientific literature
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teorell|first=T.|title=Kinetics of distribution of substances administered to the body|journal=Archives Internationales de Pharmacodynamie et de Thérapie|year=1937|volume=57|pages=205–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was in fact a PBPK model. It led, however, to computations intractable at that time. The focus shifted then to simpler models
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibaldi M., and Perrier D.|title=Pharmacokinetics, , Second Edition, revised and expanded ed.|year=1982|publisher=Marcel Dekker|location=New-York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
for which analytical solutions could be obtained (such solutions were sums of exponential terms, which led to further simplifications.) The availability of computers and numerical integration algorithms marked a renewed interest in [[mathematical physiology|physiological models]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bischoff|first=K.B.|author2=Dedrick, R.L. |author3=Zaharko, D.S. |author4=Longstreth, J.A. |title=Methotrexate pharmacokinetics|journal=Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences|year=1971|volume=60 |issue=8|pages=1128–1133|doi=10.1002/jps.2600600803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dedrick|first=R.L. |author2=Forrester, D.D. |author3=Cannon, J.N. |author4=El Dareer, S.M. |author5=Mellett, L.B. |title=Pharmacokinetics of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ARA-C) deamination in several species|journal=[[Biochemical Pharmacology (journal)|Biochemical Pharmacology]]|year=1973|volume=22|issue=19 |pages=2405–2417|doi=10.1016/0006-2952(73)90342-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2010, hundreds of scientific publications have described and used PBPK models, and at least two private companies are basing their business on their expertise in this area.

==Building a PBPK model==

The model equations follow the principles of mass transport, fluid dynamics, and biochemistry in order to simulate the fate of a substance in the body
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Campbell JL Jr, Clewell RA, Gentry PR, Andersen ME, Clewell HJ 3rd |title=Physiologically based pharmacokinetic/toxicokinetic modeling|journal=Computational Toxicology, Methods in Molecular Biology Series|year=2012|pages=439–499}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Compartments are usually defined by grouping organs or tissues with similar blood perfusion rate and lipid content (''i.e.'' organs for which chemicals' concentration ''vs.'' time profiles will be similar). Ports of entry (lung, skin, intestinal tract...), ports of exit (kidney, liver...) and target organs for therapeutic effect or toxicity are often left separate. Bone can be excluded from the model if the substance of interest does not distribute to it. Connections between compartment follow physiology (''e.g.'', blood flow in exit of the gut goes to liver, ''etc.'')

=== Basic transport equations ===

Drug distribution into a tissue can be rate-limited by either perfusion or permeability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jeong|first=Yoo-Seong|last2=Yim|first2=Chang-Soon|last3=Ryu|first3=Heon-Min|last4=Noh|first4=Chi-Kyoung|last5=Song|first5=Yoo-Kyung|last6=Chung|first6=Suk-Jae|title=Estimation of the minimum permeability coefficient in rats for perfusion-limited tissue distribution in whole-body physiologically-based pharmacokinetics|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpb.2017.01.026|journal=European Journal of Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics|volume=115|pages=1–17|doi=10.1016/j.ejpb.2017.01.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espié|first=Pascal|last2=Tytgat|first2=Dominique|last3=Sargentini-Maier|first3=Maria-Laura|last4=Poggesi|first4=Italo|last5=Watelet|first5=Jean-Baptiste|date=2009|title=Physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK)|journal=Drug Metabolism Reviews|volume=41|issue=3|pages=391–407|doi=10.1080/10837450902891360|issn=1097-9883|pmid=19601719}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perfusion-rate-limited kinetics apply when the tissue membranes present no barrier to diffusion. Blood flow, assuming that the drug is transported mainly by blood, as is often the case, is then the limiting factor to distribution in the various cells of the body. That is usually true for small lipophilic drugs. Under perfusion limitation, the instantaneous rate of entry for the quantity of drug in a compartment is simply equal to (blood) volumetric flow rate through the organ times the incoming blood concentration. In that case; for a generic compartment ''i'', the differential equation for the quantity ''Q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' of substance, which defines the rate of change in this quantity, is:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{dQ_i \over dt} = F_i (C_{art} - {{Q_i} \over {P_i V_i}})&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where ''F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is blood flow (noted ''Q'' in the Figure above), ''C&lt;sub&gt;art&lt;/sub&gt;'' incoming arterial blood concentration, ''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' the tissue over blood partition coefficient and ''V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' the volume of compartment ''i''.

A complete set of differential equations for the 7-compartment model shown above could therefore be given by the following table:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Tissue !! Differential Equation
|-
| Gut || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_g \over dt} = F_g (C_{art} - {{Q_g} \over {P_g V_g}})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Kidney || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_k \over dt} = F_k (C_{art} - {{Q_k} \over {P_k V_k}})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Poorly-perfused tissues (muscle and skin) || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_p \over dt} = F_p (C_{art} - {{Q_p} \over {P_p V_p}})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Brain || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_b \over dt} = F_b (C_{art} - {{Q_b} \over {P_b V_b}})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Heart and lung || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_h \over dt} = F_h (C_{art} - {{Q_h} \over {P_h V_h}})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Pancreas || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_{pn} \over dt} = F_{pn} (C_{art} - {{Q_{pn}} \over {P_{pn} V_{pn}}})&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Liver || &lt;math&gt;{dQ_l \over dt} = F_a C_{art} 
                        + F_g ({{Q_g} \over {P_g V_g}}) 
                        + F_{pn} ({{Q_{pn}} \over {P_{pn} V_{pn}}})
                        - (F_a + F_g + F_{pn}) ({{Q_l} \over {P_l V_l}}) &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above equations include only transport terms and do not account for inputs or outputs. 
Those can be modeled with specific terms, as in the following.

=== Modeling inputs ===
Modeling inputs is necessary to come up with a meaningful description of a chemical's pharmacokinetics. The following examples show how to write the corresponding equations.

==== Ingestion ====
When dealing with an oral [[Bolus (medicine)|bolus]] dose (''e.g.'' ingestion of a tablet), first order absorption is a very common assumption. In that case the gut equation is augmented with an input term, with an absorption rate constant ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'':

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{dQ_g \over dt} = F_g (C_{art} - {{Q_g} \over {P_g V_g}}) + K_a Q_{ing}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

That requires defining an equation for the quantity ingested and present in the gut lumen:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{dQ_{ing} \over dt} = - K_a Q_{ing}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

In the absence of a gut compartment, input can be made directly in the liver. However, in that case local metabolism in the gut may not be correctly described. The case of approximately continuous absorption (''e.g. via'' drinking water) can be modeled by a zero-order absorption rate (here ''R&lt;sub&gt;ing&lt;/sub&gt;'' in units of mass over time):

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{dQ_g \over dt} = F_g (C_{art} - {{Q_g} \over {P_g V_g}}) + R_{ing}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

More sophisticated gut absorption model can be used. In those models, additional compartments describe the various sections of the gut lumen and tissue. Intestinal pH, transit times and presence of active transporters can be taken into account
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Darwich|first=AS|author2=Pade D |author3=Ammori BJ |author4=Jamei M |author5=Ashcroft DM |author6=Rostami-Hodjegan A |title=A mechanistic pharmacokinetic model to assess modified oral drug bioavailability post bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients: interplay between CYP3A gut wall metabolism, permeability and dissolution|journal=Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-7158.2012.01538.x |volume=64 |issue=7|pages=1008–1024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin depot ====
The absorption of a chemical deposited on skin can also be modeled using first order terms. It is best in that case to separate the skin from the other tissues, to further differentiate exposed skin and non-exposed skin, and differentiate viable skin (dermis and epidermis) from the [[stratum corneum]] (the actual skin upper layer exposed). This is the approach taken in [Bois F., Diaz Ochoa J.G. Gajewska M., Kovarich S., Mauch K., Paini A., Péry A., Sala Benito J.V., Teng S., Worth A., in press, Multiscale modelling approaches for assessing cosmetic ingredients safety, Toxicology. doi: 10.1016/j.tox.2016.05.026]

Unexposed [[stratum corneum]] simply exchanges with the underlying viable skin by diffusion:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{dQ_{{sc}_{u}} \over dt} = K_p \times S_s \times (1 - f_{S_{e}}) \times ({Q_{s_u} \over {P_{sc} V_{{sc}_{u}}}} - C_{{sc}_u})&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;K_p&lt;/math&gt; is the partition coefficient, &lt;math&gt;S_s&lt;/math&gt; is the total skin surface area, &lt;math&gt;f_{S_{e}}&lt;/math&gt; the fraction of skin surface area exposed, ...

For the viable skin unexposed:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; {dQ_{s_u} \over dt} = F_s (1 - f_{S_{e}}) (C_{art} - {{Q_{s_u}} \over {P_s V_{s_u}}}) - {dQ_{{sc}_{u}} \over dt} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

For the skin [[stratum corneum]] exposed:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{dQ_{{sc}_{e}} \over dt} = K_p \times S_s \times f_{S_{e}} \times ({Q_{s_e} \over {P_{sc} V_{{sc}_e}}} - C_{{sc}_e})&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

for the viable skin exposed:
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt; {dQ_{s_e} \over dt} = F_s f_{S_{e}} (C_{art} - {{Q_{s_e}} \over {P_s V_{s_e}}}) - {dQ_{{sc}_{e}} \over dt}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

dt(QSkin_u) and dt(QSkin_e) feed from arterial blood and back to venous blood.

More complex diffusion models have been published [reference to add].

==== Intra-venous injection ====
Intravenous injection is a common clinical route of administration. (to be completed)

==== Inhalation ====
Inhalation occurs through the lung and is hardly dissociable from exhalation (to be completed)

=== Modelling metabolism ===
There are several ways metabolism can be modeled. For some models, a linear excretion rate is preferred. This can be accomplished with a simple differential equation. Otherwise a [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics|Michaelis-Menten]] equation, as follows, is generally appropriate for a more accurate result.
:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac{d [P]}{d t} = \frac{ V_\max {[S]}}{K_m + [S]} &lt;/math&gt;.

==Uses of PBPK modeling==
[[File:DrugConcOverTimeIVOral.png|thumb|right|300 px|Simulated drug plasma concentration over time curves following IV infusion and multiple oral doses. The drug has an [[Biological half-life|elimination half-life]] of 4 hours, and an apparent [[volume of distribution]] of 10 liters.]]
PBPK models are compartmental models like many others, but they have a few advantages over so-called "classical" pharmacokinetic models, which are less grounded in physiology. PBPK models can first be used to abstract and eventually reconcile disparate data (from physicochemical or biochemical experiments, ''[[in vitro]]'' or ''[[in vivo]]'' pharmacological or toxicological experiments, ''etc.'') They give also access to internal body concentrations of chemicals or their metabolites, and in particular at the site of their effects, be it therapeutic or toxic. Finally they also help interpolation and extrapolation of knowledge between:

*Doses: e.g., from the high concentrations typically used in laboratory experiments to those found in the environment
*Exposure duration: ''e.g.'', from continuous to discontinuous, or single to multiple exposures
*Routes of administration: ''e.g.'', from inhalation exposures to ingestion
*Species: ''e.g.'', transpositions from rodents to human, prior to giving a drug for the first time to subjects of a clinical trial, or when experiments on humans are deemed unethical, such as when the compound is toxic without therapeutic benefit
*Individuals: ''e.g.'', from males to females, from adults to children, from non-pregnant women to pregnant
* [[In vitro to in vivo extrapolation|From ''in vitro'' to ''in vivo'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouvier d'Yvoire|first=M. |author2=Prieto P. |author3=Blaauboer B.J. |author4=Bois F. |author5=Boobis A. |author6=Brochot C. |author7=Coecke S. |author8=Freidig A. |author9=Gundert-Remy U. |author10=Hartung T. |author11=Jacobs M. N. |author12=Lavé T. |author13=Leahy D.E. |author14=Lennernäs H. |author15=Loizou G.D. |author16=Meek B. |author17=Pease C. |author18=Rowland M. |author19=Spendiff M. |author20=Yang J. |author21=Zeilmaker M. |title=Physiologically-based kinetic modelling (PBK modelling): meeting the 3Rs agenda - The report and recommendations of ECVAM Workshop 63a|journal=Alternatives to Laboratory Animals|year=2007|volume=35|pages=661–671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these extrapolations are "parametric" : only changes in input or parameter values are needed to achieve the extrapolation (this is usually the case for dose and time extrapolations). Others are "nonparametric" in the sense that a change in the model structure itself is needed (''e.g.'', when extrapolating to a pregnant female, equations for the foetus should be added).

Owing to the mechanistic basis of PBPK models, another potential use of PBPK modeling is hypothesis testing.  For example, if a drug compound showed lower-than-expected oral bioavailability, various model structures (i.e., hypotheses) and parameter values can be evaluated to determine which models and/or parameters provide the best fit to the observed data.  If the hypothesis that metabolism in the intestines was responsibility for the low bioavailability yielded the best fit, then the PBPK modeling results support this hypothesis over the other hypotheses evaluated.

As such, PBPK modeling can be used, ''inter alia'', to evaluate the involvement of carrier-mediated transport, clearance saturation, enterohepatic recirculation of the parent compound, extra-hepatic/extra-gut elimination; higher ''in vivo'' solubility than predicted ''in vitro''; drug-induced gastric emptying delays; gut loss and regional variation in gut absorption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peters|first1=SA|title=Evaluation of a generic physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for lineshape analysis|journal=Clin Pharmacokinet|date=2008|volume=47|issue=4|pages=261–75|pmid=18336055|doi=10.2165/00003088-200847040-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits and extensions of PBPK modeling==
Each type of modeling technique has its strengths and limitations.  PBPK modeling is no exception.  One limitation is the potential for a large number of parameters, some of which may be correlated.  This can lead to the issues of parameter identifiability and redundancy. However, it is possible (and commonly done) to model explicitly the correlations between parameters (for example, the non-linear relationships between age, body-mass, organ volumes and blood flows.

After numerical values are assigned to each PBPK model parameter, specialized or general computer software is typically used to numerically integrate a set of ordinary differential  equations like those described above, in order to calculate the numerical value of each compartment at specified values of time (see Software).  However, if such equations involve only linear functions of each compartmental value, or under limiting conditions (e.g., when input values remain very small) that guarantee such linearity is closely approximated, such equations may be solved analytically to yield explicit equations (or, under those limiting conditions, very accurate approximations) for the time-weighted average (TWA) value of each compartment as a function of the TWA value of each specified input (see, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogen|first=K.T.|title=Pharmacokinetics for regulatory risk analysis: The case of trichloroethylene|journal=[[Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology]]|year=1988|volume=8|issue=4|pages=447–466|doi=10.1016/0273-2300(88)90045-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bogen|first=K.T.|last2=Hall|first2=L.C.|title=Pharmacokinetics for regulatory risk analysis: The case of 1,1,1-trichloroethane (methyl chloroform)|journal=Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology|year=1989|volume=10|issue=1|pages=26–50|doi=10.1016/0273-2300(89)90011-1|pmid=2672126}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

PBPK models can rely on chemical property prediction models ([[QSAR]] models or predictive chemistry models) on one hand. For example, QSAR models can be used to estimate partition coefficients.  They also extend into, but are not destined to supplant, [[systems biology]] models of metabolic pathways. They are also parallel to [[physiome]] models, but do not aim at modelling physiological functions beyond fluid circulation in detail. In fact the above four types of models can reinforce each other when integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bois|first=F.Y.|title=Physiologically-based modelling and prediction of drug interactions|journal=Basic &amp; Clinical Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology|year=2009|volume=106|issue=3|pages=154–161|doi=10.1111/j.1742-7843.2009.00488.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

PBPK models are data-hungry (many parameters need to be set) and may take a long time to develop and validate. For that reason, they have been criticized for delaying the development of important regulations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sott.net/article/307310-A-web-of-influence-Why-the-United-States-leaves-deadly-chemicals-on-the-market|title=A web of influence: Why the United States leaves deadly chemicals on the market -- Sott.net|website=Sott.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5828">"'''Reform of Architects Registration'''"&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.aaruk.info/board01/DOE%20Consultation.pdf Copy of consultation paper]&lt;/ref&gt; was the title of a UK government consultation paper dated 19 July 1994 which was issued by the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]].  The introduction stated that in October 1993 the Government had announced that the profession and others would be consulted about measures which could be taken to simplify the then arrangements for the registration of architects under the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects Registration Acts]], and that broad agreement on what those measures would be had been reached with the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK) and the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).  Eventually, Parliament made certain changes to the Architects Registration Acts which now have effect under the [[Architects Act 1997]].

The consultation paper went on to state that the current proposals for reform stemmed from a request from ARCUK to [[UK Government|the Government]] in 1992 that the Architects Registration Acts should be reviewed; and that a review had been carried out by Mr E J D Warne CB, whose report had been published by [[HMSO]] in 1993.

The consultation paper mentioned that the [[Warne Report]] had considered the views of architects, architectural bodies and consumers and "agreed with ARCUK" that there were certain weaknesses of its structure: and that the reforms being proposed were aimed at overcoming those weaknesses in a way that would be generally acceptable to the profession and public alike.

The main objective of the reforms was stated to be:
: ''to create a small, focussed and effective registration body which represents the interests of both the profession and the general public'',

:::and its purpose would be to
: ''set criteria for admission to the Register; prevent misuse of the title '[[architect]]'; discipline unprofessional conduct, and set fee levels.''

The [[punctuation]] in the document, as reproduced above, seemed to indicate a close connection of some kind between setting fee levels and professional conduct.  But in the event the setting of fee levels was later abandoned, while, in respect of professional conduct, statutory powers to inflict fines expressly on a par with criminal penalties were given to a body which would have persons who are not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority, and who would not be acting under the judicial oath of a [[judge]] or a [[magistrate]] in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the [[consensual]] [[jurisdiction]] of an [[arbitrator]], and would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation.  This could have been seen as an objectionable aberration, but that instead a preponderance of political opinion welcomed such an arrangement, regarding it as a pioneering development, may be explained at least in part by observing that the usage "[[wikt:stakeholder|stakeholders]]"&lt;ref&gt; Freeman, R. Edward (1984). Strategic Management: A stakeholder approach. Boston: Pitman. {{ISBN|0-273-01913-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; had gained some currency at the time.

Certain issues had been the background to the [[Warne Report]] as matters were in the 1990s and had always been, namely, issues concerning the flaws or merits of the case for or against such proposals in theory or in principle or in relation particularly, on the one hand, to the [[Register of Architects]], to restrictions on the use of the word "architect", and to the practice of architecture considered as an art or as a business or as a means of earning a livelihood; and on the other hand, to official accountability, juridical norms and the rule of law: see further, article on [[Architects Registration in the United Kingdom]] - background to legislation.

One of the proposals mentioned in the consultation document which were later enacted and are now operative was that ARCUK would remain as a legal entity, but its name would be changed to "[[Architects Registration Board]]"; and it was stated that although this change, in itself, would have no impact on the status or role of ARCUK it would suggest a smaller, tighter body and would mark the alterations to ARCUK's functions.

Another of the proposals was that there should be an office of Registrar whose functions would be to maintain the Register and carry out the instructions of the Board; and it was stated that the Registrar would be a named appointee of the Board which would decide whether the Registrar should be an employee or a contractor.

A '''register''' is a [[grille]] with moving parts, capable of being opened and closed and the air flow directed, which is part of a building's [[HVAC|heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] (HVAC) system. The placement and size of registers is critical to HVAC efficiency. Register dampers are also important, and can serve a safety function.

==Register vs. grille==
A grille is a perforated cover for an [[Duct (flow)|air duct]] (used for heating, cooling, or ventilation, or a combination thereof).  Grilles sometimes have [[louver]]s which allow the flow of air to be directed. A register differs from a grille in that a [[Damper (flow)|damper]] is included.{{sfn|Sugarman|2005|page=132}}{{sfn|Haines|Wilson|2003|page=129}} However, in practice, the terms "grille", "register", and "return" are often used interchangeably, and care must be taken to determine the meaning of the term used.{{sfn|Haines|Wilson|2003|page=129}}{{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|page=80}}

==Register size and placement==
Placement of registers is key in creating an efficient HVAC system. Usually, a register is placed near a window or door, which is where the greatest heat/cooling loss occurs.{{sfn|Lester|McGuerty|2009|page=174}}{{sfn|Bolton|Schmitt|2004|page=180}} In contrast, returns (grilled ducts which suck air back into the HVAC system for heating or cooling) are usually placed in the wall or ceiling nearest the center of the building. Generally, in rooms where it is critical to maintain a constant temperature two registers (one placed near the ceiling to deliver cold air, and one placed in the floor to deliver hot air) and two returns (one high, one low) will be used. HVAC systems generally have one register and one return per room.{{sfn|Lester|McGuerty|2009|page=174}}

[[File:Wall register.jpg|thumb|left|An unlouvered wall register, which allows circulation of air from one floor to another.]]
Registers vary in size with the heating and cooling requirements of the room.{{sfn|Bolton|Schmitt|2004|page=180}} If a register is too small, the HVAC system will need to push air through the ducts at a faster rate in order to achieve the desired heating or cooling.  This can create rushing sounds which can disturb occupants or interfere with conversation or work (such as sound recording). The velocity of air through a register is usually kept low enough so that it is masked by background noise. (Higher ambient levels of background noise, such as those in restaurants, allow for higher air velocities.) On the other hand, air velocity must be high enough to achieve the desired temperature.{{sfn|Watt|Brown|1997|page=308}} Registers are a critical part of the HVAC system. If not properly installed and tightly connected to the ductwork, air will spill around the register and greatly reduce the HVAC system's efficiency.{{sfn|Bolton|Schmitt|2004|page=180}} Ideally, a room will have both heating and cooling registers. In practice, cost considerations usually require that heating and cooling be provided by the same register. In such cases, heating most often takes precedence over cooling, and registers are usually found close to the floor.{{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|pages=80-81}}

For heating purposes, a floor register is preferred. This is because hot air rises, and as it cools it falls. This creates good air circulation in a room, and helps to maintain a more even temperature as hot and cold air is mixed more thoroughly.{{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|page=80}} Floor registers generally have a grille strong enough for a human being to walk on without damaging the grille. It is rare to find a floor register installed less than {{convert|6|in|cm}} from the corner of a room.{{sfn|Schwartz|1993|page=345}} When a floor register is not practical or desired, a wall register is used. The correct placement of wall heating registers is critical. Generally, the heating register will be directly across from an exterior window. The hot air from the register will mix with the cold air coming off the window, cool, and drop to the floor—creating good air circulation. However, the hot air must be pushed from the register with enough force (or "throw") so that it will cross the room and reach the window. If there is too little throw, the hot air will stop moving partway across the room, the cold air from the window will not be heated (creating the feeling of a cool draft), and air circulation will suffer.{{sfn|Stein|McGuinness|1997|page=262}}

==Register dampers==
A register's damper provides a critical function. Primarily, the damper allows for the amount of hot or cool air into a room to be controlled, providing for more accurate control over room temperature.{{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|pages=80-81}} Dampers also allow for air to be shut off in unused rooms, improving the efficiency of the HVAC system. Dampers can also help adjust a HVAC system for seasonal use.{{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|pages=80-81}} During winter months, for example, an air conditioning register can be closed to prevent cold air from being pulled from the room. This allows the hot air to mix more completely with the cold air in the room, improving the efficiency of the HVAC system.{{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|pages=80-81}} (The return should be efficient enough to draw off the cooler air.){{sfn|Dearborn Home Inspection|2003|page=81}}{{sfn|Stamper|Koral|1979|page=7—127}}

Some registers, particularly those in commercial buildings or institutions which house large numbers of people (such as hotels or hospitals) have a fire damper attached to them.  This damper automatically senses smoke or extreme heat, and shuts the register closed so that fire and smoke do not travel throughout the building via the HVAC system.{{sfn|Jefferis|Smith|2002|page=236}}

'''Smoking fetishism''' (also known as '''capnolagnia''') is a [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetish]] based on the [[lung|pulmonary]] consumption ([[smoking]]) of tobacco, most often via [[cigarette]]s, [[cigar]]s, and also, [[pipe smoking|pipe]]s and [[hookah]]s to some extent. As a fetish, its mechanisms regard [[sexual arousal]] from the [[observation]] or [[imagination]] of a person [[smoking]], sometimes including oneself.&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smokingfan.com/category/smoking-fetish-star/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928212838/http://www.smokingfan.com/category/smoking-fetish-star/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-28|title=Smoking Fetish Star|date=|accessdate=2013-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Capnolagnia is not considered a disease but an unusual sexual practice, and many of the fetishists do not seek medical help unless this behavior strongly interferes with their daily lives. The majority of people simply learn to accept their fetish and manage to achieve gratification in an appropriate manner.&lt;ref name="I"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/capnolagnia/treatments.htm |title=Treatments for Capnolagnia |date=|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 study found that the fetish was not previously the subject of academic study but had been mentioned in "a few newspapers".&lt;ref name=ribisl&gt;Ribisl KM, Lee RE, Henriksen L, Haladjian HH, "A content analysis of Web sites promoting smoking culture and lifestyle", Health Educ Behav. 2003 Feb;30(1):64-78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
[[File:Aketo du groupe Sniper.jpg|thumb|160px|The mannerism of the smoker, as shown here, may also elicit sexual arousal.]]
Like any fetish, the [[classical conditioning|causes]] and [[sexual arousal|mechanisms]] of a smoking fetish vary widely, with roots of [[sexualization|sexual association]] in early [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]]. Typical causes and hypotheses include:

* [[aesthetics]]: mere attraction to, and gratification of, the [[visual]] aspect of [[smoke]] as it exits the mouth
* [[childhood]]: experience or interaction with one or more attractive smoking individuals during childhood
* [[impulsivity]]: perceived [[symbol]]ism of an audacious or impulsivity personality, insinuating [[promiscuity]]
* [[Human behavior|mannerism]]: [[masculine]] or [[feminine]] [[body language]] of smokers
* [[media (communication)|media]]: early exposure to [[sexualization|sexualized]] depictions of smokers, especially from [[advertising media]], the [[film noir]] era, and [[pornography]]&lt;ref name=wallst&gt;{{cite news|last=Hwang|first=Suein|title=Drag Queens: Paula Puffs and Her Fans Watch, Enraptured|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=31 Jan 1996|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[persuasion]]: perceived [[power (social and political)|power]] of convincing or urging another individual to smoke
* [[psychosexual development]]: phenomena in the [[oral stage|oral]] and [[phallic stage|phallic]] stages of childhood development, based on [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] theory
* [[sadomasochism]]: pleasure from infliction of bodily harm caused by smoking, often called "lung damage"
* [[self-confidence]]: perceived confidence or [[masculinity]] of the smoker, regarding taboo or wealth
* [[taboo]]: perceived [[independence]] or [[rebellion]] regarding the act of smoking, amongst cultural adversity to smokers
* [[wealth]]: attraction to individuals who are wealthy enough to fund a cigarette or cigar habit

==Diagnosis==
The diagnostic criteria for fetishism are:
* Unusual [[sexual fantasies]], drives or behavior occur over a time span of at least six months. Sometimes unusual sexual fantasies occur and vanish by themselves; in this case any medical treatment is not necessary.
* The affected person, her object or another person experience impairment or distress in multiple functional areas. Functional area refers to different aspects of life such as private social contacts, job, etc. It is sufficient for the diagnosis if one of the participants is being hurt or mistreated in any other way.

People who experience one or more of the symptoms below are considered to have a smoking fetish:
* Sexual interest in smoking or watching other people smoking.
* Recurring intense sexual fantasies involving smoking or watching other people smoking.
* Recurring intense sexual urges involving smoking or watching other people smoking.&lt;ref name="H"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/c/capnolagnia/symptoms.htm |title=Symptoms of Capnolagnia |date=|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16970">'''Stochastic computing''' is a collection of techniques that represent continuous values by streams of random bits. Complex computations can then be computed by simple bit-wise operations on the streams. Stochastic computing is distinct from the study of [[randomized algorithm]]s.

== Motivation and a simple example ==

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;p,q \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is given, and we wish to compute &lt;math&gt;p \times q&lt;/math&gt;. Stochastic computing performs this operation using probability instead of arithmetic.

Specifically, suppose that there are two random, independent bit streams called ''stochastic number''s (i.e. [[Bernoulli process]]es), where the probability of a one in the first stream is &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and the probability in the second stream is &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. We can take the [[Logical and#Applications in computer programming|logical AND]] of the two streams.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left;"
! &lt;math&gt;a_i&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || ...
|-
! &lt;math&gt;b_i&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 0 || ...
|-
! &lt;math&gt;a_i \land b_i&lt;/math&gt;
| 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || ...
|}
The probability of a one in the output stream is &lt;math&gt;pq&lt;/math&gt;.  By observing enough output bits and measuring the frequency of ones, it is possible to estimate &lt;math&gt;pq&lt;/math&gt; to arbitrary accuracy.

The operation above converts a fairly complicated computation (multiplication of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;) into a series of very simple operations (evaluation of &lt;math&gt;a_i \land b_i&lt;/math&gt;) on random bits.

More generally speaking, stochastic computing represents numbers as streams of random bits and reconstructs numbers by calculating frequencies.  The computations are performed on the streams and translate complicated operations on &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; into simple operations on their stream representations.  (Because of the method of reconstruction, devices that perform these operations are sometimes called stochastic averaging processors.)  In modern terms, stochastic computing can be viewed as an interpretation of calculations in probabilistic terms, which are then evaluated with a [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs sampler]]. It can also be interpreted as a hybrid [[Analog computer|analog]]/[[Computer|digital]] computer.

== History ==

[[Image:RASCEL stochastic computer 1969.png|thumb|alt=A photograph of the RASCEL stochastic computer.|The RASCEL stochastic computer, circa 1969]]

Stochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by [[John von Neumann]] in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |

theory could not be fully developed until advances in computing of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

Despite the intense interest in the 1960s and 1970s, stochastic
computing ultimately failed to compete with more traditional digital
logic, for reasons outlined below.  The first (and last)

took place in 1978; active research in the area dwindled over the next
few years.

Although stochastic computing declined as a general method of
computing, it has shown promise in several applications.  Research has
traditionally focused on certain tasks in machine learning and
control.&lt;ref&gt;

== Strengths and weaknesses ==

Although stochastic computing was a historical failure, it may still remain relevant for
solving certain problems.  To understand when it remains relevant, it is useful to
compare stochastic computing with more traditional methods of digital computing.

=== Strengths ===
Suppose we wish to multiply
two numbers each with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; bits of precision.
Using the typical [[Multiplication_algorithm#Long_multiplication|long
multiplication]] method, we need to perform
&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt; operations.  With stochastic computing, we can
AND together any number of bits and the expected value will always
be correct.  (However, with a small number of samples the variance will
render the actual result highly inaccurate).

Moreover, the underlying operations in a digital multiplier are
[[Adder (electronics)#Full adder|full adders]], whereas a stochastic
computer only requires an [[And gate|AND gate]].  Additionally,
a digital multiplier would naively require &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; input wires,
whereas a stochastic multiplier would only require 2 input wires{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}.
(If the digital multiplier serialized its output, however, it would also
require only 2 input wires.)

Additionally, stochastic computing is robust against noise; if a few
bits in a stream are flipped, those errors will have no significant impact
on the solution.

Furthermore, stochastic computing elements can tolerate skew in the arrival time of the inputs.
Circuits work properly even when the inputs are misaligned temporally. As a result, stochastic
systems can be designed to work with inexpensive locally generated clocks instead of using a global clock and 
an expensive clock distribution network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Najafi | first1 = M. H. | last2 = Lilja | first2 = D. J. | last3 = Riedel| first3 = M. D. | last4 = Bazargan | first4 = K. | doi = 10.1109/ASPDAC.2016.7428060 | title = Polysynchronous stochastic circuits | journal = 2016 21st Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC) | year = 2016 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, stochastic computing provides an estimate of the solution
that grows more accurate as we extend the bit stream.  In particular,
it provides a rough estimate very rapidly.  This property is usually 
referred to as ''progressive precision'', which suggests that the precision
of stochastic numbers (bit streams) increases as computation proceeds.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alaghi | first1 = A. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = J. P. | doi = 10.1145/2465787.2465794 | title = Survey of Stochastic Computing | journal = ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems | volume = 12 | issue = 2s | pages = 1 | year = 2013 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is as if the [[most significant bit]]s of the number
arrive before its [[least significant bit]]s; unlike the
conventional [[Arithmetic logic unit|arithmetic circuits]] where the most
significant bits usually arrive last. In some
iterative systems the partial solutions obtained through progressive precision can provide faster feedback
than through traditional computing methods, leading to faster
convergence.

=== Weaknesses ===

Stochastic computing is, by its very nature, random.  When we examine
a random bit stream and try to reconstruct the underlying value, the effective precision
can be measured by the variance of our sample.  In the example above, the digital multiplier
computes a number to &lt;math&gt; 2n &lt;/math&gt; bits of accuracy, so the
precision is &lt;math&gt; 2^{-2n}&lt;/math&gt;.  If we are using a random bit
stream to estimate a number and want the standard deviation of our
estimate of the solution to be at least &lt;math&gt; 2^{-2n}&lt;/math&gt;, we
would need &lt;math&gt; O(2^{4n}) &lt;/math&gt; samples.  This represents an
exponential increase in work. In certain applications, however, the
progressive precision property of stochastic computing can be exploited
to compensate this exponential loss.

Second, stochastic computing requires a method of generating random
biased bit streams.  In practice, these streams are generated with
[[Pseudorandom number generator|pseudo-random number generators]].  Unfortunately, generating
(pseudo-)random bits is fairly costly (compared to the expense of,
e.g., a full adder).  Therefore, the gate-level advantage of
stochastic computing is typically lost.

Third, the analysis of stochastic computing assumes that the bit
streams are independent (uncorrelated).  If this assumption does not
hold, stochastic computing can fail dramatically.  For instance, if we
try to compute &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; by multiplying a bit stream for
&lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; by itself, the process fails: since &lt;math&gt;a_i \land
a_i=a_i&lt;/math&gt;, the stochastic computation would yield &lt;math&gt; p \times p
= p &lt;/math&gt;, which is not generally true (unless &lt;math&gt;p=&lt;/math&gt;0 or 1).
In systems with feedback, the problem of decorrelation can manifest in
more complicated ways.  Systems of stochastic processors are prone to
''latching'', where feedback between different components can achieve
a deadlocked state.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| last1=Winstead
| first1=C.
| last2=Rapley
| first2=A.
| last3=Gaudet
| first3=V.
| last4=Schlegel
| first4=C.
| title=Stochastic iterative decoders
| journal=IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory
| location=Adelaide Australia
|date=September 2005
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
A great deal of effort must be spent decorrelating the system to
attempt to remediate latching.

Fourth, although some digital functions have very simple stochastic
counterparts (such as the translation between multiplication and the
AND gate), many do not.  Trying to express these functions stochastically
may cause various pathologies.  For instance, stochastic decoding requires
the computation of the function &lt;math&gt;f(p,q)\rightarrow pq/(pq + (1-p)(1-q))&lt;/math&gt;.
There is no single bit operation that can compute this function; the usual solution
involves producing correlated output bits, which, as we have seen above, can cause
a host of problems.

Other functions (such as the averaging operator &lt;math&gt;f(p,q)\rightarrow (p+q)/2&lt;/math&gt;) require 
either stream decimation or inflation.  Tradeoffs between precision and memory
can be challenging.

== Stochastic decoding ==

Although stochastic computing has a number of defects when considered
as a method of general computation, there are certain applications
that highlight its strengths.  One notable case occurs in the
decoding of certain error correcting codes.

In developments unrelated to stochastic computing, highly effective
methods of decoding [[Low-density parity-check code|LDPC codes]] using
the [[belief propagation]] algorithm were
developed.  Belief propagation in this context involves iteratively
reestimating certain parameters using two basic operations
(essentially, a probabilistic XOR operation and an averaging
operation).

In 2003, researchers realized that these two operations could be
modeled very simply with stochastic computing.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal
| title=Iterative decoding  using stochastic computation
| last1=Gaudet
| first1=Vincent
| last2=Rapley
| first2=Anthony
| journal=Electronics Letters
| volume=39
| number=3
| pages=299–301
|date=February 2003
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, since the
belief propagation algorithm is iterative, stochastic computing provides partial
solutions that may lead to faster convergence.
Hardware implementations of stochastic decoders have been built on [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGAs]].
&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference
| title=Stochastic implementation of LDPC decoders
| last1=Gross
| first1=W.
| last2=Gaudet
| first2=V.
| last3=Milner
| first3=A.
| booktitle=Conference Record of the Thirty-Ninth Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers
| year=2006
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The proponents of these methods argue that the performance of stochastic decoding is
competitive with digital alternatives.

== Variants of stochastic computing ==

There are a number of variants of the basic stochastic computing
paradigm.  Further information can be found in the referenced book by
Mars and Poppelbaum.

''Bundle Processing'' involves sending a fixed number of
bits instead of a stream.  One of the advantages of this approach is
that the precision is improved.  To see why, suppose we transmit
&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; bits.  In regular stochastic computing, we can
represent a precision of roughly &lt;math&gt;O(1/\sqrt{s})&lt;/math&gt; different
values, because of the variance of the estimate.  In bundle
processing, we can represent a precision of &lt;math&gt;1/s&lt;/math&gt;.
However, bundle processing retains the same robustness to error of
regular stochastic processing.

''Ergodic Processing'' involves sending a stream of bundles, which
captures the benefits of regular stochastic and bundle processing.

''Burst Processing'' encodes a number by a higher base increasing
stream.  For instance, we would encode 4.3 with ten decimal digits as
::: 4444444555
since the average value of the preceding stream is 4.3.  This
representation offers various advantages: there is no randomization
since the numbers appear in increasing order,
so the PRNG issues are avoided, but many of the advantages of
stochastic computing are retained (such as partial estimates of the
solution).  Additionally, it retains the linear precision of bundle
and ergodic processing.

A function f is said to be strict if, when applied to a non-terminating expression, it also fails to terminate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/functions.html|title=A Gentle Introduction to Haskell: Functions|website=www.haskell.org|access-date=2016-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A '''strict function''' in the [[denotational semantics]] of [[programming language]]s is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' where &lt;math&gt;f\left(\perp\right) = \perp&lt;/math&gt;.  The entity &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;, called ''[[Bottom type|bottom]]'', denotes an expression which does not return a normal value, either because it loops endlessly or because it aborts due to an error such as division by zero.  A function which is not strict is called '''non-strict'''. A [[strict programming language]] is one in which user-defined functions are always strict.

Intuitively, non-strict functions correspond to [[control structure]]s. Operationally, a strict function is one which always [[evaluate]]s its [[parameter|argument]]; a non-strict function is one which may not evaluate some of its arguments. Functions having more than one parameter may be strict or non-strict in each parameter independently, as well as ''jointly strict'' in several parameters simultaneously.

As an example, the &lt;tt&gt;if-then-else&lt;/tt&gt; expression of many programming languages may be thought of as a function of three parameters. This function is strict in its first parameter, since the function must know whether its first argument evaluates to true or to false before it can return; but it is non-strict in its second parameter, because (for example) &lt;tt&gt;if(false,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;,1) = 1&lt;/tt&gt;, as well as non-strict in its third parameter, because (for example) &lt;tt&gt;if(true,2,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) = 2&lt;/tt&gt;. However, it is jointly strict in its second and third parameters, since &lt;tt&gt;if(true,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;if(false,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\perp&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;.

In a [[non-strict programming language|non-strict]] [[functional programming]] language, [[strictness analysis]] refers to any algorithm used to prove the strictness of a function with respect to one or more of its arguments. Such functions can be [[compilation (programming)|compiled]] to a more efficient [[calling convention]], such as [[call by value]], without changing the meaning of the enclosing program.

A '''synthetic radioisotope''' is a [[radionuclide]] that is not found in nature: no natural process or mechanism exists which produces it, or it is so unstable that it decays away in a very short period of time. Examples include [[technetium]]-95 and [[promethium]]-146. Many of these are found in, and harvested from, [[spent nuclear fuel]] assemblies. Some must be manufactured in [[particle accelerator]]s.

==Production==
Some synthetic radioisotopes are extracted from spent [[nuclear reactor]] fuel rods, which contain various [[fission products]]. For example, it is estimated that up to 1994, about 49,000 [[Becquerel|terabecquerels ]] (78 [[tonne|metric ton]]) of [[technetium]] was produced in nuclear reactors, which is by far the dominant source of terrestrial technetium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshihara|first1=K|editor1-last=Yoshihara|editor1-first=K|editor2-last=Omori|editor2-first=T|title=Technetium and Rhenium Their Chemistry and Its Applications|date=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-59469-7|chapter=Technetium in the environment|series=Topics in Current Chemistry|volume=176|doi=10.1007/3-540-59469-8_2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some synthetic isotopes are produced in significant quantities by fission but are not yet being reclaimed.  Other isotopes are manufactured by [[neutron]] irradiation of parent isotopes in a nuclear reactor (for example, Tc-97 can be made by neutron irradiation of Ru-96) or by bombarding parent isotopes with high energy particles from a particle accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radioisotope Production|url=http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|publisher=Brookhaven National Laboratory|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106040156/http://www.bnl.gov/medical/Isotope_Distribution/Isodistoff.htm|archivedate=6 January 2010|date=2009|deadurl=bot: unknown|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual for reactor produced radioisotopes.|date=2003|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-101103-2|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6407/Manual-for-Reactor-Produced-Radioisotopes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many isotopes are produced in [[cyclotron]]s, for example [[fluorine-18]] and [[oxygen-15]] which are widely used for [[positron emission tomography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cyclotron Produced Radionuclides: Physical Characteristics and Production Methods|date=2009|publisher=IAEA|location=Vienna|isbn=978-92-0-106908-5|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/iaeabooks/7892/Cyclotron-Produced-Radionuclides-Physical-Characteristics-and-Production-Methods}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Most synthetic radioisotopes have a short [[half-life]]. Though a health hazard, radioactive materials have many medical and industrial uses.

===Nuclear medicine===
The field of [[nuclear medicine]] covers use of radioisotopes for diagnosis or treatment.

====Diagnosis====
Radioactive tracer compounds, [[radiopharmaceutical]]s, are used to observe the function of various organs and body systems. These compounds use a chemical tracer which is attracted to or concentrated by the activity which is being studied. That chemical tracer incorporates a short lived radioactive isotope, usually one which emits a [[gamma ray]] which is energetic enough to travel through the body and be captured outside by a [[gamma camera]] to map the concentrations. [[Gamma camera]]s and other similar detectors are highly efficient, and the tracer compounds are generally very effective at concentrating at the areas of interest, so the total amounts of radioactive material needed are very small.

The metastable [[nuclear isomer]] Tc-99m is a [[gamma-ray]] emitter widely used for medical diagnostics because it has a short half-life of 6 hours, but can be easily made in the hospital using a [[technetium-99m generator]]. Weekly global demand for the parent isotope [[molybdenum-99]] was {{convert|12000|Ci|TBq|lk=out|order=flip|abbr=on}} in 2010, overwhelmingly provided by fission of [[uranium-235]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production and Supply of Molybdenum-99|url=https://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC54/GC54InfDocuments/English/gc54inf-3-att7_en.pdf|publisher=IAEA|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
Several radioisotopes and compounds are used for [[Unsealed source radiotherapy|medical treatment]], usually by bringing the radioactive isotope to a high concentration in the body near a particular organ. For example, [[iodine]]-131 is used for treating some disorders and tumors of the [[thyroid]] gland.

===Industrial radiation sources===
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}
[[Alpha particle]], [[beta particle]], and [[gamma ray]] radioactive emissions are industrially useful. Most sources of these are synthetic radioisotopes. Areas of use include the [[Uses of radioactivity in oil and gas wells|petroleum industry]], [[industrial radiography]], [[homeland security]], [[process control]] and [[food irradiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenblatt|first1=Jack A.|title=Stable and Radioactive Isotopes: Industry &amp; Trade Summary|url=https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/ITS-1.pdf|website=Office of Industries|publisher=United States International Trade Commission|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rivard|first1=Mark J.|last2=Bobek|first2=Leo M.|last3=Butler|first3=Ralph A.|last4=Garland|first4=Marc A.|last5=Hill|first5=David J.|last6=Krieger|first6=Jeanne K.|last7=Muckerheide|first7=James B.|last8=Patton|first8=Brad D.|last9=Silberstein|first9=Edward B.|title=The US national isotope program: Current status and strategy for future success|journal=Applied Radiation and Isotopes|date=August 2005|volume=63|issue=2|pages=157–178|doi=10.1016/j.apradiso.2005.03.004|url=https://www.isotopes.gov/outreach/reports/Rivard.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=Doug|title=Radioactive Isotopes in Process Measurement|url=https://www.controlglobal.com/assets/12WPpdf/121105-vega-isotopes-measurement.pdf|publisher=VEGA Controls|accessdate=4 March 2018|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tafwid''' ({{lang-ar|تفويض}}) is an Arabic term meaning "relegation" or "delegation", with uses in theology and law.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== In theology ==

In Islamic theology, ''tafwid'' (or ''tafwid al-amr li-llah'', relegation of matters to God) is a doctrine according to which the meanings of the ambiguous verses of the [[Qur'an]] should be consigned to God alone.&lt;ref name=ODOI&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA310|title=Tafwid|encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of Islam|editor=John L.

The doctrine of ''tafwid'', which was held by a number of classical scholars such as [[al-Ghazali]] and whose origin they attributed to the ''[[salaf]]'' (exemplary early Muslims), states that the Quranic expressions such as 'God's hands' or 'face' do not carry the literal meanings like their counterparts in human beings. Rather they are attributes or qualities of God and not organs like the face or hands of human beings.&lt;ref name="Phd338"&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. Dissertation|last=Shah |first=Zulfikar|date=March 1997 |title=A Study of Anthropomorphism and Transcendence in the Bible and Qur'an.

On this matter, we follow the early Muslims ([[salaf]]): [[Malik]], [[Awza'i]], [[Thawri]], [[Al-Layth ibn Sa'd|Layth ibn Sa'd]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh]], and others among the Imams of the Muslims, both ancient and modern that is, to let (the verse in question) pass as it has come, without saying how it is meant (min ghayr takyif), without likening it to created things (wa la tashbih), and without nullifying it (wa la ta'til): The literal meaning ([[zahir (Islam)|zahir]]) that occurs to the minds of anthropomorphists (al-mushabbihin) is negated of Allah, for nothing from His creation resembles Him: '''"There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing"''' (Qur'an 42:11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=htx8BAAAQBAJ|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of al-Bajuri|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|date=2014-09-09|publisher=SUNY Press|year=|isbn=9781438453712|location=|pages=129–130|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tafsir al-Qur'an al-Azim|last=Ibn Kathir|first=Ismail|publisher=Maktabat Awlad al-Shaykh l'il Turath|year=2000|location=Cairo|pages=6:320}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The precise nature of ''tafwid'' has been subject to debate among Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=Lauziere&gt;{{Cite book|first=Henri |last=Lauzière | year=2015 | title=The Making of Salafism: Islamic Reform in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Columbia University Press (Kindle edition)|page=6048 (Kindle location)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Ibn Taymiyya]], including contemporary [[Salafi]]s, hold that only the modality of the attributes should be consigned to God (''tafwid al-kayfiyya''), while the literal sense of the attributes should be accepted according to their lexical meaning in the Arabic language.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; Thus they argue that the ''salaf'' accepted that God has a hand, because the meaning of the word "hand" (''yad'') was known, but without assuming that God's hand is comparable to a human hand, or asking how or why that is.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt; In contrast, anti-Salafi scholars reject this distinction and accept ''tafwid'' without qualification.&lt;ref name=Lauziere/&gt;

== Divorce==

In Islamic personal status law, ''tafwid'' refers to a sub-type of divorce (''talaq al-tafwid'' or ''tafwid al-talaq'') in which the power of ''[[Divorce in Islam|talaq]]'' (the type of divorce normally initiated by the husband) is delegated to the wife. This delegation can be made at the time of drawing up the marriage contract or during the marriage, with or without conditions.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Classical jurists differed as to the validity of different forms of delegation.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt; Most modern Muslim-majority countries permit this type of divorce in some form.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

== Other uses==

The term ''tafwid'' has also been used in law with various other meanings related to delegation of power, authorization of an act, or issuance of a warrant for arrest.&lt;ref name=ODOI/&gt;

In a music score, the time signature appears at the beginning as a time symbol or stacked numerals, such as {{music|common-time}} or {{music|time|3|4}} (read ''common time'' and ''three-four time'', respectively), immediately following the [[key signature]] (or immediately following the [[clef]] symbol if the key signature is empty). A mid-score time signature, usually immediately following a [[barline]], indicates a change of meter.

There are various types of time signatures, depending on whether the music follows regular (or symmetrical) beat patterns, including [[Time signature#Simple|simple]] (e.g., {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|4|4}}), and [[Time signature#Compound|compound]] (e.g., {{music|time|9|8}} and {{music|time|12|8}}); or involves shifting beat patterns, including [[#Complex time signatures|complex]] (e.g., {{music|time|5|4}} or {{music|time|7|8}}), [[#Mixed meters|mixed]] (e.g., {{music|time|5|8}} &amp; {{music|time|3|8}} or {{music|time|6|8}} &amp; {{music|time|3|4}}), [[#Additive meters|additive]] (e.g., {{music|time|3+2+3|8}}), [[#Variants|fractional]] (e.g., {{music|time|{{frac|2|1|2}}|4}}), and [[#Irrational meters|irrational meters]] (e.g., {{music|time|3|10}} or {{music|time|5|24}}).

==Frequently used time signatures==
[[Image:common time signatures.gif|right|frame|Basic time signatures: {{music|time|4|4}}, also known as ''common time'' ({{music|common-time}}); {{music|time|2|2}}, ''[[alla breve]]'', also known as ''cut time'' or ''cut-common time'' ({{music|alla-breve}}); {{music|time|2|4}}; {{music|time|3|4}}; and {{music|time|6|8}}]]

=== Simple vs. compound ===

==== Simple ====
Simple time signatures consist of two numerals, one stacked above the other:
&lt;!-- Note to editors:
 We deliberately describe the lower numeral first and the upper numeral later,
 as this is clearer.  Please don't change it unless you can make it even clearer.
--&gt;
* The ''lower'' numeral indicates the note value that represents one beat (the ''beat unit'').  This number is typically a [[Power of two|power of 2]].
* The ''upper'' numeral indicates how many such beats constitute a [[bar (music)|bar]].
For instance, {{music|time|2|4}} means two [[quarter-note]] (crotchet) beats per bar, while {{music|time|3|8}} means three [[eighth-note]] (quaver) beats per bar. The most common simple time signatures are {{music|time|2|4}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, and {{music|time|4|4}}.

By convention, two special symbols are sometimes used for {{music|time|4|4}} and {{music|time|2|2}}:
* The symbol {{music|common-time}} is sometimes used for {{music|time|4|4}} time, also called ''common time'' or ''imperfect time''. The symbol is derived from a [[#Early music usage|broken circle]] used in music notation from the 14th through 16th centuries, where a full circle represented what today would be written in {{music|time|3|2}} or {{music|time|3|4}} time, and was called ''tempus perfectum'' (perfect time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Time signature#Mensural time signatures|Mensural time signatures]] below.
* The symbol {{music|cut-time}} is also a carry-over from the notational practice of late-Medieval and Renaissance music, where it signified ''tempus imperfectum diminutum'' (diminished imperfect time)—more precisely, a doubling of the speed, or ''proportio dupla'', in duple meter.&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music 900–1600'', fifth edition, revised and with commentary; The Medieval Academy of America Publication no. 38 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Medieval Academy of America, 1953): 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt; In modern notation, it is used in place of {{music|time|2|2}} and is called ''[[alla breve]]'' or, colloquially, ''cut time'' or ''cut common time''.

====Compound====
In [[Compound meter (music)|compound meter]], subdivisions (which are what the upper number represents in these meters) of the beat are in three equal parts, so that a [[dotted note]] (half again longer than a regular note) becomes the beat. The upper numeral of compound time signatures is commonly 3, 6, 9, or 12 (multiples of 3 in each beat). The lower number is most commonly an 8 (an eighth-note or quaver): as in {{music|time|9|8}} or {{music|time|12|8}}.

====Examples====
In the examples below, '''bold''' denotes a more-stressed beat, and ''italics'' denotes a less-stressed beat.

''Simple'': The meter {{music|time|3|4}} is a simple time signature that represents three quarter notes (crotchets). It is felt as
::{{music|time|3|4}}: '''one''' and ''two'' and ''three'' and ...

''Compound'': In principle, {{music|time|6|8}} comprises not three groups of two eighth notes (quavers) but two groups of three eighth-note (quaver) subdivisions. It is felt as
::{{music|time|6|8}}: '''one''' two three ''four'' five six ...

These examples assume, for simplicity, that continuous eighth notes are the prevailing note values. The rhythm of actual music is typically not as regular.

=== Duple, triple, etc. ===
Time signatures indicating ''two'' beats per bar (whether in simple or compound meter) are called [[duple time|''duple meter'']], while those with ''three'' beats to the bar are [[triple time|''triple meter'']]. Terms such as ''[[Quadruple meter|quadruple]]'' (4), ''[[Quintuple meter|quintuple]]'' (5), and so on, are also occasionally used.

===Beating time signatures===
To the ear, a bar may seem like one singular beat. For example, a fast waltz, notated in {{music|time|3|4}} time, may be described as being ''one in a bar''. Correspondingly, at slow tempos, the beat indicated by the time signature could in actual performance be divided into smaller units.

On a formal mathematical level, the time signatures of, e.g., {{music|time|3|4}} and {{music|time|3|8}} are interchangeable. In a sense, ''all'' simple triple time signatures, such as {{music|time|3|8}}, {{music|time|3|4}}, {{music|time|3|2}}, etc.—and all compound duple times, such as {{music|time|6|8}}, {{music|time|6|16}} and so on, are equivalent. A piece in {{music|time|3|4}} can be easily rewritten in {{music|time|3|8}}, simply by halving the length of the notes. 

:&lt;score vorbis="1" override_midi="3-4 equals 3-8 drum pattern.mid" lang="lilypond"&gt;
    \new Staff &lt;&lt;
       \new voice \relative c' {
           \clef percussion
           \time 3/4
           \tempo 4 = 100       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g4 d' d }
           \time 3/8
           \tempo 8 = 100       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g,8 d' d }
       }

           \stemUp \repeat volta 2 { a16 a a a a a }
       }
   &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;

Other time signature rewritings are possible: most commonly a simple time signature with triplets translates into a compound meter.

    \new Staff &lt;&lt;
       \new voice \relative c' {

           \time 12/8
           \tempo 4. = 66       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g4. d' g, d' }
           \numericTimeSignature
           \time 4/4
           \tempo 4 = 66       
           \stemDown \repeat volta 2 { g,4 d' g, d' }
       }
       \new voice \relative c'' {
           \override NoteHead.style = #'cross
           \stemUp \repeat volta 2 { a8 a a a a a  a a a a a a }
           \stemUp \repeat volta 2 { \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } \tuplet 3/2 { a8 a a } }
       }
   &gt;&gt;
&lt;/score&gt;
Though formally interchangeable, for a composer or performing musician, by convention, different time signatures often have different connotations. First, a smaller note value in the beat unit implies a more complex notation, which can affect ease of performance. Second, beaming affects the choice of actual beat divisions. It is, for example, more natural to use the quarter note/crotchet as a beat unit in {{music|time|6|4}} or {{music|time|2|2}} than the eight/quaver in {{music|time|6|8}} or {{music|time|2|4}}. {{fact|date=November 2015}} Third, time signatures are traditionally associated with different music styles—it might seem strange to notate a rock tune in {{music|time|4|8}} or {{music|time|4|2}}.

In the Western popular music tradition, unusual time signatures occur as well, with [[progressive rock]] in particular making frequent use of them. The use of shifting meters in [[The Beatles]]' "[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]" and the use of [[quintuple meter]] in their "[[Within You, Without You]]" are well-known examples,&lt;ref name="Macan"&gt;Edward Macan, ''Rocking the Classics: English Progressive Rock and the Counterculture'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997): 48. {{ISBN|978-0-19-509888-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as is [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Paranoid Android]]" (includes {{music|time|7|8}}).&lt;ref&gt;Radiohead (musical group).

[[Paul Desmond]]'s [[jazz]] composition "[[Take Five]]", in {{music|time|5|4}} time, was one of a number of irregular-meter compositions that [[The Dave Brubeck Quartet]] played. They played other compositions in {{music|time|11|4}} ("Eleven Four"), {{music|time|7|4}} ("[[Unsquare Dance]]"), and {{music|time|9|8}} ("[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]"), expressed as {{music|time|2+2+2+3|8}}. This last is an example of a work in a signature that, despite appearing merely compound triple, is actually more complex. Brubeck's title refers to the characteristic ''[[aksak]]'' meter of the Turkish ''[[karşılama]]'' dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Manuel|first1=Peter|title=Popular Musics of the Non-Western World: An Introductory Survey|date=1988|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195063349|page=131|edition=rev.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such time signatures are only unusual in most Western music. Traditional [[music of the Balkans]] uses such meters extensively. [[Bulgarian dances]], for example, include forms with 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 22, 25 and other numbers of beats per measure. These rhythms are notated as ''[[additive rhythm]]s'' based on simple units, usually 2, 3 and 4 beats, though the notation fails to describe the [[meter (music)|metric]] "time bending" taking place, or [[compound meter (music)|compound meters]]. See [[#Additive meters|Additive meters]] below.

==Mixed meters==
While time signatures usually express a regular pattern of beat stresses continuing through a piece (or at least a section), sometimes composers place a different time signature at the beginning of each bar, resulting in music with an extremely irregular rhythmic feel. In this case, the time signatures are an aid to the performers and not ''necessarily'' an indication of meter. The Promenade from [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' (1874) is a good example. The opening measures are shown below:

[[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' (1913) is famous for its "savage" rhythms. Five measures from "Ritual Action of the Ancestors" are shown below:

:&lt;score vorbis="1" lang="lilypond"&gt; { \new PianoStaff &lt;&lt; \new Staff \relative c'' { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #"violin" \clef treble \tempo 8 = 126 \override DynamicLineSpanner.staff-padding = #4 \time 3/16 r16 &lt;d c a fis d&gt;-! r16\fermata | \time 2/16 r &lt;d c a fis d&gt;-! \time 3/16 r &lt;d c a fis d&gt;8-! | r16 &lt;d c a fis d&gt;8-! | \time 2/8 &lt;d c a fis&gt;16-! &lt;e c bes g&gt;-&gt;-![ &lt;cis b aes f&gt;-! &lt;c a fis ees&gt;-!] } \new Staff \relative c { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #"violin" \clef bass \time 3/16 d,16-! &lt;bes'' ees,&gt;^\f-! r\fermata | \time 2/16 &lt;d,, d,&gt;-! &lt;bes'' ees,&gt;-! | \time 3/16 d16-! &lt;ees cis&gt;8-! | r16 &lt;ees cis&gt;8-! | \time 2/8 d16^\sf-! &lt;ees cis&gt;-!-&gt;[ &lt;d c&gt;-! &lt;d c&gt;-!] } &gt;&gt; } &lt;/score&gt;

In such cases, a convention that some composers follow (e.g., [[Olivier Messiaen]], in his ''[[La Nativité du Seigneur]]'' and ''[[Quatuor pour la fin du temps]]'') is to simply omit the time signature. [[Charles Ives]]'s ''[[Concord Sonata]]'' has measure bars for select passages, but the majority of the work is unbarred.

Some pieces have no time signature, as there is no discernible meter. This is sometimes known as [[free time (music)|''free time'']]. Sometimes one is provided (usually {{music|time|4|4}}) so that the performer finds the piece easier to read, and simply has "free time" written as a direction. Sometimes the word ''FREE'' is written downwards on the staff to indicate the piece is in free time. [[Erik Satie]] wrote many compositions that are ostensibly in free time but actually follow an unstated and unchanging simple time signature. Later composers used this device more effectively, writing music almost devoid of a discernibly regular pulse.

If two time signatures alternate repeatedly, sometimes the two signatures are placed together at the beginning of the piece or section, as shown below:

:[[File:Tchaikovsky String Quartet in F excerpt.png|center|thumb|460px|Detail of score of Tchaikovsky's [[String Quartet No. 2 (Tchaikovsky)|String Quartet No.&amp;nbsp;2 in F major]], showing a multiple time signature]]

==Additive meters==
To indicate more complex patterns of stresses, such as [[additive rhythm]]s, more complex time signatures can be used. Additive meters have a pattern of [[Beat (music)|beats]] that subdivide into smaller, irregular groups. Such meters are sometimes called ''imperfect'', in contrast to ''perfect meters'', in which the [[Bar (music)|bar]] is first divided into equal units.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner Read, ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'' (Boston: Allyn and Bacon, Inc., 1964): {{Page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the time signature {{music|time|3+2+3|8}} means that there are 8 quaver beats in the bar, divided as the first of a group of three eighth notes (quavers) that are stressed, then the first of a group of two, then first of a group of three again. The stress pattern is usually counted as 

:: {{music|time|3+2+3|8}}: '''one''' two three ''one'' two ''one'' two three ...

This kind of time signature is commonly used to notate folk and non-Western types of music. In classical music, [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] have used such time signatures in their works. The first movement of [[Maurice Ravel]]'s [[Piano Trio (Ravel)|Piano Trio in A Minor]] is written in {{music|time|8|8}}, in which the beats are likewise subdivided into {{serif|'''3+2+3'''}} to reflect [[Basque music|Basque]] dance rhythms.

Romanian [[musicologist]] [[Constantin Brăiloiu]] had a special interest in compound time signatures, developed while studying the [[Traditional music of Romania|traditional music]] of certain regions in his country. While investigating the origins of such unusual meters, he learned that they were even more characteristic of the traditional music of neighboring peoples (e.g., the [[Bulgarian Folk Music|Bulgarians]]). He suggested that such timings can be regarded as compounds of simple two-beat and three-beat meters, where an accent falls on every first beat, even though, for example in [[Bulgarian dances|Bulgarian music]], beat lengths of 1, 2, 3, 4 are used in the metric description. In addition, when focused only on stressed beats, simple time signatures can count as beats in a slower, compound time. However, there are two different-length beats in this resulting compound time, a one half-again longer than the short beat (or conversely, the short beat is {{frac|2|3}} the value of the long). This type of meter is called ''[[aksak]]'' (the Turkish word for "limping"), ''impeded'', ''jolting'', or ''shaking'', and is described as an ''irregular bichronic rhythm''. A certain amount of confusion for Western musicians is inevitable, since a measure they would likely regard as {{music|time|7|16}}, for example, is a three-beat measure in ''aksak'', with one long and two short beats (with subdivisions of {{serif|'''2+2+3'''}}, {{serif|'''2+3+2'''}}, or {{serif|'''3+2+2'''}}).&lt;ref&gt;Constantin Brăiloiu, ''Le rythme Aksak'', ''Revue de Musicologie'' 33, nos. 99 and 100 (December 1951): 71–108. Citation on pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Folk music may make use of metric time bends, so that the proportions of the performed metric beat time lengths differ from the exact proportions indicated by the metric. Depending on playing style of the same meter, the time bend can vary from non-existent to considerable; in the latter case, some musicologists may want to assign a different meter. For example, the Bulgarian tune "[[Bulgarian dances|Eleno Mome]]" is written in one of three forms: (1) {{serif|'''7 {{=}} 2+2+1+2'''}}, (2) {{serif|'''13 {{=}} 4+4+2+3'''}}, or (3) {{serif|'''12 {{=}} 3+4+2+3'''}}, but an actual performance (e.g., [https://folkways.si.edu/eleno-mome/world/music/track/smithsonian Smithsonian Eleno Mome]) may be closer to {{serif|'''4+4+2+3'''}}. The Macedonian {{serif|'''[[Leventikos|3+2+2+3+2]]'''}} meter is even more complicated, with heavier time bends, and use of quadruples on the threes. The metric beat time proportions may vary with the speed that the tune is played. The Swedish [[Polska (dance)|Boda Polska]] (Polska from the parish Boda) has a typical elongated second beat.

In Western classical music, metric time bend is used in the performance of the [[Viennese Waltz]]. Most Western music uses metric ratios of 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 (two-, three- or four-beat time signatures)—in other words, integer ratios that make all beats equal in time length. So, relative to that, 3:2 and 4:3 ratios correspond to very distinctive metric rhythm profiles. Complex accentuation occurs in Western music, but as [[syncopation]] rather than as part of the metric accentuation.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Brăiloiu borrowed a term from [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] medieval music theory: ''aksak''. Such compound time signatures fall under the "aksak rhythm" category that he introduced along with a couple more that should describe the rhythm figures in traditional music.&lt;ref name="Oprea"&gt;Gheorghe Oprea, ''Folclorul muzical românesc'' (Bucharest: Ed. Muzicala, 2002), {{Page needed|date=January 2010}} {{ISBN|973-42-0304-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Brăiloiu revived had moderate success worldwide, but in Eastern Europe it is still frequently used. However, aksak rhythm figures occur not only in a few European countries, but on all continents, featuring various combinations of the two and three sequences. The longest are in Bulgaria. The shortest aksak rhythm figures follow the five-beat timing, comprising a two and a three (or three and two).

Irrational time signatures (rarely, "non-dyadic time signatures") are used for so-called ''irrational bar lengths'',&lt;ref name="Sospeso"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014850/http://www.sospeso.com/contents/articles/ferneyhough_p1.html "Brian Ferneyhough"], ''The Ensemble Sospeso''&lt;/ref&gt; that have a [[denominator]] that is not a [[power of two]] (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, etc.).

These signatures are of utility only when juxtaposed with other signatures with varying denominators; a piece written entirely in {{music|time|4|3}}, say, could be more legibly written out in {{music|time|4|4}}.

According to [[Brian Ferneyhough]], [[metric modulation]] is "a somewhat distant analogy" to his own use of "irrational time signatures" as a sort of rhythmic dissonance.&lt;ref name="Sospeso"/&gt; It is arguable whether the use of these signatures makes metric relationships clearer or more obscure to the musician; it is always possible to write a passage using non-irrational signatures by specifying a relationship between some note length in the previous bar and some other in the succeeding one. Sometimes, successive metric relationships between bars are so convoluted that the pure use of irrational signatures would quickly render the notation extremely hard to penetrate. Good examples, written entirely in conventional signatures with the aid of between-bar specified metric relationships, occur a number of times in [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]' opera [[Nixon in China (opera)|''Nixon in China'']] (1987), where the sole use of irrational signatures would quickly produce massive numerators and denominators.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Historically, this device has been prefigured wherever composers wrote [[tuplets]]. For example, a {{music|time|2|4}} bar of 3 triplet crotchets could arguably be written as a bar of {{music|time|3|6}}. [[Henry Cowell]]'s piano piece ''Fabric'' (1920) employs separate divisions of the bar (anything from 1 to 9) for the three [[contrapuntal]] parts, using a scheme of shaped [[Notehead|noteheads]] to visually clarify the differences, but the pioneering of these signatures is largely due to [[Brian Ferneyhough]], who says that he finds that "such 'irrational' measures serve as a useful buffer between local changes of event density and actual changes of base [[tempo]]".&lt;ref name="Sospeso"/&gt; [[Thomas Adès]] has also used them extensively—for example in ''[[Traced Overhead]]'' (1996), the second movement of which contains, among more conventional meters, bars in such signatures as {{music|time|2|6}}, {{music|time|9|14}} and {{music|time|5|24}}.

A gradual process of diffusion into less rarefied musical circles seems underway.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!--A single quirky example hardly consistutes a trend. Who thinks there is one?--&gt; For example, [[John Pickard (composer)|John Pickard]]'s ''Eden'', commissioned for the 2005 finals of the [[National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain]] contains bars of {{music|time|3|10}} and {{music|time|7|12}}.&lt;ref&gt;John Pickard: Eden, full score, Kirklees Music, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notationally, rather than using Cowell's elaborate series of notehead shapes, the same convention has been invoked as when normal tuplets are written; for example, one beat in {{music|time|4|5}} is written as a normal quarter note, four quarter notes complete the bar, but the whole bar lasts only {{frac|4|5}} of a reference [[whole note]], and a beat {{frac|1|5}} of one (or {{frac|4|5}} of a normal quarter note). This is notated in exactly the same way that one would write if one were writing the first four quarter notes of five quintuplet quarter notes.

This article uses ''irrational'' in the music theory sense, not the mathematical sense, where an [[irrational number]] is one that ''cannot'' be written as a ratio of whole numbers. However, a few pieces from [[Conlon Nancarrow]]'s ''Studies for Player Piano'' use numbers that are irrational in the mathematical sense. A piece contains a [[Canon (music)|canon]] with a part augmented in the ratio {{sqrt|42}}:1 (approximately 6.48:1). Another employs a ratio of π:e{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

|}

==Variants==
Some composers have used fractional beats: for example, the time signature {{music|time|{{frac|2|1|2}}|4}} appears in [[Carlos Chávez]]'s Piano Sonata No. 3 (1928) IV, m. 1.

[[Image:orff time signatures.gif|frame|right|Example of Orff's time signatures]]
Music educator [[Carl Orff]] proposed replacing the lower number of the time signature with an actual note image, as shown at right. This system eliminates the need for compound time signatures, which are confusing to beginners. While this notation has not been adopted by music publishers generally (except in Orff's own compositions), it is used extensively in music education textbooks. Similarly, American composers [[George Crumb]] and [[Joseph Schwantner]], among others, have used this system in many of their works.

Another possibility is to extend the barline where a time change is to take place above the top instrument's line in a score and to write the time signature there, and there only, saving the ink and effort that would have been spent writing it in each instrument's staff. [[Henryk Górecki]]'s ''Beatus Vir'' is an example of this. Alternatively, music in a large score sometimes has time signatures written as very long, thin numbers covering the whole height of the score rather than replicating it on each staff; this is an aid to the conductor, who can see signature changes more easily.

==Early music usage==

===Mensural time signatures===
In the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, a period in which [[mensural notation]] was used, four basic ''mensuration signs'' determined the proportion between the two main units of rhythm. There were no measure or [[bar (music)|bar]] lines in music of this period; these signs, the ancestors of modern time signatures, indicate the ratio of [[duration (music)|duration]] between different [[note value]]s. The relation between the ''breve'' and the ''semibreve'' was called '''tempus''', and the relation between the ''semibreve'' and the ''minim'' was called '''prolatio'''. The breve and the semibreve use roughly the same symbols as our modern [[double whole note]] (breve) and whole note (semibreve), but they were not limited to the same proportional values as are in use today. There are complicated rules concerning how a breve is sometimes three and sometimes two semibreves. Unlike modern notation, the duration ratios between these different values was not always 2:1; it could be either 2:1 or 3:1, and that is what, amongst other things, these mensuration signs indicated. A ratio of 3:1 was called ''complete'', perhaps a reference to the [[Trinity]], and a ratio of 2:1 was called ''incomplete''.

A circle used as a mensuration sign indicated ''tempus perfectum'' (a circle being a symbol of completeness), while an incomplete circle, resembling a letter C, indicated ''tempus imperfectum''. Assuming the breve is a beat, this corresponds to the modern concepts of [[meter (music)#Triple meter|triple meter]] and [[meter (music)#Duple meter|duple meter]], respectively. In either case, a dot in the center indicated ''prolatio perfecta'' ([[meter (music)#Compound meter|compound meter]]) while the absence of such a dot indicated ''prolatio imperfecta'' ([[meter (music)#Simple meter|simple meter]]).

A rough equivalence of these signs to modern meters would be:
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 1 (alternative).svg|13px]] corresponds to {{music|time|9|8}} meter;
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 2 (alternative).svg|13px]] corresponds to {{music|time|3|4}} meter;
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 3 (alternative).svg|12px]] corresponds to {{music|time|6|8}} meter;
* [[Image:Mensural time signature 4 (alternative).svg|12px]] corresponds to {{music|time|2|4}} meter.

N.B.: in modern compound meters the beat is a dotted note value, such as a dotted quarter, because the ratios of the modern note value hierarchy are always 2:1. Dotted notes were never used in this way in the mensural period; the main beat unit was always a simple (undotted) note value.

===Proportions===
Another set of signs in [[mensural notation]] specified the metric proportions of one section to another, similar to a [[metric modulation]]. A few common signs are shown:&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music 900–1600'', fifth edition, revised with commentary; The Medieval Academy of America Publication no. 38 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Image:Allabreve.svg|12px]] ''tempus imperfectum diminutum'', 1:2 proportion (twice as fast);
* [[Image:mensural proportion 2.svg|13px]] ''tempus perfectum diminutum'', 1:2 proportion (twice as fast);
* [[Image:mensural proportion 5.svg|22px]] or just [[Image:mensural proportion 4.svg|10px]] ''proportio tripla'', 1:3 proportion (three times as fast, similar to triplets).

Often the ratio was expressed as two numbers, one above the other,&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''The Notation of Polyphonic Music 900–1600'', fifth edition, revised with commentary; The Medieval Academy of America Publication no. 38 (Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Mediaeval Academy of America, 1953), p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; looking similar to a modern time signature, though it could have values such as {{music|time|4|3}}, which a conventional time signature could not.

Some proportional signs were not used consistently from one place or century to another. In addition, certain composers delighted in creating "puzzle" compositions that were intentionally difficult to decipher.

In particular, when the sign [[Image:Allabreve.svg|11px]] was encountered, the [[Pulse (music)|tactus]] (beat) changed from the usual [[semibreve]] to the [[Double whole note|breve]], a circumstance called ''alla breve''. This term has been sustained to the present day, and though now it means the beat is a [[minim (music)|minim]] (half note), in contradiction to the literal meaning of the phrase, it still indicates that the beat has changed to a longer note value.

==Prehistory==
13,000 BC

The earliest evidence of man's interest in insects is from [[Cave painting|rock paintings]]. The insects depicted are [[bees]].

1800–1700 BC

Bees were significant in other early civilisations, for instance at [[Malia (city)|Malia]], [[Crete]], where jewellery depicts two golden bees holding a drop of honey.

==Egypt, Greek and Roman empires==

[[Bee-keeping]] was particularly well developed in Egypt and was discussed by the Roman writers [[Virgil]], [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], [[Varro]] and [[Columella]].

620–560 BC 
*[[Aesop's Fables]] relate stories of grasshoppers, ants and other insects.

343 BC (circa]

*[[Aristotle]] writes ''[[History of Animals]]'' In this work Aristotle includes insects in a class "Entoma" which also includes the arachnids and the myriapods but not the Crustacea which formed another class "Malacostraca" of the "Anaema" or "bloodless animals." ("Insecta" is the Latin translation of Aristotle’s εντομον (Entomon)''. [[Parts of Animals]]'' on zoological anatomy followed. For nearly 2000 years the few writers who dealt with zoological subjects followed Aristotle's leading.

==18th century==

[[Image:Reaumur 1683-1757.jpg|thumb|220px|right|René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur.]]

'''The development of entomology in the 18th century'''

In the 18th century three kinds of entomological text appeared. Firstly there were illustrative works – showy insects often beautifully coloured whose purpose was sensual. An example is afforded by [[Maria Sybilla Merian|Maria Sybilla Merian's]] ''Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamenis'' (1705).

Secondly were descriptive and [[scientific classification|systematic]] (classificatory) works usually confined to what are now known as the [[Insecta]]. Of the second kind [[Carl Linnaeus|Carl von Linne's]] [[10th edition of Systema Nature]] published in 1758 at Stockholm stands proud. In this work the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial system]] was finally settled on. Thirdly were works on [[developmental biology]] (life cycles), internal [[anatomy]], [[physiology]] and so on. These often covered other [[invertebrate]] groups. An example is [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur|René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's]] ''Memoires pour Servir a L’Historie des Insectes''.

===1700–1750===

1700
*[[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] founded in Berlin.

1705
*[[Maria Sybilla Merian]] ''Metamorphosis Insectorum Surinamenis'' (Transformations of the insects of Surinam) published by G. Valck in [[Amsterdam]]. It is a masterpiece of both art and science and Maria Merian, "the mother of entomology", was the first to record the full life cycle of many species of butterflies and moths.
*[[John Ray]] publishes ''Methodus Insectorum''.

1710
*[[John Ray]] publishes ''Historia insectorum'' in English, Study of Insects. This is the first attempt at a systematic classification of insect species.
*[[Francois Xavier Bon de Saint Hilaire]] writes on the use of spider silk as a textile. This was the first such research.

1734
*Scientist [[René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur]] publishes the first ''Mémoires pour Servir à L’Histoire des Insectes'' in English, "Memoirs Serving as a Natural History of Insects". This is a founding work of entomology, and one of the most important of all zoological works of the 18th century.

1737
*[[Microscope|Microscopist]] [[Jan Swammerdam]]'s ''Biblia naturae'' or "Book of Nature" is reissued. Describing his studies of insects, it is a founding work of entomology. It is in Latin. Swammerdam's co-authors were [[Herman Boerhaave]] and [[Hieronymus David Gaubius]].

1738
*[[Adolph Modeer]] born.

1739
*[[John K’Eogh]] publishes ''Zoologica Medicinalis Hibernica'', in English, "Zoological Medicine in Ireland".

1740
* [[Charles Bonnet]] discovers [[parthenogenesis]] by observing that female [[aphid]]s could reproduce without fertilization.

1745
*[[Johan Christian Fabricius]] (1745–1808) is born. Fabricius worked on all insect [[order (biology)|order]]s.
*[[Charles Bonnet]] published his first work on entomology. Entitled ''Traité d'insectologie'', it collected together his various discoveries regarding insects.

Not only did this 44 volume encyclopedia contain all biological knowledge of its time, it offered a different theory. 100 years before Darwin, Buffon claimed that man and ape might have a common ancestor. His work also had significant impact on ecology.

===1750–1800===

1752
*[[Maria Theresa of Austria]] instructs [[Gerhard van Swieten]] to establish [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] as an important centre of natural science. Many entomologists train there.
*[[Landgravine Caroline Louise of Hesse-Darmstadt]] founds Staatliches Museum für Naturkunde Karlsruhe

1753
*[[Louisa Ulrika of Prussia]] founded the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities]]. [[Carl Linnaeus]] named the butterflies in her Drottningens insektsskåp or Drottningen Insect Cabinet [http://goran.waldeck.se/Ento4.htm]

1757
*First volume of [[Carl Alexander Clerck]]'s ''[[Svenska Spindlar]]'' published. Describing a number of spiders in binomial nomenclature, it was the first work to employ Linnaeus's binomial system, which had been proposed in his 1753 work ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.

1758
*[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Tenth edition]] of [[Carl Linnaeus]]' ''[[Systema Naturae]] '' published. World explorers brought back to Europe so many exotic plant and animal specimens that chaos loomed for the 18th-century naturalists attempting to identify, classify, and communicate what they had gathered. Linnaeus made a great contribution to science by developing systems of [[Scientific classification|classification]] to organize these processes. His principles of organization, especially his system of [[binomial nomenclature]], provided essential tools for entomology. The tenth edition (1758–59), was chosen as the starting point for [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]].

1761
*[[Jacob Hübner]] (1761–1826) born. Jacob Hübner was the first great world lepidopterist. Before Hübner it was held that there were few genera of [[Lepidoptera]], a view he overthrew. His definitions of [[genus|genera]] are among the best of the time and so were his classifications.
*[[The Sepp Family|Christiaan Sepp]] publishes ''Nederlandische Insecten'', in English, "Dutch insects".

1762
*[[Hans Strøm]] publishes as Physisk og Oeconomisk Beskrivelse over Fogderiet Søndmør I-II in Copenhagen (1762–1766).

1763
*[[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] publishes ''[[Entomologia Carniolica]]''.
*[[Johann Wilhelm Meigen]] (1763–1845) born. Meigen began to work on Diptera at the age of twenty five. The first specialist in [[Diptera]] Meigen described a vast number of European species and his work on gross taxonomy laid the foundations of the present higher classification of the [[Order (biology)|Order]]. Unlike his [[Sweden|Swedish]] contemporary [[Carl Friedrich Fallen]] he based higher categories on a combination of characters not following Fabricius in using mouthpart characters alone. This new approach was controversial.
*''[[Centuria Insectorum]]'' by Carl Linnaeus defended as a thesis by Boas Johansson

1764
*Carl Friedrich Fallen (1764–1830) born. Johan Christian Fabricius attended Linnaeus’s lectures on natural classification. He was one of Linnaeus' most important pupils.

'''Vis5D''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[Scientific visualization|visualization system]] used primarily for animated 3D visualization of [[Numerical weather prediction|weather simulations]]. It was the first system to produce fully interactive animated 3D displays of time-dynamic volumetric data sets&lt;ref name=ecmwf/&gt;&lt;ref name=video/&gt; and the first open source 3D visualization system.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; It is GNU GPL licensed.&lt;ref&gt;http://vis5d.sourceforge.net/doc/license.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Vis5D was created in response to two circumstances:
:1. Output data from weather models and similar simulations are sampled on time sequences of regular 3D grids and are relatively straightforward to visualize.
:2. The appearance in 1988 of commercial workstations such as the [[Stardent|Stellar]] [[GS workstation|GS 1000]] capable of rendering [[Gouraud-shaded]] 3D graphics fast enough for smooth [[animation]].

Vis5D takes its name from its 5D array containing time sequences of 3D spatial grids for a set of physical parameters of the atmosphere or ocean. Its [[graphical user interface]] enables users to select from various ways of visualizing each parameter (e.g., [[ISO surface|iso-surfaces]], plane slices, [[volume rendering]]s), and to select a combination of parameters for view. A key innovation of Vis5D is that it computes and stores the geometries and colors for such graphics over the simulated time sequence, allowing them to be animated quickly so users can watch movies of their simulations.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt; Furthermore, users can interactively rotate the animations in 3D.

Vis5D provides other visualization techniques. Users can drag a 3D cursor to a selected time and location, then trigger the calculation of a forward and backward wind trajectory from that point. Users can drag a vertical bar cursor and see, in another window, a thermodynamic diagram for the selected vertical column of atmosphere. And users can drag a 3D cursor to a selected time and location and read out individual values for parameters at that point. These examples all involve [[direct manipulation interface]]s, as does the placement of plane slices through 3D grids.

Vis5D provides options for memory management, so that very large data sets can be visualized at individual time steps without the need to compute graphics over the simulation's entire time sequence, while smaller data sets can be visualized with full animation. Vis5D also provides an [[API]] enabling developers of other systems to incorporate Vis5D's functionality. This API is the basis of a [[Tcl|TCL]] scripting capability so users can write automated scripts for producing animations.

==History==
Vis5D was first demonstrated, via videotape, at the December 1988 Workshop on Graphics in Meteorology at the [[ECMWF]].&lt;ref name=ecmwf&gt;ECMWF Workshop, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; The first live demos were at the January 1989 annual meeting of the [[American Meteorological Society]].

Vis5D running on the GS 1000 was the first visualization system to provide smooth animation of 3D gridded time-sequence data sets with interactive rotation.&lt;ref name=ecmwf/&gt;&lt;ref name=video&gt;Siggraph Video Review 43, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Vis5D was the first [[open-source software|open-source]] 3D visualization system.&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;IEEE Visualization 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Vis5D is a natural for [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] [[virtual reality]] and was adapted to the [[Cave Automatic Virtual Environment|CAVE]] for the VROOM at the 1994 [[Siggraph]] conference.&lt;ref name=cave5d&gt;Hibbard et al, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This became [[Cave5D]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1682">'''Web-based taxonomy''' is the effort by [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] to use the [[World Wide Web]] in order to create unified, consensus taxonomies of life on Earth.

In his 2002 paper on the subject,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v417/n6884/full/417017a.html Godfray, H.C.J (2002). Challenges for taxonomy. ''Nature'' 417: 17-19]&lt;/ref&gt; [[H. Charles J. Godfray]] called for the creation of Web-based organisations to collect all the accumulated literature on a taxonomic group into a centralized knowledge base and make this data available through the Web as a unified taxonomy, so that it can be more easily examined and revised. Such a platform would be owned and maintained by a taxonomic working group, governed by an editor or an editorial board. An example of such a platform is [[FishBase]].

The notion of Web-based consensus taxonomies remains controversial because, as two Australian researchers pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]] and David Yeates | year = 2002 | title = Tension arises from duality at the heart of taxonomy | journal = Nature | issue =   6905| doi = 10.1038/419337a | pages = 337 | volume = 419 | pmid = 12353005}}&lt;/ref&gt; taxonomic names are not fixed but hypotheses, and therefore in constant change.

'''Workplace listening''' is a type of [[active listening]] that is generally employed in a professional environment. Listening skills are imperative for career success, [[organizational effectiveness]], and worker satisfaction. Workplace listening includes understanding the listening process (i.e. perception, interpretation, evaluation, and action) and its barriers that hamper the flow of that process. Like other skills, there are specific techniques for improving workplace listening effectiveness. Moreover, it is imperative to become aware of the role of [[nonverbal communication]] in communicating in the workplace, as understanding messages wholly entails more than simple verbal messages.
